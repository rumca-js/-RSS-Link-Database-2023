For people engaged in the timeless habit of looking up other people on the sly, as Facebook typically doesn&rsquo;t share who has seen a user profile, their browsing habits were suddenly (and in some cases, mortifyingly) revealed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-glitch-on-mobile-app-is-friending-anyone-you-view-on-phone&amp;xcust=2-1-1917385-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Daily Beast</a>, the glitch reared its head whenever you viewed the profile of someone you weren&rsquo;t friends with yet. Users shared their discovery on social media, with some individuals testing (and recording) the bug in action.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1917401\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png\" width=\"608\" /><figcaption>You can see the video of the bug in action by viewing <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/beachybones/status/1656979082721083397&amp;xcust=2-1-1917385-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">this tweet on Twitter&rsquo;s site</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While this bug put a temporary chill on Facebook stalking, a spokesperson for Meta (Facebook&rsquo;s parent company) apologized for the issue in a statement to The Daily Beast and confirmed it had been fixed. Users reported in subsequent social media posts that unwanted friend requests have since disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned you may still have lingering sent friend requests, you can check your pending requests by heading to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.facebook.com/friends&amp;xcust=2-1-1917385-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/friends</a>. Select <em>Friend Requests</em> in the left navigation bar, then click on &ldquo;View sent friend requests&rdquo; to see your unanswered friend requests. You can delete any that you didn&rsquo;t mean to (or don&rsquo;t recall) sending by clicking on the <em>Cancel request</em> button next to the person&rsquo;s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any requests you find that you don&rsquo;t recall sending (much less visiting the profile of that person), they may have been accidentally sent through Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;People You May Know&rdquo; module. It appears periodically in your feed as you scroll, and sometimes you may not be aware when you&rsquo;ve clicked or tapped on one of its <em>Add friend</em> buttons. On desktop, you can hide this feature by installing <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://socialfixer.com/download.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1917385-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Fixer</a>, a browser extension available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera that lets you tweak Facebook&rsquo;s interface.

First, Intel released the new CPU microcode as an &ldquo;out of band&rdquo; or unscheduled release. Second, it covers just about everything Intel has on the market today &mdash; dating all the way back to the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407452/core-i7-8700k-review-prices-specs-benchmarks.html\">2017 8th-gen Core (&ldquo;Coffee Lake&rdquo;) chips</a>. (The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/releases/tag/microcode-20230512&amp;xcust=2-2-1917169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">code itself</a> is on the Intel GitHub page, listing all of the affected processors up to and including Intel&rsquo;s most recent 13th-gen Core chips. Intel Xeons are affected, too.) Finally, the secretive and sudden nature of this patch raises eyebrows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do not need to try and download and install this code; motherboard vendors and even Microsoft itself will incorporate the security release inside updates for their own products. (Microsoft issues its own hardware drivers, especially for the Surface notebooks and tablets it produces.) You can probably expect that the new code will show up in a Windows update or a BIOS update from the board manufacturer itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Microsoft, Intel typically publishes <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/default.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1917169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">vulnerability information</a> on what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;Patch Tuesday,&rdquo; or the first Tuesday of the month. (As an example, Intel released <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00815.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1917169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">information</a> noting that its Smart Campus Android app could be used as a handheld Denial of Service (DOS) mechanism. Fun!) The fact that this code release <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> scheduled on that day signifies that Intel wasn&rsquo;t aware of the vulnerability then, and felt it was significant enough to release a patch on Friday rather than waiting for next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s all the fuss about? We don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ve reached out to Intel for comment, and will update this story when we hear back. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-12-May-2023-Microcode&amp;xcust=2-2-1917169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kudos to Phoronix</a> for first noticing the code, and beginning testing on whether any performance impacts would slow down your PC.</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors, Security</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1917169/mysterious-new-intel-patch-surfaces-for-virtually-all-core-chips.html", "date_published": "2023-05-15 17:54:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Brave\u2019s \u2018Forgetful Browsing\u2019 mode blocks first-party tracking", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The Brave browser is all about covering your tracks online, and the latest security feature amps up that commitment. &ldquo;Forgetful Browsing,&rdquo; introduced in the latest <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/download/&amp;xcust=2-2-1917056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">desktop</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&amp;xcust=2-2-1917056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> versions of the browser, automatically logs you out of sites once you close the tab or the browser. This is a more granular security setting than totally clearing history and cookies, as it can be enabled for the web in general or specific sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most of Brave&rsquo;s security tools, this one is focused on first-party tracking (i.e. the site itself), not third-party tracking favored by advertisers and less savory entities. With Forgetful Browsing enabled in the &ldquo;Shields up&rdquo; menu, local storage for specific sites will be cleared (including cookies, cache, and DNS cache) either when the browser is closed, or a few seconds after you close the last tab with the site open. The setting applies to sites, not domains, making it a much more wide-reaching option than most of Brave&rsquo;s security tools. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Brave browser Shields settings menu\" class=\"wp-image-1917138\" height=\"1199\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/25-settings.png?w=971\" width=\"971\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brave Browser</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the point? Brave lays out the case <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/privacy-updates/25-forgetful-browsing/&amp;xcust=2-2-1917056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">in its blog post</a> (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brave-unveils-new-forgetful-browsing-anti-tracking-feature/&amp;xcust=2-2-1917056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bleeping Computer</a>). While most of the time it&rsquo;s handy to be able to go back to a website without having to log in again, this kind of easy re-identification is used for metered paywalls, plus the usual browsing profiles (which may or may not be shared with other sites and advertisers). The example given is that a user might not want a site to know that they have two profiles using two logins that are being accessed from the same machine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When applied universally, the Forgetful Browsing feature isn&rsquo;t much more useful than the existing option to clear all local data when the browser closes. But on a site-by-site basis, I can see how it would be a huge boon to users who want to keep their browsing more private. </p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1917056/braves-forgetful-browsing-mode-blocks-first-party-tracking.html", "date_published": "2023-05-15 15:22:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "EU approves Microsoft-Activision merger with tasty freebies for gamers", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The European Union has allowed Microsoft&rsquo;s proposed acquisition of Activision-Blizzard to move forward, on the grounds that Microsoft has addressed the cloud-gaming concerns that have held up the deal in other jurisdictions. The deal proposes huge benefits for consumers, including a guaranteed right to stream Activision games. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/605846/microsoft-hopes-to-buy-activision-blizzard-in-a-deal-that-would-make-gaming-history.html\">proposed $68.7 billion acquisition</a> of Activision-Blizzard&mdash;the creator of games like <em>Diablo IV,</em> <em>World of Warcraft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em>&mdash;is still being <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799666/uk-blocks-microsoft-activision-deal-to-protect-cloud-gaming.html\">blocked in the United Kingdom</a>, specifically over concerns that the combined company would create a gaming behemoth. Both the U.K. and EU were concerned about the effects of cloud gaming &mdash; and the concessions Microsoft made to the EU are an enormous win for consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the EU and Microsoft agreed that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Microsoft would offer a&nbsp;free license to EU consumers&nbsp;that would allow them to stream, via&nbsp;<em>any</em> cloud game streaming services&nbsp;of their choice,&nbsp;all&nbsp;current and future Activision Blizzard PC and console games&nbsp;for which they have a license.</li><li>Cloud gaming providers would get a corresponding&nbsp;license to allow EU gamers to stream any Activision Blizzard&rsquo;s PC and console games, all for free.</li><li>Both deals are good for ten years.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note, as the EU does, that Activision Blizzard does not stream any of its games, either on console or PC. That includes massive hits like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, itself largely a cloud-based service, as well as its more traditional titles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal has some qualifications that you might not expect, either. For one, if a gamer already subscribes to a service that includes Activision games (such as Microsoft&rsquo;s Game Pass) that gamer has the right to stream those games from any cloud service provider, even one that the gamer doesn&rsquo;t pay for &mdash; and under any operating system they choose, too. Cloud streaming must also have the &ldquo;same quality and content as games available for traditional download.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud gaming companies showed interest in the deal, and some have already shown interest in licenses, the EU said. Regardless, the EU&rsquo;s conclusion seems valid: &ldquo;These commitments&nbsp;fully address&nbsp;the competition concerns identified by the Commission and&nbsp;represent a significant improvement for cloud game streaming compared to the current situation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible that the UK will adopt these concessions, too. If they do, Microsoft&rsquo;s gaming clout will only get stronger.</p>\n\nGaming</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1917099/eus-approval-of-activision-merger-dangles-tasty-freebies-for-gamers.html", "date_published": "2023-05-15 15:17:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "PC games might get console-style quick resume", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting and closing a game on a PC is often something of a big to-do &mdash; it takes me a solid three minutes to get into <em>Fortnite&rsquo;s </em>main menu, and the game will hang if I try to put my PC to sleep. This is an area where consoles have a distinct advantage: Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch all have means of going into low-power modes without losing game progress. According to a recent interview, Windows might be getting this capability too (though you shouldn&rsquo;t hold your breath for it to show up any time soon). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roanne Soanes, Microsoft&rsquo;s Head of Xbox Software, recently said as much when discussing some of the console-style adaptations of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus ROG Ally</a>. The Ally might be a fairly obvious competitor for the Steam Deck, but it&rsquo;s built from the ground up for Windows, and the lack of an Xbox-style Quick Resume is something reviewers have noticed. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1656675385000734724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656675385000734724%7Ctwgr%5Ea0e0682c1dd5970cb140b431a6beff67e0ba50ed%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.extremetech.com%2Fgaming%2Fmicrosoft-wants-to-bring-quick-resume-to-pc-gamers&amp;xcust=2-1-1916971-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Warren</a> clipped an official Asus video (spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/microsoft-wants-to-bring-quick-resume-to-pc-gamers&amp;xcust=2-1-1916971-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ExtremeTech</a>) in which Soanes said: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>How do we think about the idea of, you start on your PC, and you just want to take this with you, and you want to pick up where you left off and you want to be immediately ready to go &mdash; console has some of those capabilities with quick resume today. How do we think about integrating this into the Windows platform?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a quick resume feature that developers could tap into would be a big job, but not an impossible one. After all, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S both have them, and they&rsquo;re based on x64 hardware that&rsquo;s more or less identical to modern gaming PCs. The Xbox even shares a lot of code base with Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real trick would be getting it to work across a variety of form factors (with laptops and portable devices like the ROG Ally being a big priority), and creating a system that developers would actually want to implement. As noted by ExtremeTech, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1484183/microsoft-directstorage-tech-finally-arrives-on-pc-forspoken-load-times.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the new DirectStorage feature</a> could be a great way to kickstart the process, though that&rsquo;s still a long way off from mass implementation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\nGaming PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1916971/windows-games-might-get-console-style-quick-resume.html", "date_published": "2023-05-15 14:43:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Clearance sale!

This makes Intel more flexible for gamers looking to build more niche setups&mdash;such as Micro-ATX.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in shorter than a typical ATX motherboard, mATX allows for smaller, compact case options. Even better, you can often find performance and features with minimal compromise within that size. CPU overclocking is a moot point here because of the B760 chipset, but can motherboards in this chipset class still be &ldquo;just right&rdquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi joins the fray as an under-$200 option for small form-factor builders. While not as tiny as Mini-ITX motherboards, Micro-ATX retains more space&mdash;and thus more features for the price. With a value-focused package, can it still be a viable option for a serious PC gaming rig?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll go over the features, the design, and the performance. Combining that with the value you&rsquo;re getting for its price, is going mid-sized really worth it? The MAG series of motherboards from MSI have been well-priced options thus far, so we&rsquo;ll see if the B760M Mortar continues this trend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi-specs\">MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi specs</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1788999\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-31-at-3.40.01-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Micro-ATX form factor (243.84&times;243.84mm)</li><li>Supports Intel 12th- and 13th-gen CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>12+1+1 Duet Rail System with 75A</li><li>DDR5 RAM, dual channel up to 4 DIMMs (up to 128Gb)</li><li>2x onboard M.2 slots (PCIe Gen 4)</li><li>2x PCIe 16x slot (PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4)&nbsp;</li><li>1x PCIe X1 slot (Gen 3)</li><li>HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort out&nbsp;</li><li>8 USB ports on back (including 1x 20Gb/s)</li><li>Realtek 2.5Gbe LAN with Bluetooth 5.3</li><li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>RGB headers for Mystic Light</li><li>4 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>6 PWM fan headers&nbsp;</li><li>Preinstalled I/O shield&nbsp;</li><li>Realtek 7.1 ALC 897 Audio</li><li>MSRP $199</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG B760M Mortar Wi-Fi will come in at $199, which puts it on cheaper footing when compared to MSI&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666878/msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi-review.html\">AMD B650M</a> Mortar WiFi version, which we looked at recently.

The most vital thing to know is in CPU overclocking: You&rsquo;ll need Z790 if you plan to tweak your CPU above stock. This can be an issue for some, especially if you&rsquo;re planning to use an unlocked &ldquo;K&rdquo; Intel CPU for maximum performance. For most gamers, non-overclocked performance will still be more than capable. Another distinction of the B760 motherboards, is that you&rsquo;re typically getting less-capable VRMs, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other important differences in B760 come down to fewer PCIe lanes, USB ports, and SATA ports. Keeping in mind that Micro-ATX motherboards already have fewer of these onboard due to size constraints, so the chipset&rsquo;s limitations shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue for most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>With support for both 12th- and 13th-generation Intel CPUs, you&rsquo;ll have a vast variety of CPUs to choose from. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1789006\" height=\"905\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-31-at-3.39.18-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Everything included in the MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi box.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The unboxing experience is basic but has the essentials. You&rsquo;ll find SATA cables, M.2 accessories, and some neat stickers. The Wi-Fi antenna is here too, as Wi-Fi is standard on this motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cpu-choice\">CPU choice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With support for both 12th- and 13th-generation Intel CPUs, you&rsquo;ll have a vast variety of CPUs to choose from. Given the fact that B760 doesn&rsquo;t offer overclocking like Z790, we&rsquo;d recommend staying away from the highest-end &ldquo;K&rdquo; SKUs such as the i9 13900K. You&rsquo;re much more likely to pair a i5 13600 or even a last-generation non-K CPU to save some cash here. An i7 13700 can also work great here for even more performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ddr5-ram-and-pcie-gen-4-5\">DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 4/5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You have the option of DDR4 with this motherboard, but this unit is DDR5. You&rsquo;re getting some of the best speeds, and overall performance will be within a few percentage points of more expensive motherboards. Combining this with the non-K CPUs can result in some nice price savings for a still competent build.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are getting PCIe Gen 5 for the 16x slot, but the other slot will be Gen 4. (And the 1x slot, useful for minor add-ons, will be Gen 3.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M.2 slots will also be PCIe Gen 4, which is fine as Gen 5 is barely just arriving and still not saturated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Micro-ATX has these multiple PCIe slots as a big advantage compared to Mini-ITX motherboards, for those who need the extra utility. (At the cost of slightly larger size, of course.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"storage\">Storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;d expect at least two NVMe slots on a motherboard of this size, and it delivers. While many larger ATX motherboards can have four or more, due to size and chipset limitations, two should be a good number for most builds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both NVMe slots will be &ldquo;Lightning Gen 4 X4,&rdquo; with one having an M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; shield for better thermal performance. We&rsquo;d love to see both covered here, however.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also get four SATA ports for other hard drives and SSDs, filling up your small form factor case with ease!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"usb-ports\">USB ports</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You are getting eight rear USB ports, with an interesting mix. Four of them will be the ancient USB 2.0&mdash;which while fine for some peripherals, certainly falls short of USB 3.0. You do get USB 3.0&mdash;and even a single 3.2 Gen 2&times;2 with 20Gb/s speeds&mdash;to balance it out. Not perfect, but certainly a fair selection for a smaller motherboard under $200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1 also are here if your CPU supports the iGPU function.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"networking\">Networking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Connectivity is great here, similar to most ATX motherboard offerings. Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5GbE LAN are both standard, along with Bluetooth 5.3. That&rsquo;s as good as we can expect for this size and price range, no complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"audio\">Audio</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio is capable, with a 7.1 ALC 897 codec. You&rsquo;re getting a good selection of inputs in the back, but keep in mind that &ldquo;audiophiles&rdquo; may need to fish out their separate external solution for the best sound. Gamers and most users should be more than happy, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"other-features-of-note\">Other features of note</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An integrated I/O shield continues to be a party favorite on newer motherboards, and we&rsquo;re glad to see it here. The screwless M.2 drives are also nice, saving some headaches with small screws. Debug LED is also here, but you won&rsquo;t find BIOS flashback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi-design\">MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi design&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1789008\" height=\"1095\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-31-at-3.40.56-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi has a simple monochromatic silver design.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi follows in the tradition of similar MSI motherboards, such as the &ldquo;Tomahawk&rdquo; series, when it comes to design. You&rsquo;re greeted with a mostly monochromatic silver, with various shading offering contrasting points.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it lacks much RGB or gamer aesthetic, this is a clean design that can work great in almost any environment. The I/O cover area follows this same design metric, with some nice visual accents in black outlining the almost industrial-looking silver. The integrated I/O shield is another great design feature that we&rsquo;re happy is becoming more prevalent on all classes of motherboards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1789009\" height=\"849\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-31-at-3.40.35-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>VRM heatsink and &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; M.2 thermal cover on the MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While the VRM heatsink area does not look quite as imposing as on Z790 motherboards of a higher ilk, it fits in perfectly here. Continuing down the PCIe slot areas, you&rsquo;ll find the top M.2 slot with a &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; thermal cover. Sadly, the lower M.2 remains exposed&mdash;it would be nice for it to also be covered for visual continuity and thermals. This area is mostly blocked by the GPU, so it&rsquo;s a minor quibble. (Do note that the previous MSI MAG B660M Mortar WiFi motherboard&mdash;with a similar design to this&mdash;does have that second NVMe slot cover.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the $199 price, the fit and finish feel high-quality and durable. Since you&rsquo;re not paying for overkill RGB effects or fancy OLED screens, this simple design approach helps to keep the cost down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1789010\" height=\"784\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-31-at-3.39.53-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi (backside).</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The back of the motherboard is what you&rsquo;d expect&mdash;no need for a fancy backplate here. Overall, given the small form-factor size and lower price, the design across the entire motherboard is very fitting for what you&rsquo;re getting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi-performance-software-and-bios\">MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi: Performance, software, and BIOS&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi is not geared towards maximum performance. The B760 chipset forgoes CPU overclocking for cost savings, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re not still getting capable performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its 12+1+1 Duet Rail System VRMs, this board is more than capable for most CPUs. While we&rsquo;d avoid most of the &ldquo;K&rdquo; SKUs, you&rsquo;ll find a perfect pairing with something like an i7 13700 or similar. There&rsquo;s a hidden benefit to this, too. While some may be sad over the loss of CPU overclocking, using these more efficient CPUs may be a great boon when building a small form-factor PC. Lower power will mean lower heat output, making smaller air or liquid coolers easier to implement and keep under control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you remember that CPUs such as the i9 13900K often require a 360mm liquid cooler to keep it under control, it&rsquo;s easy to see how that can be difficult to properly implement in a small PC case. (From our experience, Micro-ATX supporting cases usually top out at 240mm or 280mm for radiator support, with some exceptions.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going further, DDR5 RAM is standard here&mdash;with an option for DDR4 if you purchase that version of the motherboard instead. We&rsquo;d likely recommend sticking with DDR5, as the costs are down now for most kits, and you&rsquo;ll be taking more advantage of what the B760 platform has to offer with newer CPUs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCIe Gen 5 is here for the 16x GPU slot, which currently is not saturated by modern GPUs. It&rsquo;s still nice to have for future possibilities, however. You&rsquo;re not getting Gen 5 for the NVMe slots, but you&rsquo;re getting Gen 4 and that is likewise more than capable at this point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the BIOS&mdash;which may be a less-frequent destination for most users of this motherboard. As with the B760 chipset, you&rsquo;re going to be limited when it comes to CPU tweaking compared to Z790. That&rsquo;s fine for most users, and the BIOS will still give you access to most other items you may be used to. You can set the XMP profile for the DDR5, and various other configurations of drives and boot priorities. The BIOS is generally easy to navigate and use, but after setting initial profiles, it&rsquo;s unlikely you will spend much time in here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to keep some tweaking to Windows itself, MSI offers its MSI Center software. Motherboard manufacturers have been on a trend lately of integrating as many elements as possible into one piece of software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi\" class=\"wp-image-1789013\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Picture1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>MSI Center software</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll get access to MSI&rsquo;s Mystic Light RGB control for attached devices, along with some items such as hardware monitoring and driver updates. While we still recommend that certain taks be done in the BIOS, for these items, it&rsquo;s much easier to do them in Windows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi performs as expected for its size and price class, with some good software and BIOS support. Aside from CPU overclocking, you&rsquo;re not missing much here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi\">Should you buy the MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi starts out with a few challenges: First, it&rsquo;s a Micro-ATX motherboard, meaning that right off the bat it will have some built-in limitations due to its size versus larger ATX options. Secondly, it comes wrapped in the B760 chipset, further limiting its CPU overclocking and some features like PCIe lanes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For $199, how does it add up? It does so very well, navigating those limitations in a compelling package for those wishing to remain under $200 with a small design. You&rsquo;re still getting access to the latest Intel CPUs, with fast DDR5 RAM support. You do get a single 16x PCIe slot, flanked by two onboard Gen 4 NVMe slots. Robust networking and good audio support round out the features&mdash;making it as capable as most ATX motherboards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, some users will be disappointed in the lack of CPU overclocking support&mdash;but we&rsquo;d argue that that&rsquo;s not this motherboard&rsquo;s target. Most users will be far happier with the $199 price point for Micro-ATX, which typically has less selection in the marketplace due to its &ldquo;niche&rdquo; size. You can even find a DDR4 version if that suits your needs better. Keep in mind that higher-end small form-factor motherboards also dramatically increase in price for more features, easily doubling what we have here cost wise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this price, you&rsquo;re not losing much in the way of compromises, and that&rsquo;s great news. With newer motherboards often exhibiting higher pricing, it&rsquo;s nice to see something with good baseline features that won&rsquo;t break the bank or skimp on the essentials.</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787647/msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi-review.html", "date_published": "2023-05-15 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Why AMD thinks Ryzen AI will be just as vital as CPUs and GPUs", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>A top AMD executive says that the company is thinking about deeper integration of AI across the Ryzen product line, but one ingredient is missing: client applications and operating systems that actually take advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD launched <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html\">the Ryzen 7000 series in January</a>, which includes the Ryzen 7040HS. In early May, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806031/amd-launches-ai-powered-ryzens-for-thin-notebooks.html\">AMD announced the Ryzen 7040U</a>, a lower-power version of the 7040HS. Both are the first chips to include Ryzen AI &ldquo;XDNA&rdquo; hardware, among the first occurrences of AI logic for PCs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, however, AI remains a service that (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html\">aside from Stable Diffusion</a> and some others) exclusively runs in the cloud. That makes AMD&rsquo;s venture risky. Why dedicate costly silicon towards Inference Processing Units (IPUs), advancing a function that no one can really use on the PC?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s one of the questions we put to David McAfee, the corporate vice president and general manager for the client channel business at AMD. The message is, essentially, that you&rsquo;ll have to trust them&mdash;and even reframe the way you think about AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to McAfee, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re on the cusp of a series of announcements and events that will help shed more light into what&rsquo;s happening with AI processing in general,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We really view those as the tip of the iceberg.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if McAfee was referring to Google I/O, the Microsoft Build developer conference later this month, or something else entirely. But AMD seems to be planning to take a more bite-sized approach to AI than you might expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"amd-ai-on-the-pc-will-be-less-complex-than-you-think\">AMD: AI on the PC will be less complex than you think</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you can run an AI model on top of a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html\">Ryzen CPU</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">Radeon GP</a>U, provided that you have enough storage and memory. &ldquo;But those are pretty heavy hammers to use when it comes to doing that type of compute,&rdquo; McAfee said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, AMD sees AI on the PC as small, light, tasks that frequently trigger and run on an AI processor known as an Inference Processing Unit (IPU). Remember, AMD has used &ldquo;AI&rdquo; for some time to try and optimize its technology for your PC. It groups several technologies under the label of &ldquo;SenseMI&rdquo; for Ryzen processors, which adjusts clock speeds using Precision Boost 2, mXFR, and Smart Prefetch. IPUs could take that to another level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think one of the nuances that comes along with the way that we&rsquo;re looking at at IPUs, and IPUs for the future, is more along the lines of that combination of a very specialized engine that does a certain type of compute, but does it in a very power-efficient way,&rdquo; McAfee said. &ldquo;And in a way that&rsquo;s really integrated with the memory subsystem and the rest of the processor, because our expectation is as time goes on, these workloads that run on the GPU will not be sort of one-time events, but there&rsquo;ll be more of a &mdash; I&rsquo;m not going to say a constantly running set of workstreams, but it will be a more frequent type of compute that happens on your platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD sees the IPU as something like a video decoder. Historically, video decoding could be brute-forced on a Ryzen CPU. But that requires an enormous amount of power to enable a good experience. &ldquo;Or you can have this relatively small engine that&rsquo;s a part of the chip design that does that with incredible efficiency,&rdquo; McAfee said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably means, at least for now, that you won&rsquo;t see Ryzen AI IPUs on discrete cards, or even with their own memory subsystem. Stable Diffusion&rsquo;s generative AI model uses dedicated video RAM to run in. But when asked about the concept of &ldquo;AI RAM,&rdquo; McAfee demurred. &ldquo;That sounds really expensive,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ais-future-within-ryzen\">AI&rsquo;s future within Ryzen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>XDNA is to Ryzen AI the way the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1434166/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-content-creation-review.html\">RDNA is to Radeon</a>: the first term defines the architecture, the second defines the brand. AMD acquired its AI capabilities via its Xilinx acquisition, but it still hasn&rsquo;t detailed what exactly is in it. McAfee acknowledged that the AMD and its competitors have work to do in defining Ryzen AI&rsquo;s capabilities in terms that enthusiasts and consumers can understand, such as the number of cores and clock speeds that help define CPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is, let&rsquo;s call it an architecture generation, that goes along with an IPU,&rdquo; McAfee said. &ldquo;And what we integrate this year versus what we integrate in a future product will likely have different architecture generations associated with them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U application performance \" class=\"wp-image-1806044\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AMD-Mobile-Ryzen-7040U-application-performance.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>None of Ryzen&rsquo;s application performance benefits from Ryzen AI, right now</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that AI metrics &mdash; whether it be core counts per parallel streams or neural layers &mdash; <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/breakfast-bytes/posts/what-is-a-tops-w#:~:text=So%20a%20much%20better%20measure%20is%20TOPS%2FW%20%28%22TOPS,means%20more%20area%2C%20and%20means%20more%20power%2C%20too.&amp;xcust=2-1-1815008-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">simply haven&rsquo;t been defined </a>for consumers, and there aren&rsquo;t any generally accepted AI metrics beyond trillions of operations per second (TOPS), and TOPS per watt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that we probably haven&rsquo;t gotten to the point where there&rsquo;s a good set of industry standard benchmarks or industry standard metrics to help users better understand Widget A from AMD versus Widget B from Qualcomm,&rdquo; McAfee said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d agree with you that the language and the benchmarks are not easy for users to understand which one to pick right now and which one they should be betting on.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Ryzen AI deployed to just a pair of Ryzen laptop processors, the natural question is how AMD will begin distributing it to the rest of the CPU lineup. That, too, is being discussed, McAfee said. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re having the AI conversation all the way across the Ryzen product line,&rdquo; McAfee said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the extra cost attached to the manufacturing the Ryzen AI core, AMD is evaluating what value Ryzen AI adds, especially in its budget processors. McAfee said that the end-user benefit &ldquo;has to be a lot more concrete&rdquo; before AMD would add Ryzen AI to its low-end mobile Ryzen chips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will AMD add Ryzen AI to its desktop Ryzens? That, somewhat surprisingly, is less sure. McAfee considered the question in terms of the desktop&rsquo;s power efficiency. Because of the power of the desktop, &ldquo;maybe Ryzen AI becomes more of a testing tool as opposed to something that is driving the everyday value of the device,&rdquo; he said. It&rsquo;s possible that a high-core-count Threadripper could be used to train AI, but not necessarily use it, he added.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X\" class=\"wp-image-1722549\" src=\"https://www.idg.se/editorial/980/path/1.687102.1519759582!imageUploader/467795819.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /><figcaption>Will AI be added to AMD&rsquo;s Threadripper? It doesn&rsquo;t look promising.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD does believe, though, that AI will sit at the table currently occupied by CPUs and GPUs, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I really do believe there will be a point in time in the not-too-distant future where yes, as people think about the value of their system, it&rsquo;s not just my CPU and my GPU, this, this becomes a third element of compute that that does add significant value to their platform,&rdquo; McAfee said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ais-next-steps\">AI&rsquo;s next steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chip evolution has typically followed a fairly simple progression. Developers come up with a new app, and program it to run on a general purpose CPU. Over time, the industry settles on a specific task (video games, say) and specialized hardware follows. Inferencing chips in the datacenter have been developed for years, but app developers are still figuring out what AI can <em>do</em>, let alone what consumers can use it for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, McAfee says, there will be two reasons for AI applications to run on your PC, rather than in the cloud. &ldquo;There will be a point in time where those models reach a level of maturity or reach a practical application where it becomes the right step for the developer to quantize that model and to put it on, you know, local AI accelerators that live on a mobile PC platform for, you know, the battery life benefits,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"GeForce RTX 4080 content creation performance\" class=\"wp-image-1378396\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/StableDiffusion-HalfPrec.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>An  AI app like Stable Diffusion can be its own benchmark right now, though the extreme variability in image generation can undermine that somewhat.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The other reason? Security, McAfee added. It&rsquo;s likely that as AI is integrated into business life, that businesses and even consumers will want their own private AI services, so that their personal or business data doesn&rsquo;t leak into the cloud. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a public-facing instance scanning all of my email and documents, and potentially using that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"softwares-responsibility\">Software&rsquo;s responsibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>McAfee avoided disclosing what he knew of Microsoft&rsquo;s roadmap as well as the speculation that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1508826/12-ways-ai-could-improve-windows-11-or-windows-12.html\">Windows 12 may be more closely integrated with AI</a>. Consumer AI applications may include games, such as NPCs that have intelligent conversations, rather than scripted dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s going to be the key,&rdquo; McAfee said. &ldquo;Over the next three years, the software and user experiences have to have to deliver that value, and move this from a really exciting, emergent technology that&rsquo;s just making its way into the conversation on PCs into something that potentially is rather transformational,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, McAfee added, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and the rest of the hardware industry can&rsquo;t be solely responsible for the success or failure of AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ultimately for this to be successful&hellip; It really boils down to, you know, does the software live up?&rdquo; McAfee said. &ldquo;Does the software and the user experience live up to the hype? I think that&rsquo;s going to be the key. Over the next three years, the software and user experiences have to have to deliver that value, and move this from a really exciting, you know, sort of emergent technology that&rsquo;s just making its way into the conversation on PCs, into something that it potentially is rather transformational to the way that we think about performance, and devices, and how we use them.&rdquo;</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html", "date_published": "2023-05-15 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "5 free Chrome browser extensions we can\u2019t live without", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Browser extensions improve the experience of internet trawling. Just a handful can save you time, money, and sanity, plus protect your security and privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has their favorite add-ons. And as you might expect, the PCWorld staff&rsquo;s faves tend to overlap. For example, my colleague Mark Hachman&rsquo;s list of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/395021/5-microsoft-edge-and-chrome-extensions-everyone-should-use.html\">top 5 Edge extensions</a> is a kind of sneak peek of my own lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while you&rsquo;ll see the same themes come up, my actual picks differ. There&rsquo;s a lot of choice on this planet, and that means you can tailor your experience to fit your needs and interests. Mine revolve around staying safe on the web, deal-hunting, and not letting social media get the best of me. (None make my cut here, but if you need to protect your traffic from prying eyes, check out our list of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/633008/the-best-free-vpn-for-chrome.html\">the best free VPNs for Chrome</a>, too.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and Edge users&mdash;you can join in on this party as well. Most of these exist as native Edge add-ons, but you can also install them from the Chrome Web Store, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ublock-origin\">uBlock Origin</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"uBlock Origin options on the AP News website\" class=\"wp-image-632001\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ublock.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Clicking on the uBlock Origin icon in the toolbar allows you to add a site to the allow list, check your stats, and more.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ads are an unfortunate vector for internet diseases&mdash;that is, viruses, malware, and exploits. You can stay safer while on the web by installing an ad-blocker, which cuts off that route for malicious activity. Combine it with direct support for sites you love, e.g., a subscription or periodic donation, and everyone makes out better in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an ad-blocker also supercharges your browsing experience. Your computer may feel sluggish or slow due to how long it takes to fully load a website&rsquo;s extra advertisements and scripts. Without ads, sites come up fast and also look sleek and polished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You still retain a lot of flexibility over what gets filtered. Can&rsquo;t afford to donate cash to a site? You can add it to an allow list so that their ads still show. You can also fine-tune the settings to permit some tracking sites to load, which can be necessary for newsletter links or a search engine&rsquo;s shopping suggestions to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-631993-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">uBlock Origin</a>&rsquo;s strength is that compared to rivals like Adblock Plus, it actually blocks <em>all</em> ads. (ABP allows some &ldquo;non-intrusive&rdquo; ads to slip through.) It also has less impact on your system resources. I switched over from Adblock Plus years ago and haven&rsquo;t looked back since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: If you go searching for this extension, be sure to find the one created by Raymond Hill for Chrome, and Nik Rolls for Edge. Be wary of lookalike options.)</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Tired of cookie consent notices? Turn on the EasyList Cookie filter in this extension&rsquo;s options.

No longer must you wade through what the algorithm feeds you&mdash;this extension lets you control the content that appears on your feed. (Yep!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to hide posts based on keywords? Easily done. Tired of seeing &ldquo;People You May Know&rdquo; or &ldquo;Suggested Posts&rdquo;? Gone in a heartbeat. Want to filter posts based on what&rsquo;s in them, who wrote them, or something else? Absolutely possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also customize the interface, force Facebook to list posts in order of most recent, make timestamps show as exact dates, and remove all interactive fields so you can browse without accidentally commenting or liking a post&mdash;among other things. The result is a properly curated feed, free of endless politics, spoilers for TV shows and movies, nonstop posts gushing about a significant other, or anything else that drives you up a wall. You also can save yourself from your worst tendencies and not comment on things that you know will start fights. (I&rsquo;m speaking purely hypothetically here.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part? Developer Matt Kruse constantly works to keep up with Facebook&rsquo;s changes and still add more features. And these efforts are done all for free&mdash;you&rsquo;ll only see a small request for a donation when you first install or when a new version launches. (But in my opinion, while a donation isn&rsquo;t required, it&rsquo;s a good show of gratitude.)</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> While you can create your own filters from scratch, you don&rsquo;t have to. Social Fixer&rsquo;s settings have a list of pre-defined options in the <em>Filters</em> tab.

But these days, I don&rsquo;t participate in watch parties as often, making my subscription to TwoSeven unnecessary&mdash;especially since <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-party-is-now-tele/oocalimimngaihdkbihfgmpkcpnmlaoa?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-631993-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netflix Party evolved into Teleparty</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teleparty works with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime, which amply covers the occasional movie night or drops of highly anticipated series. It also offers a simple interface that lets you get straight to watching, with support for up to 1,000 users in a single party. You simply log in to your streaming service <em>du jour</em>, as does everyone else. Then to start a party, you click on the extension&rsquo;s red TP button next to the address bar and share the link generated. (Don&rsquo;t see the Teleparty icon? You may need to first <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/693465/how-to-pin-an-extension-to-chromes-toolbar.html\">pin it to Chrome&rsquo;s toolbar</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension does have its limitations. Choosing who can control playback must be set before creating a party&mdash;you can&rsquo;t change the setting after the room is created. Refreshing the page also boots you from the room, and you&rsquo;ll need the direct link to get back in. (Sometimes I do miss TwoSeven&rsquo;s reusable watch party rooms.) But it works very smoothly, which is all you can really ask of a free service.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Want Netflix to output in 4K during a watch party? Use Edge. Cross-browser parties are supported, so your friends can still be in Chrome.

(Its developers even promote it for this purpose on their website.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before then, my bargain-hunting system had nothing in the way of direct tracking. I instead trawled crowdsourced sites like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://slickdeals.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-631993-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slickdeals</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/&amp;xcust=2-1-631993-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">/r/buildapcsales</a>, followed Twitter accounts and joined Discord servers, and waited for alerts to hit my phone. Distill.io reduces that work, as well as the delay in jumping on a deal. I haven&rsquo;t needed to use it often, but it has added one more tool to my arsenal. And with inflation currently wreaking havoc on prices, I imagine I&rsquo;m not the only person who&rsquo;ll be using every trick in the book to save money.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Creating a login syncs your tracking across devices, which is handy if you bounce regularly between, say, a laptop and a desktop PC.
