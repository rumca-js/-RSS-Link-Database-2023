We last saw Ganondorf\u2019s human form causing trouble back in 2006\u2019s Twilight Princess, where he was defeated by Link and Princess Zelda. But naturally his fingerprints are all over the convoluted Zelda timeline. \n\nWith Tears of the Kingdom reviving Ganondorf, what better time to refresh yourself on the history of The Legend of Zelda\u2019s iconic villain. From his origins within the desert-dwelling Gerudo tribe through to his return in Tears of the Kingdom, this is the complete timeline of Ganondorf.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:37 - Ganon or Ganondorf?\n01:54 - Origins\n03:03 - Ocarina of Time\n04:47 - Timeline Split\n05:27 - Defeat Timeline\n07:53 - Child Timeline\n10:54 - Adult Timeline\n13:53 - Breath of the Wild Era\n\nGanondorf is the true human form of the iconic Zelda villain - a man born into the desert-dwelling female-centric Gerudo tribe. Upon utilizing the power of the Triforce, Ganondorf is able to transform into the monstrous pig beast, Ganon, who in short is a reincarnation of the original Demon King Demise from Skyward Sword - more on him very shortly. And finally, there\u2019s Calamity Ganon, who is, simply put, more of a destructive force of nature. \n\nWe only see this rendition of Ganon in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which is set 10,000 years into the future, and so presumably, Ganon has rejected his physical form in order to fully commit to Demise\u2019s pure evil. He still looks a bit like a giant pig though, albeit in nifty neon pink. Oh, and when he\u2019s having his 100 year long hibernation in Breath of the Wild, he takes on the form of a creepy spider like monster too, so add that to the pile.\n\n#TimelineExplained #LegendOfZelda #GameSpot\n\nTimeline Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gaFRoP4RUA&amp;list=PLpg6WLs8kxGN7aotOq-B5tYZWpvTZ3KRS\n\nThis video features music from the acclaimed Zelda and Chill albums:\n\nMusic by Mikel\nMastered by Dj Cutman\nComposed by Koji Kondo, Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, Toru Minegishi\nOriginally from the Zelda series\n\nYou can (and definitely should) check out the full albums at GameChops - https://www.youtube.com/@gamechops\n\nZelda and Chill - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdzrrWA8e7A&amp;t=1771s\nZelda and Chill 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJlY1uKL87k\nZelda and Chill 3 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaDnHo3LdmA", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtduIP56WiY", "date_published": "2023-05-15 15:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Playing Diablo 4 with IRL Buffs and Debuffs", "description": "\"Pre-order 'Diablo IV' now for PC, and Xbox & Playstation consoles.
