## An egg: unfertilised, it is one giant cell | Helen Sullivan

<p>Fertilised, it can hold things shaped as differently as: a snake, an auk, a platypus; an emu, a tortoise, a peacock</p><p>Things I have learned reading about eggs: that chickens have earlobes, and the colour of the earlobes correlates with the colour of the egg: white ear lobe, white egg; red ear lobe, brown egg. What can lay an egg? An orange-peel doris can lay an egg in a tidal pool; a bee hummingbird can lay an egg the size of an aspirin; an auk on a cliff lays a conical egg, which will roll around in a circle instead of forwards and off the edge; a spider wraps her egg in silk, places it on a stalk, then lays another.</p><p>To Linda Pastan, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/33575/egg">an egg was</a> “a moon / glowing faintly / in the galaxy of the barn”. Approach it, and Louise Glück <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=109&amp;issue=6&amp;page=32">will tell you</a>: “The thing is hatching. Look.” One egg looks – apart from its size, the sharpness of its point, or its colour – much like another: they are all pleasing in the same way, hard-shelled and soft-shaped. “An egg is the most beautiful of all / beautiful forms, a box without corners / in which anything can be contained,” wrote <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/37302/faberges-egg">Elizabeth Spires</a>. This one structure, variations on round, can hold things shaped as differently as: a snake, an auk, a platypus; an emu, a tortoise, a peacock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/may/16/an-egg-unfertilised-it-is-one-giant-cell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book highlights both the horror and hope of LGBTQ people  from around the world who have sought asylum that has often saved their lives</p><p>The faces we see in photographer Umberto Nicoletti’s new book of portraits exude joy, hope, humor, beauty, confidence and power. But the text in the book, which explains the stories behind those faces, tells nearly the opposite story.</p><p>It details instances of extortion, abandonment, imprisonment, torture, and murder. The people featured in Nicoletti’s portraits, collected in a book titled Asylum, are all members of the LGBTQ+ community who have sought asylum in countries far more accepting of their identities than the ones they’re struggling to escape. At home, their identities have left them subject to punishments that range from public flogging to execution. Sad, desperate and sometimes horrific as their stories may be, Nicoletti has refused to present his subjects as objectified figures of tragedy, instead portraying them as stars and role-models. “I wanted to use beautiful, glossy images to evoke empathy, and to present each of them as a glamorous individual,” he said by Zoom from his studio in Milan. “We’re used to seeing actors or musicians portrayed like that – as heroes. But someone who fights for their rights, that’s a true hero.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/lgbtq-asylum-seekers-new-book-umberto-nicoletti">Continue reading...</a>
