We know <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sales-are-slowing-down-no-new-hardware-confirmed-for-this-fiscal-year/1100-6513928/\">it's not coming anytime soon</a>, though. Despite the grumblings about Switch performance, we're still seeing games make the most of the aging tech. And hot on the heels of a generational great on a six year-old system, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> is a technical marvel.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tears of the Kingdom isn't exactly playing in the same ballpark as the more robust, graphically demanding games on other platforms. It also only needs to run 720p in handheld mode and shoot for 1080p while docked. However, it's able to achieve a relatively striking visual experience by leveraging a distinct art style and creating an unmistakable atmosphere that plays into the series' strengths. More importantly, its sprawling and dense open world now incorporates the exploration of islands in the sky and a massive underground system the size of the surface itself, all without demanding state-of-the-art hardware. So if you thought Breath of the Wild was big, well, Tears of the Kingdom is on a whole 'nother level.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The key is it comes together through seamless exploration and relative consistency of its technical performance. You can dive from a sky island, look out into the entirety of Hyrule, then drop straight through a chasm into the depths--having tested that myself, there wasn't a hitch and maintained the target frame rate throughout. Graphical \"tricks\" and techniques make this possible, of course, as not everything in the distance is always rendered in complete detail and dynamic resolution helps lighten the load while masking moments of lower image quality. Regardless, I'm often just impressed that a game of this size and scope even runs on the Switch.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-who-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-switch-still-has-juice-left/1100-6514193/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-who-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-switch-still-has-juice-left/1100-6514193/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-15 22:20:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom - Marakuguc Shrine Puzzle Guide", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> Marakuguc Shrine Puzzle can be a little bit tricky to solve.

Below, we take a look at how the game broke new ground for interconnected, cross-media storytelling.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nearly 25 years later, the original Matrix's legacy as a stone-cold classic film is secure. Arguably, it was pretty much a done deal the second Neo flew off into orbit while Rage Against The Machine did their thing. Everything about action films changed afterwards, from the way fights were choreographed to the way it opened the door for action movies with loftier ideas. But while the legacy of the original film is undeniable, and more prescient than ever--for both good and ill, given how its iconography\u2019s been co-opted in recent years--we don't often talk about the legacy of The Matrix Reloaded in the same hallowed tones. It's understandable to an extent. Everything audiences thought was cool about the original Matrix in 1999 had been stripmined for parts by a legion of movies immediately after, with diminishing returns every single time. Given carte blanche to avoid their creation from treading the same ground, Lana and Lilly Wachowski chose to expand the universe they created in ways that resembled an Eastern philosophy-flavored Star Trek more than, say, Blade or Underworld.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's not a comment on quality--time has smiled on all four Matrix films much more kindly than most of their contemporaries--but it is a comment on how a classic had transitioned to becoming a big-budget all-encompassing megalith of a property, constantly in danger of losing what was special about the original. This was the subtext of the still-underrated Matrix Resurrections, in fact. But to this day, even the biggest megablockbusters on the planet have failed to even attempt what the Wachowskis pulled off in the wake of Matrix Reloaded to keep its power despite capitalism needing to wring it dry. Ancillary media is nothing new altogether, but before The Matrix Reloaded, anything that didn't happen on-screen during the film was just a cool, non-canon \"what if.\" Because the Matrix sequels had such a muted reaction compared to the original, it's easy to forget just how much of an absolute multimedia circus surrounded The Matrix Reloaded before its release. Sponsorships were everywhere, songs from the soundtrack were ubiquitous on rock radio, books were being written about the philosophy of the original film. All of that was there, and it all only touched the fringes of what The Matrix actually was or where it was going. But The Matrix was far too important and far too intricate to let any serious work bearing its name cheapen it in any way. And so, in the middle of an absolute marketing blitzkrieg, we got two pieces of media that changed how stories could be told in the 21st century.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-enter-the-matrix-and-the-animatrix-helped-create-the-modern-cinematic-universe/1100-6514190/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-enter-the-matrix-and-the-animatrix-helped-create-the-modern-cinematic-universe/1100-6514190/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-15 20:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Gollum Actor Andy Serkis Still Wants To Come Back For New Lord Of The Rings Movies", "description": "<p>Actor Andy Serkis, who famously played Gollum in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movie series, has said for at least a second time that he would be interested in coming back for the newly announced Lord of the Rings films.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/andy-serkis-new-lord-of-the-rings-movies-1235486874/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Serkis said Peter Jackson and writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens are \"a second family to me.\" Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens are not confirmed to be coming back yet, but if they do, Serkis would jump at the opportunity to be involved.</p><p>\"I've spent so many years making films with them,\" Serkis said. \"I love their sensibility and their take; it's filmmaking on a different kind of level.

The <strong>Jochi-iu Shrine</strong> for example, tasks players with retrieving a massive ball from a Jenga tower. The shrine, and its puzzle \"Courage to Pluck\" can be found in the North Akkala Foothill, near the East Akkala Stable. Here's how to solve its puzzle.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to solve the Jochi-iu Shrine Puzzle in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The Jochi-iu Shrine takes place in a single large room, where you enter the Shrine. To the right is the door leading to the exit, which requires a large ball to open. In the center is a large ball, on top of a bunch of loose pieces of platform, similar to a Jenga puzzle. To the right is the <strong>optional chest</strong>, which is sitting just out of reach on a ledge. There is a second <strong>optional chest</strong> located inside of the Jenga tower. <strong>If you jump onto the platform holding the tower, it will automatically drop you into the abyss.</strong></p><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4137925-jochi4.jpg\"><img alt=\"You need the ball to open the door to complete the Shrine.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4137925-jochi4.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>You need the ball to open the door to complete the Shrine.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The goal here is to get the tower to fall towards a ramp, where you will be standing, so you can snag the ball. If the ball drops into the abyss, you fail, and the puzzle resets. First, pull out a piece without the tower falling, like the front bottom piece, so you can use it as a ramp to grab the first optional chest. If you wait until after you retrieve the ball, you might not have any left to grab.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-jochi-iu-shrine-puzzle-guide/1100-6514185/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-jochi-iu-shrine-puzzle-guide/1100-6514185/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-15 19:48:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom - How To Get The Paraglider", "description": "<p>Unlocking the paraglider in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/\">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> is an important step in Link's grand adventure, but like a lot of his journey, it can happen at very different moments depending on the player.

The World War II-era drama tells the story of the creation of the atomic bomb and the man behind the project, J. Robert Oppenheimer.</p><p>With Nolan's next movie, his first since 2020's Tenet, releasing pretty soon, we're looking back at the director's past films. Here in this gallery, we are ranking Nolan's 11 major movies, dating back to Nolan's debut feature, 1998's Following, and spanning his career that has included a Batman trilogy, a magician movie called The Prestige, and the mind-bending action film Inception, among others.</p><p>The list is ranked by critic scores on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. Of course, these are only critic scores, and as usual, audience scores can vary. Everyone's taste is different. But these are Metacritic's aggregate scores for Nolan's 11 theatrical films over the past 30+ years.</p><p>As for Oppenheimer, the movie hits theaters on July 21. It stars Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer himself, with a supporting cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Jack Quaid, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, and Kenneth Branagh.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Following (1998) \u2013 60</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137849-screenshot2023-05-15at2.02.49pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Produced on a reported budget of just $6,000, 1998's Following was Christopher Nolan's feature film debut, and also his lowest-rated movie in terms of Metacritic score at 60. A crime-thriller, Following documents a young writer, played by Jeremy Theobald, who\u2026 follows people around London in an attempt to find inspiration for his writing. That's not what happens, though, and the man finds himself in London's criminal underbelly.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. The Prestige (2006) \u2013 66</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137853-screenshot2023-05-15at2.06.09pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>2006's The Prestige stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in Victorian-era London. The magicians go back and forth and try to one-up each other, culminating in a showdown over a levitation trick. Like many of Nolan's films, it would be saying too much to discuss the movie more because of its twists and turns. But this one is fondly remembered by many, despite its relatively low professional score. It even has an appearance by David Bowie as Nikola Tesla!</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Tenet (2020) \u2013 69</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137854-screenshot2023-05-15at2.08.09pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The COVID pandemic had a major impact on how movies were released, with many studios opting to launch their films day-and-date on streaming services. Nolan, a staunch supporter of the theatrical model, apparently had enough influence to convince the higher-ups at Warner Bros. to release Tenet in theaters. Unfortunately for Nolan, the movie--which stars John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, and Robert Pattinson--didn't get great reviews. It tells the story of a group that can manipulate time in strange and puzzling ways. Nolan criticized HBO Max, calling it the \"worst streaming service.\" This would be Nolan's last film with Warner Bros., before shifting to Universal for Oppenheimer.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Batman Begins (2005) \u2013 70</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137855-screenshot2023-05-15at2.09.49pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nolan entered a new stratosphere with 2005's Batman Begins, his first superhero movie. The film stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, with an all-star supporting cast that included Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman. The origin story tells the tale of how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and though it didn't get the highest reviews of Nolan's career, it's regarded as a solid start to what would become a giant trilogy.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Inception (2010) \u2013 74</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137856-screenshot2023-05-15at2.13.29pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Inception, released in 2010, is a movie about dreams. The unique concept involves agents who infiltrate their targets' subconscious to get information and plant ideas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Elliot Page, with a supporting cast that includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, and Ken Watanabe. It is fondly remembered for its striking visuals and thought-provoking story. It ends in typical Nolan fashion with the memorable spinning top scene that had viewers question if what they just watched was real or a dream, or if that distinction even matters.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Interstellar (2014) \u2013 74</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137859-screenshot2023-05-15at2.15.38pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">A sci-fi epic set in the future, Interstellar stars Matthew McConaughey as an astronaut sent into a wormhole to try to save humanity. The problem, for McConaughey's character, is that each trip deep into space takes no time at all for him but spans decades for people back on Earth, which includes his loved ones. This complicates things with his beloved daughter, and McConaughey is forced to face a number of harsh choices. The movie also stars Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, and it's a real tear-jerker and mind-bender when it all wraps up.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) \u2013 78</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137862-screenshot2023-05-15at2.16.57pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nolan's Batman trilogy-capper, The Dark Knight Rises, released in 2012 and is fondly remembered. The film brought about the end to Nolan's series in good form. Nolan was said to have been hesitant about coming back for a third, but he and co-writer David Goyer eventually found a story that inspired Nolan to finish things off. The big new addition for The Dark Knight Rises is the arrival of the villain Bane, played by Tom Hardy. Anne Hathaway also stars as Selina Kyle AKA Catwoman in this film, which earned more than $1 billion worldwide.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Insomnia (2002) \u2013 78</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137865-screenshot2023-05-15at2.17.58pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of Nolan's lesser-known films, 2002's Insomnia was actually the director's first major studio movie and it ranks highly on Metacritic with a score of 78. The movie, which is a remake of a Norwegian film of the same name, tells the story of a crooked Los Angeles police detective, played by Al Pacino, put on assignment in Alaska to solve a murder. He's facing his own demons and all-day daylight in this eerie and memorable movie. The film also stars Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, and Robin Williams.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Memento (2000) \u2013 81</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137871-screenshot2023-05-15at2.26.34pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">2000's Memento is a wild psychological thriller starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano. Pearce plays a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, and must piece together clues from his past to find the person who killed his wife. Some remarked that the film was difficult to follow due to its non-linear storytelling\u2013and that might have been an intentional device from Nolan\u2013but in any event, it is a great movie and one of Nolan's best.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Dark Knight (2008) \u2013 84</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137868-screenshot2023-05-15at2.24.29pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nolan's second Batman movie, The Dark Knight, might be his most famous. The 2008 film brought on Heath Ledger to play The Joker in what continues to be among the best villain performances of all time. Christian Bale's Batman and Ledger's Joker go toe-to-toe in this exciting action movie that also stars Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Among other things, The Dark Knight is remembered for its pulse-pounding opening heist sequence.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dunkirk (2017) \u2013 94</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4137870-screenshot2023-05-15at2.25.19pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Nolan's highest-rated movie, by far, is 2017's Dunkirk, boasting an aggregate score of 94 on Metacritic. The movie tells the miraculous real-life story of the World War II evacuation of soldiers at Dunkirk in World War II. Filmed in Dunkirk itself, the film is known and celebrated for its use of practical effects and stunning cinematography. The movie stars Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, and Mark Rylance.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-christopher-nolan-movies-ranked-by-metacritic-score/2900-4748/", "date_published": "2023-05-15 17:58:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "You Can Delete Your Diablo 4 Server Slam Or Beta Install", "description": "<p>You can delete your Diablo IV Server Slam and/or Beta installs without fear.
