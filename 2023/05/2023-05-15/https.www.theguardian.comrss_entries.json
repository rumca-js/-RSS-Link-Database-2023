comparison</p><p>The longer you look at Kaye Donachie\u2019s portraits, the weirder they get. All of them avoid looking you in the eye. Their gazes slide away; they look to the side, are cast down or are occupied elsewhere. Consumed by the unseen, they can appear distracted or appalled. These are paintings, after all, not beings trapped in a frame. They aren\u2019t even portraits. They have their beginnings in old black and white photographs, but their faces belong to no one.</p><p>Donachie uses these photographic faces as an armature for her brushstrokes. With their fades, shadows and blushes, their swipes and flickers recall other paintings as much as they animate these imaginary people. Donachie\u2019s painted women are knowing constructs, and I get the feeling they could lose their composure at any moment, turn and smile, laugh, fly apart, disintegrate. She makes use of the play between the paint and the makeup her women wear, the patches of rouge, the shadows under a cheekbone, the interplay of nature and artifice. It is all a complicated game. Lively, animated, disturbed, motivated by something other than our attention, these painted women refuse to sit still and be pretty. The paintings also seem to have built-in flaws and glitches, places where modelling misregisters or goes awry and description falters. This is clearly deliberate. Displayed in the largest room of Pallant House\u2019s original Queen Anne townhouse, they surround us, and you have the feeling that their gazes are communing among themselves rather than with us.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/kaye-donachie-song-for-the-last-act-review-pallant-house-gallery-chichester-gwen-john\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/kaye-donachie-song-for-the-last-act-review-pallant-house-gallery-chichester-gwen-john", "date_published": "2023-05-15 17:01:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sale dreaming of Premiership glory and northern rugby union revival | Gerard Meagher", "description": "<p>Alex Sanderson aims to grow the Premiership finalists\u2019 fanbase but may need RFU help in what can be a southern-centric sport</p><p>There was one sentence uttered on Sunday that best summed up the challenge Sale Sharks face.

A late winter-to-early spring vegetable, succulent puntarelle, with its asparagus-like tips, or <em>punte</em>, is a popular salad in Lazio, so the basic, nifty and cheap square cutters (<em><a href=\"https://www.coltelleriacollini.com/made-in-italy-the-chicory-cut-flush-tagliapuntarelle.html\">tagliapuntarelle</a></em>) are common and easy to come by in hardware stores.

Rising bills for weekly shopping, energy use and housing costs have meant many people are cutting back on luxuries and essentials.</p><p>As the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, <strong>Richard Partington</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the story spun by the government has been a simple one: the blame lies with Vladimir Putin and a global pandemic. But not everyone is suffering from these higher costs. Look at the country\u2019s top 350 companies and, according to a team of researchers at Unite, the UK\u2019s largest private-sector trade union, average profit margins increased from 5.7% in the first half of 2019 to 10.7% in the first half of 2022. It\u2019s a concept that is being called \u2018greedflation\u2019 \u2013 where companies are using the alibi of a global crisis to bolster their profit margin by putting up prices more than they could otherwise get away with. So is that what\u2019s happening? And if so, what can we do about it?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/15/is-the-uk-in-the-grip-of-greedflation-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/15/is-the-uk-in-the-grip-of-greedflation-podcast", "date_published": "2023-05-15 02:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Belarus president Lukashenko misses another event prompting speculation of illness", "description": "<p>Leader has not been seen publicly in nearly a week, as opposition news outlet says he was taken to an elite clinic on weekend</p><p>Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, who has not been seen in public since 8 May, did not appear at a ceremony in the capital of Minsk on Sunday, triggering speculation the longtime leader is seriously ill.</p><p>The prime minister, Roman Golovchenko, read a message from Lukashenko during an annual ceremony at which young people swear allegiance to the ex-Soviet state\u2019s flag, the BelTA state news agency reported.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/alexander-lukashenko-belarus-president-sick-illness-speculation\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/alexander-lukashenko-belarus-president-sick-illness-speculation", "date_published": "2023-05-15 01:43:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
