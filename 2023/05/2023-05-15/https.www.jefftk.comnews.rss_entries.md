In January I got a strange notification from Facebook telling me that
I had "increased visibility".  It explained:

</p>

<p>

This was a weird notification: it only showed up on my phone, not on
desktop.  Probably some sort of experiment?

</p>

<p>

Every week or so I'd get another notification telling me that I was
still getting increased visibility, but that it was conditional on
continuing to post things people were interested in.

</p>

<p>

I mostly ignored it, since I'm already very set in how I post on
Facebook, and it was hard to tell how much of an effect it was having.

</p>

<p>

On March 25th I got another notification, saying I wasn't being
interesting enough: "Engagement has slowed.  See how you can get
increased visibility".

</p>

<p>

I was curious about what effect this had, but I didn't seem to have a
way to tell.  Recently I remembered that I had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/545581016154662">turned
on</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2680340558863560">professional
mode</a> on my profile, which meant that if I went into "Professional
dashboard / Insights / Content" I could see my last three months of
posts with their "reach" and "engagement" counts.  Here are the
plots:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-reach-by-date-big.png"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="305" src="https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-reach-by-date.png" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

I've highlighted March 25th as a red square, being the day when I got
the notification that I no longer had "increased visibility".

</p>

<p>

It doesn't seem like this was doing very much?  Average "reach" (the
number of people FB showed my posts to) was 802 before the 3/25
notification and 713 after.

</p>

<p>

This isn't a perfect experiment: after getting the notification I
thought it would be a good time to post some more boring ("not of
general interest") things I'd been thinking about for a while, though
as usual I wasn't very good at predicting what people would be
interested in and <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-social-dance-covid-requirements">some of</a> <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/violin-supports">those posts</a> got a
lot of comments.

</p>

<p>

Overall, I think I'm better off continuing to write what I want
without thinking much about how it will affect how many people might
see what I write in the future, but "how does Facebook decide what to
show" is an interesting question.
