There are big, good cases that can fit tons of hardware like the Corsair 4000D. There are stylish cases like Lian Li O11 Dynamic. There are cases with great airflow like the Fractal Design Torrent. But it's hard to get all of those in a Small Form Factor of SFF case. DanCase has proven that you DON'T need to compromise on these features and that you can fit a high-end Intel or AMD CPU and even an Nvidia RTX 4090 in one of the best PC cases I've built in. I love this thing.
