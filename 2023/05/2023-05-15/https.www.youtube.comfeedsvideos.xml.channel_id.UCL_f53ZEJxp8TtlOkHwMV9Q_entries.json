All of Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8 \n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Brian Roemmele discuss the future of human civilization: a world of human androids operating alongside artificial intelligence with applications that George Orwell could not have imagined in his wildest stories. Whether the future will be a dystopian nightmare devoid of art or a hyper-charged intellectual utopia is yet to be seen, but the markers are clear \u2026 everything is already changing.\n\nBrian Roemmele is a scientist, researcher, analyst, entrepreneur, and tech expert on the forefront of artificial intelligence. His current publication, Multiplex, offers itself as an experiment in journalism as he and his team give live updates on the empirical research they conduct in the field and advocate for the positive emergence and acceptance of AI in much the same way as personal computers.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nElysium Health: Get $50 off an Index test!
