Researchers have used the observatory's near-infrared camera to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-webb-finds-water-and-a-new-mystery-in-rare-main-belt-comet\">detect</a> the first known instance of water vapor around a comet in the main asteroid belt, also known as a main belt comet. Scientists had thought comets could preserve water ice so relatively close to the Sun, but didn't have firm evidence until now. They generally expected comets to sit in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, both of which are far enough away from the Sun that ice could last.</p><p>The findings have created a new riddle, however. While carbon dioxide normally represents 10 percent of the potentially vaporized material in a comet, Webb's instruments didn't detect any in Read. The research group speculates that the CO2 either dissipated over billions of years, or that Read formed in a comparatively balmy part of the Solar System that didn't have CO2.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Read was one of the first bodies used to establish the main belt comet category. The Webb telescope is the first equipment powerful enough to study these comets in detail.</p><p>More observations will be needed to understand if Read's lack of CO2 is a fluke or shared by other main belt comets. Whether it is or not, team member Stefanie Milam suggests a sample collection mission might be helpful in learning more about comets like this. It would certainly be more practical than other missions \u2014 the Kuiper Belt starts roughly at the edge of Neptune's orbit, while the Oort Cloud is roughly two light-years away.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-finds-water-around-a-comet-in-the-main-asteroid-belt-203825983.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-finds-water-around-a-comet-in-the-main-asteroid-belt-203825983.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-15 20:38:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "iPhone syncing for Windows 11 is now available for everyone", "description": "<p>Microsoft says iPhone support for its Phone Link app is now available for all Windows 11 users. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-supports-limited-iphone-syncing-in-preview-140005285.html\">Announced</a> in February, Microsoft\u2019s feature allows syncing calls, contacts and messages \u2014 including limited iMessage support \u2014 between an iPhone and PC.</p><p>Phone Link has been around (under <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-07-windows-your-phone.html\">various names</a>) for Android-synced desktop features since 2015, but this is the first time it\u2019s supported iPhones.

Despite the budget-friendly price, S Class TVs boast plenty of modern features, like a metal bezel-less design.</p><p>S Class models break down into three sub-categories. The S2 is the barest of the bunch, with a 720p resolution and display sizes perfect for easy transport, going all the way down to 32 inches. The 1080p S3 ranges from 32 inches to 43 inches and throws in HDR, a voice remote and Bluetooth audio.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The S4, however, is where things get interesting. These TVs offer 4K resolutions, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and frame insertion for smoother motion. Best of all? The S4 starts at $280 for the 43-inch model and sizes go all the way up to 85 inches.</p><p>TCL\u2019s Q Class begins with the Q6. The QLED display offers a 66 percent brighter picture than any of the S Class models and it also features something called \u201cGame Accelerator 120\u201d which is a tool that pushes the refresh rate to 120Hz when playing games, at the expense of half the vertical resolution of a 4K image. The Q6 line ranges from 55 inches ($500) to 85 inches ($1,600).</p><p>The Q7 includes a native 120Hz panel that balloons to 240Hz by accessing its own Game Accelerator mode, though with the same cut in vertical resolution. These TVs support AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, Dolby Vision IQ and ship with a backlit remote. TCL\u2019s Q7 line starts at 55 inches ($750) with sizes going up to 85 inches ($2,200).</p><p>Finally, there\u2019s the flagship QM8 line. These TVs are all about picture quality, with Mini LED backlighting, 2,000 nits of peak brightness, thousands of local dimming zones and a proprietary engine to improve contrast. These models also boast a built-in subwoofer, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hi-sense-mini-led-t-vs-can-hit-120-hz-and-2000-nits-of-brightness-170041793.html\"><ins>much like the Hisense U8H,</ins></a> Wi-Fi 6 for improved streaming and a height-adjustable stand for proper soundbar positioning. The QM8 starts at 65 inches ($1,700) and goes all the way up to 98 inches (an eye-watering $10,000).</p><p>Most of these televisions are already available at both online and physical retail locations, except for that massive 98-inch QM8. That one comes out later this year, so start saving now.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tcls-new-2023-tvs-deliver-high-frame-rate-gaming-at-lower-prices-165458947.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tcls-new-2023-tvs-deliver-high-frame-rate-gaming-at-lower-prices-165458947.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-15 16:54:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Telly will give you a free TV if you'll watch non-stop ads", "description": "<p>Never mind <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rolls-out-free-roku-like-tv-channels-for-fire-devices-230056933.html\">free streaming services</a> \u2014 one startup is giving the hardware away, too.

You won't have to interrupt a show just to stay in the know. The set has its own camera, microphone array, sensors and voice assistant, enabling video calls and motion-captured fitness apps. There's a built-in five-driver sound bar as well. You're not stuck using the company's platform, as you'll still find three HDMI ports to plug in other media devices.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The reservations cover the first 500,000 TVs, which are expected to ship in the summer. Telly hasn't outlined full specs as we write this, but the set is estimated to be worth $1,000 at retail.</p><p>The strategy isn't surprising given Telly's leadership. Company chief Ilya Pozin co-founded Pluto TV, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/paramount-prices-are-going-up-whether-you-get-showtime-or-not-153523879.html\">Paramount's free-to-watch service</a>. He sees the free TV as making viewers an &quot;equal part&quot; of the ad system \u2014 you're benefiting as much as the corporations, Pozin claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether or not customers follow suit isn't clear. The ad-supported model might not thrill privacy-minded viewers who'd rather not share info. There's also just one size and configuration, so you'll have to look elsewhere if you want a larger or higher-quality screen. This is for viewers who'd rather not pay for a cut-rate TV (which may still have home screen ads) just to outfit their living room.</p><p>Telly's launch is part of a broader rush to offer free TV experiences. Amazon, Roku, Tubi and others all have ad-supported streaming channels, while Google TV is integrating many of those providers <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-takes-on-roku-with-over-800-free-tv-channels-173805920.html\">into its platform</a>. The difference, of course, is the business model. Companies like Amazon and Roku see ad-supported TV as a way to spur hardware sales, while Telly is depending solely on those ads to turn a profit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/telly-will-give-you-a-free-tv-if-youll-watch-non-stop-ads-164319359.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/telly-will-give-you-a-free-tv-if-youll-watch-non-stop-ads-164319359.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-15 16:43:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Hackers breach Philadelphia Inquirer ahead of Tuesday\u2019s mayoral primary", "description": "<p>This weekend, <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> was <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/philadelphia-inquirer-hack-cyber-disruption-20230514.html\">hacked</a> ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary.

The risks of serious illness have declined, according to officials. Omicron variants have also been less severe than early strains. Simply put, there isn't as much need for exposure alerts.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The technology was first announced in April 2020 as Apple and Google raced to create a common approach to exposure notification in the early days of the pandemic. The initial notifications came through states' individual apps beginning in August that year, but OS updates in September brought an Exposure Notifications Express feature to many Android and iOS devices. This theoretically reduced infections by getting people to stay home in the event of possible contact.</p><p>That's not how the exposure notifications worked in practice, however. Researchers <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9357651/\">determined</a> that the rollout was fragmented. As there wasn't a nationwide protocol early on, states either implemented their own COVID-19 alerts or delayed launches. A user from one state might not get an exposure warning if they came close to someone from another state. Only 26 states released apps to make full use of notifications, and just 36 million Americans had either installed an app or enabled Exposure Notifications Express as of May 2021. While there's evidence the tech prevented cases (Washington State's app may have prevented 5,500 cases in its first four months), most of the population wasn't sharing data.</p><p>That's not to say the exercise was pointless. California's Department of Public Health says it's still studying the benefits of the state's app, and the findings from the COVID-19 response could help deal with future diseases.

That wasn\u2019t always the case, but having a kid subjected me to two years of boot camp-level exhaustion and my reserves are gone. So I was curious whether a sleep machine could improve my shut eye in any meaningful way. Hatch\u2019s latest device, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=90fe84b8-f8ec-4f84-895a-a3ddba79cc4a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hatch&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5MGZlODRiOC1mOGVjLTRmODQtODk1YS1hM2RkYmE3OWNjNGEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF0Y2guY28vcmVzdG9yZS0yIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNjI5MDY5Ni0xZWU0LTQ5ZTItYjE2MC01NTllMTM1Y2FhOTQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcRtMZoeXUNI282DyQnz2iXN9jLR1u5piVcGwOKSLFOo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hatch.co%2Frestore-2\">Restore 2</a>, combines wind-down routines, sleep noises and wake-up techniques in a $200 bedside device. The optional subscription costs another $5 per month and lets you access a larger library of content.</p><p>I set the Restore 2 on my bedside table anticipating a few breathing sessions at night and perhaps a less jarring alarm in the morning. I didn\u2019t expect to be so enamored with its \u201cRest\u201d and \u201cRise\u201d routines that I\u2019d look forward to pushing its oversized buttons each night, but that\u2019s what happened.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Design and setup</h2><p>The Restore 2 looks good on a nightstand, with a half-moon shape, neutral colors and textured fabric covering the front and back. The first generation Restore had less textile and more exposed plastic; this new version looks classier and less like a sleep machine. Hatch replaced the physical volume and brightness buttons of the first model with hidden touch controls near the clock readout. Also, instead of touch sensors on top for the alarm and routines, you have two oversized buttons. A physical toggle on the side stops the alarm from going off, even if it's been scheduled in the app.</p><p>The two big buttons are easy to find and operate without looking since the Rest circle curves downward and the Rise key bubbles up. The toggle is a tangible way to know you won\u2019t be woken up unnecessarily on an extra day off. But the volume and brightness touch sensors are disappointing. True, the unbroken expanse of fabric looks nice, but the capacitive controls are finicky if you come at them from an odd angle \u2013 such as lying down in a bed. I found myself twisting and struggling to turn down the sound, when a simple push button would have made things easier.</p><figure><img alt=\"Top view of the Hatch Restore 2 shows the concave rest button with a closed-eye image, and the convex wake button with an opened-eye image.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/c3e246c0-eb54-11ed-bc9f-985c4eed308e\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Setup is a non-event. Plug the device in, open the app and let the Restore 2 connect to your WiFi. Time sets automatically and you can schedule the on-device clock to turn off at night. I love this feature; I wake at least once each night and the first thing I do is look at the time so I can worry about how much longer I have before I have to get up. With no display, I don\u2019t get anxious and just go back to sleep. If you need that info, you can just tap on the side of the device and the time will pop up for a few seconds.</p><p>After choosing alarm sounds and lights, the app walks you through picking out your \u201croutines.\u201d You essentially make two of them: one for sleeping and one for waking up. A Rest routine might consist of a breathing exercise and an ambient music mix to get you drowsy, followed by flowing river sounds while you sleep. Wake-up sessions could include gentle guided stretches and a motivational talk.</p><p>From the Wake menu, I chose a four-minute guided stretch called \u201cShine &amp; Rise\u201d and a two-minute \u201cJump Start\u201d motivational talk. For the evening, I picked out a three-minute body scan followed by 15 minutes of ambient music and added pink noise to play the rest of the night. You can adjust the brightness and volume levels of each element, but since I was setting this up midday in an active house, it was hard to tell how bright and loud things would feel at 10 PM, so I stuck with the defaults.</p><p>Turns out the defaults did <em>not</em> work for me. I got in bed, pressed the Rest button and was greeted by a bright reddish light and someone speaking at a normal conversation level. Right next to my head in an otherwise silent house, that was far too loud and bright. I then spent the next 20 minutes messing with the app to adjust the levels. Of course, I could have used the touch controls for a temporary adjustment, but I wanted to get my defaults right for consecutive nights.</p><p>The app has a few inconsistencies, too. You can replace an existing step from the library; you can\u2019t add to your routine. You can only do that through the Rest or Rise tab. Yet, browsing from those tabs won\u2019t show full descriptions of the segments; that info is only available in the library view. That creates some back and forth that could be streamlined. I was also disappointed when a routine repeated content from earlier in the week. A motivational speech doesn't have the same impact if you just heard it two days ago. It only happened a few times, but I wish there were failsafes against same-week duplication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once, a seeming glitch made the Restore 2 start my evening routine at 100 percent volume and brightness, waking the whole house. The volume controls didn\u2019t respond, so, in a panic, I just unplugged the whole thing. The problem resolved after I reconnected the app from my phone, but I wish that defaulting to scream-level sounds was an impossibility. I asked a Hatch representative about the mishap and was told it had to do with an older version of the Hatch Sleep app, and should be resolved with the latest update.</p><h2>Rest and wake routines</h2><p>In all, it took a week of adjustments to set things to my taste. As it turns out, I\u2019m too squirmy at night for a meditative breathing session, so I tried something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like: sleep stories. The 25-minute \u201cTrain of Thought\u201d is presented by a friendly conductor who tells you mildly interesting things about trains before collecting tickets from her passengers, asking them where they\u2019re going as the click-clack of rails play in the background. Her sing-song \u201cTickets\u2026 tickets, please\u2026 tickets\u2026\u201d is now more effective at putting me to sleep than popping a melatonin.</p><p>I did need to adjust how I respond to hearing a story. If I miss so much as a preposition in an audiobook, I\u2019ll rewind. My active brain wanted to do the same with the sleep stories, but allowing myself to tune in and out let me use the narration as a raft, something to return to when my thoughts took me out to sea. Soon I was all done thinking and ready to sleep.</p><p>After the story, a 15-minute music segment called \u201cAmbient Overlook\u201d played its combo of wind and naturescapes with quiet strings and synths. For sleep sounds, I tried pink noise but that sounded too much like an ebbing ocean that never comes back to shore. I thought I\u2019d like a flowing river, but it just made me have to pee. I tested out Hair Dryer, Forest Wind and Thunderstorm before finding my goldilocks track: Road Trip, which is just the steady sound of tires on asphalt and the low rumble of passing cars. I adjusted it to turn off after about a half hour because the sounds woke me up during lighter periods of sleep.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Hatch Restore 2 lights up purple and displays a dot-matrix LED moon and stars. The unit sits on a wooden bedside table and the corner of a few books are stacked in the background. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/b2f82db0-eb55-11ed-bff8-994b3db2d76e\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>A blaring alarm can ruin whatever peace you found in the land of nod, but Restore 2\u2019s music, tones and field recordings come on softly then build up enough steam to get you up. One exception is Retro Beep \u2013 its shrill, electronic staccato should pierce through the deepest sleeper\u2019s dreams. I went with windchimes, which are randomized and high-pitched enough to get me up, but the first few bongs are so subtle that they slip in under my consciousness. It\u2019s the most gentle alarm I\u2019ve ever used.</p><p>The sunrise light goes off before your alarm, which can help some people, particularly those who sleep with blackout curtains, to more gradually wake up. I set the sunrise glow to activate 10 minutes before my alarm, but it doesn\u2019t tend to wake me, probably because my room is not light proof so the change is hard for me to detect. I\u2019m curious if that will be different during winter when I\u2019m getting up in the dark.</p><p>As it happens, the Rise routine I picked when I first set things up works best for me. I tried others: \u201cPop Cultured\u201d pulls inspiration from things like <em>Rocky III</em> and the Wu-Tang Clan. \u201cThe Reset\u201d uses repeated self-affirmations to help generate positive thinking. But right now, Becca\u2019s stretches in \u201cShine &amp; Rise\u201d help spur the transition from sleep zombie to mobile human, and Dane\u2019s \u201cJump Start\u201d motivations have actually made me approach my day differently. Once he suggested doing the \u201chardest thing first,\u201d which led me to ship back a bulky review unit that I\u2019d been putting off. Another morning, he advised not to think of the stuff on your list as what you <em>have</em> to do, but rather what you <em>get</em> to do. That stuck with me.</p><h2>Membership</h2><p>Hatch adds content regularly that only paying members can access, and that\u2019s my biggest reservation about the Restore 2. After paying $200 for the device, a $5-per-month subscription is all but required to get the most out of it. Even if you save on the cost with a yearly $50 plan, after two years, you\u2019ve paid $300 for an alarm clock. True, it\u2019s a good one. And I understand that the company charges a monthly fee to keep producing new content.</p><p>Without a membership, you get some but not all sleep sounds (white noise, nature scapes, etc.), plus alarm sounds and sunrise lights \u2014 no sleep stories, no morning stretches. I signed up for the free week-long trial and, though I planned to, I haven\u2019t canceled just yet.</p><figure><img alt=\"Three screenshots from the Hatch Sleep app show evening, sleep, and wake-up content options.

It makes a difference in the way I fall asleep, letting my brain go quiet much faster than it would otherwise. The alarm tone wakes me gently to the point that it\u2019s almost eerie, and I like that you can turn the clock off entirely if you prefer a fully dark room. Once I got the settings dialed in, the Restore 2 became a habit I looked forward to. And the content Hatch creates isn\u2019t a rehash of greeting-card poems and motivational poster rip-offs \u2014 it's thoughtful, intelligent sessions and stories, paired with competently produced music and sounds \u2014 all of which add up to a better night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>Of course, if you have a partner with a different sleep schedule, running the routines might prove a little awkward. I also worried when I kept having to mess with the app to figure out what content and which settings worked for me. (I try not to use my phone in the bedroom.) And I don\u2019t love adding another <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html\">subscription</a> to my life, which comes on top of the already-pricey $200 device. Ultimately, the Hatch Restore 2 has the right combination of external design and worthwhile content to usher you into dreamland \u2014 as long as you\u2019re willing to pay for it.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hatch-restore-2-review-better-sleep-behind-a-paywall-130028052.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hatch-restore-2-review-better-sleep-behind-a-paywall-130028052.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-15 13:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Twitter has a new CEO", "description": "<p>On Thursday, Twitter CEO Elon Musk said he'd appointed someone to take over from him as CEO, and it didn't take long for that person's identity to be confirmed.
