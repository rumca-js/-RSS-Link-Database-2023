I went inside the former hotel where, for science (and money), people are volunteering to get colds, flu, and RSV. â–  Challenge trials looking for volunteers: https://flucamp.com/ and https://www.1daysooner.org/recruiting-challenge-studies

This isn't an advert! the subject was suggested by the team at 1DaySooner, but that's it: no money changed hands and no editorial control was given away.

Two bonus facts I couldn't fit in the main video:
ðŸ˜· There are some challenge trials which require stronger quarantine protocols or negative-pressure rooms, but they're much more rare (and much more difficult to film)
ðŸ§» The tissues that volunteers sneeze into have to be put into a separate bag, so they can be weighed
