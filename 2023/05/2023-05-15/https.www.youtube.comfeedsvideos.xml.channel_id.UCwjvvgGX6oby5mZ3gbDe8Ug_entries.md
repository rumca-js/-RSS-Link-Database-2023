It's only the beginning of May. There is already a massive flood in Jiangxi province, so why have the floods in Jiangxi been so serious in recent years?
On May 6th, 2023, China's southern province Jiangxi was hit by the strongest rainstorm since the beginning of the flood season. A riverbank breached and flooded four nearby villages; Fuzhou City experienced heavy rain in many places. The province launched a four-level emergency in flood control response. 
To avoid compensation to the flood victims, the dyke managers and government officials discharge dykes without notifying residents in advance. Moreover, be particularly vigilant about the subways and tunnels, which are prone to flooding, and watch out for the safety of your and your family's lives and property.
