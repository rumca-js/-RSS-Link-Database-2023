Olsen revealed that she has been approached by people seeking guidance on entering the superhero realm, and her response has been succinct: \"Just give them one.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">By this, she means that actors should consider signing on for a single project instead of committing to a long-term contract. Olsen explained her rationale during an appearance on the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/happy-sad-confused/id827905050?i=1000614442496\">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a> with Josh Horowitz. Olsen elaborated (via <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/elizabeth-olsen-advice-for-actors-thinking-about-joining-marvel-cinematic-universe/\">Entertainment Weekly</a>), \"I think that way you have more control over\u2026 If you, let's say, 'Oh my God, this is the most fun I've ever had and I love this character so much, I want to do it again,' you now have more creative control for the next one.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Olsen's suggestion seems logical, given that Marvel has traditionally offered its stars multi-project deals out of the gate. Notable examples include Sebastian Stan and Samuel L. Jackson, who reportedly signed nine-movie contracts, while Tom Holland and Chris Evans committed to six projects each. By opting for a trial run, actors have the liberty to decide whether to continue portraying a superhero for an extended period. It also affords them the opportunity to provide feedback on their characters' development, granting a sense of agency.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elizabeth-olsens-advice-for-any-actor-joining-the-mcu/1100-6514579/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elizabeth-olsens-advice-for-any-actor-joining-the-mcu/1100-6514579/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-25 19:11:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Warhammer Games Are Steeply Discounted Right Now", "description": "<p>Dozens of Warhammer PC games are on sale at multiple online retailers for the next several days, with many titles discounted by up to 90% or more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The sales are available at <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/warhammer\">Fanatical</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-15232592?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/promo/warhammer_skulls_2023\">GOG</a>, <a href=\"https://greenmangaming.sjv.io/c/1804712/1219987/15105?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.greenmangaming.com/skulls/\">Green Man Gaming</a>, and <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/skulls?snr=1_4_4__118\">Steam,</a> </span>though the offers differ a bit at each retailer.

You'll almost always find some combination of a princess, a Master Sword, and a Triforce. And of course, there is always a hero named Link who rises to the occasion, often as the culmination of an ancient prophecy.

It's a common trait of high fantasy, and Nintendo certainly knew it was playing in those waters when it first began utilizing it across several Zelda games. The first to do so was Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, which explained via the game manual that Link was told of an age-old prophecy about the Triforce after finding a mark on his hand as he approached his 16th birthday.

This is the raid's first encounter and is fairly straightforward as you'll have to clear six plates in the room of a Taken Knight influence, and once that is done, Kalli will be vulnerable.</p><p>What makes this method so effective is that linear fusion rifles are great for doing precision damage and Kalli takes extra damage from headshots thanks to a critical hit multiplier. One player can use Tractor Cannon to weaken her and everyone else can unload on her with Sleeper Simulant attacks to melt her health bar in seconds. Done correctly, you can take out Kalli in her first phase and reap the rewards.
