Unprecedented! China’s chip moguls arrested in rush/The shocking corruption of state-owned chip fund
In Shanghai, a netizen claimed that the company he was interviewed for went out of business halfway through the interview. After passing the first rounds of technical interviews, he made an appointment for the 6th round of a major interview. Then in the morning, the HR department in North America contacted him and said that the company's server was down and employees couldn't log on, so the interview was canceled. In the evening, when he saw the news that the entire company of ZEKU was gone, he wrote, "It's like a drama.”
The CCP authorities' policy has entered the second stage, where the military-industrial system is most likely responsible for the entire chip manufacturing and R&amp;D. This is also known as the new state-building model. It’s expected that the closing of OPPO's Zeku is just the beginning, and there are a whole bunch of Chinese IC design companies lining up to go down.
