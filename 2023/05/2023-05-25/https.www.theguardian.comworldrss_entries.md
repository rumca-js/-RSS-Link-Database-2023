An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/24/celebrity-tribute-tina-turner">outpouring of tributes</a> has emerged online following the announcement.</p><p><strong>When did her career start?</strong> In the 1960s with her abusive husband Ike Turner. After two decades of working with him, she struck out alone and – after a few false starts – became one of the defining pop icons of the 1980s with the album Private Dancer. Her life was chronicled in three memoirs, a biopic, a jukebox musical, and in 2021, the acclaimed documentary film, Tina. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/24/tina-turner-obituary">Read her obituary here</a>.</p><p><strong>What was the cause of death?</strong> It’s unclear but she had suffered ill health in recent years, being diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and having a kidney transplant in 2017.</p><p><strong>How did the Twitter launch go?</strong> Not well. The event marked the first time a major candidate had announced their run for president on social media and nearly 600,000 listeners tuned into Spaces, Twitter’s dedicated audio streaming feature but the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/24/ron-desantis-2024-twitter-launch-tech-outage">results were a disaster</a>. As the livestream began, the audio line experienced feedback, outages and garbled audio. Many users reported their Twitter apps crashing or logging them out as they tried to join the stream.</p><p><strong>What do we know about DeSantis?</strong> The Florida governor claims “blue-collar roots” and an Ivy League education but has pursued hard-right policies as he seeks to take on Trump. Here are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/24/ron-desantis-republican-president-candidate-facts">10 things to know about Ron DeSantis</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/25/first-thing-tributes-paid-to-queen-of-rock-and-soul-tina-turner">Continue reading...</a>
