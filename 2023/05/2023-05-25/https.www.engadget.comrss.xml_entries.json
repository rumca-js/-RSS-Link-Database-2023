Not only with the Department of Transportation help states build half a million EV charging stations by 2030, the White House also convinced Tesla to share a portion of its existing Supercharger network with non-Tesla EVs. On Thursday, Ford became the first automaker to formalize that pact with Tesla, announcing during a Twitter Spaces event that &quot;Ford electric vehicle customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada,&quot; starting in Spring 2024, per the company release.</p><p>Because Teslas uses a proprietary charger port design for its vehicles, Ford owners will initially need to rely on a Tesla-developed adapter connected to the public charging cable in order to replenish their Ford F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit vehicles. Ford also announced that, beginning with the 2025 model year, it will switch from the existing Combined Charging System (CCS) port to Tesla's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-is-offering-its-proprietary-charge-connector-as-a-new-north-american-standard-193223322.html\">now open-source NACS charge port</a>.

First, the company effectively <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html\">killed most third-party clients</a> in January before quietly updating its terms to reflect the change.

(The old version of the free API was cut off entirely in April, although Twitter <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-restores-free-api-access-for-emergency-weather-and-transportation-alerts-204519574.html\">reenabled it</a> for emergency services in May.)

However, as the company has already alienated many of the developers that once relied on its platform, it remains to be seen how effective it will be at luring new customers \u2014 especially smaller operations \u2014 into the expensive new plan.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-startups-can-experiment-with-its-data-for-5000-a-month-200705341.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-startups-can-experiment-with-its-data-for-5000-a-month-200705341.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 20:07:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitch is raising prices for its ad-free Turbo service", "description": "<p>Get ready to pay a bit more to watch live-streamers without being constantly interrupted by ads.

Introducing MoviePass 2.0, or 3.0 depending on who you ask. The <a href=\"https://www.moviepass.com/pricing\"><ins>phoenix has risen from the ashes</ins></a> to once again offer you access to a bunch of theatrical films for a monthly subscription cost, and just in time for Memorial Day weekend.</p><p>The nationwide re-launch <a href=\"https://www.moviepass.com/theaters\"><ins>includes over 4,000 movie theater locations</ins></a> throughout the country, such as those operated by AMC Theaters, Regal Cinemas, Cinemark and a slew of smaller regional chains.

The subscription model now costs more, likely because the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-moviepass-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html\"><ins>company figured out the hard way</ins></a> that charging $10 per month for unlimited in-person movies makes it tough to turn a profit.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This latest iteration of MoviePass offers several subscription plans to suit how often you like sitting in a darkened movie theater. Plans still start at $10 per month, but this is only good for up to three movies each month, instead of one each day like the MoviePass of old. Subscription tiers go all the way up to $40 per month, which allows for up to 30 theatrical screenings. In other words, it\u2019s four times as expensive as the OG plan. Still, $40 for 30 movies is a great deal, considering a single ticket costs $10 to $14 in most places.</p><p>Just like before, you can make arrangements to see a film right on the MoviePass app, as long as the theater has partnered directly with the company. You should be able to reserve a space and even select your seats, just like you were buying an actual movie ticket. It also looks like MoviePass reservations are exclusive to 2D screenings, so toss those 3D glasses in the trash.</p><p>The movie-reservation subscription app has had a long and storied history, capturing the hearts of theater-goers upon its launch in 2011. This love affair couldn\u2019t last, however, as it ceased operations in 2019 and filed for bankruptcy in 2020. Since that time, original co-founder Stacy Spikes acquired the company\u2019s assets, brought on new investors and went ahead with this re-launch. Cheaper movies are never a bad thing, so here\u2019s hoping the app has some staying power this time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/moviepass-relaunches-nationwide-with-a-new-pricing-model-171626638.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/moviepass-relaunches-nationwide-with-a-new-pricing-model-171626638.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 17:16:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "YouTube Stories are going away on June 26th", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/\"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> creators can wave goodbye to Stories, as the service is killing off its version of the feature.

Yes, gaming on the go has been a thing since the Game Boy, but the runaway success of the Nintendo Switch and continued growth of mobile processors has brought an explosion of devices that let you play all sorts of games wherever you want. Figuring out the best gaming handheld for you, though, can be complicated. You already know that the Switch is worth buying, but depending on what you want to play, the right handheld could cost you less than $100 or close to $1,000. To help you narrow things down, we\u2019ve extensively researched the handheld market and tested the major contenders, from beefy portable PCs to compact emulation machines.</p><h2>What to know about the gaming handheld market</h2><figure><img alt=\"A collection of gaming handhelds rest on a wooden tabletop. The handhelds include the Nintendo Switch - OLED Model, Valve Steam Deck and the Retroid Pocket 3, as well as an iPhone 12 mini hooked up to a Backbone One mobile game controller.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/b56e1aa0-fa46-11ed-bf6c-fd19d876366a\" style=\"height: 1320px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>The market for gaming handhelds can be broken down into three broad tiers. At the top, you have x86-based portable gaming PCs like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html\">Asus ROG Ally</a>. These are the most powerful handhelds you can buy, as they seek to replicate the experience of a moderately specced gaming desktop. The Steam Deck runs on Linux, but most others use Windows. If you want to play modern, recently released games on the go (and need something stronger than a Switch), this is the type of device you\u2019d get. They can also emulate the widest range of retro consoles. However, they\u2019re typically the largest and most cumbersome devices to hold and their battery life can be short. Naturally, they\u2019re also the most expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Further down on the price spectrum are mobile handhelds like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-preorder-amazon-logi-play-142636818.html\">Logitech G Cloud</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/retroid-pocket-3-irl-153508438.html\">Retroid Pocket</a>. These often run Android or Linux and can range from under $50 to $400-ish. They aren\u2019t equipped to play modern console or PC titles, but they\u2019re usually more compact than a portable PC and can still be used for mobile games and cloud streaming. While most are marketed toward those ends, many people actually buy them to emulate classic games through software like <a href=\"https://www.retroarch.com/\">RetroArch</a>. Getting emulators to work <a href=\"https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/01/16/retroid-pocket-2-starter-guide/\">can be complicated</a>, and accessing the BIOS and ROM files required to play games this way is <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/262758/is-downloading-retro-video-game-roms-ever-legal/\">legally murky</a>. (Engadget does not condone piracy. Backing up files of games you already own for personal use only is considered more defensible, however, so for that a mobile handheld can be a more user- and wallet-friendly way to play the classics on the go.) Today, the ARM chips in top mobile handhelds can emulate games into the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles\">sixth generation</a> of consoles.</p><p>We\u2019ll call the last tier \u201chandhelds that do their own thing.\u201d This is a catch-all for things like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html\">Switch</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html\">Playdate</a>: portable gaming devices that run heavily customized software and aim to provide a unique experience. They aren\u2019t necessarily ideal for emulation or playing the latest multiplatform titles; instead, they often have distinct game libraries. They might not have the widest appeal as a result (Switch excluded), but they\u2019re often easier for less tech-literate folks to just pick up and use.</p><h2>Best handheld gaming PC for most: Valve Steam Deck</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s been well-documented over the past year but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vc3RlYW1kZWNrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZmMzZTBiMy1kYTIxLTQxZTYtYjRjOC0wZmNjNDExZTg2ZGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWaWEBDFIbCkCQSBymrLEUKQlUVVwWEAkJd3QFK6BA01&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck\">Valve\u2019s Steam Deck</a> still offers the best balance of price and functionality in the gaming handheld market. Specifically, we\u2019re talking about the entry-level model, which costs $399 and comes with 64GB of eMMC storage (which is easily expandable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-microsd-card-130038282.html\">with a microSD card</a>). The $529 and $649 variants with faster SSDs and, with the highest-end model, a premium glass display are fantastic as well, but a few new Windows handhelds might put dent in their value proposition, at least for some people. (We\u2019ll dig into this more below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, the entry-level Steam Deck is still a remarkably capable device. While not every game in the Steam library is compatible with the device\u2019s Linux-based OS, thousands are and the list of <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified\">officially verified</a> and <a href=\"https://www.protondb.com/\">still-playable</a> titles is growing all the time. It can play some games natively and stably that just aren\u2019t possible on the Nintendo Switch, from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/elden-ring/\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-120044800.html\"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a> to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-review-a-half-step-backward-for-capcom-remakes-070100973.html\"><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake</a>. The process isn\u2019t quite as plug-and-play as Nintendo\u2019s console, as some games require tweaks to run optimally, and some newer AAA titles are <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-can-steam-deck-handle-a-range-of-pcs-most-challenging-games\">starting to push</a> the device\u2019s limits. But SteamOS makes its settings relatively accessible, and in practice, this is essentially a last-gen console that plays in 720p but can be carried anywhere.</p><p>This power makes the Steam Deck a superb device for emulation as well. While some systems need a few tweaks (Wii) and others are more game-dependent (the oft-tricky PS3 and Xbox), most run flawlessly, and just about everything is at least playable. It can even play higher-end Switch games. Using a tool like <a href=\"https://www.emudeck.com/\">EmuDeck</a> makes setting all of this up about as easy as it could be, too. Beyond emulation, the Deck\u2019s flexibility makes it a fine device for <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvdG9waWMveGJveC1jbG91ZC1nYW1pbmctaW4tbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2Utd2l0aC1zdGVhbS1kZWNrLTQzZGQwMTFiLTBjZTgtNDgxMC04MzAyLTk2NWJlNmQ1MzI5NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZjM2UwYjMtZGEyMS00MWU2LWI0YzgtMGZjYzQxMWU4NmRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAemyVIYPRQhYQLgTCnHT_d_Vx7XFCDrx82Z0rDEpelPS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftopic%2Fxbox-cloud-gaming-in-microsoft-edge-with-steam-deck-43dd011b-0ce8-4810-8302-965be6d53296\">cloud streaming Xbox games</a>.

Even if you have large hands, it can be tiring to hold for a couple of hours. Depending on what you play, its battery life can range from eight hours to less than two. The 7-inch IPS LCD display, while decent, isn\u2019t as vibrant as the Switch OLED, and the d-pad is somewhat mushy. All that said, the Deck is a sturdy piece of kit. Its joysticks are pleasingly smooth, the face buttons and triggers are responsive and it dissipates heat comfortably. It doesn\u2019t feel far off from using a normal controller, plus there are four customizable back buttons and two trackpads to make navigating PC-style game UIs easier. And while the whole thing is heavy, its contoured grips slide naturally into the hands.

We\u2019ll have a full review of the ROG Ally in the coming weeks and will keep on top of the Ayaneo 2S when it arrives.</p><p>Both the ROG Ally and Ayaneo 2S run on Windows 11, which means they can play games from not just Steam, but other gaming clients like Epic, GOG, Itch.io or the Xbox app. Yes, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+play+epic+games+gog+on+steam+deck+engadget&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS924US924&amp;oq=how+to+play+epic+games+gog+on+steam+deck+engadget&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5670j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">technically possible</a> to play non-Steam games on SteamOS, but that\u2019s not the point of the Deck. And while Valve is doing an admirable job of getting more Windows games working on a Linux-based OS, it\u2019s still running a layer. Every now and then, an update will break something in a given game.</p><p>But Windows certainly isn\u2019t immune to things going haywire, and so far, no Windows handheld has really nailed a portable UI as well as the Steam Deck. Battery life is often shorter, too. The early consensus on the ROG Ally seems to be that these are still issues there. Plus, the performance jump may not always be massive; its gains over the Deck <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-asus-rog-ally-vs-steam-deck-review\">appear to be</a> most notable at higher power modes, but running at a higher wattage also means nuking the battery. Still, it's faster. And if everything is working right, a handheld running Windows should have fewer limitations.</p><p>Of the Windows handhelds we've tested, we\u2019ve found the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2-review-specs-price-a-more-premium-and-pricier-take-on-the-steam-deck-143039617.html\">Ayaneo 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-plus-mini-steam-deck-163047036.html\">Ayaneo Air Plus</a> to be competent alternatives to the Steam Deck with generally higher performance. The <a href=\"https://gpd.hk/gpdwin4\">GPD Win 4</a> is relatively well-regarded, too. But the software experience on these devices isn\u2019t nearly as polished as SteamOS, and devices with better hardware are on the way. We\u2019ll update this guide once we\u2019re able to review the ROG Ally or another handheld with a Ryzen 7000 series chip.</p><h2>Best budget handheld gaming system: Retroid Pocket 3+</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-3-handheld-retro-gaming-system-1\">Retroid Pocket 3+</a> is an Android device with far less power than the Steam Deck or portable Windows PC, so the only way it can play modern games is via cloud streaming. But if you primarily want a handheld to emulate older games when you\u2019re away from your home console or gaming PC, this is a generally comfortable and, at $149, reasonably affordable way to do so.</p><p>We <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/retroid-pocket-3-irl-153508438.html\">praised this handheld\u2019s predecessor</a>, the Pocket 3, in 2022. The Pocket 3+ is effectively the same device, but with a stronger chipset (the Unisoc T618) and more RAM (4GB). The design is like a smaller Nintendo Switch Lite, which is to say it\u2019s slim, lightweight (235g) and not fatiguing to use for hours at a time. The 4.7-inch touch display isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s bright and saturated, with a sharp-enough 750 x 1,334 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio that plays nice for cloud streaming and emulating systems like the PSP. (You\u2019ll get borders with some older consoles, though.) The hardware still has some quirks: The face buttons are on the beady side, the start and select buttons are oddly placed on the left-hand side and the analog triggers aren\u2019t pressure-sensitive. The joysticks are on the shallower side, too, though they\u2019re smooth and accurate in action. For the money, the Pocket 3+ is built well and easy to transport.</p><p>The Pocket 3+ can emulate consoles up to the Dreamcast/PSP range fairly comfortably, so you\u2019ll have few troubles if you\u2019re mainly looking to play older games from the SNES, PS1 and earlier. With a recent <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1vMnl3ZjNwMW1zRSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZjM2UwYjMtZGEyMS00MWU2LWI0YzgtMGZjYzQxMWU4NmRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZFWxaxpabXLF9uZlUNJgAzn0xzs6TO89QC6fM10O_6x&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Do2ywf3p1msE\">firmware update</a>, the device\u2019s performance has also improved with more demanding machines like the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It\u2019s still not flawless (particularly with the PS2), but numerous games are at least playable, which is impressive at this price. You can also play most native Android games or stream games from a PC, Xbox or PS5. Battery life will depend on what you\u2019re playing but typically lasts between five and seven hours.</p><p>Retroid recently launched a handheld called the <a href=\"https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-flip\">Pocket Flip</a> that\u2019s more or less the Pocket 3+ with a clamshell design. It costs $10 more and uses sliders instead of joysticks, but if you\u2019d prefer a form factor that\u2019s closer to a Nintendo DS than a Switch Lite, feel free to get that instead.</p><h2>A more powerful Android option: AYN Odin</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ayntec.com/collections/odin\">AYN Odin</a> is worth considering if you like the idea of the Retroid Pocket 3+ but are willing to pay a little more for better emulation performance with systems like the GameCube, PS2 and Wii. Its Snapdragon 845 processor and Adreno 635 GPU still can\u2019t run 100 percent of games from those systems, but the Odin <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zATLq_UshE1Nw6HhHuJvrv6f6xFyK8nHrUdDd6bO7KM/edit#gid=1678734171\">can do more</a> than the Pocket 3+, and the handful that are playable on both devices will generally perform better here. The device is even capable of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zATLq_UshE1Nw6HhHuJvrv6f6xFyK8nHrUdDd6bO7KM/edit#gid=1022148806\">playing some</a> 3DS games.</p><p>The Odin is also a better piece of hardware than the Pocket 3+. Its layout is pretty much the same, but it has gentle curves on the back that make it easier to grip, a couple of customizable back buttons and analog triggers that\u2019ll play nicer with more modern games and cloud streaming. It has a larger 6-inch 1080p display, and it should still get around five to seven hours of battery life on average. It\u2019s not as portable as Retroid\u2019s handheld, but it has a more substantial feel on the whole.</p><p>All of this makes the Odin a better device than the Pocket 3+, but it\u2019s hard to call it a better value. AYN sells three different Odin models: The base version, which often goes for $240, is probably the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d option for most people. A more powerful Odin Pro comes with twice the RAM (8GB) and storage (128GB) but costs $290; at that price, you\u2019re getting pretty close to the Steam Deck, which is comprehensively superior. There\u2019s also the $200 <a href=\"https://www.ayntec.com/collections/odin/products/odin-lite\">Odin Lite</a>, which is technically more capable than the Pocket 3+ but less of a jump than its siblings. It\u2019s worth noting that AYN has a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ayntec.com/\">Loki</a>\u201d series of handhelds on the way as well. Nevertheless, the Odin is a standout among mobile gaming handhelds.

Its 7-inch, 1080p display is bright, vibrant and altogether more pleasing to look at than the Retroid Pocket 3+, AYN Odin and even the entry-level Steam Deck. Despite having the same screen size as the Deck, it weighs a half pound less and its contoured grips are easy to hold for hours. Its haptics work as they should, and it gets a good 10 to 12 hours of battery life. The big panel makes it a treat for game streaming, and in terms of emulation, it can play into the Dreamcast/PSP range comfortably. Since Logitech is an established firm, you don\u2019t have to worry about extended shipping fees or wait times, either; just grab one from your retailer of choice and you\u2019ll have it in a few days.</p><p>Alas, the G Cloud has typically sold for $300 in recent months. While that\u2019s $50 less than its launch price, it\u2019s still too much when the Pocket 3+ and Odin get you most of the way there for much less, and when the Steam Deck can do far more for $100 extra. The Odin is more powerful, too; the G Cloud can still play some GameCube, 3DS and PS2 games, but not as comfortably, particularly at higher resolutions. Plus, while the G Cloud doesn\u2019t feel cheap, its triggers are somewhat shallow, and its face buttons are just OK. (The triggers are analog, though.) And because the device only supports the <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/235596/whats-the-difference-between-fat32-exfat-and-ntfs/\">FAT32</a> file system, it can\u2019t play any games larger than 4GB off a microSD card. All that said, the G Cloud is still a more luxurious experience than the Odin and Pocket 3+ in many ways. If money is no object, or if you ever see on sale around $200, it\u2019s worth considering.</p><h2>A premium device for vintage portable games: Analogue Pocket</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://store.analogue.co/#pocket\">Analogue Pocket</a> is the ultimate Game Boy. As we note in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html\">our review</a>, its vertical design is built like a modernized version of Nintendo\u2019s classic handheld. The general layout is the same, and it can even work with classic accessories like the Game Boy Camera. But in contrast, it has four face buttons instead of two, a couple of triggers on the back, microSD and USB-C ports and a rechargeable battery rated for six to 10 hours of playtime. Most notably, there\u2019s a gorgeous 3.5-inch display that\u2019s backlit and incredibly sharp (615 ppi) but can look like an old Game Boy screen through different filter modes. This is an elegant handheld with a premium feel, plus it can output to a TV with an optional dock.</p><p>Unlike the retro handhelds mentioned above, the Pocket is designed to play actual cartridges, not just emulate ROM files. It can play Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games through its cartridge slot, with games from the Sega Game Gear (and eventually, other systems like the TurboGrafx-16 and Atari Lynx) playable through optional adapters. Like past Analogue devices, the Pocket uses field programmable gate array (FPGA) motherboards to mimic its target systems on a hardware level. In practice, this means the Pocket\u2019s \u201cemulation\u201d of older titles is near-perfect, with a level of responsiveness and visual faithfulness that software-based emulation can\u2019t match. Pop a Game Boy or GBA cartridge in here and you can essentially play it as nature intended.</p><p>That said, thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-openfpga-firmware-update-beta-pdp1-spacewar-150038571.html\">big update</a> last year and an active community around the device, the Pocket can also run ROMs off a microSD card and <a href=\"https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/08/07/analogue-pocket-jailbreak-guide/\">thus play</a> systems like the SNES and Sega Genesis. At $220, the Pocket isn\u2019t cheap, and its shoulder buttons aren\u2019t as crisp to press as the excellent face buttons or d-pad. Still, if you have a collection of Game Boy, Game Gear or GBA games, the Pocket is the most luxurious way to play them, and it\u2019s only become more versatile since launch. Its biggest problem is that it\u2019s extremely hard to get \u2014 expect to wait <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/pocket-preorder-faq\">several months</a> for any new order to ship.</p><h2>A charming indie game machine: Playdate</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shop.play.date/#buy\">Playdate</a>, from app developer and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-10-gaming-irl-untitled-goose-game.html\"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>publisher Panic, might be the most niche device in this guide. It\u2019s a tiny yellow box with a 2.7-inch monochrome display, two face buttons, a d-pad and a physical crank built into its side. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html\">Our review</a> called it a cross between a Game Boy and a business card, and it is indeed incredibly compact, measuring about three inches tall and just 0.18 pounds. Its game library largely consists of <a href=\"https://play.date/games/\">oddball indies</a>, most of which focus on one or two core ideas instead of stuffing in as many mechanics as possible. A couple dozen of those games come with the Playdate for no extra cost, a few others are available through a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playdates-first-store-update-adds-four-games-and-a-calculator-210551529.html\">built-in store</a> and hundreds more can be <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/sideloading/\">sideloaded</a> from shops like <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">Itch.io</a>.</p><p>None of this is designed for emulation or capital-m \u201cModern\u201d gaming, and at $200, it\u2019s wildly expensive given its limitations. Plus, while the display is smooth and sharp enough, it\u2019s not backlit, so it\u2019s difficult to view in dim lighting. But beyond that, the Playdate is as polished as it is adorable, and many of its games are simple fun. Battery life is decent at six to eight hours as well. In a sea of devices that try to be everything for everyone, the Playdate\u2019s goals are admirably focused and low-key. For the most part, it achieves them. If you\u2019re into smaller-scale games and have some cash to burn, it\u2019ll be a charming little toy. Like the Analogue Pocket, however, actually getting a hold of one will take some time: As of this writing, Panic says new Playdate orders won\u2019t ship until \u201clate 2023.\u201d</p><h2>Honorable mentions</h2><figure><img alt=\"In games like Streets of Rage 4 with native controller support, the Razer Edge will automatically detect that which makes setup extremely easy. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/d24fa570-b9ce-11ed-9fcf-89b58257dcef\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><h3>Razer Edge</h3><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d043077a-4ba1-4321-a933-30b8701d8d31&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMDQzMDc3YS00YmExLTQzMjEtYTkzMy0zMGI4NzAxZDhkMzEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL21vYmlsZS1oYW5kaGVsZHMvcmF6ZXItZWRnZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZjM2UwYjMtZGEyMS00MWU2LWI0YzgtMGZjYzQxMWU4NmRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeLmAX1k3BL3dIGC9hN7md7Q9Rw5ojwl6iQCM-7ZERuk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-handhelds%2Frazer-edge\">Razer Edge</a> sits in a similar no man\u2019s land as the Logitech G Cloud. As we said in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/razer-edge-review-a-new-breed-of-gaming-handheld-170026147.html\">our review</a>, the hardware isn\u2019t bad at all. It\u2019s about as powerful as a flagship phone from 2022, so it can play just about all Android games at max settings and emulate GameCube, PS2 and Wii games well. Its 144Hz OLED display is impressive, and both its speakers and battery life are solid.</p><p>But the design is odd: It\u2019s essentially a standalone tablet attached to a Razer Kishi V2, so it doesn\u2019t feel quite as stable as something like the AYN Odin or Logitech G Cloud. The display also has a superwide 20:9 aspect ratio that isn\u2019t well-suited to most retro games, so the effective screen space for emulation isn\u2019t much more than what you\u2019d get from a smaller device. It may be one of the more powerful Android handhelds, but at $400, the whole thing is way too expensive.</p><p></p><h3>Miyoo Mini+</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://powkiddy.com/products/miyoo-mini-plus-portable-retro-handheld-game-console-mini-ips-screen-linux-system-childrens-gift?variant=43779530391799\">Miyoo Mini+</a> is more affordable than our top picks and comes in a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display really pops for something in the $70 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to, and we found it to emulate retro consoles up to the PlayStation 1 without much issue. As a Linux handheld, its software is extensively customizable, though it can require a bit of tinkering to get the most out of it as a result.</p><p>Unfortunately, between stock shortages and its lack of availability at major retailers, the Mini+ has been difficult to actually buy. If you can\u2019t find one, <a href=\"https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx\">Anbernic\u2019s RG35XX</a> should be a decent alternative; it\u2019s a bit easier to pick up and use once it\u2019s set up, though it lacks built-in WiFi.</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Backbone One\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e44f8410-7925-11ec-bcf6-da9b33ed53cc\" style=\"height: 1144px; width: 1716px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><h3>Anbernic RG405M</h3><p>We weren\u2019t able to test it, but the <a href=\"https://anbernic.com/products/rg405m\">Anbernic RG405M</a> should be a good alternative to the Retroid Pocket 3+ for those who want something more compact. The two devices run on the same chipset, but the RG405M has a 4-inch display and a more substantial metal frame. Its 4:3 aspect ratio means you won\u2019t have to deal with black bars as much for retro games, too, though it can feel crunched with newer systems and cloud streaming. At $175 or so, it\u2019s also pricier than the Pocket 3+.</p><p></p><h3>Backbone One</h3><p>At their core, all of the mobile handhelds we\u2019ve mentioned are just modified Android or Linux tablets. If you play more casually, you can get a similar experience by hooking up your existing smartphone to a mobile gamepad like the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CYWNrYm9uZS1PbmUtTW9iaWxlLUdhbWluZy1Db250cm9sbGVyLUFuZHJvaWQvZHAvQjBCTUQ0S0ZTTD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby16ci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZjM2UwYjMtZGEyMS00MWU2LWI0YzgtMGZjYzQxMWU4NmRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfceEnSBS12tfYUPf4HoDQPg6H0kbEiYet1VLtezCk5X&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBackbone-One-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android%2Fdp%2FB0BMD4KFSL\">Backbone One</a>. This connects directly to your phone\u2019s USB-C or Lightning port and immediately works with any game with controller support. Its face buttons are somewhat noisy, and its d-pad is a bit spongy, but it\u2019s comfortable for its size and has all the inputs needed to play modern games, including analog triggers and clickable joysticks. There's also a headphone jack and pass-through charging port, plus a useful app for starting party chats. The One costs $100, which isn\u2019t cheap, but it feels <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html\">much more natural</a> than using a console controller with a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qb3dlckEtTW9iaWxlLUdhbWluZy1Db250cm9sbGVycy1BbmRyb2lkLXgvZHAvQjA4TllHRDVHOT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby16ci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZjM2UwYjMtZGEyMS00MWU2LWI0YzgtMGZjYzQxMWU4NmRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATKUhZ2_rdudgQYaVveEijod6gKqgdSEtrTJibQTkJjD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPowerA-Mobile-Gaming-Controllers-Android-x%2Fdp%2FB08NYGD5G9\">clip</a>.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 14:00:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google Play Games for PC is now available in Europe and New Zealand", "description": "<p>You no longer have to live in one of a handful of countries to try the official option for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-play-games-pc-us-beta-180621316.html\">Android games on Windows</a>.

Years after we all decided that a stack of tabs at the top of a browser window is how we\u2019re doing things, Arc has a different approach. Like most modern apps, Arc puts everything in a sidebar and lets you build spaces that you can use to focus on a particular task. For example, all the research and documents I need for a particular article live in their own space, and I can jump over to another for personal tabs or a third for keeping an eye on the news of the day.</p><p>Arc, which launched a little over a year ago, certainly has its quirks. A big one is the fact it doesn\u2019t have a bookmarking system like other browsers, and there are a lot of small things that differentiate it from Chrome and Safari. One of those features is taking center stage in a new update that Arc is rolling out today. It\u2019s called Boosts, which the Arc team grandly refers to as a way to take control over the sites they visit. I\u2019ve been testing the Boosts 2.0 release for a few weeks, and while I don\u2019t think it is reinventing the internet, it does open up some fun possibilities.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"d995d7ec2a54411aacbf777700ccf554\"></div><p>Boosts first launched about a year ago, and product designer Nate Parrott told me the concept was to \u201cmake it 10 times easier\u201d to build a browser extension. \u201cIf you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to tinker with things or a person who makes websites, you probably have all the technical skills to make a Chrome extension, like JavaScript and CSS and HTML,\u201d Parrott said, \u201cand yet nobody makes them because it's just really hard.\u201d And while the original Boosts release put a bunch of tools right in the browser to let you customize sites, it still wasn\u2019t exactly user-friendly for people who don\u2019t know things like CSS.</p><p>\u201cTen times easier than making a Chrome extension is not really that easy,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cYou have to know how to code, you have to be willing to dig around in the web inspector and figure out what things are called in the code and stuff like that. It's just not that easy.\u201d Boosts 2.0 fixes that in a pretty major way by giving anyone a few simple tools to tweak sites they visit. If the original Boosts made things ten times easier, Parrott wanted Boosts 2.0 to make it 50 times easier.</p><div id=\"a6a5d06ea5694327b9e96bdd55351c45\"></div><p>To that end, Boosts now has a handful of simple but useful ways to customize basically any site. There\u2019s a color picker that lets you change most sites from the standard white or black backgrounds you\u2019re used to, and you can also replace the font in many cases as well. That might not sound like that big a deal, but it can really make things feel fresh \u2013 being able to change the Spotify web app from the black-and-green motif was nice, and being able to try some new customization features for my Gmail inbox was fun as well.</p><p>Perhaps more useful is the \u201cZap\u201d feature. This lets you highlight an element of a page that you don\u2019t want to see and just\u2026 zap it into oblivion. I tried this with YouTube Music; since the service added podcasts a few weeks ago, the \u201cexplore\u201d page has included a \u201ctop shows\u201d segment that surfaces some extremely low-quality garbage. I just clicked the zap button, highlighted the section and now I don\u2019t have to think about it anymore.</p><figure><img alt=\"Arc Boosts 2.0 zap feature\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4bbe6670-fa8f-11ed-9d3e-8e236fe668a7\" style=\"height: 1772px; width: 3008px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Results can be a bit hit or miss. For example, I tried to zap some elements on Twitter\u2019s website to essentially make it read-only so I can use it to dig for news without being tempted to actually engage with anything. I was able to delete the row that contains the reply and like buttons below a tweet, but getting that to apply to <em>every</em> tweet didn\u2019t work for me. Of course, if you have the technical knowledge to dig into a site\u2019s code, you can still do that just like you can in Boosts 1.0 and use tools like CSS, HTML and Javascript to tweak things to your liking.</p><p>You can also share your Boosts with other Arc users, something else that\u2019s new to this release. (Any Boost that uses Javascript is unable to be shared for security reasons, though.) If you\u2019ve come up with a particularly inspired tweak to a site, you can share it directly with a friend, as each Boost has a permalink. Arc will also be curating a gallery of its favorite custom options as well.</p><figure><img alt=\"Arc browser Boosts 2.0 gallery\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/739ade30-fa8f-11ed-bbdf-e44d7d21ad82\" style=\"height: 2072px; width: 2966px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">The Browser Company</div></figure><p>I asked Parrott if he had any concerns that giant corporations would take issue with users tweaking their websites, but he had the good point that Arc\u2019s user base is so small that it\u2019s hard to imagine it would be an issue. He also had some philosophical thoughts about the tension between how people want the internet to look versus how companies and designers want it to look. \u201cWe've swung so far in the direction of \u2018users do not have agency over the web tools that they use,\u2019 while the companies have so much control,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that really anything that swings the pendulum a little bit in the other direction of \u2018the users actually have a little bit of agency over this\u2019 I think is gonna be a positive thing and a healthy thing.\u201d</p><p>Right now, Arc is still Mac-only and you need to sign up on a waitlist to get access, so whatever weird things people try with Boosts 2.0 will remain a minor part of the internet landscape for now. And after playing around with them a bit, I can\u2019t say they\u2019d be a key driver in my decision to use Arc over another browser \u2013 but then again, I\u2019m not much of a tweaker. Maybe the people who prefer Android over an iPhone, or those who are spending hours making wild contraptions in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are exactly the kind of people who might enjoy painting Engadget\u2019s home page in a lovely shade of teal.</p><figure><img alt=\"Engadget homepage with Arc browser\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a038e030-fa90-11ed-bb77-dac062e2352d\" style=\"height: 1658px; width: 2594px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-arc-internet-browser-lets-you-customize-or-vandalize-any-website-130010555.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-arc-internet-browser-lets-you-customize-or-vandalize-any-website-130010555.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 13:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Acer\u2019s 16-inch Predator Triton and Swift Edge laptops are aimed at gamers and creators", "description": "<p>Acer just announced two new laptops at this year\u2019s Computex expo in Taiwan.

But you don\u2019t have to force your not-so tech savvy mom or dad to jump on FaceTime to show them how to check their email. iPhones have another built-in feature that makes screen recording and sharing easy. The steps below will work on iOS 11 and later. Any older iPhone will have to rely on third-party screen recording apps from the App Store.</p><h2>How to screen record on iPhone</h2><p>To start screen recording, you first need to make the option more accessible by editing your Control Center.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>1. Go to the Settings app and tap Control Center.</p><p>2. Here you\u2019ll see a list of tools you can add to your Control Center for easy access.

Tap either of those and the iPhone will ask you if you want to stop recording. Hit \u201cconfirm\u201d and you\u2019ll then see a pop up that tells you your video is saved and where to find it.</p><h2>How to turn on your microphone</h2><p>If you want to add audio to your recording, go to the Control Center. Press and hold the Screen Recording icon and tap the microphone icon in the context menu. Now, every time you screen record, your iPhone will collect sound along with video.</p><h2>How to find a screen recording</h2><p>Screen recordings are treated like any other video, so you\u2019ll find them in the Photos app where you can edit them if needed. However, if you would like your recording to go to a different location, press and hold the Screen Recording icon in the Control Center. You\u2019ll then see a list of apps to which you\u2019re able to send your video and share with others. For example, if you want to send that screen capture to Discord, all you have to do is tap the app in the menu and add a check next to it. Next time you want to show your gaming buddies what's on your screen, you can send the video straight to them.</p><figure><img alt=\"How to screen record on iPhone\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/b8020cf0-fa3b-11ed-b7aa-7b1f1d889e4c\" style=\"height: 1920px; width: 2300px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-screen-record-on-iphone-123016561.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-screen-record-on-iphone-123016561.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 12:30:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "ChatGPT for iOS is now available in 11 more countries", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-now-has-an-official-iphone-app-181454446.html\">OpenAI first launched its ChatGPT iOS app</a> across the US in mid-May and now it has made good on its promise to expand to more countries in the &quot;coming weeks&quot; by launching in 11 new countries.

Those satisfying transformations are something you'll see a ton of as you explore multiple open areas and compete in races that play out across ever-changing terrain.</p><p>This arcade racer is the first Lego game from Visual Concepts, a developer that has otherwise focused on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k23-michael-jordan-league-pass-2k-sports-140059388.html\"><ins>NBA</ins></a> and WWE games over the last few years. The studio hasn't hit the same heights of humor and wit as TT's Lego games (to be fair, Visual Concepts doesn't have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-release-date-crunch-151421921.html\"><ins>nine movies worth of iconic Star Wars movies to riff on</ins></a>), but <em>2K Drive </em>is still packed with surprises and clever ideas.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It's a fun blend of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-gaming-irl-racing-154527277.html\"><em><ins>Forza Horizon 5</ins></em></a> and Mario Kart. Zooming through the open areas can be a blast and losing bricks from your vehicle when you take damage is a neat touch (smashing breakable objects will restore your health and increase your boost meter). So, it's a shame that the actual races can get pretty frustrating.</p><div id=\"5c1885b45cff4a488421bc584078c411\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Visual Concepts has tuned races to make them feel as close and exciting as possible, for better and worse. No matter your vehicle loadout, every other competitor in the race storms ahead of you as soon as the light goes green. At first, finding a way to overtake your race-specific rival and other Lego drivers to win is thrilling, but the game quickly shows its hand. You can never build up too much of a lead. If you spin off the track at a tight corner, enemies will kindly slow down a little for you. The <a href=\"https://blog.wtfast.com/blog/what-is-rubberbanding-in-games-amp-how-to-stop-it\"><ins>rubberbanding</ins></a> works both ways, but it makes races ultimately feel overly contrived. More than once, I was on the verge of victory only for an opponent to storm past me at the last second.</p><p>There are some Mario Kart-style powerups you can grab during races and in the open world. On the surface, the powerups seem to add another dimension to races, though any enemy car I destroyed was quickly back in the thick of the action. They can work against you too. In one race, I was about to take the checkered flag when an enemy launched a spider web to obscure my vision and slow me down.</p><p>Winning races is essential to progress through the story, and it's annoying that there's no quick restart option when you aren't victorious. You have to go back to the open world before you can try a race again.</p><p>Those quibbles aside, the game is plenty enjoyable. There's a ton to do after beating the campaign, even if you don't care about online races. There are dozens upon dozens of challenges, side missions and collectibles to discover. You might find yourself smashing alien robots to protect some towers or scooting around a small town to pick up residents and protect them from skeleton attackers. There are fetch quests galore too. The story missions and challenges can become too much of a grind \u2014 you have to reach a certain experience level to unlock some races \u2014 but there was just enough variety to keep a smile on my face.</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot of the vehicle building mode in Lego 2K Drive.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/9ae86e20-fa68-11ed-af7f-6b163226e86c\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Visual Concepts/2K</div></figure><p>The most exciting aspect of <em>Lego 2K Drive </em>for many players will be the vehicle builder. You can use virtual Lego bricks to build pretty much anything you want, including replicas of pre-made cars you unlock or even toy vehicles you've built in real life. The one car I made is a monstrosity, but at least it works, unlike many of the janky vehicles I've seen in <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ieUw3X3Q3ZkZQTSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzU2N2E0M2EtNDU2Zi00YTY5LWE1NWUtOWZlY2MzZjVhN2U0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAd5ZHAcCpVkmuFOop9nyyh8SevlQD5OL5BRNNoH_dmQ6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbyL7_t7fFPM\"><em><ins>Tears of the Kingdom</ins></em><ins> clips</ins></a>.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game nudges you in the direction of microtransactions for the pre-made cars. You'll slowly earn currency, but it'll take you quite a while to unlock vehicles from the shop for free. After playing for seven hours, I still didn't have enough Brickbux for a car. As it happens, you can pay real cash to unlock cars and drivers faster, as well as more types of bricks for your custom builds.</p><p><em>Lego 2K Drive </em>is almost a great game. Most of the right pieces are in place and younger players may get more of a kick out of it than more experienced gamers. Hopefully, Visual Concepts can tweak the race AI and other minor flaws to make it really sing. In the meantime, I'll still be hunting for rainbow bricks in Big Butte County.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lego-2k-drive-lets-you-build-your-dream-race-car-brick-by-brick-113038327.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/lego-2k-drive-lets-you-build-your-dream-race-car-brick-by-brick-113038327.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 11:30:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Sony reveals its PS5 streaming handheld", "description": "<p>Among a barrage of game announcements during PlayStation\u2019s State of Play yesterday, Sony revealed it\u2019s getting into the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-pro-x-2-gaming-headset-promises-longer-battery-life-070129596.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/logitechs-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-arrives-in-europe-141551128.html\">increasingly</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-pro-gaming-handheld-review-180003707.html\">busy</a> world of game streaming devices.

That's not quite an all-time low, but it's still 12 percent less than what the pack typically costs. It's also certainly one of the best prices we've seen for the bundle on Amazon. While a single AirTag only costs $28, this is a great chance to get your hands on a few so you could track several items \u2014 like bags, valuables or even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-convinced-my-dog-is-stalking-me-143100932.html\">pets</a> \u2014 at once through the Find My app.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The Apple AirTag can easily pair with your iPhone or iPad with one tap. Once it's paired, you can use your device to look up where it's currently located and to play a sound through its built-in speaker to help you find what you're looking for. If you have a newer iPhone that supports Ultra Wideband technology, you can even use precision finding to lead you right to each specific AirTag. In case you do lose something that you're keeping track of, you can put AirTag in \"lost mode\" to be notified when the Find My network of Apple devices detects it.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Since the AirTag is water and dust resistant, it won't easily break if it gets lost. And while it's not rechargeable, the CR2032 coin battery that powers it is removable and can last for a year before you'd need to replace it. These four-pack AirTags  don't come with any accessories, but you can check out some of the best products for the tracker that you can buy <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">right here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-4-pack-falls-to-87-091304049.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-4-pack-falls-to-87-091304049.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-25 09:13:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
