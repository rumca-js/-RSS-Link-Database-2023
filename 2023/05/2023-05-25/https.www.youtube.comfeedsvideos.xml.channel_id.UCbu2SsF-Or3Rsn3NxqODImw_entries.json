In this video he reacts to the warriors of Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer: 40,000. \n\nToby Capwell breaks down armor and weapons such as the Ultramarine's armor from Space Marine 2, the Medival and Rennisance units from Total War: Warhammer 3, as well as the Skaven armor from Vermintide 2's Stormvermin. \n\nWould knights wield automatic weapons like the Boltgun? Would ancient Romans want a chainsword? Do the Adepta Sororitas' have Medival France inspirations? \n\nTobias Capwell is an American historian who lives and works in London. His principal interest is in European arms and armor of the medieval and Renaissance periods. He has written and spoken extensively on both the historical and the practical aspects of his subject.\n\n\u2014\nTimestamps\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:43 - Total War: Warhammer 3 - Bretonnia\n02:33 - Total War: Warhammer 3 - Empire\n05:15 - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine\n09:57 - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\n11:43 - Warhammer Vermintide 2\n15:16 - Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters\n18:07 - Dawn of War 2\n20:16 - Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader\n23:31 - Blood Bowl 3\n__\n\nToby's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tobiascapwell/ \n\nCheck out Toby's books: https://www.olympiaauctions.com/about-us/publications/armour-of-the-english-knight-1400-1450-by-tobias-capwell/\n https://www.olympiaauctions.com/about-us/publications/armour-of-the-english-knight-1450-1500-by-tobias-capwell/\n https://www.olympiaauctions.com/about-us/publications/armour-of-the-english-knight-continental-armour-in-england-1435-1500-by-tobias-capwell/ \n\nAll about Tobias: https://independent.academia.edu/TobiasCapwell", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsCXcW9pDLk", "date_published": "2023-05-25 15:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
