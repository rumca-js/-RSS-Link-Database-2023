Despite being presented as a lonely creature, Gollum gets more attention than he might deserve in The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. With average by-the-books platforming and stealth gameplay, there actually is a thoughtful and engaging story at the heart of Gollum. It’s up to fans of the genre to decide whether time spent on ordinary gameplay is worth experiencing Gollum’s history.
