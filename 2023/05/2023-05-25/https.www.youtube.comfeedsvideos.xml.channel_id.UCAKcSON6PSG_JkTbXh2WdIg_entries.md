What began as a fun idea for a cover band has turned into Turn Turn Turn, a dynamic collection of singer-songwriters and musicians who have already released two full-length albums and — as they explain during this session for Radio Heartland — have another on the way.

"New Rays From An Old Sun" is the 2023 album from Turn Turn Turn, and the band performed a set of songs from that latest release. Turn Turn Turn describe themselves as an Americana band, and their sound demonstrates some of that category’s sonic breadth, from the Tom Pettyesque sounds of “7 Kids” to the loping cowboy-ballad sound of “Acceleration Dreams” to the sunshine pop of “Dopamine Blues.” 

Watch and listen to the complete session above, including the band's interview with host Mike Pengra.
