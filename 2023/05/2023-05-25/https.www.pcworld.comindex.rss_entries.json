But as highlighted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23736005/microsoft-windows-11-force-quit-taskbar-option-feature&amp;xcust=2-1-1931912-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Verge</a>, you can soon perform the same action with fewer steps in Windows 11. You just have to right-click on the app in the taskbar, then choose <em>Force Quit</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method mimics macOS, making a transition (or switching between operating systems) that much easier than before&mdash;and less bewildering for people who rarely (if ever) interact with the Task Manager.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Force Quit isn&rsquo;t the only fresh feature headed to Windows 11, either. A couple will cross off items from our wishlist, like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html\">universal RGB lighting controls</a>. Other nifty updates include <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928482/the-magnificent-mouse-without-borders-joins-microsoft-powertoys.html\">Mouse without Borders</a>, an addition to Microsoft&rsquo;s excellent PowerToys lineup that lets you control multiple PCs with just one mouse; a proper <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930130/windows-backup-app-debuts-alongside-a-taskbar-update-users-begged-for.html\">Windows Backup app</a>; and the launch of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">Windows Copilot</a>, which will provide AI assistance within the operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps the most momentous announcement was coming native support for compressed files formats like RAR, 7-ZIP, and GZ. After almost three decades, Microsoft is officially making third-party programs that handled such files extraneous&mdash;and by proxy, likely putting memes about WinRar&rsquo;s 30-day trial in their grave.</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1931912/windows-11-will-soon-let-you-nuke-apps-from-the-taskbar.html", "date_published": "2023-05-25 21:56:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "5 ways Windows 11\u2019s new Copilot AI assistant will make your life easier", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Microsoft offered its first look at Windows Copilot, an AI-powered assistant that appears to be a one-stop shop for managing all sorts of tasks within Windows 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft showed <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">Windows Copilot</a> standing in for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html\">Bing Chat</a>, the AI chatbot that&rsquo;s rivaled OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT as the main AI assistants of the Web. But Windows Copilot appears to be much more, as a concierge of sorts for everything that your PC <em>and</em> its apps can do. There&rsquo;s a real question, however, of what class of hardware Windows Copilot will demand &mdash; and Microsoft offered the first hints of how it may manage the diversity of PCs that wish to run it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows Copilot, at least for now, appears to be a sidebar that for right now will open up as a column on the right side of your screen, where your Windows notifications typically reside. While Copilot leans heavily on text, Microsoft showed it interacting with photos and even files. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella introduced the following video at his opening keynote on Tuesday, and chief product officer Panos Panay played it again during his keynote address as well. It&rsquo;s a short overview of Windows Copilot&rsquo;s capabilities, before Panay offered more of a hands-on demonstration later on in his speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"replace-bing-chat\">Replace Bing Chat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen Bing Chat, Microsoft&rsquo;s AI-powered chatbot, in Windows &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html\">kind of</a>. Windows Copilot looks like the more sophisticated version that we originally anticipated. The video opens by claiming Copilot will offer &ldquo;answers to complex questions,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;help me plan my fishing trip.&rdquo; That sounds like Bing Chat to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Panay copied a bunch of code and asked Windows Copilot to interpret what it is and what it does. Again, that&rsquo;s a capability that Bing Chat has been able to fulfill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his own demonstration, Panay typed in &ldquo;how can I adjust my system to get work done.&rdquo; Copilot assumed he was referring to a Windows 11 system, and provided an answer. On the Web, Bing Chat doesn&rsquo;t make the same assumption. That could mean that Copilot is searching local help files, rather than the Internet. Why does that matter? We&rsquo;ll talk about that more, below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"an-automated-settings-assistant\">An automated Settings assistant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a case to be made that Windows Copilot is an admission that Windows is just too complex for ordinary users, who feel like they can&rsquo;t use it to its full advantage. &ldquo;Control your Windows environment,&rdquo; the next suggestion, will save you from digging through menus and apps for specific tasks like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/541768/here-are-the-hidden-features-of-windows-11.html\">turning on dark mode</a>, for example, or something a little broader like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796506/how-to-tweak-windows-to-help-your-tired-eyes.html\">suggestions to use Windows to ease eye strain</a>. It&rsquo;s the latter that benefits from Copilot, in that suggestions like &ldquo;adjust my settings so I can focus&rdquo; need some intelligent interpretation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, when Panay asked Copilot to adjust his system to get work done, Copilot launched Windows 11&rsquo;s dark mode and its Focus mode by itself.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Windows Copilot 2\" class=\"wp-image-1930302\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WIndows-Copilot-2.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Windows Copilot switched to Windows to dark mode and launched a Focus Session.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"work-across-documents\">Work across documents</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows Copilot will adapt some of the features in Microsoft Edge Copilot, namely <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656353/microsoft-edge-copilot-adds-ai-content-creation-to-your-browser.html\">AI summarization and content creation</a>. This is why we think Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI for Office apps) might be <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661649/forget-bing-microsoft-365-copilot-looks-like-ais-killer-app.html\">Microsoft&rsquo;s killer AI app</a>, in that it will save time reading and responding to information. There&rsquo;s no indication that you&rsquo;ll need a Microsoft 365 subscription for this, yet, but we almost certainly expect a Microsoft account will be necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"launch-apps\">Launch apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In his demonstration, Panay asked Copilot, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s great music to work to?&rdquo; Copilot responded by opening Spotify and suggesting three playlists. The two big next steps in Bing Chat and OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT are both plugins and web browsing &mdash; both sources of information to supplement what both already know. On the PC, it seems that the &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; will simply be apps like Spotify.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Windows Copilot 4\" class=\"wp-image-1930301\" height=\"802\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WIndows-Copilot-4.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Panay asked Windows Copilot &ldquo;how do I create a logo for my business?&rdquo; and Windows Copilot not only responded, promoting Adobe Express, but also opened the app as well. It then sent the logo to a coworker, using Teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that suggests the question: what, if any, apps will Copilot not be able to launch or understand?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"automated-transcription\">Automated transcription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice transcription is near and dear to our journalist hearts, as it&rsquo;s always handy to have a comprehensive, textual record of what someone actually says. Microsoft has made this part of its business services (Teams, mainly) for a number of years now, but it looks like it will come to Windows, too. Panay dragged an MP3 recording into the chat box (interesting in and of itself!) and Windows Copilot began generating a transcription.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Windows Copilot 3\" class=\"wp-image-1930300\" height=\"803\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-Copilot-3.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Dropping files into Windows Copilot for transcription or analysis seems pretty cool.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-will-be-windows-copilots-hardware-requirements-be\">What will be Windows Copilot&rsquo;s hardware requirements be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this begs the question: How will Windows Copilot actually <em>run</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recall <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html\">Windows 11&rsquo;s strict hardware requirements</a>, and how they evolved: first a Trusted Platform Module, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/542121/microsoft-reveals-how-to-bypass-windows-11s-strict-hardware-requirements.html\">then not</a>, and finally some middle ground between the two. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html\">AI art apps like Stable Diffusion</a> can run on local PCs, but they&rsquo;ve traditionally run best on laptops or desktops with discrete GPUs and lots of video memory to run the algorithms, plus storage to store the code itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CPUs with dedicated AI blocks attached to them add another wrinkle. Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 processor has a Hexagon DSP attached to it specifically for AI processing, while the AMD <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806031/amd-launches-ai-powered-ryzens-for-thin-notebooks.html\">Ryzen 7040U</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html\">Ryzen AI</a> block pack dedicated AI hardware too. Specific Intel 13th-gen Core chips have a Movidius AI card attached, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html\">Intel&rsquo;s Meteor Lake will have integrated AI</a>, according to chief executive Pat Gelsinger. All these, however, make up a small percentage of the available PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-consumer-gpu-for-ai-tasks\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best consumer gpu for ai tasks\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition\">GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG93V9GW?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1930286-5-1348256-11566&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1,609.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6521430&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6521430%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-1930286-5-1348256-11566\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Not Available at Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know how Microsoft plans to address this disparity, but we do have a few hints. For one, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/401941/how-microsofts-windows-ml-machine-learning-could-help-apps-anticipate-your-needs.html\">Microsoft launched machine-learning API Windows ML</a> a few years back to address AI, but without any killer apps, it faded from public view. This week, Microsoft said that it&rsquo;s working with AMD, Intel, and Nvidia to optimize their transformer and diffusion models to run AI locally on their hardware. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/204969/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1930286-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia&rsquo;s latest Game Driver can double AI performance</a> for apps like Stable Diffusion, and AMD will release optimized drivers for AI on its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\">Radeon RX 7900 GPU</a> and Ryzen 7040 CPU in the next month, Microsoft said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s still the question of whether local hardware can keep up with the demands of Windows Copilot and other AI. For that, Microsoft might apply something called Hybrid Loop, which would allow the cloud and the PC to work in tandem. At Build, Pavan Davuluri, a corporate vice president a Microsoft, said that Hybrid Loop makes Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure cloud &ldquo;show up just like a coprocessor in Windows, just like an NPU or a GPU.&rdquo; That might allow a PC to use a local GPU or AI coprocessor for as much processing as it can, tapping the Azure cloud if it can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That still doesn&rsquo;t answer the question of how Copilot will work on your PC, especially if you don&rsquo;t have the absolute latest hardware. We asked Microsoft for comment, and company officials responded that they have nothing official to share. Rest assured, however, that if Microsoft is as driven as they seem to make Windows Copilot part of your PC, they&rsquo;ll need to solve these problems. The answer, though, might demand you buy a more powerful PC.</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930286/heres-what-windows-copilot-can-do-according-to-microsoft.html", "date_published": "2023-05-25 14:15:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save 30% on Amazon\u2019s Ring Video Doorbell and keep your home safe", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re monitoring arriving packages or watching for nefarious activity, these days it&rsquo;s important to secure your home with a video doorbell.

That&rsquo;s 30 percent off of the original $99.99 price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I own this specific doorbell myself and really love it, especially when I&rsquo;m home alone. The 1080p video is clear and smooth, and it was relatively easy to install. I also like to scare my husband by randomly speaking to him through it. This joke never gets old (well, for me it doesn&rsquo;t). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amazon Ring Video Doorbell features 1080p video, mobile notifications, and a built-in rechargeable battery. The mobile notifications pop up whenever the doorbell detects motion, which gives me peace of mind whenever I&rsquo;m out for a walk or at lunch with friends. I like being able to closely monitor my front door when I&rsquo;m not home. You can also check out the Ring Protect Plan, which records all of your videos and review what you missed.

And there&rsquo;s now AI, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1442835/acer-swift-edge-review.html\">original review of the Acer Swift Edge 16</a> we noted that &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve not seen a laptop with a larger screen that weighs less.&rdquo; But reviewer Matt Elliott went on to note that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing Acer invest in a bit more material to stabilize the laptop. Acer apparently rejected that advice, went the other direction, and this $1,299 Ryzen 7000-based laptop is the result. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a consequence, the Acer Swift Edge 16 (SFE16-43-R98R) will be a tad thinner at 0.51 inches thick, but will weigh 2.73 pounds, a 0.14-pound increase over the previous generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(The earlier generation sloped from 0.55 inches thick to 0.51 inches thick; the latest version is 0.51 inches, front to back. Acer also offered the previous generation at either $1,499 or $1,299; the 2023 refresh will be sold in a single model for North America, at $1,299. )</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contrasts continue. Although both Acer Swift Edge models include an OLED panel, the earlier generation uses a 16-inch 16:10 4K(3840&times;2400) display. The current model steps down to what Acer calls &ldquo;WQXGA+&rdquo;: a 16:10 (3200&times;2000) display instead. On the other hand, the newest Swift Edge&rsquo;s display runs at 120Hz, a quality-of-life improvement that will generally just be easier on your eyes. (Like some OLED displays, it&rsquo;s not a touchscreen.) Still, the improved refresh rate has a cost attached to it: The battery-life rating of &ldquo;8+&rdquo; hours sounds like a dip from the 10 or so hours that the original Swift Edge lasted in our tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interesting twist is the processor: the Ryzen 7 7840U. Like certain members of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html\">Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen mobile Core family</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html\">AMD Ryzen 7040 Mobile family</a> includes Ryzen AI, which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html\">an AMD executive explained</a> is vital to the company&rsquo;s processor development going forward.

That&rsquo;s a good amount of power right there, so we expect this laptop to smoothly run most modern titles. The IPS display will feature a resolution of 2560&times;1600, an aspect ratio of 16:10, a refresh rate of 240Hz, and a maximum brightness of 500 nits. Based on those specs alone, visuals should be crisp and vibrant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptop will also have a dual-fan system with dedicated heat pipes and exhaust vents, which are designed to keep the machine running nice and cool. There&rsquo;s even a layer of liquid-metal thermal grease on the CPU, which further helps distribute the heat created by the hardware. The laptop is also quite thin, measuring 19.9 mm (0.78 inches). No word on the weight yet, but it could very well make for a capable traveling companion.

This is important to know since most, if not all, SSDs include an endurance rating, so that gives you an idea of how much life is left in your drive. For this SSD, Intel claims it can write up to 200TB before it peters out, so this drive has quite a bit of life left in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also be curious to see the number of times it&rsquo;s been powered on, and how many hours it&rsquo;s been running, but neither of those stats will have an impact on the drive&rsquo;s performance.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"SSD information\" class=\"wp-image-541482\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/main3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the middle section there is some handy information for verifying that your drive is operating at its peak capacity, which is noted in the box labeled, &ldquo;Transfer Mode.&rdquo; With <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html\">motherboards these days</a> having multiple M.2 SSD slots, it is useful to double-check that the slot you&rsquo;re using is a true PCIe X4 slot as opposed to a slower X2 slot.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel SSD summary tool\" class=\"wp-image-541480\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/intel-tool.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you <em>really</em> want to see the actual S.M.A.R.T. data your drive is producing, most drive manufacturers offer their own drive management software that will show it to you. Here&rsquo;s what Intel&rsquo;s looks like.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel SSD details\" class=\"wp-image-541483\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/intel-smart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1087\" width=\"1087\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, most people will a need to do a lot of Googling to understand what all the numbers mean. There&rsquo;s no universal definition of what properties a drive has to monitor, and the acceptable values can change from drive to drive and company to company. Plus, it&rsquo;s not really enjoyable to be Googling, &ldquo;Available spare normalized percentage of the remaining spare capacity available,&rdquo; which is one of the Intel S.M.A.R.T. attributes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So take it from us: Just use Crystal Disk Info. It&rsquo;s easier to deal with, easy to understand, and you can&rsquo;t beat the price of free.</p>\n\nTechnology Industry</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/541476/how-to-check-your-ssd-health-stats-crystaldiskinfo.html", "date_published": "2023-05-25 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 review: Cool, quiet, and compelling", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"review-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" /><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Great 1080p gaming performance with factory overclock</li><li>Cool, quiet, and pretty custom cooling solution</li><li>Affordable, doesn&rsquo;t upcharge for the cooler</li><li>Manageable two-slot design</li><li>Only needs 8-pin power connector (no adapter needed)</li><li>AV1 encoding</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Ray tracing performance is bad</li><li>All image upscaling features (FSR/DLSS) look ugly at 1080p</li><li>8GB of VRAM; may need to dial graphics from Ultra to High in some particularly intensive games, even at 1080p</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Sapphire&rsquo;s Pulse Radeon RX 7600 offers great 1080p gaming in a cool, quiet package for just $269.

After years of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">exorbitant</a> GPU <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">prices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">stagnant new &ldquo;upgrades,&rdquo;</a> the Radeon RX 7600 delivers a true generational improvement for a lower price than its predecessor&mdash;a winning combination. It offers fast, power-efficient 1080p gaming at an affordable price point. Enter Sapphire&rsquo;s Pulse Radeon RX 7600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve loved Sapphire&rsquo;s Pulse line since its introduction thanks to its laser-focus on excellent, cool, no-frills gaming for an affordable price, regardless of the GPU inside. That seems like a perfect combination with AMD&rsquo;s new excellent, affordable GPU, no?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is. After putting the card through its paces, we&rsquo;re happy to report that the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 is everything you would want from the RX 7600 lineup. It&rsquo;s just big enough to carry a competent cooling solution without being obtrusive, all for the baseline $269 MSRP price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7600-specs-and-features\">Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve included AMD&rsquo;s breakdown of the Radeon RX 7600&rsquo;s technical specifications below. Sapphire stuck mostly to reference specs with the Pulse, other than offering a slight factory overclock. The Pulse RX 7600 is rated for an average game clock speed of 2,356MHz, compared to the reference 2,250MHz.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7600 specs\" class=\"wp-image-1928231\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/specs-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=993\" width=\"993\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We covered the Radeon RX 7600&rsquo;s critical technical bits in <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html\">our reference card review</a> and won&rsquo;t rehash that here. In addition to the raw upgrade to the new 6nm RDNA 3 architecture (which brings AV1 encoding, higher GPU and memory clock speeds, new AI accelerators, and second-gen RT accelerators), AMD also packed the GPU with flat-out <em>more</em> horsepower than its predecessor, the Radeon RX 6600 that launched at $329 in 2020. All told, the Radeon RX 7600 offers an average of 35 percent more 1080p gaming performance for 18 percent less money&mdash;a true generational upgrade. It falters in ray tracing, however, and upscaling technologies like AMD&rsquo;s FSR and Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS look bad at this resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one aspect worth briefly readdressing here: the memory configuration. AMD equipped the Radeon RX 7600 with a tiny 128-bit bus and 8GB of onboard memory. That limits the Radeon RX 7600 to consideration for 1080p gaming (though it can handle 1440p with reduced settings)&mdash;a reasonable compromise in an affordable GPU, unlike identical compromises made in <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s $400 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But PC gamers are worried that 8GB of memory capacity isn&rsquo;t enough now that a swathe of modern triple-A games consume more than that regularly at Ultra resolution. Those edge cases are rare, however, and PCWorld contributor Keith May tested the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929687/pushing-the-radeon-rx-7600-vram-to-its-limits-is-8gb-enough.html\">Sapphire Pulse RX 7600&rsquo;s performance in some of today&rsquo;s most VRAM-hungry games</a> to see what you can expect. You can see his analysis in the video below, but bottom line? If you bump graphics settings from Ultra to High in those most-intensive titles, you still get a killer 1080p gaming experience that looks great and runs fast. Again, at this affordable price point, that&rsquo;s totally reasonable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Radeon RX 7600 is a testament to Sapphire&rsquo;s strict &lsquo;no-frills, just great gaming&rsquo; approach to the Pulse lineup.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Onto the Pulse itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sapphire stuck to the tried-and-true Pulse design we&rsquo;ve loved in cards like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1658218/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review.html\">Pulse RX 7900 XT</a> and last-gen&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394996/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review.html\">Pulse RX 6600 XT</a>. It&rsquo;s still good. The dual-slot card features a basic aluminum fin stack and a focus on low noise output, bolstered by Sapphire&rsquo;s Dual-X Cooling technology. Dual &ldquo;hybrid fan blades&rdquo; and intelligent fan controls keep thing running nice, cool, and quiet&mdash;as you&rsquo;ll see later, the Pulse offers much lower temperatures than AMD&rsquo;s reference card, including peak hotspot temperatures. That&rsquo;s a testament to Sapphire&rsquo;s intentional design for all Pulse models.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600\" class=\"wp-image-1930249\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapphire-Pulse-Radeon-RX-7600-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keith May/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You won&rsquo;t find any fancy extras like RGB lighting, dual-BIOS switches, or fan control headers on the switch, but those luxuries aren&rsquo;t typical on budget-priced cards, or on custom offerings that hit the MSRP suggested by AMD and Nvidia. One minor sacrifice? While the AMD reference 7600 contains DisplayPort 2.1 connections, that&rsquo;s an optional specification, and the Pulse relies on the same DisplayPort 1.4 technology that Nvidia offers in its RTX 40-series GPUs. The higher bandwidth provided by DP 2.1 would mostly be useless on a $269, 1080p-focused graphics card anyway, as it&rsquo;s intended to power pixel-packed high-resolution displays at ultra-fast refresh rates.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600\" class=\"wp-image-1930248\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapphire-Pulse-Radeon-RX-7600-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keith May/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Aesthetically, the Pulse looks as good as ever, featuring a blacked-out design with red highlights and a gorgeous red &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; heartbeat traveling the length of the card&rsquo;s metal backplate. (Yes, Sapphire still slapped a backplate on here despite the low price&mdash;always welcome, since bare PCBs look terrible when you&rsquo;re using a case with a tempered glass window.) Power is handled via a simple, single 8-pin connection, no fiddly 12VHPWR adapters required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, as a modern AMD graphics card, the Sapphire Pulse can tap into AMD&rsquo;s suite of Radeon features, such as Smart Access Memory for faster game performance in Ryzen + Radeon systems, Smart Access Video for faster encoding in all-AMD PCs, FSR 2, Radeon Super Resolution, Anti-Lag, and more. And the Radeon RX 7600&rsquo;s new AV1 encoding works great with the Record &amp; Stream features in AMD Adrenalin software, which might actually be a bit better than Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted Shadowplay now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onto the benchmarks!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"our-test-system\">Our test system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keith May tested the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 on his testing system, which runs using the same core components as Brad&rsquo;s main PCWorld GPU testing rig. You can see Keith explain the components in his rig&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00T15aL1pkA&amp;t=102s&amp;xcust=2-3-1930244-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">in video form here</a>, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html#toc-2\">this link</a>&nbsp;details what&rsquo;s inside the main GPU rig. Keith provided numbers for the Zotac card; the comparison data was pulled from our just-updated database of GPUs using the main test rig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential. Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;xcust=2-3-1930244-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia&rsquo;s FrameView tool</a>, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We&rsquo;ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. We&rsquo;ve focused our testing on 1080p performance alone in a select handful of games, since our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html\">original Radeon RX 7600 review</a> already established that this class of GPU is best suited for 1080p gaming <em>without ray tracing enabled</em> due to the way it&rsquo;s technically configured. If you want to see all that work, go check out that review; the purpose of this one is to compare the Sapphire Pulse&rsquo;s performance specifically against AMD&rsquo;s reference 7600, hence limiting our benchmarks to a more focused selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7600-gaming-benchmarks\">Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 gaming benchmarks</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 1080p benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1930246\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1080p-pulse-7600.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keith May/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>No surprises here. The Sapphire Pulse&rsquo;s modest factory overclock and enhanced cooling let it eke out a few more frames than AMD&rsquo;s reference Radeon RX 7600. It&rsquo;s a great, affordable option for 1080p gaming with excellent visual fidelity and fast frame rates out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s notable, because as we covered in our reference 7600 review, performance-boosting image upscaling technologies like AMD&rsquo;s FSR and Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS negatively affect visual quality at 1080p resolution, since they&rsquo;re working with so many fewer pixels than at 1440p or 4K. So picking up a 1080p graphics card that offers a great native experience is key. The Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 checks that box with gusto.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7600-power-and-temperatures\">Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 power and temperatures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Sapphire Pulse&rsquo;s power draw, though the thermals and acoustics are the real draw here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 power and temps\" class=\"wp-image-1930247\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/power-temps-pulse-7600.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keith May/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sapphire Pulse comes with a small factory overclock and offers slightly faster performance than the AMD Radeon RX 7600 reference card, so it&rsquo;s no surprise to see it draw slightly more power. The energy consumption remains small enough that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onto the Pulse&rsquo;s strong suit. We test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sapphire&rsquo;s straightforward, but effective Pulse cooling design impresses yet again. Not only does the Pulse keep overall GPU temperatures lower than the Radeon RX 7600 reference design, it tames the peak GPU hotspot temperature more effectively too, maxing out at 84 degrees Celsius on the Pulse and 90 degrees on the reference model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, the Pulse runs exceptionally quiet, a focus of Sapphire&rsquo;s cooling design for the line. You&rsquo;ll barely (if ever) hear it even under load, and the card offers idle fan stop capabilities that stop the blades from spinning whatsoever if you aren&rsquo;t gaming or performing other GPU-intensive loads. The reference card is very quiet, too, but the Pulse does it while running cooler and faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"should-you-buy-the-sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7600\">Should you buy the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600?</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600\" class=\"wp-image-1929707\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sapphire-pulse-7600.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keith May/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable 1080p graphics card, this should absolutely be on your short list. The Radeon RX 7600 is the first low-cost GPU launch worth praising in <em>years</em>, and the Sapphire Pulse runs faster, cooler, and just as silent as AMD&rsquo;s reference card, all for the same wallet-friendly $269 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a testament to Sapphire&rsquo;s strict &ldquo;no-frills, just great gaming&rdquo; approach to the Pulse lineup, which proves especially welcome here in the budget segment. Modern AV1 encoding is a delectable cherry on top for streamers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t turn on ray tracing with the Radeon RX 7600, or buy it for 1440p gaming. Our much more detailed <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html\">original AMD Radeon RX 7600 review</a> breaks down why in exacting depth (along with suggesting potential alternatives if desired). But those aren&rsquo;t necessarily drawbacks in this mainstream price range. If you want to buy a modern graphics card that you can plop into your system and experience fast, high-fidelity 1080p gaming with minimal hassle&mdash;and without busting your bank account&mdash;the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 is well worth buying.</p>\n\nGaming, Graphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930244/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7600-review.html", "date_published": "2023-05-25 10:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Get this golf simulator for an extra 20% off for Memorial Day", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Memorial Day weekend is a great time to hit the links, but if you want to get some practice in ahead of time, you don&rsquo;t even have to head out to the driving range.
