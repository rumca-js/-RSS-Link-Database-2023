  <p id="dy24UA">YouTube on Thursday announced a big upgrade to its NFL Sunday Ticket offering: if you’re at home, you’ll now be able to watch unlimited simultaneous streams of NFL Sunday Ticket content across both YouTube and YouTube TV, <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1661851969689120768">according to a tweet</a>.</p>
<p id="XhJ7Dg">Previously, YouTube was going to limit NFL Sunday Ticket content to two screens maximum, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/13505074?hl=en">as detailed in a support article</a>. This change could mean that some houses will be watching a lot more football when the regular season rolls around in September — especially if they take advantage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/14/23638949/youtube-tv-multiview-early-access">YouTube TV’s new multiview feature</a>, which is set to be <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1656855324765085704">available with NFL Sunday Ticket</a>. If you’re not<em> </em>at home, the two-stream limit will still be in place, YouTube wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1661851974349000704">a follow-up tweet</a>. </p>

## The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season forecast is ‘near-normal’ — but there’s a wild card

  <p id="zxvS4m">After a few years of heightened risk, the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to look pretty average for 2023. That’s thanks to an unusually long-lasting weather pattern called La Niña finally ending, with its counterpart, El Niño, expected to soon develop. The caveat is that there’s more uncertainty in this year’s seasonal forecast than normal because of unusually warm temperatures in the Atlantic. </p>
<p id="vSs34X">Those factors tend to have opposite effects on hurricane season. El Niño generally ushers in milder storms in the Atlantic. But warmer waters provide more fuel for tropical storms to strengthen. So we’ll have to wait and see how these competing forces influence this year’s season. </p>

  <p id="cI3cun">YouTube is getting rid of <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/217640760">Stories</a>, a feature for temporary posts, beginning in June. Users won’t be able to post Stories starting June 26th, and existing posts will expire after seven days. </p>
<p id="r2VBtM">Stories were first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/29/16716354/youtube-stories-reels-feature-announced">introduced</a> in 2017 under the name Reels and were available to users with over 10,000 subscribers. Similar to Instagram (which in turn lifted the concept from Snapchat), YouTube Stories disappeared after a set amount of time; creators could use Stories to post updates or behind-the-scenes content to promote their channel. But looking around today, it doesn’t seem to have caught on — access was limited, few creators seem to be regularly posting Stories, and the feature doesn’t get much promotion even from YouTube.</p>

  <p id="HvFdPU">It seems like the theme of this year in film might be “existential crisis.” Fresh off the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23671900/beau-is-afraid-review"><em>Beau Is Afraid</em></a> and a new trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735724/a24-problemista-trailer"><em>Problemista</em></a>, we have the latest clip of Greta Gerwig’s <em>Barbie</em> movie. It shows the main Barbie (Margot Robbie) planning for a trip to the real world, brought on by an existential crisis that started because she put her heels on the ground — literally. Before she leaves, though, she has to put on a gigantic bash. At one point during the party, she asks, “Do you guys ever think about dying?” Barbie has never been so relatable.</p>
<p id="kK9jfd">As a reminder, the <em>Barbie</em> movie has a gigantic cast that also includes:</p>

<p id="qjKhmC">The most interesting feature in Labs is the Search Generative Experience, which puts an AI-generated summary at the top of search results across Google.

Snap is adding an AR filter featuring a handful of OPI colors as part of the partnership.</p>

  <p id="zPsoDF">In many ways, remaking <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> is an obvious choice. The game is a near-universally beloved PS2 classic, one of the best stealth action games of all time, and is filled with iconic moments and set pieces. And the remake — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735626/playstation-showcase-metal-gear-solid-3-delta-snake-eater-remake">titled <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a> — is being announced at a time when audiences and critics alike have ample appetite for revisiting gaming’s past. Several of this year’s biggest and most critically acclaimed releases have been remakes and remasters, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review"><em>Dead Space</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime</em></a>. </p>
<p id="6CfHtK">Remaking <em>MGS3</em> feels uniquely challenging, however, because of how inseparable the <em>Metal Gear</em> games are from series creator Hideo Kojima, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/19/8258855/metal-gear-solid-hideo-kojima-leaving-konami-rumor">parted ways with Konami</a> in...</p>

  <p id="OjD8BL">TikTok is testing an AI chatbot called Tako that can recommend videos based on what people ask it, according to screenshots of the feature shared with <em>The Verge</em>. </p>
<p id="OogtUJ">If TikTok ends up releasing it widely, the chatbot could “radically change search and navigation” in the app, according to Daniel Buchuk of Watchful Technologies, a firm that spots these kinds of upcoming app changes for Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p id="W5mSkb">In screenshots of the test that Buchuk shared with <em>The Verge</em>, Tako sits above the TikTok profile icon to the right of a video. Tapping it opens up a chat screen, where the bot appears capable of answering a wide range of queries. It’s unclear what AI model TikTok is using to power Tako.</p>

  <p id="UAIpAo">If you use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462235/arc-web-browser-review">the Arc browser</a>, you’re about to get the power to redesign the internet. Kind of. Arc, the popular new browser from The Browser Company, is releasing an updated version of <a href="https://arc.net/boosts">its Boosts feature</a> that lets you control everything from the color to the layout of every website you visit. </p>
<p id="kD6DuE">Basically, Boosts has two features. You can use it to change the colors and fonts on a page, or you can use it to hide any given part of the page. (You can also write CSS and JavaScript, so technically the sky’s the limit, but that requires more coding knowledge.) Want to force a website to have a dark mode? Easy. Want to make an article’s text bigger so you can actually, you know, see it? Done. </p>

The Q3 is the latest version of the German manufacturer’s fixed-lens full-frame compact camera, and in addition to matching the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22879207/leica-m11-rangefinder-camera-news-announcement-features-price">M11</a> at 60 megapixels, it offers an updated electronic viewfinder, 8K video, a new hybrid autofocus system, Qi-compatible wireless charging support via an optional handgrip, and — yes finally — a flip-and-tilt articulating LCD.
