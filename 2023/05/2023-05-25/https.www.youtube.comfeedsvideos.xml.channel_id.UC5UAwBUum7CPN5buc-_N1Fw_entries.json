And to manage that, you have the VanillaOS control center.\n\nYou can add an Arch subsystem to get access to the AUR, a Fedora subsystem with DNF as the package manager, you get an OpenSUSE container, plus a VOid Linux one, and one for Alpine. Or you can create your own with any other distro you want.\n\nAPX is VanillaOS all in one package manager. It lets you install applications for any source that you have access to, including all your distro containers.\n\nThe syntax is pretty easy: you just type apx install, followed by the package manager that will perform the actual install, and the package name.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to install davinci Resolve from the AUR, I could type:\n\napx install --aur davinci-resolve\n\nAnd APX will automatically start my Arch container, and use the arch package manager to install Davinci Resolve from the AUR.\n\nAnd on top of that, apps installed this way will still show up in your GNOME overview and app grid, just like if they were installed on the base system itself.\n\nAnd, if you absolutely need to install something to the base system, you can, there's a preinstalled tool called ABRoot, that lets you execute a command, like running apt, since the system is Ubuntu based.\n\nNow for updates, Vanilla OS is not a rolling release, it has fixed releases that follow the Ubuntu release convention. \n\nFlatpaks you installed through GNOME software or the command line will be updated through the same methods. System updates are handled by VSO, for Vanilla System Operator.\n\nThis does mean you'll need more disk space: at least 50 gigs to install the system, and the root partition you don't use. Containers and applications installed in them can be updated by running apx update in a terminal.\n\nBut there are issues: as I mentioned, if you need more software from multiple sources, then you need multiple containers. This takes up a lot of space. And if your container dies, so do all your installed applications, and related user data.\n\nThe second problem is the disk space usage of the main system: sure having 2 root partitions is great for stability, but it also consumes a LOT of disk space you'll never use.\n\nI also noticed that apps installed from containers sometimes don't show up in the GNOME app grid, and you have to run an APX command to actually add them.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOm_zATjgqU", "date_published": "2023-05-25 15:55:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
