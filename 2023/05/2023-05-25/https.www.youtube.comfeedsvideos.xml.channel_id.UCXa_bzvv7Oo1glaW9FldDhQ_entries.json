Sony and Insomniac Games chose the upcoming\u00a0Marvel's Spider-Man 2\u00a0to be the show's closer, offering up a meaty, excellent gameplay debut for the highly anticipated superhero sequel. \n\nPlenty was revealed, both in the gameplay demonstration as well as a PlayStation Blog article that was published shortly afterward, and here, we're going to parse through all the key details that you should know about.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvniOgkqg80", "date_published": "2023-05-25 18:30:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Platforming fans can enjoy the game\u2019s challenges. While stealth is naturally a part of the gameplay loop, it\u2019s certainly no Splinter Cell.

With average by-the-books platforming and stealth gameplay, there actually is a thoughtful and engaging story at the heart of Gollum. It\u2019s up to fans of the genre to decide whether time spent on ordinary gameplay is worth experiencing Gollum\u2019s history.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ_qQtWsr_E", "date_published": "2023-05-25 15:30:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 Things To Know BEFORE YOU BUY Diablo 4", "description": "Even after its BlizzCon 2019 announcement, Diablo 4 didn't seem like it was really happening.
