<p>Breillat’s remake of Queen of Hearts rather pointlessly draws the sting from a mother’s affair with her teenage stepson</p><p>Catherine Breillat has made a hot – or rather tepid – mess of this remake of the very recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/03/queen-of-hearts-review-may-el-toukhy-trine-dyrholm">Danish erotic thriller Queen of Hearts</a>, and it’s not immediately clear why exactly she felt she needed to direct her own moderate version. The changes amount to smudging the original’s icy Scandi sheen, decreasing its erotic excitement, making the performances more laboured and thus leaving the story’s essential preposterousness dangerously exposed.</p><p>The first film, from writer-director May el-Toukhy, featured Trine Dyrholm as an elegant career lawyer specialising in representing rape victims who has a passionate affair with her teen stepson; that is, her husband’s moody son by his first marriage. Now the action is transplanted from chilly Denmark to sunny, summery France and Léa Drucker plays legal high-flyer Anne, married to wealthy but dull businessman Pierre (Olivier Rabourdin), with two adorable adopted twin girls. She has a sister, Mina (Clotilde Courau), who lives locally, has a less glamorous and successful life and is affectionately yet shrewdly unimpressed by Anne’s pretensions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/last-summer-review-catherine-breillat-lea-drucker-samuel-kircher">Continue reading...</a>

## Goodbye to Succession, the defining show of the Trump era

<p>As the finale looms, the darkly comedic drama about pettiness and politics stands as a brilliantly warped mirror of what Americans have suffered through since 2016</p><p>A fact I think about often when I watch Succession, perhaps the defining fact of the HBO series, is that its first full-cast table read was on 8 November 2016, AKA election day. The run-through ended with a party at executive producer Adam McKay’s house that was supposed to celebrate the victory of Hillary Clinton. It didn’t work out that way. Sarah Snook, who plays Shiv, the psychically bruised, acid-tongued youngest daughter of media titan Logan Roy, later <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/how-hbos-succession-became-perfect-show-trump-age-1227997/">recalled</a> that McKay said: “Well, we’re making the right show.” Series creator Jesse Armstrong <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/30/the-real-ceo-of-succession">remembered</a> the election call for Trump as “such a shock – then five, 10 minutes later, everyone’s living in a new reality”.</p><p>Over six years and four seasons, Succession has been, for me and for many viewers, the right show for the moment, a way to process and inhabit that new reality. No other show, I would argue no other cultural product, was better suited to reflect, fillet, riff and even at times anticipate the toxic cartoon rollercoaster of the Trump presidency than a series about a fragile media conglomerate family with more than a few similarities to the Murdochs. In the way that Hamilton immediately conjures the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22641501/hamilton-parks-rec-harry-potter-cringe-obama-era-pop-culture">sunny earnestness of the Obama years</a>, or Arrested Development <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/arrested-development-politics-bush-iraq-war-wmd/">spoofed the silly incompetence of the Bush presidency</a>, or Bo Burnham’s Inside will be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jun/15/bo-burnham-inside-netflix-special-comedy">only thing I ever watch to remember the pandemic</a>, Succession is not only inextricable from its national context but emblematic of its atmosphere. When the show concludes this Sunday, it’s the end of a Prestige TV era. And it’s also goodbye to our most incisive, eviscerating and brilliantly warped mirror of the Trump years. (Of course, you could argue that Trump’s era never fully ended — he’s the current Republican frontrunner for 2024.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/succession-series-finale-hbo-trump-fox">Continue reading...</a>

It had fallen back almost to Brown-era levels when Boris Johnson succeeded Theresa May, and while he went into an election casually promising that overall numbers would fall, May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, disclosed this week that ministers were told not to repeat that pledge since their laid-back new leader didn’t actually believe in it.</p><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/tories-proud-britains-migration-numbers-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From October UK gas and electricity consumers will be paying £10 more to suppliers – a £56m earnings boost for Centrica</p><p>And the big winner from Ofgem’s latest price cap announcement is … British Gas. Shares in the parent company, Centrica, popped to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board for an understandable reason. While <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/25/britain-energy-price-cap-fall-ofgem-gas-electricity-bills">the cost of energy is indeed falling</a>, the slice of the bill that is allocated for suppliers’ profits is going up – and increasing substantially in percentage terms. From October, we’ll all be paying, on average, £47 instead of £37 to our suppliers in the hope that fewer of them go bust.</p><p>A tenner may sound modest in the context of a price cap of £2,074 from July, but crunch the numbers to see the effect on British Gas, a company with about a fifth of an overall retail energy market of 28 million customers. An extra £10 per account equates to an additional £56m of earnings if nothing else changes – a very nice uplift from last year’s profits of £72m.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/may/25/british-gas-wins-as-ofgem-hits-consumers-with-an-extra-tenner">Continue reading...</a>

A choice between doing the Today programme and Sky News, or a 20 minute stint on This Morning, on the day your government yet again misses its immigration targets. Though judging by how uncomfortable Rishi Sunak looked on the ITV sofa, maybe even that was a step too far for the prime minister. He just doesn’t have the homey, man of the people vibes. Principally because he isn’t. Rish! oozes privilege out of every pore. The country merely a Goldman Sachs case study.</p><p>“It’s great to be here,” said Sunak, looking like he couldn’t wait to head for the exit. As if he had realised that even the soft format could soon become rather uncomfortable. Alison Hammond may be a stand-in for Holly Willoughby and Craig Doyle may be a stand-in for a stand-in – Dermot O’Leary, the replacement for Phillip Schofield, was off celebrating his 50<sup>th</sup> birthday – but neither of them are mugs.

<p><strong>Andy Wong</strong> wonders where disaffected young people will turn, while <strong>James Calhoun </strong>suggests a scheme in Spain that aims to help renters. Plus letters from <strong>Kate Macintosh </strong>and <strong>Dan Rainey</strong></p><p>John Harris’s article struck me deeply, as someone who is turning 30 in July (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/generation-living-parents-tory-housebuilding-young-adults" title="">A lost generation are stuck living with their parents – and Tory talk of housebuilding won’t help them, 22 May</a>). What he says about the political class as a whole neglecting the aspirations and concerns of under-30s in society is not a uniquely British phenomenon, and unfortunately seems to be increasingly entrenched in many advanced societies around the world with rapidly ageing populations.</p><p>It seems to me that we’ve come a long way from a leadership – and even societal – mentality of building a better future for our descendant generations, even if it’s one that we will possibly never see in our lifetimes. How much of this is the cynical political calculations of the establishment appealing to the biggest ageing demographic in the voting population, or political disengagement and disillusionment from the younger generation of voting adults is moot – one feeds into the other in a cyclical pattern.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/25/politicians-are-still-failing-young-voters-on-housing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I would heartily recommend hosting families if you have the room and can afford it, says a reader</p><p>Colleen Molloy (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/lets-use-our-spare-rooms-to-help-homeless-refugees" title="">Letters, 22 May</a>) suggests that all those with spare rooms can help the homeless by inviting them to stay. I strongly concur. We first did this in 1973, when we welcomed a family of three Uganda Asians to live with us. It was one of the richest experiences of our lives, and we are still in touch with the family. The daughter, then a disoriented teenager whom we were able to get back on her feet and into education, has just retired as a consultant anaesthetist. Since then, we have welcomed a family of three from Iran, and others from Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Nigeria and elsewhere.</p><p>They have all been genuine asylum seekers, sent to us via the Red Cross and a local asylum seeker hub. The Iranian family has now obtained refugee status, the son is at university and the father is in work and self-supporting. A fourth person’s claim is well under way – she has valid grounds to remain. All were destitute when we welcomed them into our home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/25/welcoming-refugees-into-our-home-has-enriched-our-lives">Continue reading...</a>

## Britten Sinfonia review – immaculate playing illuminates a programme that takes us back to 1953

<p><strong>Milton Court, London</strong><br />Works by Tippett, Walton and Maconchy underlined the UK’s fertile musical life at the time of the last Coronation, while a new Joseph Phibbs piece was worthy company</p><p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/07/standards-and-premieres-galore-as-music-takes-centre-stage-at-coronation">the ragbag of new pieces composed for the coronation</a> earlier this month, it was good to be reminded of some of the music that was written in Britain 70 years ago, at the time of the coronation of Elizabeth II. The Britten Sinfonia’s concert included three works for string orchestra that were premiered or composed in 1953. Strictly speaking, only one of the three was directly connected to the royal celebrations – the fugal finale that William Walton contributed to the collective Variations on an Elizabethan Theme that six British composers (all male) were invited to write for the Aldeburgh festival that year. Brief and extrovert, here it provided a last athletic workout for the 30-strong sinfonia, whose playing, with leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/26/thomas-gould-chamber-music-jazz-variety-spice-of-life">Thomas Gould</a> directing from the violin, had been immaculate throughout.</p><p>But the other works from 1953 were far more substantial, and among their composers’ finest achievements. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/23/michael-tippett-the-midsummer-marriage-edward-gardner">Michael Tippett</a>’s Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, preceded here by the Corelli concerto grosso from which its themes were sourced, and with Gould, violinist Miranda Dale and cellist Caroline Dearnley as the concertino group in both, sounded as radiantly ecstatic as one remembered, even if the warmth of the Milton Court acoustic was a bit too much of a good thing when it came to separating out some of the denser contrapuntal passages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/britten-sinfonia-review-milton-court-thomas-gould">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bittersweet tale of an apparently contented toilet cleaner has an ambient urban charm, but feels a little too understated </p><p>Wim Wenders’s new film, co-scripted by him with writer-director Takuma Takasaki, is a bittersweet quirky-Zen character study set in Tokyo which only comes fully to life in the final extended shot of the hero’s face, drifting back and forth between happiness and sadness. There are some lovely magic-hour scenes from cinematographer Franz Lustig, shooting in the boxy “Academy” frame.</p><p>Hirayama, played by Koji Yakusho (from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/01/guardianobituaries.film">Shohei Imamura</a>’s The Eel) is a middle-aged man employed as a toilet cleaner, who drives around serenely from job to job in his van, listening to classic rock and pop on old-school audio cassettes: Patti Smith, the Kinks and of course, given the title, Lou Reed. At each location, he changes into a jumpsuit and with his brushes and mop matter-of-factly gets on with the job in hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/perfect-days-review-wim-wenders-tokyo-toilet-cleaner">Continue reading...</a>

Influential avant-garde film-maker and author of the salacious book Hollywood Babylon<p>Lucifer played an important part in the life of the avant-garde film director and author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/10/kenneth-anger-interview" title="">Kenneth Anger</a>, who has died aged 96. From his late teens he was attracted by the practices and philosophies of the occultist guru <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/10/society" title="">Aleister Crowley</a>, of whom he became a passionate disciple. Like Crowley, Anger, who was one of the first openly gay film-makers in the US, lived by the philosophy of Thelema, a set of beliefs based on the rule “Do what thou wilt”, which included “sex magick”. “Lucifer has appeared in all my films,” Anger once explained. “Sometimes he’s not labelled as such but there’s always a figure or a moment in my films to communicate what I call my ‘Lucifer moment’.”</p><p>At least two of his films of what became the Magick Lantern Cycle – nine shorts made between 1947 and 1972 – testify to this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyWkcB-K9TI" title="">Invocation of My Demon Brother</a> (1969) and Lucifer Rising (1972). Anger described the former 11-minute short as “the shadowing forth of our lord Lucifer as the powers of darkness gather at a midnight mass”. A homage to Crowley, it rejects narrative, using dynamic montage to Mick Jagger’s Moog synthesiser soundtrack. Anger himself plays a magus, while the musician Bobby Beausoleil is Lucifer, who appears at the climax. In between are shots of an occult ritual, a Rolling Stones concert and GIs leaping from helicopters in Vietnam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/kenneth-anger-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Since then I’ve mostly avoided penetration. </strong><strong>However, I’ve realised recently </strong><strong>(after being intimate with my boyfriend) that the problem is not physical but psychological</strong><strong>. In the past, I was shamed for wanting tampons by my </strong><strong>mum, so I didn’t attempt to use one until I was older</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>I want to move past this problem</strong><strong>, but I don’t know where to start and I am so scared.</strong></p><p>Everything you are dealing with is treatable, so be hopeful!

He told the BBC:</p><p>I don’t think that’s unrealistic; that’s the sort of figure there was in the 1990s and I think we should see that again.</p><p>… with us, our borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. No ifs. No buts. That’s a promise we made to the British people. And it’s a promise we are keeping.</p><p>Our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands. That ambition remains the right one.</p><p>At the moment we are stuck in the EU so it [the immigration policy] is not possible, but post-23 June that option will be on the table. What we want to do is take back control over immigration and have more fairness over the way it is done.</p><p>We do want to bring net migration down to sustainable levels.

## Randall Goosby: Bruch and Price Violin Concertos review – Florence Price has her ideal champion

<p><strong>Goosby/Philadelphia Orchestra/Nézet-Séguin<br />(Decca)<br /></strong>Goosby and Nézet-Séguin bring Price’s storytelling to life and embrace the romance of Bruch</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/19/their-music-lit-a-fire-in-me-florence-price-margaret-bonds-kapralova-samantha-ege-">Florence Price’s star</a> continues to rise. Her two violin concertos were rediscovered among piles of old papers in 2009, when renovators entered her old Illinois summer house more than half a century after her death. Now they find an ideal champion in the US violinist Randall Goosby, whose recording of them follows on from his 2021 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/24/randall-goosby-roots-review-suave-sounds-with-no-fuss-but-plenty-of-style">Roots</a>, exploring music associated with Black America. Together with the Philadelphia Orchestra and conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, he presents Price’s concertos alongside an appealingly unhackneyed performance of Bruch’s blockbuster Concerto No 1, his playing full of old-school warmth and breadth but never schmaltzy. In the Bruch, he and Nézet-Séguin resist many temptations to milk the bits you’d expect, and yet the performance has plenty of romance.</p><p>Price’s first concerto dates from 1939, and there is no record of any performance in her lifetime. The first solo violin entry has echoes of the same moment in the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, and that work – the most sprawling of the romantic warhorse concertos – could be seen more generally as the model for Price’s, which luxuriates in good tunes more than it seeks to wrangle with matters of musical tension and resolution. Overall it’s as if the Gershwin of Porgy and Bess met the Richard Strauss of Ein Heldenleben and Till Eulenspiegel. The first movement especially has a storytelling feel, with some extended orchestral interludes that wouldn’t be out of place covering scene changes; the second is bluesy, the third a short study of knotty perpetual motion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/randall-goosby-yannick-nezet-seguin-max-bruch-and-florence-price-violin-concertos-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new experimental game demo full of sophisticated AI characters has some game writers worried about their jobs. Is AI really going to improve games, or the games industry?</p><p>Corny dialogue has been part of video games almost since they have existed. From 1989’s Zero Wing spawning the decades old “All your base are belong to us” internet meme, to the clunky translations of the pre-remake Resident Evil games (“the master of unlocking”), to Skyrim’s infamous adventurer who once <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/article/6KNyeH7wG4FOFIEev8VaX1/how-an-arrow-in-the-knee-made-its-way-to-skyrim">took an arrow to the knee</a> and never shuts up about it, non-playable character (NPC) dialogue has rarely been exactly Shakespearean, and the frequent repetition doesn’t help. But could AI tools change that, enabling a world full of characters that respond believably when you talk to them?</p><p>In collaboration with Google, a team of researchers from Stanford have <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">built a game demo called Smallville</a> that integrates the AI writing tool ChatGPT. Instead of just walking into walls and setting themselves on fire like the classic Sims characters we all knew and loved, the game’s 25 characters can instead comfortably discuss topics such as local politics and composing music, pulling from ChatGPT’s enormous database.</p><p>In about a year and a half, we could see this type of technology being used in smaller indie games, with wider adoption coming in about five years</p><p>It always sounds like the dawn of a new age, but tends to end up being disruptive and demoralising</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/25/could-ai-write-super-intelligent-video-game-characters-stanford-smallville">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Matador)</strong><br />Across seven years and several albums this band has been evolving its scattershot sonic collage, and here it feels like they’ve finally found their sound</p><p>We live in an environment that encourages rock and pop artists to make an immediate splash, to cut through the digital noise and the plethora of musicians jostling for attention on streaming services by appearing fully formed, as exciting on arrival as they’re ever going to be: in a world where tens of thousands of new tracks are uploaded every day, you’d better stand out straight away. Carving out the space to evolve or develop isn’t easy, so it’s impressive when you encounter a band that has managed it.</p><p>Which brings us to Brooklyn-based duo Water From Your Eyes. The duo, Rachel Brown and Nate Amos, started out as nothing special. Their 2017 debut, Long Days No Dreams, covered so many modish US indie bases – bedroom synth-pop, offbeat post-punk and distorted digital noise, shoegazey textures, introverted acoustic balladry and what Americans persist in calling tweepop – it might as well have been called 6.9 From Pitchfork: fine if you like that sort of thing, but there really was more than enough of that sort of thing already available.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/water-from-your-eyes-everyones-crushed-review-nate-amos-rachel-brown">Continue reading...</a>

This can work.’”</p><p>Despite no design training and just a brief history as a model/muse for the storied Italian fashion house, Dua Lipa is the latest pop star to try her hand at designing a collection in what has become the era of the musician turned designer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/dua-lipa-designs-first-collection-for-versace">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Florida governor’s campaign gets off to shaky start after launch was marred by glitches</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>’s presidential campaign kickoff descended into farce on Wednesday evening, after the Florida governor opted to make the bid official with an announcement on Twitter’s Spaces audio streaming feature. But there’s a reason White House aspirants usually unveil such things in speeches to cheering crowds, rather than with appearances on social networks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/spike-in-twitter-outages-since-musk-takeover-hint-at-more-systemic-problems">known lately for their unreliability</a>: the former are much harder to mess up. And that’s exactly what happened on Twitter, with DeSantis silenced for minutes while the website’s employees could be heard trying to fix whatever was wrong with Spaces, before they restarted the event and many listeners went elsewhere. So we can say his campaign launch didn’t go well, and the Twitter debacle will be fodder for talk shows and rival candidates for weeks, if not months, to come. DeSantis’s ultimate objective nonetheless remains the same: He still needs to close the big gap in Republican voter support between him and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> if he ever wants to appear on the same ballot as <strong>Joe Biden</strong>.</p><p>Here’s what else is going on today:</p><p><strong>Debt ceiling negotiations</strong> are ongoing in between Republicans in the House of Representatives and the White House. The first days of June remain the estimated deadline for a deal to be reached to avoid a catastrophic default. There’s been no breakthrough yet, but we’ll let you know if one is at hand.</p><p><strong>Today is the third anniversary of George Floyd’s death</strong>, and Biden has issued a statement asking Americans to “build on the progress we have made thus far and recommit to the work we must continue to do every day to change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies.”</p><p><strong>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre</strong> will brief reporters at 1pm eastern time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/may/25/desantis-twitter-trump-2024-debt-ceiling-deadline-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With her commanding stage presence and astonishingly powerful voice, unbowed even in the face of abuse, Turner lit up every phase of 20th century pop</p><p>There is a great photograph of Tina Turner, taken for Vogue by Jack Robinson in 1969, the year she and her husband, Ike, supported the Rolling Stones on their US tour. It appears to show Tina in full flight; the contact sheets from the shoot suggest Robinson had encouraged her to dance and sing in the studio as she would on stage. Her face is at the photograph’s bottom-right corner, as if he had only just managed to catch her in shot. Her mouth is wide open, her face contorted, eyes raised to the ceiling, hair flying upwards.</p><p>It’s a great photograph because it manages to look like Tina sounded in 1969. Listen to the Ike and Tina Turner songs recorded at Madison Square Garden in November of that year (belatedly issued on a 40th-anniversary edition of the celebrated Rolling Stones live album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/26/the-rolling-stones-get-your-ya-yas-out">Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out</a>). The duo pile through one cover version after another at breathless speed: Creedence Clearwater Revival’s Proud Mary, a frantic Land of a Thousand Dances, a take on Come Together during which Tina finds a crackling sexual energy in the song that is absent from the Beatles’ original.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/through-pain-and-joy-tina-turner-wrote-herself-into-pop-history-again-and-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Exuberant midfielder hopes to become the first player to represent the same club from non-league to Premier League</p><p>It is Tuesday afternoon and an hour or so after training Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, wearing white crocs studded with Super Mario, Superman and Batman charms, walks into the Eric Morecambe Lounge at Kenilworth Road, Luton Town’s creaking but charismatic ground. The room – home to trophy cabinets, photos of comedy nights here and a panoramic mural with a timeline celebrating the club’s storied past – has an orange glow and Mpanzu a beaming smile as he embraces John Still, the manager who brought him to the club a decade ago, when Luton were toiling in non-league.</p><p>A teenage Mpanzu initially joined on loan from West Ham, making his debut at Staines Town in the FA Trophy in front of a crowd of 621, before Luton paid £50,000 to make the move permanent. Those who know Mpanzu talk of a laid-back character with a contagious personality and he is calmness personified in the buildup to the Championship playoff final, the most lucrative one-off game in the world. The 29-year-old grew up in Hendon, north London, and could spy Wembley from his back garden. He remembers the iconic arch lighting up in the distance. “I’ve been chilled, I’ve been myself,” he says of the buildup this week. “There is no need to be nervous because we know what we can do on the pitch against Coventry. We’ve gone about our days the same as we have the whole season.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/25/pelly-ruddock-mpanzu-luton-non-league-to-playoff-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A revealing memoir illuminates the conflict between wordly success and creative freedom</p><p>For someone who didn’t grow up in a bookish family, let alone a poetic one, the young Andrew Motion lost no time in making up for his lack of connections. Hurtling back from a sixth-form pilgrimage to Rupert Brooke’s grave in Skyros, Motion is delighted to discover that the war poet’s literary executor, Geoffrey Keynes (brother of John Maynard), lives down the road from him in rural Essex. No sooner has the teenager got himself set up with regular invitations to discuss Brooke than Keynes is ogling his body and giving him whiskery kisses.</p><p>Up at Oxford and having burnished his fledgling career with the Newdigate prize for poetry, Motion has regular meetings with an ancient but still priapic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden">WH Auden</a> who is eking out his last days at Christ Church. It’s not long before Auden is asking Andrew leeringly what he’d like – which Motion pretends not to understand and requests a martini. Then it’s off to his first job as a lecturer at the University of Hull to try to meet Philip Larkin, the librarian, whose verse comes closest to what the young poet is trying to do himself. There is no lechery this time – Larkin only has eyes for the women he enjoys playing off against each other – but within weeks Motion is going round to Larkin’s squalid home and getting himself appointed as one of his literary executors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/25/sleeping-on-islands-by-andrew-motion-review-candid-stories-from-the-former-poet-laureate">Continue reading...</a>

## The Resurrection of Charles Manson review – evil-hippy horror looks for chills in desert

<p>This film isn’t really about Charles Manson, and it’s a total mess, but there’s fun to be found in its ragged, plothole-filled thrills</p><p>This shambolic but not entirely uninteresting low-budget horror flick clearly aims to cash in on the continuing public fascination with 1960s cult leader Charles Manson, who died in prison in 2017. However, it barely engages with Manson or the stories around his so-called “family” of followers, or what is significant, in cultural terms, about the murders they committed in Hollywood in 1969. Manson’s name here is little more than a boogieman – like Satan, or Hitler, or Freddie – to establish a creepy tone for a story about evil hippies with malign intent. This is not to suggest that the film would have been better if it had been more Manson-y, just that it is a missed opportunity to add more texture.</p><p>The first act introduces us to a good-looking, white-skinned, shiny-haired Los Angeles-based couple who are obviously headed for a bad time, in classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre style. Tianna (Katherine Hughes, pretty good despite the material) is an aspiring actor up for a role in a film about Manson. Her partner Mitch (Josh Plasse) offers to film an audition tape for her in the desert, and is secretly planning to propose. The two are a relatively new thing, having met at a support group for grief; Tianna’s fiance died from cancer, and Mitch lost a parent. They arrive in a remote but lushly appointed Airbnb house, but something doesn’t feel right. Mitch keeps seeing a circle that suggests an ouroboros – a snake eating its own tail – scratched into the soil near the front door, a symbol that also appears branded into the skin of a super-skeevy gas station attendant (Will Peltz) he keeps running into. It also seems as if someone is walking on the roof, or watching through a window as they make love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/the-resurrection-of-charles-manson-review-evil-hippy-horror-looks-for-chills-in-desert">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A brother and sister leave Latvia for Liverpool in this impressive family epic, an intimate history of Jewish assimilation</p><p>“In the olden times, in the old country of Latvia, a girl walks out of the city into the forest to gather mushrooms in a basket, like a child in a fairytale.” So begins Linda Grant’s absorbing ninth novel, The Story of the Forest. The year is 1913, the mushroom-gathering girl 14-year-old Mina Mendel, daughter of a prosperous Jewish flour merchant in Riga, who happens while walking to stumble upon a clandestine meeting of Bolshevik boys. They are singing. One of them asks her to dance. Exultant, a little afraid, Mina “felt something dislodge in her, the mechanism that was winding her down like a cheap clock to early marriage and a replica of her mother’s pale floury form”. Change is duly set in motion. When Mina summons the courage to return to the forest, her scheming younger brother, Itzik, follows and witnesses her first, chaste kiss. Gleefully, he reports the news back to their eldest brother, Jossel. Afraid that his father will hear of it and hustle the spirited Mina into a respectably miserable marriage, anxious himself to escape the stifling predictabilities of his father’s business, Jossel suggests that they emigrate to America.</p><p>Folk tales, as Grant points out, begin with a journey. This particular journey takes Mina and Jossel as far as England, where first lack of funds and then the outbreak of war prevent the onward crossing to New York. Instead, they settle in Liverpool. Left behind in Riga, their parents and three siblings must endure in their different ways the agonies of “the great wound of the 20th century”, but, safe in the Jewish community of Brownlow Hill, Mina’s closest brush with the Bolshevist idealism of the boys in the forest is working in the cafeteria of a munitions factory during the “Great War”. Meanwhile, Jossel is sent to the eastern front where he, too, acquires a story that will be polished up and passed down the generations: he saves the life of a fellow soldier, a Polish Jew who later becomes Mina’s husband.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/25/the-story-of-the-forest-by-linda-grant-review-20th-century-journeys">Continue reading...</a>

## To Catch a Killer review – Shailene Woodley sniper thriller like mid-season CSI

<p>This flat-footed serial-killer hunt, co-starring Ben Mendelsohn, is full of underwritten cops who seem to have no real idea what they’re doing</p><p>Shailene Woodley (Big Little Lies, Divergent) stars as Eleanor Falco, a young Baltimore beat cop who seems unhappy both at home and at work. There’s no time to dig any deeper into the cause of Officer Falco’s malaise, however, before she – and we – are plunged into the action of a paint-by-numbers police thriller. There’s a sniper on the loose, picking off victims at random in the downtown area, and maverick FBI investigator Geoffrey Lammark (Ben Mendelsohn) has been drafted in to put a stop to the killing.</p><p>Lammark believes he recognises a fellow profiling savant in Falco, so she’s fast-tracked into his unit, despite her lack of training. Could Lammark be mistaking portentous wildlife analogies for actual insight? He does seem overly impressed when she says stuff like, “Evil is cutting off a bird’s wings just to see what happens; this guy’s shooting mosquitos.” But then Lammark’s own detective skills are apparently limited to enigmatic growling and looking good in a trench coat, so the bar is low. There’s also a third team member, played by Babylon’s Jovan Adepo, but even by the standards of a script that generally skates over characterisation, he’s too underwritten to warrant much attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/to-catch-a-killer-review-shailene-woodley-sniper-thriller-like-mid-season-csi">Continue reading...</a>

## Close Your Eyes review – Victor Erice returns with enigmatic tale of disappeared actor

<p>The Spirit of the Beehive director’s first feature in 30 years uses a film-within-a-film structure to ruminate on memory, ageing and cinema itself</p><p>82-year-old Spanish director Víctor Erice had previously released a total of three feature films: his classic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1047414,00.html">The Spirit of the Beehive</a> in 1973, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/victor-erice-el-sur">The South</a> in 1983 and The Quince Tree Sun in 1992. Now here is Close Your Eyes, co-written by Erice and Michel Gaztambide, whose title could be taken to indicate a farewell. We can only hope not. It is a mysterious, digressive, long and baggily constructed film possessed of a distinctive richness and humanity, all about the balance between memory and forgetting which we all negotiate as we come to the end of our lives. And it is also about cinema, which helps to promote memory and retrieve that which has vanished, even as it is itself in danger of being forgotten. Close Your Eyes could even be a wry comment on Erice’s own absence these 30 years.</p><p>We begin in the grounds of a secluded, handsome villa in France just after the second world war, occupied by a wealthy recluse who calls himself the “Sad King”. He is played by Josep Maria Pou, wearing a toque (like Hamm in Samuel Beckett’s Endgame) and attended by a fancifully imagined Chinese manservant. He receives a visitor, played by José Coronado, a Spanish leftist and anti-Francoist to whom the Sad King feels gratitude for the way he helped him during the war (the Sad King is Jewish). He offers his visitor a lucrative job to track down his half-Chinese daughter who has vanished from his life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/close-your-eyes-review-victor-erice-returns-with-enigmatic-tale-of-disappeared-actor">Continue reading...</a>

Now her granddaughter is curating the first UK show of an overlooked body of work</p><p>For the Swedish artist and designer Moki Cherry, there was no separation between life and work. As her motto went: “The stage as a home, and the home as a stage.”</p><p>In 1963, at the age of 20, she met the jazz musician Don Cherry, with whom she formed a decades-long domestic and creative partnership. Roving between Europe and the US, they developed a new approach to performance, taking concerts out of late-night jazz clubs and into galleries, schools and outdoor spaces. Moki, who trained as a fashion designer in Stockholm, produced album covers, costumes and tapestries that were used as environments for these events – all in her signature psychedelic style. The enterprise, which fused eastern and western cultural traditions, was branded “Organic Music Theatre”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/25/people-didnt-think-of-her-work-as-fine-art-revisiting-the-psychedelic-creations-of-moki-cherry">Continue reading...</a>

By trade and trickery, they attempt to pry Han loose from Jabba’s clutches, but all they succeed in doing is getting captured, one by one, and making the beast angrier. But rather than kill them outright, Jabba enslaves Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher, looking less comfortable than any human in history) and condemns the other to the Dunes, where they will be fed to a giant worm-like beast called the sarlacc.</p><p>“In his belly,” announces Jabba, “you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you will be digested over 1,000 years.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/return-of-the-jedi-at-40-star-wars-george-lucas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Susan Sontag’s mixed feelings towards the movement that propelled her career</p><p>Did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/susan-sontag">Susan Sontag</a> like women? I’m not so sure she did, which made the arrival of feminism in the early 1970s a complicated prospect. Should she get on board or scuttle the ship? I’m not talking about the private realm, of course. She liked, loved, lusted after and admired plenty of individual women. Although she declined to identify publicly as a lesbian, most of her sexual relationships were with women. But was membership of the second sex useful to the public project of Being Sontag? Judging from the evidence here, it was an ambivalent passport, sometimes flashed at the border and sometimes disparaged.</p><p>The essays that make up On Women are from the early 1970s, just as the second wave of feminism was breaking on the shores of New York. They weren’t originally published as a book, in the manner of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/against-interpretation-susan-sontag-100-best-nonfiction-books" title="">Against Interpretation</a>, the collection that established her reputation as a young avant-gardiste and intellectual force in 1966. Instead, they are wayside pronouncements from a jobbing writer whose high-low trajectory ran from the New York Review of Books to Vogue. Their appearance now is a posthumous creation that, the jacket reports, brings together Sontag’s “most fearless and incisive writing on women, a crucial aspect of her work that has not until now received the attention it deserves”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/25/on-women-by-susan-sontag-review-the-reluctant-feminist">Continue reading...</a>

You can learn about how barrels are made, get your face printed in the head of a pint and, at the end, have a drink in a bar with a 360-degree view of the city. But what stayed with me most was something I saw there by accident.</p><p>One of the exhibit rooms was closed off, but only partially. Curiosity got the better of me, and behind the door, I found a room that was empty but for a table. On the table, there were a handful of editions of the Guinness Book of Records. I hadn’t thought about this book since I was in primary school. Back then, the Guinness Book of Records meant a big, brightly coloured, hardback volume containing 500-odd pages of pictures of people doing things like growing their hair very long or juggling knives. These were books that children gleefully unwrapped on Christmas Day and argued over with their siblings. As I flicked through the old editions – 1994, 2005, 2012 – I thought about the connection between Guinness the stout and Guinness the book for the first time, as well as a hundred questions I hadn’t thought to ask as an eight-year-old marvelling at the man with the stretchiest skin or the most needles inserted into his head.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/25/guinness-world-records-norris-mcwhirter-ashrita-furman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Away from their restaurants, chefs improvise in extraordinary ways. Here are some of the killer combinations they wouldn’t dare put on their menus</p><p>Chefs are grazing animals, forever playing with ingredients, nibbling at leftovers and then, back home at 1am, trying to conjure a quick bite from whatever is there. In these moments of curiosity and urgency, bizarre snack habits are born. “People think we go home and have elaborate dinners, but give me some string cheese, chilli sauce, a Fab and a Stella and I’ll be happy,” says Jack Stein, the chef director at the Rick Stein group. At work, chefs are surrounded by the finest ingredients. At home, they frequently crave “simple things”, he says.</p><p>“You never think about your own fridge and what you’re going to feed yourself,” says Meriel Armitage, the founder of the Club Mexicana restaurants in London. So when chefs arrive home “really late and really hungry”, they improvise – in extraordinary ways. “I guess we’re confident in putting weird combos together that most people would be quite scared of,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/25/ice-cream-with-gherkins-mash-sandwiches-maltesers-in-wine-21-weird-snacks-loved-by-top-chefs">Continue reading...</a>
