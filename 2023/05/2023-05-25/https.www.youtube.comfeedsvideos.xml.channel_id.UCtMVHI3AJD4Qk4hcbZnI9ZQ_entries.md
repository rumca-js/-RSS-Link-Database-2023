Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at Nintendo and how they recently shut down their own store and decided when providing no legal options to just update their 3DS systems and lock out modders. For every bad thing in the world some good also happens and I'm proud to say a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is in the pipeline and I couldn't be happier! Thanks for watching!
