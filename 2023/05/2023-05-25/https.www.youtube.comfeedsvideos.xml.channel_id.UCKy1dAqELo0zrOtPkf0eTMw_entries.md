The Lord of the Rings: Gollum reviewed by Justin Koreis on PC, also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.

Why, of all the interesting characters in The Lord of the Rings lore, would anyone want to play an entire game as Gollum? Why would one trade the solid action of prior games in this universe, like Shadow of Mordor, for busywork, uninspired and frustrating platforming, and bad stealth? It’s not clear who this is for, or what it was intended to achieve. What is clear is that it’s not fun to play, and not something to recommend to any but the most curious and dedicated Lord of the Rings fan.

In Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin, which is set in the fantasy universe of Age of Sigmar, you will command four unique factions in dynamic real-time battles. The RTS game also features a story-driven single-player campaign, as well as the ability for you to compete in 1v1 and 2v2 cross-platform online multiplayer modes.

Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin is set in Ghur, the savage Realm of Beasts, an inhospitable, violent land where only the strongest survive. In the single-player campaign, the forces of Order dispatch the celestial, reforged champions known as the Stormcast Eternals to reclaim this realm. After establishing a precarious foothold in this dangerous place, their fortress settlement is under serious threat from the Kruleboyz, the sinister and violent Orruk faction who call Ghur their home. When this Stormcast detachment’s leader, Sigrun, learns about a source of arcane power that can protect against the Kruleboyz, they venture into the swamplands at great risk to obtain it – beginning the campaign’s twisted cinematic tale of desperate survival.

In today's Entertainment Fix:
The dreaded Netflix password sharing crackdown has finally arrived. Netflix will now start charging you for every person using your account that's not in your household. Subscribers now can setup different "profiles" for each extra person, complete with their own password, but it'll cost you $7.99 per add-on account. Will this get you to cancel your Netflux subscription? Let us know in the comments. In related Netflix news, the team behind The Witcher series are confident the show could've continued without Geralt. Henry Cavill has already announced plans to leave the show, but the producers have decided to recast the character with Liam Hemsworth taking over for Cavill. In other streaming news, HBO Max is now officially just MAX, but the changeover wasn't without its hiccups. And finally, you can own a piece of movie history via a prop auction. Up for bid are items like Princess Leia's A New Hope gown, Star-Lord's helmet, and that disgusting spider head alien from The Thing.
