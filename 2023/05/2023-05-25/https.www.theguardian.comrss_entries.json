politics stands as a brilliantly warped mirror of what Americans have suffered through since 2016</p><p>A fact I think about often when I watch Succession, perhaps the defining fact of the HBO series, is that its first full-cast table read was on 8 November 2016, AKA election day. The run-through ended with a party at executive producer Adam McKay\u2019s house that was supposed to celebrate the victory of Hillary Clinton. It didn\u2019t work out that way. Sarah Snook, who plays Shiv, the psychically bruised, acid-tongued youngest daughter of media titan Logan Roy, later <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/how-hbos-succession-became-perfect-show-trump-age-1227997/\">recalled</a> that McKay said: \u201cWell, we\u2019re making the right show.\u201d Series creator Jesse Armstrong <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/30/the-real-ceo-of-succession\">remembered</a> the election call for Trump as \u201csuch a shock \u2013 then five, 10 minutes later, everyone\u2019s living in a new reality\u201d.</p><p>Over six years and four seasons, Succession has been, for me and for many viewers, the right show for the moment, a way to process and inhabit that new reality. No other show, I would argue no other cultural product, was better suited to reflect, fillet, riff and even at times anticipate the toxic cartoon rollercoaster of the Trump presidency than a series about a fragile media conglomerate family with more than a few similarities to the Murdochs. In the way that Hamilton immediately conjures the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22641501/hamilton-parks-rec-harry-potter-cringe-obama-era-pop-culture\">sunny earnestness of the Obama years</a>, or Arrested Development <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/arrested-development-politics-bush-iraq-war-wmd/\">spoofed the silly incompetence of the Bush presidency</a>, or Bo Burnham\u2019s Inside will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jun/15/bo-burnham-inside-netflix-special-comedy\">only thing I ever watch to remember the pandemic</a>, Succession is not only inextricable from its national context but emblematic of its atmosphere. When the show concludes this Sunday, it\u2019s the end of a Prestige TV era. And it\u2019s also goodbye to our most incisive, eviscerating and brilliantly warped mirror of the Trump years. (Of course, you could argue that Trump\u2019s era never fully ended \u2014 he\u2019s the current Republican frontrunner for 2024.)</p> <a

The seven-time champion\u2019s contract with Mercedes ends this year but he dismissed the rumours as speculation.</p><p>Hamilton has persistently reiterated his intention of staying with the team, with whom he has won six championships. However, earlier this week it was reported that a Ferrari bid would potentially match his \u00a340m-a-year Mercedes salary and involve a swap with their driver Charles Leclerc moving to Mercedes. Speaking before this week\u2019s Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton rejected the story and confirmed he expected negotiations with Mercedes\u2019 principal, Toto Wolff, to conclude in a new deal shortly.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/25/lewis-hamilton-says-he-is-close-to-signing-new-mercedes-deal\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/25/lewis-hamilton-says-he-is-close-to-signing-new-mercedes-deal", "date_published": "2023-05-25 16:37:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Politicians are still failing  young voters on housing | Letters", "description": "<p><strong>Andy Wong</strong> wonders where disaffected young people will turn, while <strong>James Calhoun </strong>suggests a scheme in Spain that aims to help renters.

A homage to Crowley, it rejects narrative, using dynamic montage to Mick Jagger\u2019s Moog synthesiser soundtrack. Anger himself plays a magus, while the musician Bobby Beausoleil is Lucifer, who appears at the climax.

Her two violin concertos were rediscovered among piles of old papers in 2009, when renovators entered her old Illinois summer house more than half a century after her death.

The first movement especially has a storytelling feel, with some extended orchestral interludes that wouldn\u2019t be out of place covering scene changes; the second is bluesy, the third a short study of knotty perpetual motion.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/randall-goosby-yannick-nezet-seguin-max-bruch-and-florence-price-violin-concertos-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/25/randall-goosby-yannick-nezet-seguin-max-bruch-and-florence-price-violin-concertos-review", "date_published": "2023-05-25 14:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Toxins hidden in plastics are the industry\u2019s dirty secret \u2013 recycling is not the answer | Charlotte Lloyd", "description": "<p>We need to know more about what goes into plastics in the first place and better regulation of how recycled products are used</p><ul><li>Dr Charlotte Lloyd is a researcher in environmental chemistry at the University of Bristol</li></ul><p>Sometimes it feels like we are simply drowning in plastic.

The year is 1913, the mushroom-gathering girl 14-year-old Mina Mendel, daughter of a prosperous Jewish flour merchant in Riga, who happens while walking to stumble upon a clandestine meeting of Bolshevik boys. They are singing. One of them asks her to dance. Exultant, a little afraid, Mina \u201cfelt something dislodge in her, the mechanism that was winding her down like a cheap clock to early marriage and a replica of her mother\u2019s pale floury form\u201d. Change is duly set in motion. When Mina summons the courage to return to the forest, her scheming younger brother, Itzik, follows and witnesses her first, chaste kiss. Gleefully, he reports the news back to their eldest brother, Jossel. Afraid that his father will hear of it and hustle the spirited Mina into a respectably miserable marriage, anxious himself to escape the stifling predictabilities of his father\u2019s business, Jossel suggests that they emigrate to America.</p><p>Folk tales, as Grant points out, begin with a journey. This particular journey takes Mina and Jossel as far as England, where first lack of funds and then the outbreak of war prevent the onward crossing to New York. Instead, they settle in Liverpool. Left behind in Riga, their parents and three siblings must endure in their different ways the agonies of \u201cthe great wound of the 20th century\u201d, but, safe in the Jewish community of Brownlow Hill, Mina\u2019s closest brush with the Bolshevist idealism of the boys in the forest is working in the cafeteria of a munitions factory during the \u201cGreat War\u201d. Meanwhile, Jossel is sent to the eastern front where he, too, acquires a story that will be polished up and passed down the generations: he saves the life of a fellow soldier, a Polish Jew who later becomes Mina\u2019s husband.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/25/the-story-of-the-forest-by-linda-grant-review-20th-century-journeys\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/25/the-story-of-the-forest-by-linda-grant-review-20th-century-journeys", "date_published": "2023-05-25 08:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "To Catch a Killer review \u2013 Shailene Woodley sniper thriller like mid-season CSI", "description": "<p>This flat-footed serial-killer hunt, co-starring Ben Mendelsohn, is full of underwritten cops who seem to have no real idea what they\u2019re doing</p><p>Shailene Woodley (Big Little Lies, Divergent) stars as Eleanor Falco, a young Baltimore beat cop who seems unhappy both at home and at work.
