Also known as “The Suffragette Derby”, was a horse race which took place at Epsom Downs on 4 June 1913. 
The race was overshadowed by the death of suffragette Emily Davison, who was killed when she ran out in front of King George V's horse, Anmer. The horse struck Davison as she tried to grab the horse's reins, the injuries she received proved fatal as she died 4 days later. 

The race was attended by an estimated 500,000 people, including the King and Queen.

Music: Brahms, Opus 51.
