<p>Everton have relegation battle in their own hands, Aston Villa fans face a dilemma and there will be emotional farewells galore</p><p>For the third time in 29 years, Everton’s Premier League status is on the line on the final day at Goodison Park although, unlike against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/99-94-cricket-blog/2020/may/19/my-favourite-game-everton-stayed-up-last-day-season">Wimbledon in 1994</a> or Coventry in 1998, survival is in their own hands. The task sounds straightforward enough: beat a Bournemouth team with nothing to play for and a 70th consecutive season in the top flight is guaranteed. Everton, though, have an aversion to the straightforward. Sean Dyche does not have a decent striker available with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has been integral to the team’s recent improvement, hamstrung again. Unless Vitaliy Mykolenko recovers from a thigh injury, he will not have a recognised full-back (left or right) available either. Everton have not won at home since 11 March and were soundly beaten twice in five days by Gary O’Neil’s team just before the World Cup break, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPj5j7W0VQE">4-1 in the Carabao Cup</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/12/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report">3-0 in the Premier League</a>.

## A measurement for chronic pain is a scientific holy grail – and we’re getting closer | Abdul-Ghaaliq Lalkhen

<p>People who have chronic pain without a visible injury are often not believed, but new research can help visualise that pain</p><p>Most people, including doctors, do not appreciate that the organ that produces pain is the brain. A broken bone, damaged tissue or a bleeding wound is often the focus, but the experience of pain is the sum total of more than just the physical injury – it is the result of information sent from our nerves being filtered through an individual’s unique psychological makeup, genetics, gender, beliefs, expectations, motivations and emotional context. Pain is therefore an individual experience, and often confounds and frightens us, as well as those we love and who love us.</p><p>Acute pain is a life-preserving sensory and emotional experience, like hunger or thirst, and is produced by the brain to alert us to an actual or potential threat to our survival from damage to our bodies.<em> </em>It is a complex biological alarm system<em> </em>and, like all systems, may malfunction. When it becomes dysfunctional, the individual experiences pain without identifiable damage. The disease state that results is called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/16/chronic-pain-support-medication-painkillers-holistic">chronic pain</a><em>. </em>At the moment,<em> </em>it<em> </em>cannot be cured – in other words, there is no bone that can be mended or wound that can be stitched that will cause the alarm to be switched off.</p><p>Dr Abdul-Ghaaliq Lalkhen specialises in pain medicine and is a visiting professor at Manchester Metropolitan University.

<p>Cassandra Naud is striking if a little opaque as a predator seducing image-obsessed tourists in Thailand</p><p>In this smartly arranged thriller by Kurtis David Harder, Canadian actor Cassandra Naud holds her own as a kind of social media Tom Ripley, out in Thailand preying on vacuous, smartphone-toting influencers while coveting their silky lifestyles. Broken down into four parts following different characters, the film dabbles in but doesn’t wholly conform to the now-standard satirical takedown of 21st-century popinjays. There’s something darker and more solipsistic at work here: Naud’s repeated spiel of “They won’t even notice you’re gone. Nobody cares” is just as rehearsed and trite as other airheaded Insta-platitudes.</p><p>Her character, CW, first gets her claws into Madison (Emily Tennant), a fellow American making nice for her feeds but actually moping around the Thai coast because she’s having a hard time with her British boyfriend and manager Ryan (Rory J Saper). So when CW steps in at a bar to protect her from a sharking expat, Madison is glad to be swept into the wake of this free-spirited font of local secrets. Weeks later, she has gone missing, CW has headed to Bangkok to target Madison’s bougier and more confident clone Jessica (Sara Canning), and Ryan – rattled by the radio silence from his girlfriend – jumps on a plane.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/25/influencer-review-smart-thriller-about-instagrammers-in-mortal-peril">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is nothing quite like the spectacle of a tech bro with vast financial resources failing to grapple with his own mortality</p><p>There are a lot of details to enjoy in the story of Bryan Johnson, the middle-aged almost-billionaire spending $2m (£1.6m) a year pursuing eternal youth. As <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tech-millionaire-injected-with-sons-blood-in-quest-for-youth-z8bbtm9f8">described </a>in the Times this week, Johnson has <a href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/bryan-johnson-son-blood-ageing">received</a> “plasma infusions” from his 17-year-old son, had “33,537 images of his bowels” taken, and tried experimental treatments previously only tested on mice. But the one I like best, I think, revolves around his meal plan. As a man who made $800m (£646m) from the sale of his company to eBay, he enjoys a diet of “brown sludge” made of pureed vegetables – baby food, in other words. From the photos, these measures certainly seem to be working: the 45-year-old tech entrepreneur looks approximately 43.</p><p>It is, of course, a source of reliable entertainment to study how the very wealthy set about ruining their lives. If excess is the quickest and most conventional route to self-destruction, self-denial is the more rewarding approach for the idle observer. There is nothing quite like the spectacle of a man with huge resources failing to grapple with his own mortality and spending what precious time he has left in joyless pursuit of a goal that is doomed to fail.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/bryan-johnson-800m-baby-food-mortality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After decades of just shovelling in food, I have finally learned to pace myself</p><p>I read and listen to an awful lot of words. How many? Let’s see. I must get through at least four hours of speech radio, podcasts and audiobooks a day. At roughly three words a second that’s more than 10,000 an hour, so let’s call it 40,000 a day. And I must be in conversation for about the same amount of time, so allowing for silences and subtracting the words I use, that’s maybe another 15,000 a day. And I must read about the same number. I reckon, all up, 70,000 a day; 25m a year. Some of those words have more merit than others. A few, vanishingly few, are sheer gold. One short sentence can reframe everything.</p><p>An example: I’ve <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/21/all-you-can-eat-i-take-those-words-as-a-promise-and-a-challenge">banged on extensively</a> about my propensity to overeat, at every meal, and between meals, all day, every day. After more than half a century of this, the shame of it hadn’t abated any more than the habit. I’d all but given up trying to change. Then a month ago, I picked up Paul McKenna’s book I Can Make You Thin. This turned out to be something of a gamechanger. I have not overeaten since and I’m 6kg lighter. The whole book is interesting, and I have even quite enjoyed the “weight-loss mind-programming audio”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/a-few-wise-words-have-stopped-me-eating-like-a-barnyard-animal">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>No 8 seed Florida win 4-3 over Carolina on Tkachuk’s late goal</li><li>Panthers sweep Hurricanes to reach second Stanley Cup final</li></ul><p>Matthew Tkachuk scored a power-play goal with 4.9 seconds left, Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 36 shots to cap off a brilliant series, and the Florida Panthers earned their first trip to the Stanley Cup final in 27 years by beating the Carolina Hurricanes 4-3 on Wednesday night to win the Eastern Conference title in a sweep.</p><p>Tkachuk’s goal was his second of the night – and maybe the biggest in Panthers’ history. The Panthers will play either Vegas or Dallas for the Stanley Cup starting sometime next week; Vegas currently leads the Western Conference title series 3-0.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/24/florida-panthers-carolina-hurricanes-nhl-stanley-cup-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What liberals may have feared as the alliance of two anti-woke villains, turned out to have the menace of a damp dishcloth</p><p>The screen kept saying “Preparing to launch”. But this wasn’t one of Elon Musk’s space rockets that soars through the stratosphere and settles into a comfortable orbit. This was one that blew up on the pad in a dazzling ball of flame.</p><p>The eccentric billionaire had invited Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, to the somewhat niche Twitter Spaces – a dedicated audio streaming feature on the social media platform – to announce his run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/24/ron-desantis-elon-musk-twitter-campaign-launch-glitch">Continue reading...</a>
