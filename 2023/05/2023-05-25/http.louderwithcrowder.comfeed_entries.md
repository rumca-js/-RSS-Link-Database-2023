Like, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/female-prisoners-extra-jail-time" target="_blank">having time added to your prison sentence over calling</a> a he a she level absurdity. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-pronouns-fauci" target="_blank">As Elon Musk tweeted</a>, forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone. But I've never quite heard the insanity explained better than through this random TikToker.</p><p>Maybe it's the British accent. If it was an Irish accent, he would sound drunk. If it were a Scottish accent he would sound like he was looking for someone to beat the humus out of. But the British accent makes this basic grammar lesson sound intellectual as f*ck.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Based man explains the real reason why a person might want to announce what his or her pronouns are. <br /><br />His explanation is perfect. <a href="https://t.co/CJ8jmHSZxU">pic.twitter.com/CJ8jmHSZxU</a><br />— Catch Up (@CatchUpNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1611172996252684288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>When you are having a conversation with someone, you aren't referring to them with third-person pronouns like he/her, xi/xir, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/frog-pronouns-gop" target="_blank">frog/frogself</a>. You're referring to them with second-person pronouns like you and yours. Using third-person pronouns in a conversation with someone makes you sound mental, daft,  and like a nutter.</p><blockquote>So when you -- quite uninvited -- declare your pronouns to me, in spite of what you might say, you are not telling me how to address you. You are not telling me how you like to be spoken to. What you're telling me is how I must think about you and how I must speak to everyone else in the world when I refer to you. You might think it's okay to control me in that way. You may think you have a good justification for doing so. But at the very least let's be honest about what you're doing. Because that's how I like to be spoken to.</blockquote><p>What sells it is ending the video with a spot of tea.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

As an internal memo shows, it's happening during the worst possible week. Not only is the store being harassed by people choosing not to spend money there, but it's the anniversary of George Floyd's death.</p><p>No, seriously. That's what's been leaked in an internal coping memo to employees about all the bad things happening.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: I have obtained the internal email that <a href="https://twitter.com/Target?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Target</a> sent to their employees following the Pride month disaster that has caused them to lose $9B in one week, where is goes from standing with the "LGBTQIA+ community" to the anniversary of George Floyd lmfao. <a href="https://t.co/GQVgrdmHDv">pic.twitter.com/GQVgrdmHDv</a><br />— Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1661747295438921729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Yesterday was bad, but today?!</p><blockquote>Today brings more reflection, pain. and the need for continued care as our team, hometown and world remember the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Today marks the three-year anniversary of George Floyd sacrificing his life for social justice (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/derek-chauvin-verdict-liberal-reactions" target="_blank">shout out Nancy Pelosi</a>). Target employees are encouraged to take space from themselves to cope.</p><p>The whole losing money thing is a different problem. Target came under fire when it social media users observed they were selling swimwear with new "tucking" technology for minors. "Tucking" is something you do if you have a weiner you don't want to have but aren't committed to the gimmick enough to chop it off if you're an adult. If you're a kid, it's very well something you will grow out of if your public school doesn't get a hold of you.</p><p>As one YouTuber shows us, the store has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-pride-collection" target="_blank">a whole collection of rainbow color merchandise for virtue-signaling parents and their children</a>. The "no validation needed" t-shirt is my favorite. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">And you wonder why Target is in a state of emergency... <a href="https://t.co/XLCLyAWw5y">pic.twitter.com/XLCLyAWw5y</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1661345364882890752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/25/target-loses-8b-in-week-since-boycott-calls-over-pride-collection/" target="_blank">Since the controversy started</a>, Target has seen a 12% drop in stock price that erased $9 billion off the company’s market capitalization. Not that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-shoplifting-finances" target="_blank">Target is any stranger to losing money</a>. They are just used to the money being lost due to shoplifting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-target-detergent" target="_blank">caused by progressive policies put in place by the progressive leaders</a> Target as a corporation supports.</p><p>Now the store faces radical right-wingers deciding they are going spend their money elsewhere.

## Watch as brave bystanders save the day after goon viciously attacks a motorcycle cop

A motorcycle cop was being violently assaulted by a thug along the California freeway. When four samaritans ran in from all directions to help the officer.</p><p>Thuggy McGoon was trying to rip down a freeway sign and screaming at motorists. This is conjecture, but there is a good chance he may have been high. Or at least, nuts. A CHP motorcycle officer arrived and <a href="https://policetribune.com/video-three-good-samaritans-help-motorcycle-cop-during-violent-attack/" target="_blank">was just going to give the guy a warning</a>. But Thuggy attacked, and a group of bystanders acted.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Random Bystanders spring into action when a Motorcycle Cop in Santa Ana, California needs help..<br /><br />Good people still exist.<br />❤️🤍💙 <a href="https://t.co/xXIoapriQP">pic.twitter.com/xXIoapriQP</a><br />— BIG DAVE (@2bz4thot) <a href="https://twitter.com/2bz4thot/status/1660871987214921728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Side note.: I am today year's old to learn that the acronym for California Highway Patrol is CHP and not CHiP.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Thuggy pushed the officer to the ground and jumped on top of him, appearing to attempt to choke the officer. This is where the Samaritans ran in. One guy rained down punches while the officer got up. Others ran in and held the perp down until the officer could regain his senses.</p><p>One of the bystanders spoke to the local press after:</p><blockquote>Since I see the officer down, I was concerned about the guy grabbing the officer’s gun and shooting the officer. That was my biggest concern and possibly doing the same to me. So, in that moment, I didn’t have any other choice.”</blockquote><p>We tend to see too many bystanders in these videos do nothing but film the incident for their social media. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-highway-officer-shot-bystanders" target="_blank">It's rare we</a> see <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/walmart-veteran-speaks" target="_blank">heroes act</a>.

We provide details and fact-check against the media's misinformation, including the claim that Twitter is the largest platform for free speech. We have a LIVE correspondent at Target going through the children's section. Also, The North Face has been completely co-opted by the woke mind virus, and the Drag Queen story hour in New Hampshire has reached a whole new level of degeneracy. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

## Man shoots roommate in the buttcheek for eating the last Hot Pocket, charged with hilarious assault

One dude ate the last Hot Pocket and got a bullet in his ass for it. Let he without sin, amirite?</p><p>Clifton E. Williams <a href="https://www.wlky.com/article/hot-pocket-shooting-louisville-clifton-williams/43965711" target="_blank">was arrested and charged with one count of assault</a>. His roommate had eaten the last of the Hot Pockets. Williams was angered by this, so he *checks notes* whipped out his pistol and shot the roommate in the buttcheek. Unclear is if it's the left butt cheek or the right buttcheek. Though in Williams's defense, he started off throwing titles at the roommate. If the roommate would have just apologized and offered to go to the store, he wouldn't have gotten a round in his hiney.</p><p>This is Clifton, with the amazing mugshot.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>He's out on $7500 bond and has been ordered not to have communication with his roommate. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A life lesson about “Hot Pockets” <a href="https://t.co/D3j1jUMYyP">pic.twitter.com/D3j1jUMYyP</a><br />— Royce Reeves (@roycereevesss) <a href="https://twitter.com/roycereevesss/status/1661580354380083203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'll be honest if anyone deserves a bullet in the ass over a Hot Pocket it's the people who make the Hot Pockets. They never heat up right. Either they are cold in the middle, or get overheated and the cheese leaks out the holes. You burn your tongue no matter how hot they are. And most of them taste like a cross between cardboard-flavored ass and ass-flavored cardboard.</p><p>Hot Pockets are not worth a life of crime. There are better microwavable snacks to shoot your roommate over.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Sunny Hostin tries shaming Elon Musk, gets fact-checked into oblivion LIVE by her own producers

And that was BEFORE the announcement broke the Internet and/or was a disaster depending on if you are a DeSantis supporter or on the same side as corporate media and Trump supporters. More on that in a bit. I wanted to laugh at Sunny Hostin first.</p><p>The shrill harpies from <em>The View</em> wanted you to know how much of a mistake it was for DeSantis and Musk to do a thing together. SPOILER: They're all Biden supporters. Hostin, known for being <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sunny-hostin-florida-desantis-national" target="_blank">a leftist</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sunny-hostin-nikki-haley" target="_blank">a racist</a>, attempted to make the case it was because Elon Musk is very unpopular. That's when her producers stepped in.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The View's Sunny Hostin on Elon Musk: "I don’t know what his approval rating is, but it’s, like, in the toilet -- oh, I'm sorry, I was just told that he’s more favorable than Biden and Trump, which scares me."<br /><br />(deleted previous tweet claiming she was referencing DeSantis) <a href="https://t.co/vSGTYH02gA">pic.twitter.com/vSGTYH02gA</a><br />— Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1661445542608601092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>"I don’t know what his approval rating is, but it’s, like, in the toilet -- oh, I'm sorry, I was just told that he’s more favorable than Biden and Trump, which scares me."</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>It is believed Hosting was <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/politics/elon-musk-just-smoked-trump-putin-and-biden-in-a-key-poll" target="_blank">misunderstanding a Harvard/Harris poll from last week</a>. The poll had Elon Musk at a 46% percent approval rating. That's higher than DeSanis, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The only reason people even know this is because of screenshots posted on Twitter lol<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1661546412415537152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>As for the campaign roll-out debacle last night, I'm already (personally) all-in for DeSantis so I opted to go to my niece's softball game instead. Plus sitting in front of a computer while supporters on both sides (even the ones I agree with) spin and share tweets from an hour earlier wasn't my idea of an enjoyable evening.</p><p>I think we can all agree that having the site crash isn't a preferable way to launch a political campaign in the micro, it's not going to be a big deal in macro, and the media was going to attack no matter what happened. Twitter's serves crashing just came them an easy excuse.</p><p>Also, Rumble's servers wouldn't have had that problem. Just sayin'.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Dog stealing TikToker tries playing race card against Piers Morgan: "I just think you're an idiot"

The first is that UK TikToker Mizzy -- the guy who breaks into homes, attacks Jewish people, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/old-ladys-dog-tiktoker" target="_blank">and steals people's dogs for social media clout</a> -- was on the Piers Morgan Show. The second is that Mizzy claimed the only reason anyone criticizes him for breaking into homes, attacking Jewish people, or stealing people's dogs... is because he's black.</p><p>Morgan was not amused.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"Why would I care what colour your skin is? I just think you're an idiot."<br /><br />Piers Morgan blasts TikTok prankster Mizzy for 'playing the race card' while discussing the backlash he's received.<a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@piersmorgan</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TalkTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TalkTV</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PMU</a> <a href="https://t.co/Qg1bi7vAaQ">pic.twitter.com/Qg1bi7vAaQ</a><br />— Piers Morgan Uncensored (@PiersUncensored) <a href="https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored/status/1661454284599488512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Morgan: Tell me about your life. What justifies this?<br /><br />Mizzy: Are you saying because I'm black? Because I guarantee if I was white...<br /><br />Morgan: I don't give a damn about your skin color. I just think you're an idiot.<br /></blockquote><p>The interview <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/teen-tiktok-prankster-charged-over-30062380" target="_blank">comes on the heels of Mizzy being arrested</a>. Yes, breaking and entering into someone's home even as a prank is still illegal. Even in the UK. Though Morgan had an issue with that as well, saying Mizzy only got a tiny fine that showed no deterrent for Mizzy's behavior. Mizzy countered with a valid point:</p><blockquote>The UK laws are weak. Simple as. That's not my fault.</blockquote><p>When you have weak laws, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-city-shoplifting-plan" target="_blank">bad people take advantage of those weak laws</a>. Go figure.</p><p>Mizzy is what you get when you raise a generation without consequences, who also discovers the quickest way to become famous is to act like a schmuck on social media. That includes white people too. And I say this on behalf of the whites. If you look like me and break into my house, or attempt to steal my dog, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gasoline-cars-pranks" target="_blank">or chase me in a parking lot pretending to pour gasoline on me</a>... your ass is getting whooped.</p><p>It's not because you're black. It's because you're a dickhead.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
