It’s been over two decades since the first Fast & Furious movie came out, a relatively low-key movie about some street racers that steal DVD players. With the franchise having gone to space in the last installment, what more is there for the Fast Family to do at this point? Just keep going on, looks like.

Fast X definitely raises some questions. Like how did they land on that title? How many people from Dom’s past are out there right now plotting revenge? What’s with the tourism stop after getting on the most wanted list? What was that ENTIRE scene with Pete Davidson??

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Fast X!
