<ul><li>Svitolina beats Martina Trevisan 6-2, 6-2</li><li>‘These moments bring joy to people of Ukraine’</li></ul><p>Sixteen months since Elina Svitolina last competed in a grand slam tournament, the Australian Open, life has changed significantly. She is now a mother, having taken maternity leave from the tour before giving birth to her first child, Skaï, with her husband, Gaël Monfils. Her country, Ukraine, has been invaded by Russia. She spent much of her time away from the sport, including during her pregnancy, advocating for her country’s cause.</p><p>On the court, however, not too much has changed. Svitolina returned to the French Open with a spectacular performance, dismantling the 26th seed, Martina Trevisan, a semi-finalist last year, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the second round. Trevisan is Svitolina’s first top‑30 win of her comeback.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/29/elina-svitolina-advocates-for-ukraine-on-spectacular-return-to-tennis-tour">Continue reading...</a>
