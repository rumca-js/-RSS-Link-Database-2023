<p></p><p>It has not been a dull couple of weeks from a Sheffield Wednesday perspective. With six seconds of extra time to play, Josh Windass’s diving header spared Wednesday another penalty shootout and sent them into the Championship. Fifteen years on from his dad, Dean, lashing in here to win Hull City promotion to the Premier League another Windass made a Wembley memory to last a lifetime.</p><p>The celebrations were wild. Barry Bannan, the Wednesday captain who departed with cramp deep into extra time, rushed to celebrate with Dean in the stands. It was a heartbreaking ending for Barnsley, who played more than 70 minutes with 10 men after Adam Phillips was controversially sent off early in the second half. Darren Moore, typically, was the calmest man in the stadium. Now Wednesday substitute Will Vaulks could laugh about his cartwheel and backflip celebration after his extra-time goal was disallowed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/barnsley-sheffield-wednesday-league-one-playoff-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The Belgian striker had just equalled Roger Boli’s record goal tally over a single campaign for the club and proceeded to mimic the Franco-Ivorian striker’s iconic aeroplane celebration.</p><p>The goal – the third in a 3-0 victory over already relegated Ajaccio – secured the team’s spot in next season’s Champions League. The anthem for that competition provided the background music to the celebrations at the final whistle as the Ligue 1 runners-up revelled in their most successful campaign in 25 years.

<p>BVB’s victory parade was all in place before a 2-2 draw against Mainz and Jamal Musiala’s winner for Bayern Munich in Köln</p><p>The queue for the bar started to snake around Signal Iduna Park from not long after 6am. Stalls sold scarves and T-shirts plastered with the legend “Deutscher Meister 2023”. The club had emailed fans to detail the timings and route of Sunday’s victory parade; after the players had signed the Golden Book of the City of Dortmund, their bus would leave Westfalenhütte and make the journey towards Borsigplatz, where the club was founded in 1909.</p><p>This time, it had to be for Borussia Dortmund. Thoughts of tempting fate and angering the football gods were put to one side in the interests of practicality. Sebastian Kehl – a man who knows what it takes to beat Bayern Munich to a Bundesliga title – and Edin Terzic spoke boldly in the run-up to the game, with the latter talking of the team, the fans and the city taking “a final step” in unison.

<p>Players time-wasting, fans expecting too much and the continued dominance of gambling adverts all make our list</p><p>Surely we are at the stage where we do not need to constantly criticise players who have not reached the level a fan wants them to in the first few months of the season? We can all now look at Jack Grealish being integral to Manchester City’s title-winning side and realise what happens when someone with incredible talent is allowed a year to settle in. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/13/jack-grealish-superstar-cog-ruthless-machine-manchester-city">Grealish has worked out what he needs to do</a> after making the big leap from doing what he wanted at Aston Villa to learning a new role in the best team in the world. This season, Darwin Núñez has been questioned after not providing the goods at Liverpool, while Antony’s consistency for Manchester United is under scrutiny. Players should be allowed time to show their worth; it does little good berating them for their failings after arriving in a new country to play at a higher level. That said, if they are still underwhelming at the end of next season: fill your boots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-gripes-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

I finished my entry with: “What is frightening is how much better he could become, especially if Arsenal invest in a proper striker and a right-back capable of overlapping and creating more space for Saka.” The emergence of Ben White at right-back and the signing of Gabriel Jesus have indeed furthered Saka’s development: he has scored 14 league goals and only Kevin De Bruyne, Leandro Trossard and Mohamed Salah have more than his 11 assists. Before the World Cup, many were unsure whether Saka had a place in Gareth Southgate’s first XI. By the end of the tournament, he was probably the second or third name on the team sheet. For club and country, the cheerful Saka is a smiling assassin and has propelled Arsenal from also-rans to title contenders in less than 12 months. Gunners fans will be delighted about his new four-year contract, which will allow Mikel Arteta to build around him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-young-players-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

## 12 Ensemble & GBSR Duo review – Laurence Osborn’s new work TOMB! absorbs and intrigues

Osborn describes his piece TOMB! as recognising “the necrophiliac side of heritage and our morbid obsession with dead things”. In this case the “dead things” are traditional musical forms like fugue, jig and passacaglia, which flit in and out of the 20-minute movement like apparitions, only occasionally assuming recognisable forms. The effect is intriguing, sometimes unnerving, but always engaging, and full of textures that are never quite as straightforward as they seem.</p><p>Repeated at <a href="https://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/music/whats-on/2023/12-ensemble-gbsr-duo">Cheltenham festival</a> on 14 July</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/12-ensemble-gbsr-duo-review-laurence-osborn-kings-place-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The experimental sex lives of the artists and thinkers of the roaring 20s are set against the burgeoning threat of fascism in this wickedly amusing and timely book</p><p>Writing in a hectic, almost impromptu present tense while darting to and fro between dozens of parallel stories, Florian Illies has pieced together the emotional history of a doomed generation. His cast of European artists and intellectuals spend the 1920s experimenting erotically, then succumb to anxiety and outright panic during the 1930s; by the 1940s, they are either in exile or on their way to concentration camps.</p><p>The structure of Illies’s book, apparently haphazard in its quick cuts between people and places, matches the creed of its characters. Sartre declares existence to be precariously contingent, which serves as a justification for living from moment to moment. Brecht leaves notes for the women he juggles telling them that he cannot be relied on, and Picasso stows a variety of simultaneous mistresses and muses in scattered lodgings and busily commutes between them. Others triangulate in troilist arrangements that never quite exclude the old-fashioned vice of jealousy. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/07/anais-nin-author-social-media">Anaïs Nin</a> has an affair with her father, documented in a journal entitled <em>Incest</em>.
