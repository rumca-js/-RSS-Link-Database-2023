Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Missouri senator Josh Hawley discuss his new book, “Manhood,” and break down the importance and depth of the biblical ideals that have shaped society - and particularly the west - in a historically unprecedented manner. 

Josh Hawley is a constitutional lawyer, the U.S. Senator for Missouri, and the bestselling author of “The Tyranny of Big Tech.” His newest publication, “Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs,” is available now and seeks to defend the positive and necessary attributes of masculinity across leadership, governance, and the everyday structure of American life. Men of character are needed for a civilization to thrive, and today's America, the west, has openly sought to destroy the foundational and biblical principles that create them.
