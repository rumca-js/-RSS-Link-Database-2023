But it is University Challenge that marks his longest association with a show: from 1994 until now.

## We cling because where else do we go when it’s over for Jimmy Anderson? | Jonathan Liew

<p>Test cricket will lose a part of itself when England’s elder statesman retires and, while it will survive, it will be painful</p><p>“Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head.” A few weeks ago English cricket was thrown into a medium-sized spasm by the news that Jimmy Anderson had sustained a groin injury playing for Lancashire against Somerset. On one level it felt faintly ridiculous that England’s Ashes chances should rise or fall on the fitness of a man old enough to have bowled at Derek Randall. But the predominant sensation was really a kind of paralysing fear: the sort that grips you when you hear that an elderly relative has fallen over at home. Everyone knows the stakes here. Every twinge, every niggle and every limp now comes with a sinister metatext: “this time, you know, it might really be over”.</p><p>But still we cling, because we don’t know where else we can go. Naturally Anderson’s injury turned out to be little more than a minor setback. He will be rested for the Test against Ireland this week. And so come 16 June, in all likelihood, we will once again be treated to the sight of Anderson gingerly grimacing his way to the bowling crease: blisters popping in his boots, face writ with that peculiar mixture of acute discomfort and acute satisfaction. Anderson, more than any bowler of his generation, has learned to associate pain with reward. This thing is supposed to hurt. That’s how you know it’s worth it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/29/we-cling-because-where-else-do-we-go-when-its-over-for-jimmy-anderson-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the Met’s mental health ultimatum: a deadline is not a solution | Editorial | Editorial

<p>Sir Mark Rowley is right that mentally ill people should not be looked after by police officers. Ministers, not health workers, are to blame</p><p>The decision last week by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, that in future his officers will attend emergency calls related to mental health only where a threat to life is feared, was both a wake-up call and a threat. His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/28/met-police-to-stop-attending-emergency-mental-health-calls" title="">letter</a>, and deadline of 31 August, have raised the stakes in negotiations with health bosses. The danger is that his combative approach will undermine attempts to find a solution to a problem that no one denies.</p><p>Sir Mark is right that people with severe mental illness should be looked after by health workers, not police. The enormous amount of time that his officers spend in A&amp;E departments with mentally ill people waiting to be treated should be reduced. Situations such as the one described last year by the former West Midlands chief Sir David Thompson, in which a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/27/child-in-mental-health-crisis-lived-at-police-station-for-two-days-chief-reveals" title="">child having a mental health crisis</a> lived in a police station for two days because there was nowhere else for her to go, should shame us all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-mets-mental-health-ultimatum-a-deadline-is-not-a-solution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As he embarks on a third decade in power, Turkey’s president will continue to use sweeping powers to divide and rule</p><p>During his victory speeches on Sunday night, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan celebrated re-election as Turkey’s president with a call for national unity. “We are not the only ones who have won, Turkey has won … our democracy has won,” he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-close-in-second-round-of-the-turkish-presidential-election" title="">told</a> supporters, while at the same time doubling down on the type of inflammatory rhetoric he deployed against LGBTQ+ people throughout his campaign.</p><p>As Mr Erdoğan embarks on a record third decade in power with a conservative and nationalist mandate – and with increasingly authoritarian powers to enforce it – millions of other Turkish residents also have good grounds to disbelieve his sunny rhetoric. In an increasingly militarised “anti-terror” environment, political repression and harassment of the country’s sizeable Kurdish population are set to continue. The president’s campaign was loaded with barbs and misinformation about the mainly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party, which backed Mr Erdoğan’s defeated rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/29/the-guardian-view-on-erdogans-victory-a-triumph-for-polarisation-not-unity">Continue reading...</a>

To restore the NHS, we could learn from its history. The independent contractor model of primary care has been an NHS success story and, arguably, its collapse is at the root of the service’s wider malaise.</p><p>Unifying fragmented primary, community and social care staff in independent, wholly subcontracted organisations under one roof, possibly as social enterprises or John Lewis-style partnerships, would improve care, lift staff morale and release funds to address the workforce crisis. Relocating services currently provided in hospitals – such as urgent care, diagnostics and outpatients – into the community would offer the opportunity for care to be delivered using the personalised, relationship-based and cost-effective model traditionally used by family doctors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/29/to-reform-the-nhs-labour-must-learn-from-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

Arguing is a sterile, counterproductive activity if it does not have a philosophical base. Simple philosophical ideas do have a place in every child’s life from an early age. Some of the words form part of early vocabulary.</p><p>How often do adults explore with children words such as fair, kind and share? How often are the consequences of doing what you want discussed beyond the immediate and practical? If politics or arguing is to go beyond pure self-interest, it needs a philosophical base. Rooting it in the real world with its limitations and resources is where economics comes in. Philosophy, politics and economics in primary school should be seen as basic life skills and embedded in the curriculum. The performance of PPE graduates in parliament seems to indicate that it is a university course of little merit in character-building.<br /><strong>John Sommer</strong><br /><em>Saltford, Bristol</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/29/starting-young-on-the-politics-of-argument">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A 2-2 draw at Valencia ensured Luis García’s team will not be among several sides fighting for La Liga survival on the final day</p><p>When the end came, Espanyol’s captain pulled his shirt over his face and sobbed, a member of staff taking him gently by the arm and guiding him off the Mestalla pitch and out of the first division. “We didn’t deserve it to end like this,” Sergi Darder had said, which was just about all he had been able to say; three men needed to compose him and carry him towards the camera where, exposed, his voice cracked and his eyes stung. That and “sorry”, plus a promise to be back that he knew was as hard to hear as to express. Then he raised an apologetic hand and, head covered, hurt hidden inside, departed.</p><p>“When we were closest, it was gone: it was cruel,” said his coach, Luis García. In the 93rd minute of the 37th week of the longest and tightest relegation battle anyone had ever seen, when someone’s grip finally failed, survival torn from their fingers, it was theirs. “We had fought so hard to have our final at our home with our people,” Darder said, but Espanyol, relegated, will not be in the fight for survival next Sunday. <em>Six</em> other teams, separated by two points, will be: Valladolid, Celta, Almería, Valencia, Cádiz and Getafe, each with their fate in their hands and hearts in their mouths.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/29/it-was-cruel-espanyol-crumble-but-leave-six-still-in-la-liga-danger-zone">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>Premieres by Jonathan Woolgar and Colin Matthews sat alongside music by Lili Boulanger, Cassie Kinoshi and Bartók in a concert full of interest and energy</p><p>The latest of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/london-symphony-orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>’s annual new music concerts, which was conducted by <a href="https://fxroth.com/">François-Xavier Roth</a>, included two world premieres, one from a composer still in the very early stages of his career, the other from one of the most familiar and significant figures in British contemporary music.</p><p>Like many of the pieces that find their way into LSO Futures concerts, <a href="https://jonathanwoolgar.com/">Jonathan Woolgar</a>’s <a href="https://www.lso.co.uk/composer-jonathan-woolgar-on-symphonic-message-wach-auf/">Symphonic Message: “Wach Auf”</a> had emerged through the orchestra’s <a href="https://www.lso.co.uk/learn-and-discover/support-for-emerging-artists/panufnik-composers-scheme/#:~:text=The%20Panufnik%20Composers%20Scheme%20offers,2022%2F23%20cohort%20only).">Panufnik Composers Scheme</a>, which mentors up-and-coming talents. It packs an awful lot of incident into barely six minutes of music, beginning with the glorious G major chord that the chorus sings on the word “Auf” at the beginning of the song contest in the final act of Wagner’s Die Meistersinger. That grandeur is immediately undermined by a referee’s whistle, and the music sets off in half a dozen different directions at once: there’s a boozy trombone solo, an irascible clarinet, even the beginnings of a Shostakovich-like gallop. It all peters out soon enough, but the eclectic energy is unmistakable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/lso-futures-review-barbican-london-jonathan-woolgar-colin-matthews">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain’s ever-harsher welfare system means that now only the rich can afford to make art | Alex Niven

<p>Postwar artists wouldn’t have had a chance without affordable housing or social security. When will politicians realise that?</p><p>When John Lydon sang in 1976 that anarchy was coming to the UK, he wasn’t far wrong. Genuine anarchism (a noble political tradition) certainly didn’t descend on Britain in the wake of punk rock and Margaret Thatcher’s general election victory three years later. But since 1979, the consensus that the British state should empower individuals through social security (such as the “<a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/profit-motives-not-residents-interests-drove-estate-regeneration-project-academic-report-says-81616">council tenancy</a>” Lydon sneered at in Anarchy in the UK) has been steadily unpicked by Thatcher and her successors – a triumph for laissez-faire anti-statism, if not quite anarchy itself.</p><p>The irony is that countercultural outbursts like punk were really enabled by the statist policies of postwar Britain. For all that countless artists, musicians and writers from the 50s to the 80s saw government as the enemy and thought they were mavericks railing against the system, the flourishing culture of the period was very much a product of the welfare state and its nurturing social infrastructures.</p><p>Alex Niven is a lecturer in English literature at Newcastle University and the author of New Model Island</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/29/britain-welfare-rich-art-artists-housing-social-security">Continue reading...</a>

It happened so often that they had to get more security and put extra signs up that said: ‘Don’t sing, don’t dance.’” She continues: “It’s off-putting and you don’t want to stop the show and ruin it even more for everyone else. It’s very distracting when you’re trying to sing, act and dance. It’s unsafe as well because any noises, or anything that throws you, will put you in the wrong spot on stage.” In these instances, she says, actors could “get hit by a piece of scenery” or even end up falling off the stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/29/they-dont-know-the-rules-actors-hit-back-at-theatregoers-phoning-drinking-and-fighting">Continue reading...</a>

They gave him time. At PSG, you also need that. By giving serenity to this project, we will be close to winning the Champions League.”</p><p>Serenity. Yes. Well, good luck with that. One of the fundamentals of coaching is that vacancies rarely turn up at clubs where everything is running smoothly. Yet even allowing for this, Pochettino’s appointment at Chelsea carries its own irresistible quantum of jeopardy. A coach who craves order and control, colliding head-on with an organisation that has spent two decades running on the fumes of chaos. A coach who values a tight-knit environment and close personal relationships, entering a club that has spent the last year trying to sign every professional footballer in the northern hemisphere.

<p><strong>Neighbourhood Weekender, Victoria Park, Warrington<br /></strong>Ably led by the ultimate disco dad in Jarvis Cocker, mass sing-songs blended with darker moments to prove Pulp can still do reunions with panache</p><p>Reunion tours have become a common feature of the live circuit nowadays, but Pulp do them with panache. Having originally split in 2002 after their huge Britpop-era success, they toured again in 2011-12 and now, more than a decade later, they have not forgotten how to make an entrance. An electronic drone grows louder and louder before Jarvis Cocker ascends from beneath the stage – like a boyband member half his age – and launches into 1995’s I Spy, a dazzling tale of working-class revenge that includes the marvellous line: “Take your year in Provence and shove it up your arse.”</p><p>Having formed in 1978 and been influenced more by the likes of Sparks and Roxy Music than, say, the Beatles and the Kinks, Pulp were always the oddballs who crashed the Britpop party. Now, they may seem an unlikely band to be such a hit at a festival with a young audience. They pepper the setlist with deep cuts, the breeze blows the sound around for the first half an hour, and many in the audience won’t have been born when the band headlined V festival here in 1996. However, a mix of parents, radio, YouTube and Spotify seem to have taken their songs to a whole new generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/pulp-review-reunited-britpop-oddballs-thrill-a-new-generation">Continue reading...</a>

## Champions to Championship: how slow-thinking Leicester sealed their own fate | Ben Fisher

<p>Poor management and poor recruitment have seen the unthinkable happen to a club who have enjoyed a glorious decade</p><p>Over the past few months the pre-match montages on the big screens at Leicester’s King Power Stadium have felt particularly bittersweet. One culminates in Ricardo Pereira striking late at PSV Eindhoven to tee up a first European semi-final and a date with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico last May, the other with Wes Morgan lifting the Premier League trophy with Claudio Ranieri. Confetti rains down and then there are a few seconds of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester’s late owner, applauding fans on all four sides of the ground before the pictures fade to black. At which point supporters instinctively respond with a rousing cheer.</p><p>Seven years on from winning the title, six on from competing with Atlético Madrid for a spot in the Champions League semi-finals, two on from winning the FA Cup and missing out on a top-four league finish on the final day, and 12 months on from another European adventure, Leicester are coming to terms with relegation. Their previous three league finishes read: fifth, fifth, eighth. And now 18th, two points shy of Everton, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/28/disbelief-hangs-in-air-as-leicester-suffer-an-avoidable-relegation">stayed up on the final day at their expense</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/how-slow-thinking-leicester-sealed-their-own-fate-relegation-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Couple who kill a man for harassing them in the pub are pursued by an army of his father’s goons. A few sparky performances can’t redeem this cartoonish thriller</p><p>One might start to wonder if the career of British writer-director Savvas D Michael (previously responsible for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/26/the-bezonians-review-unlikable-london-gangsters-cameo-vinnie-jones">The Bezonians</a>) may be propelled, like the scam in The Producers, by a deliberate intention to make crap movies for an investment write-off. Anything is possible in the wild and wonderful world of the film business. The only other explanation is that Michael thinks the laddish, nihilistically violent and yet not in the slightest bit amusing quasi-cartoon world he’s created in Hitman is entertaining. Could anyone be that deluded?</p><p>Hitmen’s inciting incident occurs when a bickering couple, office administrator Luke (Daniel Caltagirone) and estate agent Lauren (Lois Brabin-Platt, one of the few redeeming features of the film) are harassed in a pub by a drunken visiting American (Max Lohan) who is trying pick up Lauren. They manage to punch him so badly he dies, and evade getting done for murder by claiming self-defence. This enrages the dead guy’s rich grandfather (Eric Roberts) who hires an army of hitmen to kill Luke and Lauren. Unfeasibly, each one fails to kill their quarries for increasingly absurd reasons. They end up getting protected by one soft-hearted but deadly assassin (Lucas Aurelio) who is grieving for his recently deceased wife, and is deluded in the belief that Luke and Lauren really love each other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/29/hitmen-review-nihilistic-mess-of-a-gratuitously-violent-revenge-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The superstar’s 52-stop US tour has dominated headlines since March with fan theories, romantic controversy and even a congressional hearing</p><p>On St Patrick’s Day of this year, Taylor Swift kicked off her Eras Tour, a 52-stop showcase encompassing all ten of her studio albums. Since then, people have fallen into three categories: either you won the Ticketmaster lottery and attended the tour, a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/03/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review/673438/">genuinely epic event</a> in which the 33-year-old singer plays 44 or more songs over roughly three and a half hours; you did not get tickets, and have instead viewed innumerable videos of the show – her outfits, her choreography, her stage banter, the crowd, the celebrities; or you exist somewhere outside the Swiftie-verse and have been forced to pay attention to the Eras tour through consistent headlines and hype.</p><p>A Taylor Swift stadium tour – her first since 2018, owing to the pandemic – was always going to be an event. But the Eras Tour has surpassed mere pop spectacle and become an ongoing mass cultural moment. It exists in the physical world, bringing <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/05/10/taylor-swift-eras-tour-record-breaking-crowd-nashville/70203629007/">record-breaking</a> <a href="https://uproxx.com/pop/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-concert-history-madonna/">crowds</a> to a different US city each weekend. It has generated unceasing buzz, with headlines on anything from how demand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/17/tennessee-ticketmaster-investigation-taylor-swift-tickets">broke Ticketmaster</a> (and led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/05/taylor-swift-fans-sue-ticketmaster-over-tour-sale-debacle">lawsuits</a> and a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-fans-and-congress-take-on-ticketmaster/">congressional hearing</a>) to her romantic life to how far people are willing to go for tickets. (One Massachusetts father, for example, <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/21/massachusetts-dad-pays-21000-for-last-minute-taylor-swift-tickets/">shelled out $21k</a> to go last-minute.) And it exists in a vast, ever-expanding digital world of clips, reactions, live-streams, dissections and analysis. After viewing a few videos several months ago, my discovery pages on Instagram and TikTok are still predominantly Eras Tour content; even the algorithm loves Taylor Swift.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/taylor-swift-eras-tour-america-takeover">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Monday Night Football to non-league via YouTube, here are our picks of the game’s best commentators</p><p>“City will win that league by 10 points.” Neville <a href="https://youtu.be/s3I83hMhR7w?t=441">made that prediction</a> back in early February, with Arsenal five points clear (and with a game in hand) of their rivals. People smirked, but they are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table">not laughing now</a>. Neville – like every pundit – has also got plenty wrong, but the eight-times Premier League title winner’s opinion carries an authority that few can match, and he remains a brilliant broadcaster. There is no “say what you see” with Neville: his in-depth tactical analysis is insightful but succinct, while Monday Night Football remains essential viewing – the interview with the PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb this month was headline news. A pundit on top of his game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-pundits-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two meals for about £1 a head: tomato, leek and oregano beans with feta, and butter-bean mash with sausage and lemony greens</p><p>I would happily write a whole book about butter beans – they’re the tin I reach for most. Butter beans are such a cheap and versatile ingredient, and they have such a comforting quality. In our house, we always make a midweek version of tomato, leek and oregano beans (essentially posh beans on toast), which always hits the spot after a long day at work. The tin juices, meanwhile, are primarily responsible for making bean mash really creamy – just delicious with crisp sausagemeat. So, whatever you do, hold on to some of that wonderfully starchy liquid.</p><p>Jess Elliott Dennison is the author of Tin Can Magic, published by Hardie Grant at £15.

<p>When I teach five-year-olds the subject they typically scream with excitement. Here’s how to stop maths-phobia setting in</p><p>When I tell people I’m a mathematician, one of the first things many of them say is “I’m really bad at maths”. Sometimes I can detect a touch of pride in their voices, but I suspect this is more like bravado – an attempt to hide a certain amount of insecurity, or block out often painful classroom memories.</p><p>I’m sad that the subject is so polarising, with some believing they are “maths people” and others convinced they’re bad at it. But very few aspects of human behaviour are so black and white. Our abilities might fall along a continuum, but the most important thing is that everyone can get better if they’re helped in the right way. You won’t necessarily believe that if you’ve been scarred by your experiences at school. But one thing I know is that when I help five- and six-year-olds with maths they typically scream with excitement, and only learn to fear it later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/29/what-if-nobody-is-bad-at-maths">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For civil society and rights defenders, five more years of the Turkish president and his radical backers are a daunting prospect</p><p>On Sunday, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-close-in-second-round-of-the-turkish-presidential-election">declared the winner</a> of Turkey’s presidential runoff elections. According to numbers reported by the state-owned Anadolu news agency, more than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/who-won-turkeys-2023-elections-final-results-high-stakes-issue-2023-05-29/">27 million voters</a> cast their ballots in favour of Erdoğan, who has been at the country’s helm for more than two decades. He entered the second round in the lead in the polls, and was expected by most to emerge victorious. Although Erdoğan captured slightly more than half of the vote, more than 25 million people also mobilised to vote against him.</p><p>The elections were being held under deeply unfair conditions, with an opposition set up to fail.

<p>We select a few contenders for the Premier League’s flop of the season – and invite you to have your say</p><p>Let’s face it, this entire page could have been filled with Chelsea flops. There was a point in late April when, with Chelsea on a losing run under the dumbfounded Frank Lampard, saviour without a clue, it became almost possible that the club would pay the ultimate price for eight months of farce and get relegated. As it is, the (dis)organisation that walloped out close to £600m on transfers finished in mid-table, but with no heroics in staying up. From Thomas Tuchel’s still-mysterious defenestration, to Graham Potter being handed a squad so bloated they had to use two different dressing rooms, to spending all that loot and still not signing a striker beyond Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – signed for Tuchel only for the coach to be sacked within days – Chelsea’s decision-making made little sense.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-flops-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We select a few contenders for the Premier League’s signing of the season – and offer you the chance to have your say</p><p>The simplest deals are often the best deals, and too many overthought this one. What would a manager like Pep Guardiola do with a guaranteed goal machine with the cruising speed of a runaway Scania and the height of an Olympian pole vaulter? The answer, once the requisite adjustments had been made, was that Guardiola and Manchester City now had the use of a goalscoring force so powerful that early 20th-century ghosts such as Dixie Dean and George Camsell were brought back to prominence. All while journalists reached for metaphors along the lines of “wrecking ball” and “Death Star”; Haaland appears to have made City more powerful than they could possibly imagine. Pity poor Darwin Núñez, who entered the season being compared to the Norwegian, and at Liverpool had the kind of inconsistent season that might be expected of a new signing in a new country. From two goals on his league debut at West Ham onwards, there could never be doubts in Haaland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-season-review-signings-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liam must work out not just what he did and what’s gone wrong but how to stop it in the first place when the time-travel gizmo at his super-secret science lab goes wrong</p><p>This British-made puzzle of a movie revolves around Liam (Neil Bishop), a young man who wakes up with amnesia in an eerily quiet hospital ward with stitches in his face and a big bandage around his head. He suddenly has a vision of an older man (Martin Bishop) dressed like a shepherd in a nativity play telling him to wake up. When he does, it’s as if he’s shifted to a different point in time, and the injuries are much less severe. The only doctor around is Emma (Zoe Cunningham), who helpfully explains he was exposed to an intense electromagnetic field that caused his memory loss, but when he starts bombarding her with questions she less helpfully insists that it’s best if memories come back on their own.</p><p>It turns out Liam has been working at a super-secret science lab on a gizmo that allows people to time travel. Liam, both the lead inventor and first guinea pig, has done just that, except it seems as if he’s come a bit unstuck in time as a consequence, like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut Jr’s classic novel Slaughterhouse-Five. Or it might be something else: the science in this fiction is very muddled and consists of characters jabbering at speed about quantum fields and string theory while very cheap visual effects (reminiscent of 1980s Doctor Who episodes) helpfully signal when we make a temporal jump. Liam must work out not just what he did and what’s gone wrong but how to stop it in the first place before it triggers the end of the world. For some reason, an attractive valley in Wales is the location of the next big bang, which surely won’t please the local tourist board.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/29/breaking-infinity-review-low-budget-time-travel-puzzler-goes-round-in-circles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A square meal from Lazio featuring spring peas and lasagne sheets cut up into stamp-sized pieces</p><p>Take a sheet of paper. You can simply use it as is, filling it with words or drawings, or you could roll it into a tube, shred it into ribbons of any width, rip or cut it into any number of squares, or fold it into a boat, hat or peacock. Well, the same applies to sheets of pasta! I am thinking mostly about the sheets of fresh egg pasta that here in Italy come in stacks in cellophane-topped packets. For a long time, I only ever saw these sheets as “sheets to be layered” (their purpose was stated in their name), but even when the packet has “lasagne” printed on the front in big letters, it doesn’t mean that’s the only way to use them; they are sheets of great potential, to be rolled into cannelloni or sliced into ribbons of any width.</p><p>They can also be cut into squares of any size, to wrap around a filling (if the pasta is soft enough, although it generally isn’t after days in the packet). I cut sheets into 6cm squares or diamonds for basil and other types of pesto, while for minestrone and other bean soups a 3cm square or lozenge is a good shape and size for a spoon. And the shapes don’t need to be neat. Quite the opposite, in fact – <em>maltagliati</em> (meaning badly cut) is one of the nicest shapes of all, and then there are <em>quadrucci</em>, which are little squares that vary in size from postage stamps to mosaic tiles or to the size of a pencil rubber or pea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/29/italian-pasta-and-peas-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Low demand combined with sunny conditions and meltwater lifts hydro and solar production</p><p>Over the last week, several European countries had power prices in the wholesale energy market dip into negative values during daylight hours. The decline in prices was mostly driven by the abundance of available energy generated by renewable sources, combined with the relatively low demand for energy for heating or cooling, caused by normal springtime temperatures.</p><p>Negative prices often occur when there is an excess supply of electricity in the market. This can happen when renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydro produce a large quantity of electricity which exceeds demand and cannot be stored for later use. In such cases, producers may offer negative prices to incentivise wholesale consumers to take the surplus electricity off the grid and avoid overloading the system. This situation occurred due to an area of high pressure dominating across much of central and north-west Europe, providing lots of solar power generation across the area. Meanwhile, Finland experienced an oversupply of hydroelectric power resulting from excessive springtime meltwater which in turn led to negative prices here as well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/29/weather-tracker-power-prices-dip-to-negative-in-europe-amid-clean-energy-boost">Continue reading...</a>

But not everyone finds it so easy. Florence Pugh, for one, recently announced that she finds water “too boring to drink”. As well as the lack of flavour, she bemoaned the constant toilet breaks that come with a high intake, calling them “a waste of time”. Instead, she prefers orange juice, elderflower presses and tea.</p><p>What do the experts say?

<p>We select a few contenders for the best strikes of this top-flight season – and invite you to have your say</p><p>In the entirety of last season, the Paraguayan mustered a solitary goal and his Newcastle career looked to be whimpering to an end. Almirón has spent the past nine months proving any doubters they were incorrect by becoming one of the most elegant and creative players in the league. He started a run of seven goals in as many games, six of which Newcastle won, with a double at Fulham in early October. When Bruno Guimarães lofted a pass over the defence at Craven Cottage, few could have anticipated what Almirón would do next. Standing on the right-hand side of the area, he let the ball drop out of the sun and on to his left boot, volleying it across Bernd Leno into the top corner. The goal helped ignite Almirón’s revival and Newcastle’s push for the Champions League, but it was also a perfect moment in itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-goals-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We select a few contenders for the Premier League’s manager of the season – and invite you to have your say</p><p>This selection – alphabetically first but meritocratically last – could just as easily have been Mikel Arteta, Steve Cooper, Thomas Frank or Erik ten Hag. But De Zerbi carries it, and with good reason. Ordinarily, arriving after the start of the season would be enough to rule him out of lists such as this, but strangely, in this case it fortifies his position in it. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/18/brighton-confident-of-making-roberto-de-zerbi-their-new-manager">His appointment in September</a> left him plenty of time to work, but more than that, the manner in which he has inculcated a style change in between matches, most particularly solving a goalscoring problem that has dogged Brighton for years, make him impossible to leave out. Watching Brighton at any point during any game, it’s clear that the players know their jobs as individuals and a collective and stick to them in all circumstances against every opponent. On the face of things, this looks a brave plan – different opponents have different strengths and weaknesses – but in reality it makes perfect sense, because De Zerbi formulated it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-managers-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lucky McKee’s psychological horror starring Stephen Lang feels inauthentic and flat </p><p>Here is an unexceptional psychological horror from director Lucky McKee that feels dated and clunky, with some fairly ropey acting – or maybe that is down to the shaky lines put into the actors’ mouths. It only comes alive after a freaky plot twist at the end, but even that left the hairs on the back of my neck unprickled, the carpet under my feet unpulled.</p><p>Stephen Lang plays a cranky codger known only as Old Man who lives in the remote Smoky Mountains wilderness. The set design of his wooden cabin is distractingly inauthentic; it’s like an Ikea store display that has been done up in hicksville chic. Old Man has woken up in a filthy temper; first his dog, Rascal, pees on the floor, and then there is a knock at the door. Old Man shoves his shotgun into the face of the stranger standing outside. “Do as I say, or you’ll end up like her,” he growls, jabbing the gun at a stuffed wildcat on the wall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/29/old-man-review-wilderness-horror-as-cranky-codger-faces-off-with-mysterious-hiker">Continue reading...</a>

## On Marriage by Devorah Baum review – endless love or life sentence?

<p>The author and film-maker explores the landscape of matrimony in an erudite and entertaining quest for enlightenment</p><p>“Marriage,” writes Devorah Baum, in her incisive and thought-provoking interrogation of the subject, “is a formal relation that could arguably lay claim to being the world’s most enduring and universal.” It’s the plot that drives much of western literature and drama; it is presented to successive generations (especially women) as both the highest goal and a yoke of oppression. It has often been regarded as the most bourgeois and conservative of institutions, while proving flexible enough to accommodate radical reinventions. Why, then, she wonders, has there been so little serious intellectual engagement with the idea of marriage?</p><p>Baum herself has tackled the subject before, in a different medium; together with her husband, Josh Appignanesi, she is the co-creator of two films, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/09/the-new-man-review-parenting-documentary-josh-appignanesi">The New Man</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/05/husband-review-josh-appignanesi-devorah-baum-squirmingly-uncomfortable-new-york-book-tour-docucomedy#:~:text=Husband%20review%20%E2%80%93%20squirmingly%20uncomfortable%20New%20York%20book%20tour%20docucomedy,-In%20their%20follow&amp;text=The%20new%20film%20from,previous%20collaboration%2C%20The%20New%20Man.">Husband</a></em>, documentary (mockumentary?) explorations of the dynamic between a contemporary couple committed to a partnership of equals. In these movies, both partners offer what you suspect is an exaggerated version of themselves: Baum the straight woman, Appignanesi the butt of the joke. The point, of course, is that a marriage is unknowable to anyone outside it (and often to the people in it), so that only the couple themselves know where the lines between autofiction, truth and comedy blur in these retellings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/29/on-marriage-by-devorah-baum-review-endless-love-or-life-sentence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We select a few contenders for the Premier League’s player of the season – and invite you to have your say</p><p>There aren’t many players ridiculous enough to mooch through their careers secure in the knowledge that any team in the world will take them any time they’re benevolent enough to deem them worthy. But Erling Haaland is one, a lab-created goalmonster sent from the future to destroy the present. Obviously there are the numbers – 36 goals, four hat-tricks – those alone tell us plenty. But football is about feelings not figures, and what’s special about Haaland is the fear he inspires in otherwise aggressive defenders and the joyful abandon that gives him, somehow apologetic and vicious at the same time – he knows it’s not fair but he’s glad it’s not fair, smile scrunching and expanding like a viking Les Dawson. Haaland isn’t the best at everything – there have been and still are defter and more imaginative centre-forwards. But the overall package of power and timing, of ravenousness and composure, are like nothing the game has ever seen – and he’s still getting better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/29/premier-league-2022-23-review-players-of-the-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From paintings stuck in cellars for centuries to acclaimed sculptures pointlessly destroyed, the art of women has been crowded out of galleries and public spaces. It’s time we stopped putting up with it</p><p>Last week I was speaking with an artist – highly regarded and in her 60s – when she began telling me about a recent incident with a male curator. She had been helping him install a show at a major institution when he realised the measurements for a large work of hers were off – he’d failed to double check the dimensions of the gallery. As a result, he asked if she could chop off a section of her large-scale artwork so it could fit. Understandably outraged, she declined, and the work didn’t end up in the show. But she also wondered whether the curator would have asked the same of a male artist – to butcher his own work to make it accommodate the space?</p><p>Women accommodate to a fault. But why have we been made to feel like this: guilty if we take up space; unpleasant if everything we do is not done with grace; demanding if we ask for what we want? It’s shocking to think that in 2023, the questioning of women’s authority – and the disbelief in what we are capable of – is still rife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/29/art-history-galleries-men-women">Continue reading...</a>

Mitsotakis has convinced many voters that he is returning Greece to stability after the turbulence of the 2010s – and part of the pitch is his claim to have all but ended refugee boat crossings from Turkey.</p><p>“We proved that the sea has borders, and those borders can and must be guarded,” Mitsotakis declared at a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/5/15/greeces-conservatives-campaign-on-firm-but-fair-refugee-policy">campaign event</a> on 12 May, at which he claimed his government had reduced “irregular” arrivals by 90%.

<p>The Rehearsal features regular people trying out different solutions to a problem. Isn’t that what we’re all doing much of the time?</p><p>The Rehearsal is an HBO documentary series in which the comedian Nathan Fielder guides strangers through an overwhelming domestic problem. The first episode opens with a man on a trivia team who wants to confess he lied for a decade about having a masters degree. Fielder has him practise the admission on an actor cast to look – and sound – like the team member he’s most intimidated by. To make it even more realistic, it all happens in a replica of the bar he plans to meet her in.</p><p>Every possible outcome of their discussion is imagined and accounted for. In times of unknown global turbulence<strong>,</strong> people have tended to surrender to the madness of ectoplasm, seances or, 100 years later, QAnon. But in allowing people to rehearse their own lives, Fielder guides vulnerable souls to emotional breakthrough via the pursuit of order. Using his blank presence he is, like a psychiatrist, their “tabula rasa” – a clean slate on to which these people can project.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/29/nathan-fielders-tv-show-moves-in-mysterious-ways">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One of the leading thinkers on artificial intelligence discusses responsibility, ‘moral outsourcing’ and bridging the gap between people and technology</p><p>Rumman Chowdhury often has trouble sleeping, but, to her, this is not a problem that requires solving. She has what she calls “2am brain”, a different sort of brain from her day-to-day brain, and the one she relies on for especially urgent or difficult problems. Ideas, even small-scale ones, require care and attention, she says, along with a kind of alchemic intuition. “It’s just like baking,” she says. “You can’t force it, you can’t turn the temperature up, you can’t make it go faster. It will take however long it takes. And when it’s done baking, it will present itself.”</p><p>It was Chowdhury’s 2am brain that first coined the phrase “moral outsourcing” for a concept that now, as one of the leading thinkers on artificial intelligence, has become a key point in how she considers accountability and governance when it comes to the potentially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/03/ai-could-be-as-transformative-as-industrial-revolution-patrick-vallance">revolutionary impact</a> of AI.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/29/rumman-chowdhury-interview-artificial-intelligence-accountability">Continue reading...</a>

<p>KD Davison’s hagiography of the ‘godfather of American avant garde cinema’ says much about his profound influence, but glosses over uncomfortable details about his early life</p><p>Hailed as “the godfather of American avant garde cinema”, Jonas Mekas led an extraordinary, multi-hyphenated career whose wide-ranging influence must have proved a challenge for a documentary to encompass. When Mekas arrived in New York as a Lithuanian exile in 1949, the first thing he bought was a Bolex camera. For the displaced immigrant, when language faltered images became a means of communication.</p><p>As Fragments of Paradise charts Mekas’s professional milestones – a critic, a film-maker, a curator, and so on – what emerges most movingly is his philosophy of creative togetherness. In founding Film Culture magazine, the Film-Makers’ Cooperative, and later on the Anthology Film Archives, Mekas succeeded in building a nurturing space for those forgotten by the mainstream. It’s the kind of community-oriented work reflecting the belief that, for him, the home is the cinema.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/29/fragments-of-paradise-review-broadly-sketched-portrait-of-film-maker-jonas-mekas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After two decades of work, work and more work, Ann Halloran decided it was time to leave her comfort zone. And it all began with a broken walking stick</p><p>One day last September, Ann Halloran made her way to her nearest bus stop in Hove, East Sussex, with a 15kg rucksack. She had done plenty of travelling but, at 65, was setting off alone on her first backpacking adventure. Somewhere between her first stop in Turkey and her final destination – a yoga retreat in Mazunte, Mexico – she found a new perspective.</p><p>In Nepal, climbing the 5,400m (17,575ft) Gokyo Ri in the Himalayas, Halloran broke her walking stick. She has osteoporosis, which makes bones more likely to break, so the stick was an essential piece of trekking kit in the mountains. Losing it was a blow, but she found reserves of inner strength: “I challenged myself,” she says. The setback was surmountable, a new stick was found. “It gave me confidence that at my age I could go up to that height.” Now, she says: “Whenever I get scared, I think of myself on top of that mountain, looking out over Lake Gokyo – and beyond that, Everest. I say, if you can do that, you can do anything.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/29/a-new-start-after-60-backpacking-in-the-himalayas-i-found-the-courage-to-change-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

## How would a home swap affect stamp duty and inheritance tax?

<p>We plan to exchange deeds and move into my mother-in-law’s new £700,000 house and she will switch to our £600,000 one</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I’m hoping you can shed light on an odd situation. My mother-in-law is selling her home and, with the proceeds, is buying a new one for £700,000. My wife and I and our children will be moving into this new house, and my mother-in-law will move into our current home, which is valued at £600,000. We plan to formalise the swap by exchanging deeds. Are we subject to any land tax or inheritance tax as the difference between the properties is £100,000? There are no mortgages on either property as we all own our properties outright.<br /><strong>RG</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> You will need to do more than just exchange deeds to formalise the swap. As with a normal house purchase, you will each need to use a solicitor to go through the standard conveyancing process. And you will have to pay stamp duty land tax (SDLT) on the market value of the property you are acquiring. Except that, according to the team of conveyancing solicitors at <a href="https://gordonbrownlaw.co.uk/">GB Law</a>, because the properties differ in value, you will both pay SDLT based on the highest value of the two properties (so the value of your mother-in-law’s new home). The SDLT would be based on the market value of each property if you “paid” your mother-in-law your home worth £600,000 plus £100,000 in cash as a balancing payment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/29/home-swap-stamp-duty-inheritance-tax">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An eight-day trek high in the Alps of France, Italy and Switzerland proves a stern test amid bad weather, snoring hikers and hangovers. But the views …</p><p>It was the penultimate day of my Tour du Mont Blanc and, as I scrambled up the side of the Aiguilles de l’Argentière, I was feeling smug. I’d ticked off more than 90 of the 105 miles, almost all in dazzling spring sunshine. Such luck with the weather was encouraging complacency. But up high, any hubris is ripe for a humbling. And the mountain gods were beginning to conspire.</p><p>The first hint of trouble came when I recognised the two fellow hikers coming the other way. In Tré-le-Champ, way below, we had drunk coffee at neighbouring tables and, realising we were on the same route, resolved to move on to beer when we saw each other again at the next refuge, La Flégère. So when I saw them marching back to the village, I stopped, assumed a quizzical face and asked: <em>Est-ce l</em><em>a bonne direction?</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/29/hiking-the-tour-du-mont-blanc-mountain-walking-france-alps">Continue reading...</a>

These beautiful cloud formations can often be seen during the summer months shining with an electric blue colour against the darkening western sky about 30 minutes after the sun sets.</p><p>The origin of the noctilucent clouds remains mysterious. They are the highest known clouds in Earth’s atmosphere, existing at an altitude of about 80km (50 miles), which is virtually the edge of space.

<p>When the UK finally goes to the polls, the British-Pakistani-Fijian daughter of a car mechanic could win the seat that Iain Duncan Smith has held for more than 30 years. Some would see that as proof that anyone can succeed – but not Shaheen</p><p>It was 12 December 2019; the first winter general election in Britain since 1923. Faiza Shaheen walked into Waltham Forest town hall in north-east London. The academic, economist, self-described inequality geek and Labour parliamentary candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green was about to find out if she had pulled off a feat so close to impossible that the odds were one in 10m. Had she – a working-class, Muslim, British-Pakistani-Fijian daughter of a car mechanic – toppled the former leader of the Conservative party, Iain Duncan Smith, in a seat that he had held for 27 years? A seat in which Tory values were so enshrined, it was previously held – albeit the boundaries had changed over the years – by Norman Tebbit and Winston Churchill. It was the perfect David versus Goliath battle. And then David lost.</p><p>“It was crushing,” says Shaheen. “One of those out-of-body experiences. They show you the results just before you go on stage and I was like: ‘Oh my God, we’ve lost.’ I could see my party, all these young people with so much hope on their faces, and I couldn’t look at them. When I saw Iain Duncan Smith go up, I just thought: ‘How can this be the outcome?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/29/social-mobility-is-a-fairytale-faiza-shaheen-on-fighting-for-labour-and-hating-oxford">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I couldn’t outrun my grief’: Julie Byrne on the death of her musical partner

<p>Singer-songwriter Julie Byrne’s friend and collaborator Eric Littmann died at 31. Yet the astonishing final record they made together is really about life</p><p>Julie Byrne precisely remembers the day she met the man who would change her life. “I loved him right away,” she says. It was the 2014 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas and Eric Littmann had helped engineer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-6UIDHoIGc&amp;ab_channel=PortalsMusic">an outdoor live session</a> by the then-emerging songwriter on a dry creek bed. “He always said he felt chosen by me, right out the gate,” she recalls. “I remember feeling so at ease in his presence.” At the creek, they paired off together. “We heard the call of a mourning dove and I asked him whose song that was and he told me.”</p><p>Today, mourning doves are common in Byrne’s New York neighbourhood, where she moved after Littmann’s untimely death in June 2021, at age 31. One often perches by her studio window. “As a bereaved person who’s always trying to figure out how to reach him, these are things that I experience as visitations,” she says, speaking by phone. “It doesn’t even feel so much like an association. It feels real, undeniable.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/julie-byrne-on-death-of-musical-partner-eric-littmann">Continue reading...</a>

All the promises made are gone forever,” the Belta news agency quoted Volfovich as telling an interviewer on state television.</p><p><strong>The EU’s spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, Nabila Massrali, has said Russia “will be held accountable” for attacks on civilian areas</strong>. “[Russian] leadership and perpetrators will be held accountable.
