And so come 16 June, in all likelihood, we will once again be treated to the sight of Anderson gingerly grimacing his way to the bowling crease: blisters popping in his boots, face writ with that peculiar mixture of acute discomfort and acute satisfaction. Anderson, more than any bowler of his generation, has learned to associate pain with reward. This thing is supposed to hurt.

The decline in prices was mostly driven by the abundance of available energy generated by renewable sources, combined with the relatively low demand for energy for heating or cooling, caused by normal springtime temperatures.</p><p>Negative prices often occur when there is an excess supply of electricity in the market. This can happen when renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydro produce a large quantity of electricity which exceeds demand and cannot be stored for later use. In such cases, producers may offer negative prices to incentivise wholesale consumers to take the surplus electricity off the grid and avoid overloading the system. This situation occurred due to an area of high pressure dominating across much of central and north-west Europe, providing lots of solar power generation across the area. Meanwhile, Finland experienced an oversupply of hydroelectric power resulting from excessive springtime meltwater which in turn led to negative prices here as well.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/29/weather-tracker-power-prices-dip-to-negative-in-europe-amid-clean-energy-boost\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/29/weather-tracker-power-prices-dip-to-negative-in-europe-amid-clean-energy-boost", "date_published": "2023-05-29 09:08:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Poem of the week: Life and Song by Sidney Lanier", "description": "<p>Imagining the poet as a kind of musical instrument is a somewhat dotty thought, but here the conceit resonates with irresistible musicality</p><p><strong>Life and Song</strong></p><p>\u201cIf life were caught by a clarionet,<br />And a wild heart, throbbing in the reed,<br />Should thrill its joy and trill its fret,<br />And utter its heart in every deed,<br /><br />\u201cThen would this breathing clarionet<br />Type what the poet fain would be;<br />For none o\u2019 the singers ever yet<br />Has wholly lived his minstrelsy,<br /><br />\u201cOr clearly sung his true, true thought,<br />Or utterly bodied forth his life,<br />Or out of life and song has wrought<br />The perfect one of man and wife;<br /><br />\u201cOr lived and sung, that Life and Song<br />Might each express the other\u2019s all,<br />Careless if life or art were long<br />Since both were one, to stand or fall:<br /><br />\u201cSo that the wonder struck the crowd,<br />Who shouted it about the land:<br />\u2018His song was only living aloud,<br />His work, a singing with his hand!\u2019\u201d<br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/29/poem-of-the-week-life-and-song-by-sidney-lanier\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/29/poem-of-the-week-life-and-song-by-sidney-lanier", "date_published": "2023-05-29 09:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Water is too boring\u2019?!
