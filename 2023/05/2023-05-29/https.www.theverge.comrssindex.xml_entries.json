Since Riot\u2019s announcement, many franchises have already dropped their amateur teams for the summer season, cutting off an important development pipeline for players who want to compete in the main League Championship Series (LCS). The vote, held by the LCSPA, which represents North American <em>League of Legends</em> esports players, passed \u201coverwhelmingly,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NALCSPA/status/1663039093557608448\">according to an early Monday tweet</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"yw9nkv\">It\u2019s unclear exactly when the walkout will take place, but assuming the two sides don\u2019t come to some sort of agreement, it seems likely it will happen at the start of the summer...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/29/23741567/league-of-legends-players-association-lcspa-walkout\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/29/23741567/league-of-legends-players-association-lcspa-walkout", "date_published": "2023-05-29 21:35:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "The Witcher is officially one of the most successful game series of all time", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"A screenshot from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzyynhRKV9DZXNsBkCAl1dh4cB4=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72322594/ss_5710298af2318afd9aa72449ef29ac4a2ef64d8e.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Image: CD Projekt Red</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"tSPcCp\"><em>The Witcher</em> is a juggernaut, and thanks to new data from <em>The Witcher</em> game developer CD Projekt Red (CDPR), we have a better idea of just how huge it really is. The studio revealed Monday that <em>The Witcher</em> video games have sold <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1663204245946900480\">more than 75 million copies</a>, with <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> alone responsible for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1663203765187485705\">more than 50 million of those sales</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"Fi4shA\">Those sorts of numbers mean that series is one of the biggest video game franchises of all time.
