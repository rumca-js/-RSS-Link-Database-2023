	Retired Army Sgt. Joe Cantasano <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@averagefloridaman/video/7234131559442566446" target="_blank">shared a vulnerable video of himself on TikTok</a>, expressing his frustrations with the health care he receives (or doesn't receive) from Veterans Affairs. When people point to the VA as an example of why the government has no place running this country's health care, this video is an example of why.
</p><p>
	Some of the issues Sgt. Cantasano is dealing with are issues other Americans deal with trying to stay with the same health care provider. There is one key difference though. The VAs one job is to make sure he doesn't have to.

## Ex-Disney Star Puts Entertainment Industry on Blast: ‘There’s a Reason You See People Dressed Up as Satan’

Basically, when I saw the video of her dragging <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whoopi-goldberg-hollywood-elitist" target="_self">Hollywood elites</a>, I decided to do a Google search. I might not have known her, maybe you don’t know who she is, but your kiddos just might. She’s been in a handful of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-aims-center-characters" target="_self">Disney</a> movies over the past decade. And she’s just taken to Twitter to blast Hollywood’s—how best to put this—<a href="https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/whitlock-a-lot-of-what-the-political-left-supports-is-satanic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Satanic proclivities</a>…</p><p>She lays it out in no uncertain terms just what she thinks about the toxic entertainment industry.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Ex Disney star China McClain talks about satanic worship in Hollywood. <br />"They know full well that God exists" she says. “They also know that Satan exists. They are just counting on you all not to know. But either way, the things that you take in that they’re feeding you. <a href="https://t.co/nTKFkY69W0">pic.twitter.com/nTKFkY69W0</a><br />— ContraMari66 (@ContraMari66) <a href="https://twitter.com/ContraMari66/status/1605651758784647187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>“The entertainment industry is about influence. There is a reason why you see people dressed up as Satan. Full-on visuals of Satan, people dressed as Satan, dressed as a demon, got upside-down crosses all on [their] clothes, or <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/rapper-lil-nas-x-rolls-out-line-of-bloody-satan-shoes-to-coincide-with-new-song-about-demonic-sex" target="_blank">pentagrams all on their clothes</a>. […] They know good and god-darn well that God exists. They also know that Satan exists. They’re just counting on the fact that y’all don’t know that.”<br /></p><p>A few years ago, I would simply assume Ms. McClain here had just decided she wasn’t going to take her meds anymore, but this is 2022, and I cannot say this is even the craziest thing I’ve heard this week. A <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/satanic-temple-elementary-schools" target="_self">satanic cult</a> in the entertainment industry is far more believable than human beings magically changing their genders based on how they feel when they wake up.</p><p>This might also explain why someone like Lil Nas X is able to get famous giving lap dances to a literal Satan figure. Or why Disney child stars always seem so messed up in the head. Or a litany of other things we see in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Do I believe McClain’s rant? I’m inclined to. But then, I already believed nearly every person in Hollywood and such were a bunch of godless heathens.</p>

They grab the first photo that comes up in Google search, write a generic message about never forgetting something or the other, and call it a day. Some of them may have even written the generic message themselves! Then you have people like Chris Pratt who actually cares about the holiday and the importance of making sure people KNOW what the holiday means.

Pratt not only shares respect for our fallen heroes but also a concern for our country if we don't effectively teach what their sacrifice actually means. It's almost as if he's been paying attention.

</p><p>Amen, brother.</p><p>I won't say we need more celebrities like Chris Pratt. I'm sure there are more than a few who agree with him and disagree with the viewpoint commonly associated with their Hollywood peers. It would be nice if more of them had the courage to be Chris Pratt out loud.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>Thought in PawPaW's defense, he wasn't the only security guard who stood around doing nothing.

<p>The investigative team at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website is unable to confirm if these ladies at least made it through opening act Cody Johnson (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5KG9qBHGW8" target="_blank">who just released a killer version of George Strait's "Troubadour"</a>), or if this fight took place prior to the event starting. They could also be the type of people who buy concert tickets and pound drinks instead of showing love to the openers. I hate those people.</p><p>I could understand it <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-tampa-viral-brawl" target="_blank">popping off like this at a Waffle House</a>, or whatever Canada's version of the Waffle House is. The fact two people can be this unable to calm down at a Luke Combs concert is further evidence that every day we stray further from God.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
