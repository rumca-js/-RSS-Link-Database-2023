Compared with ULMB, which it released in 2015, the company says the latest version offers nearly twice as much brightness, along with almost no <a href="https://blurbusters.com/faq/advanced-strobe-crosstalk-faq/"><ins>crosstalk</ins></a> — the strobing or double-image effect that sometimes appears when blur reduction features are enabled.</p><p>Motion clarity is largely determined by the monitor's pixel response time. To improve matters, NVIDIA is using "full refresh rate backlight strobing," which builds on the backlight strobing technique from the original ULMB. Although the previous version of the tech improved motion clarity for many, it needed to switch off the monitor's backlight 75 percent of the time. This reduced the brightness of the screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7432f425eb7346beb05b04e2c8b4e758"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>With ULMB 2, NVIDIA is able to match the display's refresh rate when it turns the backlight on and off. The aim is to only turn the backlight on when pixels are at the correct color value for each frame. This mitigates crosstalk, as you shouldn't see pixels when they're transitioning to the accurate color.</p><p>This approach <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ulmb2-boosting-motion-quality-1400hz-nvidia"><ins>wasn't really possible</ins></a> with the slower pixel refresh rates of older monitors. ULMB 2 is able to run at the full refresh rate of current displays. On a 360Hz display, each backlight strobe happens every 2.7 milliseconds — a rate that's imperceptible to the human eye.</p><p>What this all boils down to is NVIDIA being able to offer more brightness and an effective motion clarity of over 1000Hz. If you use a 360Hz monitor with ULMB 2 on, NVIDIA says you'll get an effective motion clarity of 1440Hz. The company claims that, without ULMB 2, you'd need a monitor that's capable of 1440Hz to get equivalent motion clarity. Given that we've <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-500-hz-gaming-monitor-ips-g-sync-170047975.html"><ins>only recently</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-swift-is-the-first-500-hz-gaming-monitor-104132755.html"><ins>started seeing</ins></a> 500Hz monitors, mass-market 1440Hz displays seem quite a ways off.</p><p>NVIDIA offered some brief demos of ULMB 2 in action. In the video below, you'll see what a motorcycle pursuit sequence looks like in slow-motion at 360 frames per second with the feature both off and on.</p><div id="c6c4470966e6408e8293456cfa8b2251"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>ULMB 2 is available now as a free update for compatible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-reflex-1440p-360hz-gaming-monitor-1080p-mode-162014715.html">1440p, 360Hz G-Sync monitors</a>. Only two such displays are on the market at the minute, NVIDIA says: the Acer Predator XB273U and the ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQN, both of which are 27-inch monitors. The ASUS ROG Swift Pro PG248QP (a 25-inch 1080p, 540Hz display) and the 27-inch AOC AGON AG276QSG G-Sync Monitor are also compatible, and they'll be available soon.</p><p>NVIDIA announced ULMB 2 alongside some AI developments at Computex.

## ARM's latest CPUs push Android phone makers toward 64-bit only devices

<p>ARM just sent a not-so-subtle warning to Android phone makers still hanging on to 32-bit technology. The company has <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2023/05/new-arm-total-compute-solutions-enable-mobile-future-built-on-arm">introduced</a> its first lineup of CPU core designs that are exclusively 64-bit — unlike last year, there's no legacy tech for vendors to use. The Cortex-X4, Cortex-A720 and Cortex-A520 don't always represent major leaps in performance, but they're likely to set the pace for Android in the near future.</p><p>The Cortex-X4, like the X3, is a performance core aimed at flagship phones. Its updated architecture delivers a 15 percent claimed higher performance, but uses 40 percent less power than its predecessor. That translates to faster app launches and a more responsive interface, according to ARM. We also wouldn't be surprised if this led to improved battery life in games and other intensive tasks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the Cortex-A720 is a sequel to the A715 &quot;middle&quot; core that handles most computing chores.  While it is faster, the focus is on longevity. ARM claims the A720 is over 20 percent more power efficient than last year's design. Chipmakers can even use a smaller 'entry' version to cut costs or shrink their hardware.</p><p>We wouldn't discount the Cortex-A520 efficiency core. While it's ultimately meant for background processing and other low-demand duties, it's reportedly 22 percent more efficient than the A510 it's replacing while managing eight percent better performance. Your phone might last longer even if you aren't a heavy-duty user.</p><p>Yes, ARM is also paying attention to graphics performance. It's simultaneously launching Immortalis-G720, Mali-G720 and Mali-G620 GPU designs that again offer more performance with a reduced power draw. They notably introduce a deferred vertex shading (DVS) pipeline that uses much less bandwidth (33 percent less in the demanding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/genshin-impact-version-3-0-update-august-24-193517039.html"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>), leaving room for more complex scenes and HDR visuals. The Immortalis is said to offer an average 15 percent jump in performance over its predecessor, even as it's 15 percent more efficient. It supports 10 or more cores, while the Mali-G720 supports six to nine cores. The G620 is the budget offering with five cores or less.</p><p>ARM hasn't named customers. As virtually the entire mobile industry is built around ARM, though, we'd expect Qualcomm, MediaTek and others to use the new Cortex designs as starting points for their next system-on-chip models. Whether or not Apple uses it isn't clear. Although Apple uses ARM, it hasn't yet made the leap to the newer ARMV9 architecture.</p><p>It's safe to say this will influence the Android market, at least. While Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-04-apple-stops-showing-32-bit-ios-apps-in-searches.html">cut off support for 32-bit hardware</a> and apps with iOS 11's release in 2017, <em>AnandTech</em><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18871/arm-unveils-armv92-mobile-architecture-cortex-x4-a720-and-a520-64bit-exclusive">notes</a> that Android has moved relatively slowly, with Chinese brands like Oppo and Xiaomi holding on to 32-bit capable SoCs for a particularly long time. The new ARM range effectively pushes those companies to upgrade — either they use pure 64-bit SoCs or risk being left behind.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/arms-latest-cpus-push-android-phone-makers-toward-64-bit-only-devices-165606654.html?src=rss

## Tesla will open its Supercharger network to other EVs in Canada

<p>Tesla's plan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-open-up-7500-charging-stations-to-other-evs-by-2024-115527953.html">open up Superchargers</a> is now extending to Canada after the government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2023/05/minister-wilkinson-provides-spring-update-on-support-for-canadian-ev-economy-announces-nearly-3000-new-chargers-in-ontario.html">revealed</a> that the company will open access to some of its existing Supercharger network to other brands' EVs. The effort starts later this year with a pilot route between the capital city of Ottawa and Sudbury. There will be 750 opened stations by the end of 2025, and &quot;at least&quot; 350 of those will be speedy 250kW Superchargers. That performance is important given the focus on long-distance travel — the open charger route will include a very large Trans-Canada Highway stretch between Ottawa and Calgary.</p><p>The announcement comes alongside a plan to make EV chargers more accessible in the country. The government is teaming up with partners to help install nearly 3,000 EV chargers in multi-use residential buildings, offices, public places and fleets. Most of them (1,908) will be modest Level 2 chargers, but this will include 100 Level 3 chargers. Funding is going toward five ongoing projects installing as many as 1,328 EV chargers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Canadian news comes just as Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-drivers-will-get-access-to-12000-north-american-tesla-superchargers-next-spring-221752191.html?guccounter=1">promised Ford EV drivers access</a> to 12,000 North American Superchargers starting in spring 2024. Ford is also switching to Tesla's open-source charge port standard with 2025 model year cars. This is in addition to previous efforts to open Superchargers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-open-up-7500-charging-stations-to-other-evs-by-2024-115527953.html">in the US</a> and Europe. While this isn't ubiquitous coverage, it could be reassuring if you want a non-Tesla EV but are worried about inconsistent charger quality.</p><p>Canada isn't a major EV hub like the US or China, but it's taking steps to make itself an industry cornerstone. Volkswagen will build its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-will-build-its-first-north-american-ev-battery-plant-in-canada-172720275.html">first North American EV battery plant</a> in southern Ontario. A deal for a Stellantis EV battery plant is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/dilkens-petition-stellantis-1.6856008">on shaky ground</a>, but could be influential if it goes through. Add the country's existing car manufacturing base and it may play an important role going forward. Not that the nation has much choice — if it's going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canada-combustion-engine-car-ban-2035-154623071.html">ban sales of combustion engine passenger cars</a> by 2035, it needs to foster demand for EVs well in advance.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-open-its-supercharger-network-to-other-evs-in-canada-150057481.html?src=rss

<p>WhatsApp's newest update takes a page out of work-centric video call platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The messaging app is in the process of rolling out a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-huddles-video-screen-sharing-130033179.html">screen sharing</a> feature that will record and display the contents of your screen with whoever is on the other end of the video call, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-11-19-whats-new/"><em>WABetaInfo</em> reports</a>.</p><p>An icon of a phone with an arrow pointing out of it represents the feature and sits alongside longstanding tools like switching cameras, muting and disabling video that appear at the bottom of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-on-windows-now-supports-up-to-eight-people-in-video-calls-105523148.html">WhatsApp calls</a>. Once you click the new button, a prompt appears asking if you want to &quot;Start recording or casting with WhatsApp?&quot; alongside a disclaimer that the company will have access to any passwords, photos or payment details you display. If you're okay with that, all that's left is to click &quot;Start now.&quot; You can then stop sharing your screen at any time during the call.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Screen sharing is only available to select Android beta testers right now but should roll out to more users in the coming weeks. However, it might not work on older Android models, bigger group calls or with people who don't have WhatsApp's latest version downloaded. If you have an iPhone or iPad and don't feel tied to WhatsApp, Apple baked a similar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-share-screen-facetime-143556350.html">screen sharing feature into FaceTime calls</a> in January.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-test-brings-screen-sharing-to-android-phones-135041152.html?src=rss

## NVIDIA's generative AI lets gamers converse with NPCs

<p>NVIDIA has unveiled technology called <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ace-for-games-sparks-life-into-virtual-characters-with-generative-ai">Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE)</a> that would allow gamers to speak naturally to non-playable characters (NPCs) and receive appropriate responses. The company revealed the tech during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-next-dgx-supercomputer-is-all-about-generative-ai-043053544.html">generative AI keynote</a> at Computex 2023, showing a demo called <em>Kairos</em> with a playable character speaking to an NPC named Jin in a dystopic-looking Ramen shop.&nbsp;</p><p>The demo (below in 32:9, the widest widescreen I've ever seen) shows the player carrying on a conversation with Jin. "Hey Jin, how are you," the person asks. "Unfortunately, not so good," replies Jin. "How come?" " I am worried about the crime around here. It's gotten bad lately. My ramen shop got caught in the crossfire."&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3a5041e38aa64d80b590b39ae943d563"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Yes, the dialogue is a tad wooden; it seems like ChatGPT might have done a better job. Still, the idea is to show that you could just speak into your headset and an NPC will answer in the proper context, making for a more natural interaction than you'd usually get in such a situation.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA made the demo in partnership with Convai to promote ACE, which can run both in the cloud and locally (on NVIDIA hardware, natch). It uses NVIDIA NeMo for building, customizing and deploying large language models that can be customized with lore and character backstories, while using guardrails to protect against inappropriate conversations. It also deploys a speech recognition and speech-to-text tool called Riva, along with NVIDIA's Omniverse Audio2Face "for instantly creating expressive facial animation of a game character to match any speech track."</p><p>The demo was built in Unreal Engine 5 to show off NVIDIA's ray-tracing and other GPU features. The visuals are actually more compelling than the AI dialogue, though it's easy to see how the latter could be improved enormously. NVIDIA didn't announce any games that will use the tech, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-20223-release-date-204512203.html"><em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl</em></a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzE5MzE3MzAvRm9ydF9Tb2xpcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI2OTM3YzM4LTQ1MWQtNDc5Yy1iZTljLTNlMGIzZWYwMjI5ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAf8gDDn1YT0MlJkKjwH_X38O38neebiUBgTx4q-_b2Pi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1931730%2FFort_Solis%2F"><em>Fort Solis</em></a> will employ Omniverse Audio2Face.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-generative-ai-lets-gamers-converse-with-npcs-124552730.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Japan will try to beam solar power from space by 2025

<p>JAXA, Japan’s NASA equivalent, has spent decades trying to make it possible to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japan-will-try-to-beam-solar-power-from-space-by-2025-214338244.html">beam solar energy from space</a> – which seems like technology for a far-future space anime. In 2015,  JAXA scientists successfully beamed 1.8 kilowatts of power, enough energy to power an electric kettle 50 meters away, wirelessly. Now, a Japanese public–private partnership will attempt to beam solar energy from space as early as 2025. The project involves deploying into orbit a series of small satellites, which will beam collected solar energy to ground-based receiving stations hundreds of miles away.</p><p>While this already seems a huge step up from a kettle 50 meters away, it’s just the start of the challenge. Creating a satellite array that can generate 1 gigawatt of power – or about the output of one nuclear reactor – is estimated to cost around $7 billion with current technologies.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## NASA's SLS rocket is $6 billion over budget and six years behind schedule

<p>NASA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-nasa-sls-rocket-ever-unveiled.html">Space Launch System (SLS) rocket</a> designed to take astronauts to the moon is over budget and far behind it's original schedule, according to a scathing new <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-23-015.pdf">audit</a> from NASA's Inspector General. Furthermore, the report foresees &quot;additional cost and schedule increases&quot; that could potentially jeopardize the entire Artemis mission if problems aren't handled.&nbsp;</p><p>NASA's spending on the Artemis Moon Program is expected to reach $93 billion by 2025, including $23.8 billion already spent on the SLS system through 2022. That sum represents &quot;$6 billion in cost increases and over six years in schedule delays above NASA’s original projections,&quot; the report states.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The SLS, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-nasas-latest-artemis-1-launch-attempt-here-020044428.html">finally launched</a> for the first time in November 2022, uses four RS-25 engines per launch, including 16 salvaged from retired Space Shuttles. Once those run out (all engines on SLS are expendable), NASA will switch to RS-25E engines being built by Aerojet Rocketdyne, which are supposed to be 30 percent cheaper and 11 percent more powerful. It also uses solid rocket boosters provided by Northrop Grumman.&nbsp;</p><p>The older technology isn't helping with the budget as NASA expected, though. &quot;These increases are caused by interrelated issues such as assumptions that the use of heritage technologies from the Space Shuttle and Constellation Programs were expected to result in significant cost and schedule savings compared to developing new systems for the SLS,&quot; the audit states. &quot;However, the complexity of developing, updating, and integrating new systems along with heritage components proved to be much greater than anticipated.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, only 5 of the 16 engine adaptations have been completed, and scope and cost increases have hit the booster contract as well. The latter has been the biggest issue, increasing from $2.5 billion to $4.4 billion since Artemis was announced, and delaying the schedule by five years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Inspector General also blames the use of &quot;cost-plus&quot; contracts that allow suppliers to inflate budgets more easily, instead of fixed-priced contracts. The report recommends that upcoming work be shifted to a fixed-price regime and that procurement issues be resolved, among others. NASA management has agreed to all eight recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>The Artemis moon mission project was based on the Constellation program, originally launched in 2005 with the goal of returning to the moon by 2020 and eventually, Mars. Cancellation of that project by the Obama administration was met with widespread criticism, largely because the program guaranteed jobs around the US.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, introduced the same year, mandated construction of the SLS and requiring the repurposing of existing technology, contracts and workforce from Constellation. It also required partnerships with private space companies. SpaceX, for one, is developing its own Starship rocket system, also capable of carrying astronauts to the Moon and Mars. However, Starship exploded on its first orbital launch mission, and may not fly again soon due to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacexs-starship-didnt-immediately-respond-to-a-self-destruct-command-120010127.html">issues with the self-destruct command</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-wants-to-join-the-faa-as-defendant-in-environmental-groups-starship-lawsuit-061134095.html">considerable damage</a> it did to local ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasas-sls-rocket-is-6-billion-over-budget-and-six-years-behind-schedule-091432515.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nvidia/"><ins>NVIDIA</ins></a> CEO Jensen Hiang made a string of announcements during his Computex keynote, including details about the company’s next DGX supercomputer. Given where the industry is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-microsoft-build-2023-keynote-in-under-10-minutes-202055599.html">clearly</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-everything-announced-at-the-event-193758196.html">heading</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the DGX GH200 is largely about helping companies develop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/generative-ai/"><ins>generative AI</ins></a> models.</p><p>The supercomputer uses a new NVLink Switch System to enable 256 GH200 Grace Hopper superchips to act as a single GPU (each of the chips has an Arm-based Grace CPU and an H100 Tensor Core GPU). This, according to NVIDIA, allows the DGX GH200 to deliver 1 exaflop of performance and to have 144 terabytes of shared memory. The company says that's nearly 500 times as much memory as you'd find in a single DGX A100 system.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For comparison, the <a href="https://www.top500.org/news/frontier-remains-sole-exaflop-machine-and-retains-top-spot-improving-upon-its-previous-hpl-score/"><ins>latest ranking</ins></a> of the Top500 supercomputers lists <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-retakes-first-place-on-top-500-supercomputer-ranking-082342025.html"><ins>Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee</ins></a> as the only known exascale system, having reached a performance of nearly 1.2 exaflops on the Linmark benchmark. That's over twice the peak performance of the second-placed system, Japan's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japan-fugaku-supercomputer-013121699.html"><ins>Fugaku</ins></a>.</p><p>In effect, NVIDIA claims to have developed a supercomputer that can stand alongside the most powerful known system on the planet (Meta is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-ai-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-rsc-184644623.html">building one</a> that it claims will be the fastest AI supercomputer in the world once it’s fully built out). NVIDIA says the architecture of the DGX GH200 offers 10 times more bandwidth than the previous generation, &quot;delivering the power of a massive AI supercomputer with the simplicity of programming a single GPU.&quot;</p><p>Some big names are interested in the DGX GH200. Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft should be among the first companies to gain access to the supercomputer to test how it can handle generative AI workloads. NVIDIA says DGX GH200 supercomputers should be available by the end of 2023.</p><p>The company is also building its own supercomputer, Helios, that combines four DGX GH200 systems. NVIDIA expects Helios to be online by the end of the year.</p><p>Huang discussed other generative AI developments during his keynote, including one on the gaming front. NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games is a service developers will be able to tap into in order to create custom AI models for speech, conversation and animation. NVIDIA says ACE for Games can &quot;give non-playable characters conversational skills so they can respond to questions with lifelike personalities that evolve.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-next-dgx-supercomputer-is-all-about-generative-ai-043053544.html?src=rss
