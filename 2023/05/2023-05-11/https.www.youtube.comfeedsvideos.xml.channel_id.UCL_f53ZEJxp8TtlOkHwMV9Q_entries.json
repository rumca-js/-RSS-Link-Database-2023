All of Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and twelve-time All-American female swimmer Riley Gaines discuss the insemination of men into women's spaces. Gaines breaks down the breach in security that women face when forced to share vulnerable spaces with biological men, the purpose of athletic achievement, why segregation of the sexes has genuine merit, and what exactly went down at San Francisco State University.\n\nRiley Gaines is an American athlete and female rights activist. Gaines is a graduate from the University of Kentucky, where she was a twelve-time All-American swimmer. She competed and tied with trans-identifying swimmer Lia Thomas at their NCAA championships and was unfairly sidelined from the awards ceremony. She has spoken to numerous teammates and administrators who do not think this attack on female sports is fair, and more importantly, do not feel this invasion by men into female spaces is remotely safe. Gaines has become an outspoken female rights activist, advocating for the protection of women's spaces, sports, and achievements, and has proven herself unshakable even when faced with a dangerous mob.\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nMoink: Get FREE bacon in your first Moink order today!\nhttp://www.MoinkBox.com/JBP\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Riley Gaines:\n\nWebsite: https://rileygaines.com/\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Riley_Gaines_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:24) Intro\n(2:25) Riley\u2019s credibility as an athlete\n(7:28) Obsessive dedication and unmatched discipline\n(11:49) Why ambition is not selfish\n(14:25) Grace in defeat\n(16:09) Lessons only sport can teach you\n(19:35 The necessary attributes of a team captain\n(21:47) Alignment of interest despite individual goals\n(23:23) Navigating leadership on an all female team\n(29:01) Masculine versus feminine mindset in sports\n(30:36) Why sports don\u2019t have radical equality\n(34:09) The purpose of high level competition\n(35:23) Should any domains be sex segregated?\n(42:33) What you give up for athletic success\n(48:28) Men in women\u2019s sports\n(53:22) Riley\u2019s first competition against Lea Thomas\n(1:04:56) The psychology of knowing you won\u2019t win even when you win\n(1:08:13) Derealization, and those who Lea Thomas has displaced\n(1:12:49) Lea Thomas is a narcissist\n(1:21:22) Invading the locker room, the failure of administrators\n(1:30:34) SFSU: the whole story of the viral incident\n(1:48:26) Riley Gaines will not back down\n(1:52:19) We must advocate for change\n\n\nEp.356\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08DSMeEpQyY", "date_published": "2023-05-11 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
