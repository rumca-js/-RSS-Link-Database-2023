Unless it's men dressed like women performing like they would for suburban soccer moms in bars, but doing it in an elementary school auditorium, it's not tolerant enough. All they have to do is put the words "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/back-to-school-jenna-tailia" target="_blank">family-friendly</a>" in front of "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-meeting-mom-dresses" target="_blank">drag queen</a>," making it a-ok.</p><p>One mother was not impressed. She wanted to know from her school board if they know what the words "family-friendly" mean.

Yet those aren't "family-friendly." Not yet. I'm sure if parents said they didn't want their kids going to the Jiggy Room, five different California school boards would make it a requirement to graduate the eighth grade.<br /></p><blockquote>What is it about a grown man, and I honestly, sincerely as a woman, mean this, what is it about a grown man costumed in a sparkly bra with augmented boobs busting out a leather mini skirt barely covering his twerking ass with tuck-tape on the front spreading his fish-netted legs as he writhes on the ground, grinding his groin NEXT TO A MINOR, that's "family-friendly"?</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>What it all boils down to is that teachers' unions and the school boards they stuff union shills with hate parents. They aren't crazy about kids. But they really hate parents. The more parents get upset about something, the more the school boards double down on it to be spiteful. This is why "drag shows" have become the focal point of comprehensive sexual education. And why "comprehensive sexual education" has become the cornerstone of the progressive agenda.</p><p>Parents say it's inappropriate and that their kids should not be indoctrinated with this garbage. The school boards say "f*ck them kids." Then they cry when parents get angry and run against them. All the more reason for parents to be spiteful and triple down on both.</p><p><p><em>Facebook doesn't want you reading this post or any others lately.

## Anheuser-Busch takes another massive hit when major bank downgrades the company's stock

Fair question, and one that the pile of PENN stock I'm sitting on shows I'm not qualified to answer. Thought we might get more of an answer soon. Anheuser-Busch's stock has just been downgraded to a HOLD.</p><p>Carlos Laboy, a managing director at HSBC’s global beverage sector, says you don't want to sell the stock you have, but definitely don't buy any more. After the words WORST marketing decision has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/clay-travis-beer-experiment" target="_blank">led to people embarrassed to be seen with your product</a> -- even for free -- <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/10/anheuser-busch-stock-downgraded-over-bud-light-crisis/" target="_blank">AB has some 'splaining to do</a> before anyone invests further in the company.</p><p><em>“Why did its US leadership underestimate the risk of pushback given the recent experience of other firms?” </em></p><p><em>“Is A-B hiring the best people to grow the brands and gauge risk?”</em></p><p><em>“If Budweiser and Bud Light are iconic American ideas that have long brought consumers together, why did these marketers fail to invite new consumers without alienating the core base of the firm’s largest brand?”</em></p><p>Let me take a step at answering these: 1. because the people hired to do these jobs <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-free-beer" target="_blank">live in a leftist bubble with other "professionals" living in a leftist bubble</a>, 2. no, and 3. the marketers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing" target="_blank">hate the core base of the firm's largest brand</a>.</p><p>My assumption is that other companies will start answering those questions themselves because we're in uncharted waters here. The way it worked pre-Bud Light is that the companies only cared about the opinions of radical progressives demanding their every worldview be validated by every company in America. Normal people were left wondering why their favorite brand is bending over to radical progressive politics. Or why did the MLB All-Star game got moved out of Atlanta.</p><p>This is the first time normal, middle-of-the-road voters have spoken out. It's costing Budweiser its title as America's #1 beer. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/coca-cola-shareholders-vote" target="_blank">And other brands are beginning to notice</a>.</p><p>From here on out, companies are going to have to do the risk assessment and decided if alienating the bulk of its audience by pandering to a small minority of woke leftists is worth it. The answer is now no.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: All-girl street fight comes to an abrupt end when security guard with zero patience lets the pepper spray fly

It's nighttime in some city in America. A bunch of girls broke out into a massive street brawl. He had to interfere somehow. Turns out, he has an itchy pepper spray finger.</p><p>And then he walks away.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The cop just walks in there and pepper sprays everyone and walks away, like "job's done." <a href="https://t.co/tQyZLwgkjP">pic.twitter.com/tQyZLwgkjP</a><br />— Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1656666463221211139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Standard viral video rules apply. Allow for missing context. The video starts when the fight had already broken out and it is unclear what set it off. There could have been an argument about Ukraine. Maybe there was a dispute over if Joe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Maybe someone stole someone else's man. Who can say? The only thing we know is that the time for talk was over and the time to throw hands was now.</p>

</p>
<p>This is where Paul Blart Jr. arrives on the scene. And again, allow for missing context. We don't know if he was assigned to keep the piece outside of whatever store that was. He could have been in the right place at the wrong time. Without knowing the city, perhaps it goes down on sight like this nightly. It's the non-challantness of it all that makes this at least 8/10 content.</p><p>It's almost as if our dude happened to be walking down the street, dispensed his pepper spray when he saw the fight, and walked away as if it was no big deal. Like Tom Cruise walking away from an explosion in slow motion.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>I'm sure there are critics who will be chirping about his techniques, but what do you want from the guy? He didn't use his gun. He didn't taze anyone. It was a few squirts and the fight was over. A job well done.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Aubrey Plaza's "wood milk" ad mocking a plant-based lifestyle has leftists outraged, or are they?

Because if you can extract milk from an almond, you can extract milk from wood. It's all about living that sustainable lifestyle. Know what I mean?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>The commercial is satire, released by the same people who brought you the "Got Milk?" ads. <a href="https://notthebee.com/article/got-wood-milk-aubrey-plazas-hilarious-commercial-satirizing-plant-based-milks-has-the-left-crying-about-big-dairy" target="_blank">Shout out to Not the Bee</a> for first introducing me to wood milk.

</p>
<p>Leftists were outraged by the mockery of their nut milk. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2023/05/08/embarrassing-wood-milk-campaign-shows-why-congress-must-end-forced-farm-advertising/?sh=31799e6a71a4" target="_blank">Forbes</a> cried about the " disappointed fans expressing their disapproval.." <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/5/23709822/milk-dairy-plant-based-meat-soy-almond-fake-processed" target="_blank">Vox</a> rambled on about "very real harms of dairy production." To validate how outraged people were, I searched Twitter to meet <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/scooby-doo-velma-video-game" target="_self">mainstream journalisming standard</a> of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl-outrage" target="_self">three idiots sharing the same dumb opinion</a>. First, I searched Twitter for "nut milk." I WOULD NOT suggest you do the same.</p><p>Then I searched "Aubrey Plaza." No outrage. There were Aubrey Plaza stan tweets.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Aubrey Plaza <a href="https://t.co/cH7RoJcdt2">pic.twitter.com/cH7RoJcdt2</a><br />— Celebrity Queens (@celebrityqueene) <a href="https://twitter.com/celebrityqueene/status/1653147889064099847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>And apparently, the actress slayed at the Met Gala.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">MOTHER <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetGala?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetGala</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AubreyPlaza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AubreyPlaza</a> <a href="https://t.co/RenFGqUKMB">pic.twitter.com/RenFGqUKMB</a><br />— LAQUESO PORTE (@laquesoporte1) <a href="https://twitter.com/laquesoporte1/status/1653244082972676096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Yet no one was outraged about her Nut Milk. Then I noticed the alleged outrage was from comments of an Instagram post from LAST MONTH. It was Vox and Forbes attempting to bring it back with their recent content. When the "outrage" was happening, no one knew about it.</p><p>The Bud Light outrage is legit. Look no further than the stock being downgraded today. But alleged outrage over a dairy commercial was so non-existent, leftists need to dig it up again.</p><p>It's similar to Aubrey's former husband Chris Pratt (there's that <em>Parks</em> reference). "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-james-gunn-thor" target="_self">Cancel Chris for being Christian</a>" was all the rage on Twitter. Elon Musk fired the Marxist twats who decided what trends. Now, all of a sudden, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-cancelled-twitter" target="_self">there isn't as much energy to cancel "the worst Chris" anymore</a>. Go figure.</p><p>So, yes. Leftists are outraged over Aubrey in the same way the Internet Wrestling Community is outraged any time you criticize AEW. They bang their stubby fingers away in comment sections, but IRL people don't care. It makes you wonder how much of the things we're told people are "outraged" over are the result of a tiny minority of people manipulating trends because they're the angry ones.</p><p><p><em>Facebook doesn't want you reading this post or any others lately.

<p>This is what the left does. They want people to believe the issue is with gay cabaret performers doing a routine to Lady Gaga's "Poker Face" for the entertainment of adults.

## Bitter vegan to neighbor: Please close your window when you cook meat, the delicious smells are triggering

EV owners <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ration-energy-ev-neighbors-flyer" target="_blank">demanding the rest of the block use less electricity</a> are up there. The bitter old hag complaining that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doorbell-camera-wife-neighbor-clothes" target="_blank">her neighbor is too hot and doesn't wear enough clothes</a> gets the silver metal. But these Australian vegans wanting their neighbor to control the wind because meat smells hurt their tum-tums tops the list.</p><p>Some bloke (Aussie Aussie Aussie) was making steak (Oi Oi Oi) in his own kitchen, when a note was left on his door. Our carnivorous friend <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/vegans-confront-aussie-neighbour-over-cooking-meat-makes-us-feel-sick-064558069.html" target="_blank">shared it on the Hey Peth Facebook group</a> out of disbelief. Pro-tip: if you ever want or expect me to take your note seriously, whatever you do, do NOT write this on the envelope:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c9d20" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33645309&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>It gets better.</p><blockquote>Hello neighbour, could you please shut your side window when cooking please.  My family are vegan (we eat only plant based foods) and the smell of the meat you cook makes us feel sick and upset.  We would appreciate your understanding.</blockquote><p>Signed Sarah, Wayne, and the Kids. I'm going to go on a limb and say Sarah both wrote the letter AND wears the pants in the family. Because he is so deprived of meat, Wayne lacks the upper body strength to fight it anymore. He also wishes the neighbor would invite him over the next time he's having cheeseburgers.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>It's the smugness of the note that drives home just how vegan these vegans are. Sarah's sense of entitlement led her to demand her neighbor close HIS window instead of her closing her window. And the fact that she is such a douchebag she felt she had to explain vegan meant "plant-based" was a nice touch.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>The response to the meat eater's post was refreshing. It's Australia, so you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/top-5-australia" target="_blank">would have reason to believe the police raided his house and sent him to a plant-based reeducation camp</a>.  Instead, people called for a cookout.</p><p>"Should definitely shut the window and then cook on the bbq right next to the fence."<br /></p><p>"Time for a huge bbq....whole street is invited."</p><p>"Jesus… what is the world coming to when you can't cook a steak in your own kitchen."</p><p>If it's me, I'm (respectfully) NOT taking it seriously as requested. Instead, I'm buying a ten-pound brisket. I'm keeping an eye on the weather to see when it isn't too windy to affect the cook but just windy enough to be a dick. And then I'm smoking it low a slow starting at around 4:00 in the morning so the entire block can enjoy the smell for the next twelve hours or so. </p><p>Possibly while playing AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" on a continuous loop. It all depends on Sarah getting the soy out of her vag.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
