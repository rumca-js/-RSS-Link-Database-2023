The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch.

This is an unfathomable sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas with an alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds.

In today’s Daily Fix:

Nintendo has revealed that the traditional ‘themed’ dungeons of previous Zelda games will make their return in Tears of the Kingdom. One of the (albeit slight) criticisms of Breath of the Wild was the lack of big, old-school dungeons, and the four Divine Beasts were not that much different from each other. In PlayStation news, Sony has revealed May’s free games coming to the PS Plus Extra and Premiere tiers. Over at Electronic Arts, the CEO and COO addressed the rise of A.I. in the games industry, comparing it to major events like the Industrial Revolution. And finally, one of our favorite games of 2021 is finally Steam Deck verified…and on sale! It’s your Daily Fix!

## Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Wants You To Cry

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 makes James Gunn’s understanding of the fact that without the small the big doesn’t matter very clear. The Guardians trilogy has always been full of huge, galaxy-saving moments, but those moments hit as hard as they do because of the small, intimate moments we get to spend with Star-Lord, Gamora, Nebula, Rocket, Groot, Drax, and Mantis.

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 makes it clear that the MCU isn’t quite finished taking swings yet. Not everyone’s loved the most recent phase, but Marvel still has a few proverbial cards up their sleeve. This isn’t quite a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ending explained, but there are plenty of Guardians spoilers to choose from. Either way, GotG 3 has made it clear that we’ll miss the biggest idiots in the galaxy a whole lot.
