Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has been part of a broader global shift towards authoritarianism.

On stage at CNN\u2019s disastrous town hall, former president Trump recounted the rape allegation of E Jean Carroll, the columnist who won her lawsuit against him for sexual abuse and defamation just yesterday. Trump spoke to the character of Carroll\u2019s former husband, addressing the man in a kind of masculine comradery, saying he felt bad for him for having been married to Carroll. He claimed Carroll was promiscuous for going into a dressing room at a department store with him, and also that he never met her. He complained that he had not been allowed to introduce the name of her pet as evidence against her at trial. And he referred to her accusation of rape as \u201chanky panky.\u201d The crowd of Republican voters chuckled and cheered.</p><p>They laughed, too, when Trump referred to former Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi as \u201ccrazy Nancy.\u201d And they laughed when Trump got frustrated with the moderator, CNN\u2019s 31-year-old Kaitlin Collins. \u201cYou\u2019re a nasty person, I\u2019ll tell ya,\u201d he told her, and his fans in the audience erupted in delightful laughs. Collins, for her part, was badly outmatched, unable to fact check the continuous stream of disinformation from Trump. She failed to offer any correction whatsoever when Trump repeatedly made inflammatory lies about abortion, lies that have incited murderous violence against medical providers. Collins instead tried to pin Trump down on whether he would sign a federal abortion ban, but Trump demurred, refusing to commit. Reportedly, the former president has been alarmed at the political fallout from the Dobbs decision. All night, he derided women for contemptuous laughs, playing to his base.

A decade older than his brother, Tom grew up on 90s mixtapes from Fantazia and World Dance, in an era when the music at those raves had split into two factions: jungle on one hand and the relentless four-four kick of happy hardcore on the other.

As he did so, a song called Talkin\u2019 Like You (Two Tall Mountains) came on the stereo that, he recalls, \u201cswallowed me. The party froze. The room disappeared.\u201d Set against a backdrop of gentle guitar picking, it was sung by a woman, plaintively and without affectation, about \u201ca place they called Lonesome\u201d where everything, from the nearby brook to the pigs in the yard, reminds her of an absent lover. Fishman sought out the host to ask who was singing, and she told him about Connie Converse, who recorded songs in her kitchen in 1950s Greenwich Village,<strong> </strong>and whose musical talents had gone largely unrecognised in her lifetime.</p><p>Fishman went straight from the party to a record store where he bought Converse\u2019s How Sad, How Lovely, an album compiled by latterday fans in 2009. He wanted to hear more from this musician whose lyrics brimmed with poetic intimacy and whose lo-fi, homespun style sounded decades ahead of its time.
