While this newest entry in the Zelda franchise is most recognizably similar to that 2017 game, it builds upon the foundation so thoroughly and transformationally that it feels like a revelation. This is The Legend of Zelda at its finest, borrowing the best pieces and qualities from across the franchise's history and creating something new that is emotionally resonant, captivating, and endlessly rewarding.\n\n#thelegendofzelda #tearsofthekingdom #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2P5PgL1LfI", "date_published": "2023-05-11 12:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
