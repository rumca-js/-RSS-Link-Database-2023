[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Contra Caller Signs", "description": "<p><span>\n\nA contra dance stage can be a bit chaotic and noisy, especially during\na dance.  It's a good fit for gestures, and over time callers and\nmusicians have settled on a few covering the main things they need to\ncommunicate.  I couldn't find a listing of these anywhere, so here are\nthe main ones:\n\n</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Closed hand facing down with thumb and finger\nextended, rotate wrist to waggle: change tunes.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>A number of fingers: this many more times through the dance\nafter this one.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Lift leg or raise fist: going out at the end of this time\nthrough the dance.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Fingers across throat (\"cut\"): go out immediately, not at the\nend of the tune or phrase.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Palm facing up, repeatedly lift fingers: play faster.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Palm facing down, repeatedly lower fingers: play slower.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Place hand on the top of the head, palm down: the top of the\ntune goes now.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe tune change sign is usually advisory, letting the band know that\nif they want to change at some point they're close to running out of\ntime.  If the caller does it early and emphatically, though, it can\nmean that the music is really not working for the dance and you should\nplay anything else.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHolding up a number of fingers to indicate the number of times\nremaining is best done in the second half of the tune (B part), to\nmake it clearer that you know you're not counting the current time\nthrough.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02ZqfSETQ6nQ6M8tBn2jCoKW67piJH9dDWBxDvg1NVnMxXjSmjh5Eq6dNsbywTpvdul\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/yvomXJeQzswcRmseB\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraDance/comments/13en1kk\">r/ContraDance</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110350216407221662\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/contra-caller-signs", "date_published": "2023-05-11 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
