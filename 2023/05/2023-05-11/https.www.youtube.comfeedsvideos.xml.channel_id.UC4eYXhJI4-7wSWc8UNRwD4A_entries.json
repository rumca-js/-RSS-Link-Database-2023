We explore how the collision of TikTok and hip-hop has ushered in a new era of visibility in rap for the most marginalized, and dissect how the double-edged sword of virality is that much more sharp for queer rappers. We chat with hip-hop scholar and professor Shant\u00e9 Paradigm Smalls about the evolution of queer aesthetics in hip-hop, as well as Santana's best friend, the hairstylist Mitch Copeland, who witnessed his friend's rise from glam girlie to the stars to a star in his own right. And we ask: How can queer rappers leverage viral visibility into lasting success?\n\nIllustration by Amanda Howell Whitehurst.\nhttp://amandahowellwhitehurst.com\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nLOUDER THAN A RIOT\u2019s second season unpacks just how deeply misogynoir is embedded in the fabric of the hip-hop culture that we love. How did issues of masculinity play into the tensions between ILoveMakonnen and Drake, or Saucy Santana and the industry? How did Rico Nasty's community mobilize for her when she was targeted by Playboi Carti fans? Why did Megan Thee Stallion's reputation get put on the stand for a trial where she was the victim? And why does the culture antagonize rap beefs that reinforce the idea there can only be one queen of rap?\n\nFOLLOW \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"\nhttps://twitter.com/LouderThanARiot\n\nFOLLOW NPR MUSIC\nhttp://nprmusic.org/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\nhttps://twitter.com/nprmusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NPRMusic\n\nSee \u201cLouder Than A Riot\u201d sponsors and promo codes\nhttps://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/podcastsponsors/louder-than-a-riot/\n\nThe NPR shows you love are possible thanks to your support.
