Itâ€™s been nearly a decade since James Gunn brought the Guardians of the Galaxy into the MCU, and arguably changed the direction of the entire cinematic universe. The success of that first movie opened the door for Marvel to explore lesser-known comic book characters and also seemingly gave them the green light to go all-in on comedy beats (for better or for worse.)

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 definitely raises some questions. Like what's Adam Warlock actually doing in this movie? How did they make High Evolutionary so despicable so quickly? Are kids gonna be okay after all that intense animal stuff? Why didn't Star-Lord have his helmet and boots?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3!!
