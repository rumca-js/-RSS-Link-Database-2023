<p>Live commands, 2FA copying, and content-aware brightness settings: Microsoft may be releasing these features for a Windows 11 test build, but they should soon arrive on your PC.</p>



<p>Microsoft released Windows 11 Build&nbsp;22621.1776 (KB5026446) to the Windows Insider Release Channel on Thursday. That&rsquo;s a signal that, unlike many of Microsoft&rsquo;s test features, the changes that the new build brings about <em>will</em> actually land on your PC before long. Microsoft has said that it will release <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1069779/windows-11-will-add-new-features-whenever-it-wants.html">bundles of new features in &ldquo;moments&rdquo;</a> in between official major feature releases, and this looks like it could be the next one.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve seen many of these new features crop up in earlier test builds, but they&rsquo;re worth recapping here. And there are a ton! Here are some of the highlights of the new build, as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/11/releasing-windows-11-build-22621-1776-to-the-release-preview-channel/&amp;xcust=2-1-1858854-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">listed</a> by Microsoft. (If you have a PC running a Release Preview build, you can ensure you&rsquo;ll get the new features by opening <em>Settings &gt; Windows Update</em> and turning on the toggle&nbsp;&ldquo;Get the latest updates as soon as they&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Content-Adaptive Brightness Control:</strong> This is an optional feature that Microsoft is adding to Windows laptops and two-in-ones. (The original plan was to add it to desktops, but that didn&rsquo;t work out.) Essentially, it&rsquo;s like a poor man&rsquo;s HDR: If you&rsquo;re watching a video with a dark scene, then a brighter scene, Windows may dynamically change your screen&rsquo;s brightness and contrast to emphasize the video.</p>



<p>Not everyone will love this, however, especially if you&rsquo;re involved in editing photography or just don&rsquo;t want your laptop display settings to change. To turn this feature on or off, you&rsquo;ll need to go to <em>Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;System&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Display</em> and then to the <em>Brightness</em> control to adjust it.</p>



<p><strong>A new Widgets picker:</strong> If you&rsquo;re confused by what adding a widget to Widgets actually does, Microsoft will show you a preview of what to expect. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 Widgets picker" class="wp-image-1875936" height="956" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-widget-picker.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Widgets picker in Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>OneDrive storage: </strong>You&rsquo;ll see the full amount of storage space allocated to all of your OneDrive subscriptions now appear in the <em>Accounts</em> page within the Settings app.</p>



<p><strong>Tab limits for Alt+Tab:</strong> When you press <strong>Alt+Tab</strong> Windows can pull from your most recent tabs as selection choices. Windows will now allow you to limit them to the 20 most recent tabs within the <em>Settings &gt; Multitasking</em> section.</p>



<p><strong>New Print Screen shortcut: </strong>We documented how the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784286/microsoft-is-changing-how-print-screen-works-within-windows.html">PrtScn key will now open the Snipping Tool app</a>. That feature is now stepping through to Release Preview. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Snipping Tool" class="wp-image-1430867" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ST_LaunchScreen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The PrtScn key will now launch the Snipping Tool.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>USB4 Hubs and Settings:</strong> This is a slightly odd choice, since USB4 hubs pale in comparison to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">more common Thunderbolt docks</a>. USB4 is almost functionally the same as a Thunderbolt dock, but it tends to be a feature associated with AMD Ryzen-powered notebooks, not Intel Core devices. Regardless, this new Windows Settings page provides information about the system&rsquo;s USB4 capabilities and the attached peripherals on a system that supports USB4.</p>



<p><strong>Touch keyboard options:</strong> Disconnect the Surface keyboard from a Surface Pro tablet, and you may see a touch keyboard pop up instead. The new <em>Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Time &amp; language&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Typing&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Touch keyboard</em> setting allows you to show the touch keyboard always, never, or only when you disconnect the hardware keyboard.</p>



<p><strong>2FA copying: </strong>Most phones allow for two-factor authentication (2FA), which can send an authorization code via text. If you have a phone connected to your PC via <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link</a>, you can now automatically copy any 2FA codes that are sent. (Some services, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815683/how-to-set-up-and-use-passkeys-with-your-google-account.html">Google, are moving to passkeys</a> instead.) </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Windows 11 Phone Link for iOS better shot" class="wp-image-1525348" height="789" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phone-Link-for-iOS-better.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Phone Link for Windows allows you to access messages from your phone, right on your PC.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>Sensor settings:</strong> Some laptops have presence sensors, both as security settings as well as automatically dimming your screen when you walk away, preserving battery. A new setting in <em>Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Privacy &amp; security&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Presence sensing</em> will allow you to manage this.</p>



<p><strong>VPN signal:</strong> You&rsquo;ll see a small &ldquo;shield&rdquo; icon in the Taskbar if you&rsquo;re connected to a VPN.</p>



<p>Microsoft also tweaked some of its existing features, too:</p>



<ul><li>Voice commands now support different English accents (UK, India, New Zealand, Canada, and Australia) and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-voice-access-to-control-your-pc-author-text-with-your-voice-4dcd23ee-f1b9-4fd1-bacc-862ab611f55d&amp;xcust=2-1-1858854-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">new commands</a> have been added.</li><li>Key shortcuts have been added to File Explorer.</li><li>If you&rsquo;d like, you can add seconds to the Taskbar clock via the Taskbar settings menu.</li><li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/625640/microsofts-new-windows-11-build-signals-its-final-features-for-the-fall.html">Live captions</a>, a rather nifty feature that applies AI captions to pre-recorded video, now supports Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), French (France, Canada), German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Spanish, Danish, English (Ireland, other English dialects), and Korean.</li></ul>

<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of AI art, and AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing. Now you can try out AI music, compliments of Google&rsquo;s MusicLM.</p>



<p>Originally announced in January, MusicLM is now available for you to play with, compliments of what Google calls its AI Test Kitchen. Though you can jump directly to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/experiments/music-lm&amp;xcust=2-1-1853613-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MusicLM site</a> to try it out, Google may throw up a popup requiring you to sign up for AI Test Kitchen first. You&rsquo;ll need to provide a Gmail address, and agree that whatever prompts you provide may be reviewed by human members of Google&rsquo;s team, though anonymized.</p>



<p>Google quietly announced the opening of MusicLM at its Google I/O developer conference, where it also announced a service to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1843892/google-will-tell-you-when-your-email-is-lurking-on-the-dark-web.html">protect your email from the dark web</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816665/google-plans-to-supercharge-search-with-ai.html">AI improvements to search</a>&mdash;which seem to have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1817020/google-search-ai-bard-wrong-pixel-facts.html">failed spectacularly</a>, at least initially. </p>



<p>Like our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html">best AI art generators</a>, MusicLM begins with a text prompt: You define the piece of music you want Google to come up with: &ldquo;a drum and bass funeral dirge,&rdquo; for example, or &ldquo;a soft melody, with strings, about walking through a spring meadow.&rdquo; MusicLM will then generate a music sample trying to match what you provided, about 20 seconds long. Some samples will include &ldquo;vocals,&rdquo; though they&rsquo;re more of the &ldquo;<em>wawawa</em>&rdquo; vocals you&rsquo;d hear in an animated <em>Peanuts</em> cartoon.</p>



<p>What MusicLM will <em>not</em> do is what AI art generators helped sell themselves on: provide an output that&rsquo;s in the style of another artist. Ask MusicLM to provide a sample &ldquo;in the style of U2&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll receive an error message: &ldquo;Oops, can&rsquo;t generate audio for that.&rdquo; If you cut out the artist&rsquo;s name from the prompt, though, MusicLM will proceed.</p>



<p>Is MusicLM accurate? Not entirely, at least to my ears. You&rsquo;ll sometimes be hard pressed to understand how it interpreted your prompt the way it did. And no, don&rsquo;t expect weird prompts to generate miraculously coherent music. Heck, don&rsquo;t expect generic prompts to generate good music, either. </p>



<p>Sometimes, though, MusicLM generates some realistic music&mdash;which may not be to the credit of the algorithm, but just how generic some music can sound. &ldquo;A modern pop-country ballad that you&rsquo;d hear on top 40 radio&rdquo;&hellip; gives you a melody you&rsquo;d expect to hear on country radio in the heartland. But Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and Drake probably have nothing to worry about.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s one more angle, too: All of the AI-generated samples can be downloaded, so, yes, you could use AI to generate the backing track to your next hit, &ldquo;Loving My Tractor in the Cornfields of Your Heart.&rdquo; For now, you&rsquo;ll just have to sing your own lyrics.</p>

## Warning: PCIe 5.0 SSDs freak out if you don’t use a heat sink

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809085/corsairs-first-pcie-5-ssd-is-now-available-and-surprisingly-affordable.html">Corsair&rsquo;s new MP700 SSD</a>&mdash;or any other drive wielding cutting-edge PCIe 5.0 technology&mdash;you should <strong>really</strong> consider picking up an M.2 heatsink or cooler. The MP700 is one of the few PCIe 5.0 SSDs that ships without a cooling solution. Reviewers have discovered that if the drive is pushed to its limit, it can freak out really, really hard.</p>



<p>According to testing data from both <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.phoronix.com/news/PCIe5-NVMe-SSD-Fail-3-Minutes&amp;xcust=2-1-1842652-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Phoronix</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techpowerup.com/review/corsair-mp700-2-tb/8.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1842652-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TechPowerUp</a>, if you don&rsquo;t take measures to properly cool down the MP700, it can start generating file system errors or completely shut down your PC. Oof. Thankfully, Phison, the designers of the PS5026-E26 SSD controller used by the MP700 and many other PCIe 5.0 drives, is aware of the issue and is working on a fix. But there&rsquo;s bad news too: This problem isn&rsquo;t limited to Corsair&rsquo;s SSD alone. It&rsquo;s a potential concern for any drive using Phison&rsquo;s SSD controller. </p>



<p>Phison, in speaking directly to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pcie-50-ssds-generates-errors-shut-down-without-cooler-fix-on-the-way&amp;xcust=2-1-1842652-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>, say it&rsquo;s already made the appropriate adjustments to the thermal throttle curve internally. That said, the brand new firmware first needs to go through the company&rsquo;s austere validation process before it can be released to the general public. Phison said it was able to fix the problem &ldquo;within hours of the report&rdquo; so the company appears to be moving quickly here. That said, there&rsquo;s no word yet on when the fix will be available. Fingers crossed that&rsquo;ll it be sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s generally understood that PCIe 5.0 SSDs run blisteringly hot when there&rsquo;s no cooling involved. The higher the performance, the more power it consumes. The MP700 has a power consumption level of up to 10W, but&mdash;unlike the vast majority of early PCIe 5.0 drives&mdash;no included cooling solution. The omission of a heatsink helps keep the price low, sure, but you&rsquo;re out of luck if you&rsquo;ve got poor airflow. </p>



<p>The Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 1000, for example, includes a massive heatsink. In our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681210/gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000-review.html">review</a>, it &ldquo;never once threatened to throttle during multiple benchmark runs.&rdquo; Although heatsinks jack up the overall price, it&rsquo;s there for a reason, as it prevents the drive from overheating. </p>

## Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro review: More performance per pound

<p>What&rsquo;s orange and black and can run your fridge, CPAP, or laptop for hours on end? Jackery&rsquo;s Explorer 1500 Pro obviously.</p>



<p>With its trademark orange accents and folding cooler-style carry handle, the new Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro provides high capacity and high performance in a relatively light and compact body. We say relatively because, for its 1,500 watt hours, it&rsquo;s actually pretty light at 37.5 pounds. Compare that to the competing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784445/goal-zero-yeti-1500x-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Goal Zero Yeti 1500X</a>, which despite having the same battery capacity, weighs about 8 pounds more than the Jackery.</p>



<p>Like the Goal Zero, the Jackery Explorer 1500 is probably the limit for what most people will want to carry to a campsite or up a flight of stairs while still offering a lot of power.</p>



<p>We know this from trying to move 3,000 watt-hour units on our own during a power outage. It&rsquo;s difficult at best.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-ports-does-the-jackery-explorer-1500-pro-have">What kind of ports does the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro have?</h2>



<p>For ports, the the Explorer 1500 Pro gives you three three-prong outlets keyed for 20 amps. Despite the 20 amp NEMA 5-2 keying of each outlet, each AC port is only rated for 1,800 watts continuous and 3,600 watts surge. For your phone, laptop, and tablet, the Explorer 1500 Pro gives you two USB-A ports and a pair of USB-C ports. The USB-A ports support Quick Charge 3.0 protocols for up to 18 watts for faster charging of older phones, while the USB-C ports support up to 100 watts over USB Power Delivery that will fast charge modern phones, tablets, and laptops.</p>



<p>Solar charging is done over a pair of DC-in/barrel chargers with up to an impressive 1,400 watts&mdash;if you can afford the solar panels to hit that rate. You also get a car cigarette power port providing 12 volts at 10 amps or 120 watts. Like most portable power stations, the &ldquo;cigarette&rdquo; port only supports 12 volts of output, which is fine for many accessories, but be mindful that certain devices built to run off a car&rsquo;s 13 to 14.8 volts of output may not function. In that case, you&rsquo;ll have to buy an AC power adapter with the right output and plug it into the normal AC plugs to make them work.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-battery-does-the-explorer-1500-pro-have">What kind of battery does the Explorer 1500 Pro have?</h2>



<p>The Explorer 1500 Pro is built using nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) lithium-ion batteries, which some will see as inferior to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) lithium-ion cells since the duty cycles are far lower on NMC cells. In Jackery&rsquo;s defense, the company rates the battery at 1,000 full cycles before the battery capacity drops to 80-plus percent. LFP-fans will scream that 1,000 (which is still twice the 500 cycles of the Goal Zero Yeti 1500X) is poor compared to the typical 3,000-cycle range of LFP-based power stations.</p>

<p>We actually don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s big a deal since most people using the unit for camping or in an emergency power outage will still see many years of service. However, if you are planning to run your power station full time in an off-the-grid scenario, you&rsquo;ll probably want to opt for a battery using LFP batteries instead.</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-jackery-explorer-1500-pro-perform">How does the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro perform?</h2>



<p>For efficiency tests, we use a 200-watt AC load, an 800-watt AC load and a 60-watt DC load. In all three areas, we saw the Explorer 1500 Pro perform quite well with 81 efficiency at 200W, a very good 83 percent at 800W, and an excellent 89 percent under the 60W DC load. Overall, that means you&rsquo;re going to generally extract more out of the battery, which means you&rsquo;re getting more of what you paid for. We should also mention that fan noise on the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro was well managed except under the highest output or charge rates. Even then, fan noise was better than many competitors thanks to the larger fans which don&rsquo;t have to rotate at the high RPMs of smaller fans (<em>cough</em>, we&rsquo;re looking at you, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381039/ecoflow-delta-2-power-station-review.html">EcoFlow</a>).</p>



<p>The inverter is indeed a pure sine wave inverter according to our scopes but certainly not as clean a sine wave as the Goal Zero Yeti 1500X&mdash;although it worked just fine with our sensitive electronics.</p>



<p>Charging performance (which you can&rsquo;t change) sees the unit pulling 1,500 watts from a wall socket and total charge time from empty to full in an impressive 107 minutes. That&rsquo;s the kind of speed that means you can lug this station to work during an outage at your home, charge it up, and get back to powering your fridge without fear of anything defrosting.</p>

<h2 id="jackery-explorer-1500-pro-application-support">Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro application support</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;ve come to expect all new power stations to come with smart phone support to check the unit&rsquo;s status over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, but oddly, the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro doesn&rsquo;t offer it. This feels like a massive blind spot to us. It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re so addicted to our smart phones that we just have to have an app; it&rsquo;s that application support lets you do such things as customize the power station&rsquo;s shut off time for the ports as well as easily update the unit&rsquo;s firmware if needed. It&rsquo;s also useful for monitoring the battery&rsquo;s status remotely (assuming your internet is up and running). For example, during a power outage we experienced during a storm, we were able to remotely tell if the fridge was still getting power and could also tell if the power had come back on since we left the unit plugged into the outlet&mdash;that won&rsquo;t happen with the Explorer 1500 Pro.</p>



<p>Why Jackery didn&rsquo;t integrate app support is just bizarre, especially on such a powerful and full-featured power station. Is it possible app support could be added in the future? That&rsquo;s hard to say but looking closely at the Explorer 1500 Pro&rsquo;s screen, we could see a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi icon on it&mdash;there was just no way to turn on any such feature. We asked Jackery officials if we had somehow missed the option (we could find nothing in the manual either) but heard nothing back.</p>



<p>To be fair, as a power station, it makes no difference if there is app support or not&mdash;the only thing that matters is providing power.</p>



<h2 id="what-accessories-come-with-the-jackery-explorer-1500-pro">What accessories come with the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro?</h2>



<p>Jackery provides an AC charging cable, car adapter for charging, and a pair of adapters to add solar panels to the unit. Normally we don&rsquo;t need to mention this, but Jackery gets special credit for the included accessory bag with Jackery printed in orange on it. Most portable power stations don&rsquo;t go to this effort but they should as not losing your cables is important. Perhaps more important is that the charging cable Jackery includes is a heavy-duty, heavy-gauge bright orange cable. This is critically important for power stations, which can push very high charge rates for more than an hour. That&rsquo;s made us somewhat worried about people who mix up their cables and use a light-duty printer cable to charge at 1,400 watts for 1.5 hours. That can lead to problems if the cable overheats. With its accessory bag and bright orange cable, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;ll do that with the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro.</p>



<h2 id="is-the-jackery-explorer-1500-pro-worth-it">Is the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro worth it?</h2>



<p>For most consumers, the feature that the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro will be judged on is its performance, and that&rsquo;s where it excels. For example, with its 81 percent efficiency under a 200-watt load and its weight of 37.5 pounds, the unit produces almost 33 watt-hours per pound. The only unit we&rsquo;ve seen exceed it is the Delta 2, but only when coupled with its auxiliary battery&mdash;by itself, the Delta 2 loses. It&rsquo;s even worse for the similarly sized Yeti 1500X, which actually has slightly higher efficiency but due to its weight actually does worse than the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro per-pound.</p>



<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t mind the lack of smart phone support, and want the most power with the lowest weight, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to beat the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro.</p>

## Gmail can warn you if your account is being trafficked on the dark web

<p>Set a reminder: In just a few weeks, you&rsquo;ll be able to ask Google if your email address is being used as currency on what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;dark web.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a service that the company previously made available to Google One subscribers as a paid security method. Now, it&rsquo;s being rolled out to Gmail users as a whole.</p>



<p>The &ldquo;dark web&rdquo; is usually referred to as a series of servers that don&rsquo;t publicly register with search engines &mdash; quite the opposite, as they want to stay hidden from the eyes of the law for whatever reason. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447091/meet-darknet-the-hidden-anonymous-underbelly-of-the-searchable-web.html">dark web or Darknet</a> surfaced a few years ago, when researchers started delving into the reaches of the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; web. There are plenty of vital, positive aspects of the dark web; it can be used to freely express yourself in repressive regimes, for example. But illegal commerce can be carried out there as well: drugs, weapon sales, and worse. Hackers and criminals also buy and sell personal information stolen in security breaches, which is where Google&rsquo;s privacy feature comes in.</p>



<p>Google maintains its own eyes on the dark web, which it uses to try and protect its users. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but if Google detects that your email address (which could be used as your login information on sites you&rsquo;ve signed up for) has been detected, it&rsquo;s a good sign that either your email, Google account, or one of your signed-in sites has been compromised. In this case, Google will flag your email and send you a notification.</p>



<p>While we don&rsquo;t know exactly how this will work, we&rsquo;d imaging that it will work similarly to the privacy checkups offered by Google and Microsoft, where the services will periodically ask you to review your personal information, including any passwords that have been compromised in privacy breaches. It&rsquo;s just one way to tell <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393981/how-to-tell-if-your-password-has-been-stolen.html">if your password has been stolen</a>.</p>



<p>Google also announced a few other privacy initiatives at Google I/O, its developer conference:</p>



<ul><li>New spam protections in Google Drive, to help determine if files you saved are actually unwanted.</li><li>Location alerts on your phone, if an app wants to share your location.</li><li>A new data deletion option within Google Play.</li></ul>

## Kingston SSD firmware hides a Coldplay Easter egg

<p>Solid-state storage is a pretty straightforward affair, not really lending itself to levity or fun. So can you blame someone deep in the software division of Kingston for expressing their taste in the form of&hellip;firmware notes? One user was shocked to find song lyrics from the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1VNAUqwREY&amp;xcust=2-1-1841242-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2002 Coldplay song <em>The Scientist</em></a><em> </em>in one of the .bin files in Kingston controller firmware. </p>



<p>Nicholas Starke spotted the song lyrics while digging through generic drivers for Kingston drivers from 2020, and showed off his findings to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/kingstons-ssd-firmware-has-coldplay-lyrics-hidden-within-it/&amp;xcust=2-1-1841242-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>. Sure enough, the lyrical string is right there in the SKC2000_S2681103.bin file, publicly available on Kingston&rsquo;s support download site. It&rsquo;s possible Windows automatically downloaded a version of the file to your PC as part of Windows Update. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The lyrics are hiding in the notation of the code, not actually affecting anything. Notation is basically the equivalent of a page margin, and it&rsquo;s frequently used by programmers to relay relevant information about specific functions or adjustments. But it&rsquo;s not unheard of for programmers to leave Easter eggs in there. Who left the lyrics in the file and why, I couldn&rsquo;t guess &mdash; though now that I look at it, the Kingston &ldquo;Head&rdquo; logo isn&rsquo;t totally dissimilar to the album cover for <em>A Rush of Blood to the Head. </em> </p>



<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a deep, dark, sinister conspiracy going on here. Or maybe someone was just trying to alleviate a little boredom. Either way, Kingston declined to comment. </p>

## YouTube might try to block your ad blocker
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1836236/youtube-might-try-to-block-your-ad-blocker.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1836236/youtube-might-try-to-block-your-ad-blocker.html)

<p>If you love browsing YouTube and hate constantly having to wait through ads for Purple mattresses and local political candidates, you might be running some kind of ad-blocker on the web&rsquo;s biggest video repository. Naturally, YouTube and Google would prefer that you not do so, and instead fork over twelve bucks a month for the ad-free YouTube Premium service. If some pop-up messages recently spotted by users are any indication, the service may be taking more proactive steps to block ad blockers soon.</p>



<p>A Reddit user (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2023/05/10/youtube-ad-blockers/&amp;xcust=2-1-1836236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>) spotted a pop-up message on the YouTube desktop site, telling them that they needed to disable their ad blocker in order to keep watching. These sorts of messages aren&rsquo;t new &mdash; a service called Admiral shows similar pop-ups when you try to access many sites. But the implication that Google will straight-up deny access if you don&rsquo;t disable your ad blocker or subscribe for ad-free service is particularly aggressive. &ldquo;Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube,&rdquo; says the message in large, bold text. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="YouTube ad blocker message " class="wp-image-1838222" height="430" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1ddspzr4hqya1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="791" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Reddit user Sazk100</p></div>



<p>A YouTube employee reached out to the subreddit mod team and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/13cfdbi/apparently_ad_blockers_are_not_allowed_on_youtube/jjlu4m2/&amp;xcust=2-1-1836236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed that the message is an &ldquo;experiment.&rdquo;</a> It doesn&rsquo;t seem like everyone, using the many varied methods of blocking YouTube ads, is seeing it yet. How widely YouTube is willing to go to force advertising on users who don&rsquo;t want to see it isn&rsquo;t currently known, though it&rsquo;s certainly been pursuing those goals lately. Google shut down a user-customized version of the YouTube Android app <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.androidpolice.com/google-finally-succeeds-in-killing-youtube-vanced/&amp;xcust=2-1-1836236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">called YouTube Vanced</a> earlier this year for unlocking premium features, including ad-free watching. </p>



<p>As someone whose entire career has been funded by online advertising in one way or another, I certainly understand that ads are a necessary part of the web. I&rsquo;m also an avid user of that web, and I recognize that ad blockers are sometimes necessary in order to make it usable. It certainly didn&rsquo;t escape my notice that YouTube&rsquo;s advertising seemed to double &mdash; at the very least &mdash; around the same time it started offering a paid way to stop seeing those ads. And even so, plenty of YouTube channels still include sponsorships, Patreon pleas, and other means of trying to get revenue without using Google&rsquo;s built-in advertising platform. </p>



<p>If YouTube finds that so many people are blocking ads that it&rsquo;s affecting the bottom line, I might humbly suggest that they try running fewer ads, or charging less than a full streaming service just to get rid of them. That might be a more successful &ldquo;experiment,&rdquo; because I highly doubt those who are willing to use third-party tools to block ads will be any less motivated to do so. </p>

<p>Cookie consent notices. You&rsquo;ve seen them. You can&rsquo;t not see them these days. They&rsquo;re everywhere, on every website, because of well-meaning legal requirements. Sometimes blocking elements of the page you want to interact with, to boot.</p>



<p>I could have tinkered with Chrome and Firefox (my main two browsers) to nuke these annoyances, but an alternative browser first caught my eye. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1816983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Brave</a> blocks cookie consent notices by default. All I needed to do was download an installer, run it, and fire it up.</p>



<p>It works perfectly, and I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the feature for months now. You can see it in effect on this Google I/O livestream page:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Google I/O Keynote livestream cookie consent overlay in Edge" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1400" id="1816996" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/google-consent.png" width="2560" /><img alt="Google I/O Keynote livestream with no cookie consent overlay in Brave" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1400" id="1816998" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cookie-no-consent.png" width="2560" /></div><figcaption>The same site in Edge (left image) and in Brave (right image) upon first load.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Brave touts itself as a browser dedicated to privacy and security, and it definitely delivers that out of the box&mdash;cross-site trackers automatically blocked, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1684308/what-is-a-digital-fingerprint.html">fingerprinting protection</a>, scripts blocked, a built-in VPN. It also defaults to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/794153/braves-privacy-focused-search-engine-exits-beta-with-huge-numbers-and-a-new-feature.html">its own search engine</a> and offers its own video call platform (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/talk/&amp;xcust=2-1-1816983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Brave Talk</a>), too. And as a Chromium browser, you can still customize it with your favorite extensions from the Chrome Web Store.</p>



<p>I appreciate that Brave provides those features <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/features/&amp;xcust=2-1-1816983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">and others</a>, and they&rsquo;re additional reasons to keep using the Browser as a regular browser. But what got me in the door was that cookie consent blocking.</p>



<p>What if you don&rsquo;t want to switch to Brave? I highly recommend giving the browser a shot, but you can still get a similar feature with a little light work. (And I eventually got around to applying this to Chrome and Firefox.)</p>



<p>You need the uBlock Origin ad-blocking extension installed (one of my <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631993/5-free-chrome-browser-extensions-need-to-try.html">must-have extensions for Chrome</a> and other browsers). Click on its icon next to your address bar, then on the gears icon. If it&rsquo;s not visible, click on the puzzle piece icon next to your address bar, then the three-dot icon for uBlock Origin, and choose <em>Options</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="uBlock Origin's EasyList Cookie Notices filter option" class="wp-image-1817001" height="1171" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/easyfilter-cookie-notices.png" width="725" /><figcaption>uBlock Origin&rsquo;s Filter lists tab lets you further tweak what the extension blocks.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>In the <em>Filter Lists</em> tab, look for the <em>Annoyances</em> drop down list. Unfurl it, then check the <em>EasyList &ndash; Cookie Notices</em> option. To save the change, click on the <em>Apply Changes </em>button at the top of the screen. Now you&rsquo;ll have the same experience on Brave&mdash;at least for avoiding cookie consent notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get that browser&rsquo;s other privacy features, you&rsquo;ll need to add more extensions like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-1816983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NoScript</a>, one for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">a dedicated VPN</a>, and more (or just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1816983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">try Brave</a>).

<p>Nothing excites me more than a well-designed gaming mouse. Personally, if I&rsquo;m going to be gaming for hours on end, I need an ergonomic mouse that&rsquo;ll reduce wrist strain. If you&rsquo;ve been shopping around for a comfortable peripheral, then we&rsquo;ve got an excellent deal on tap for you today.

<p>The fact that you and everyone you know will receive spam and scam emails (and texts) for as long as they live should be added to the famous Ben Franklin quote, &ldquo;&hellip; in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.&rdquo; Death, taxes, and spam. It&rsquo;s constant, ever-present, and you likely have a few hundred of them sitting in your Spam folder as you read this. The very fact that we even <em>need</em> to have a spam folder tells us there&rsquo;s a problem. </p>



<p>While email providers and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best Windows antivirus solutions</a> can often do a decent job at spotting the false missives from Nigerian princes that hit your inbox, both remain far from foolproof&mdash;so you need to know how to spot a scam email to avoid falling prey to their tactics. Here&rsquo;s some advice that can help.</p>

<p>An email from someone you know suddenly arriving in your inbox with no warning is a red flag. Typically, when we get email from our family or friends, it&rsquo;s about a topic we are actively discussing, so when there is no warning of an incoming email, tread lightly; it could be a scam. If there is a link inside a suspicious email, then it&rsquo;s almost always a scam. Hackers and ne&rsquo;er-do-wells can sometimes take over someone&rsquo;s email account and just start spamming all of their contacts with nefarious links that seem safe, but will plant malware on your system, or worse. Luckily, this tactic is easy to counter since you can just verify if the person who you think sent the email did indeed mean to send it. A simple phone call or text will do, and if they exclaim, &ldquo;What email?&rdquo; then you know what to do.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also important to point out that when examining these emails, don&rsquo;t just look at the name of the sender, but the email address. For example I got a spam email from &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; recently, which is obviously fake, but when I clicked the drop-down for the actual address and CC&rsquo;d people, I saw the details below. Even your <em>grandma</em> knows that is fishy. Not to mention the address <a href="mailto:Facebookmail750@gmail.com">Facebookmail750@gmail.com</a>&mdash;come on spammers, try harder.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="List of scam email addresses in message" class="wp-image-549428" height="887" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spam-list.png" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="always-check-links-in-email">Always check links in email</h2>



<p>As a general rule it&rsquo;s safest to never click any links in emails, even if you think you know the source. As we just said, you might not <em>actually</em> know the source and clicking links in email is how the vast majority of people fall victim to phishing operations (see the United States <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-phishing-email-that-hacked-the-account-of-john-podesta/&amp;xcust=2-3-549422-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Presidential election of 2016</a> for how disastrous this can be). </p>



<p>That said, if you are sure of the source, and you are confident it is not a spam or scam email, you can always check the actual link prior to clicking it. The process is quite simple. Just hover your mouse over the link in the email, and a little window will pop-up in the lower corner of your browser (usually on the left side) showing you what the actual link. For example, when I hover over <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541476/see-your-ssds-hidden-stats-with-this-free-tool.html">this masterfully written article&rsquo;s</a> link on PCWorld.com, I can look in the lower left-hand corner to see where it will take me. You might need to enable this preview window in your browser, so if you don&rsquo;t see link previews, click &ldquo;View&rdquo; in your browser&rsquo;s controls and look for something called Status Bar or similar.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hovering link preview in browser" class="wp-image-549429" height="718" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/link-preview.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<p>When hovering over what you think might be spam links, you&rsquo;ll usually see some very strange URLs that are not typical, which usually means it&rsquo;s spam, of course. You can see an example below.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Scam link preview in browser" class="wp-image-549425" height="160" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/actual-spam.png" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="spelling-mistakes-are-a-huge-red-flag">Spelling mistakes are a huge red flag</h2>



<p>Spelling mistakes, odd punctuation, and weird use of language are probably the easiest red flags to recognize. The majority of scam operations are run from countries far away, where English is not their native tongue, and hence you get stuff like this.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Poorly written scam email" class="wp-image-549423" height="275" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/weird-english.png" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<p>Sure, nobody is perfect and email can be seen as a casual way to communicate at times, so even <em>we</em> have typos in our emails from time-to-time. But if you&rsquo;re reading an email thinking the person must have been drunk while typing it, mark it as Spam.</p>



<h2 id="be-wary-of-email-from-big-companies">Be wary of email from big companies</h2>



<p>You will likely never receive an email from Facebook, Apple, or Google, unless you are paying for a service from them, so it could be an invoice for iCloud, or Google Storage, or similar. They will not just email you out of the blue, usually, to let you know there&rsquo;s an issue with your account. They will, however, send you an email when a foreign device logs into your account, but hopefully that&rsquo;s you on a new device, and not some nefarious person. You should <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html">enable two-factor authentication on all your accounts</a> for online services anyway, so something like this should not be possible in the first place.</p>



<p>That said, there are exceptions that can be safe. For example, I recently got an email from Google asking me to add a second phone number to my two-factor authentication setup, and since Google is usually smart about these things, it thoughtfully included a non-clickable link at the bottom if I wanted to copy-and-paste it myself instead of clicking an active link. That&rsquo;s because, as we&rsquo;ve said previously, savvy users know to be wary of clickable links. Most big companies will also write in their emails to you that they will never ask for your password over email.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google two-step verification message" class="wp-image-549427" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/security-check.png?w=1140" width="1140" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<p>One more thing to note: Typically, if you do get an email from a big company like Facebook, there will not be clickable links in the email. It&rsquo;ll be just to inform you of something. However, if you are curious enough to follow up, do it outside the email itself. Open Facebook, or your Google settings, or your iPhone, and investigate the issue there instead of through the email you received.</p>



<h2 id="texts-are-just-as-dangerous-as-email">Texts are just as dangerous as email</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it, I have definitely been curious about a few texts I have received, which were worded like, &ldquo;Your Amazon package is delayed. Check its status here.&rdquo; Most of us have an Amazon package en route often enough for this type of message to be applicable, but more often than not, it&rsquo;s a scam. </p>



<p>Text messages are much more dangerous than emails because there&rsquo;s not really a way to see where the embedded link is taking you unless you preview it, but not everyone knows how to do that. Smartphones have gotten smarter by displaying a preview of what is linked in a box with an image, but of course the scammers have found ways around this, so there&rsquo;s usually not a preview box. The best thing to do, in almost every case, is simply ignore the text, block the sender, and navigate directly to the website of the alleged link. If that example Amazon package was indeed delayed, you&rsquo;ll find evidence of it in your orders summary on Amazon.com.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Spam failed package delivery text" class="wp-image-549426" height="986" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/package.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<p>In the link above, you know it&rsquo;s a scam just based on the URL alone, but what if the message is more sophisticated? What if they use your name, or say something in the message that is actually applicable to your life?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Scam text message" class="wp-image-549424" height="1015" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/scam-text.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Josh Norem/IDG</p></div>



<p>The same rules apply to texts as they do to emails&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t know the sender, do not open any links. Even if you know the sender, contact them separately to verify they are the ones who sent it. Either way, your life will not deteriorate in any noticeable fashion if you simply do not click the link provided.</p>

<p>To sum things up, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best Windows antivirus tools</a> can often spot a lot of scam emails for you, and the vast majority of phishing and malware attacks are only successful if the target clicks on a link provided. While there are &ldquo;no click&rdquo; malware attacks going around right now, they are expensive for a third party to purchase on the black market, so they usually target high-level government employees, journalists investigating corruption, and those types of people. Most regular people will only get scammed if you respond to a mysterious message, whether it&rsquo;s via email or text. So be safe, do not click on links you get that seem fishy, no matter how curious you might be about it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to trust Google&rsquo;s new AI-powered search vision when it can&rsquo;t even correctly summarize the details of its own products.</p>



<p>At its Google I/O developer conference on Wednesday, Google laid out the foundation for revamping its iconic search engine, which has followed the same basic formula for years. The company aims to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816665/google-plans-to-supercharge-search-with-ai.html">power Google search up with conversational and generative AI</a> &mdash; and, most importantly, put those responses before traditional links and everything else. For the most popular search engine in the world, this is a monumental change.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Google AI search " class="wp-image-1817076" height="760" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-AI-search.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>A Google example of generative AI results atop traditional search links.</p></figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a></div>



<p>The problem with that approach is that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-theyre-cryptobros.html">AI chatbots often make confident-sounding mistakes</a> &mdash; and, true to form, Google couldn&rsquo;t even get the details of its latest Google Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet products exactly right, including the price. We used Google Bard for our tests, not Google Search, but with the same AI eventually underlying both, we think the results are worth highlighting.</p>



<p>Google makes a bold choice when laying out its latest search vision: It puts its AI results right on top. Microsoft and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808784/1808784.html">AI-powered Bing search engine</a> also includes a conversational AI-powered chat interface, but places its AI in a small box to the right of traditional links, at about the height (and priority) of the top search result. In certain cases, such as asking both search engines for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/742457/google-pixel-fold.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">specifications of the Google Pixel Fold</a>, Bing includes an array of specifications from a third-party Web site. In Google&rsquo;s mockups, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-theyre-cryptobros.html">AI chatbots aren&rsquo;t search engines, they&rsquo;re crypto bros</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="bings-right-bard-isnt">Bing&rsquo;s right; Bard isn&rsquo;t</h2>



<p>On the advice of my editor, I asked both Google Bard and Bing Chat for the specifications of both the Google Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. Bard was much more verbose &mdash; but, unfortunately, also more wrong.</p>



<p>Both search engines, to be fair, returned mostly accurate results. We even gave Bard the benefit of the doubt, asking it for the specifications of, first, the &ldquo;Google Fold&rdquo; and then the &ldquo;Google Pixel Fold.&rdquo; But Bard still returned incorrect information about the exterior display, reporting first that its outer 5.8-inch display had a 1080&times;2670 display and an inner 7.6-inch display of 1920&times;1080. It doesn&rsquo;t; the exterior display has a resolution of 2092&times;1080 and an inner display of 2208&times;1840. (Both run at up to 120Hz, another fact Bard left out.) When we asked it a second time, it didn&rsquo;t even distinguish between the inner and outer display, simply stating that it has a 7.6-inch foldable display with a resolution of 1920&times;1080.</p>



<p>(You can see the results of our query below. You may need to open the images in a separate tab. Google lists the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_fold_specs?hl=en-US&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">specifications of the Pixel Fold</a> on its shopping page.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Bard versus Microsoft Bing Pixel Fold" class="wp-image-1817065" height="818" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Pixel-Fold-Bing-v-Bard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Google Bard (left, center) versus Bing Chat (right)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Bard also waffled on the camera specs, first reporting that the Pixel Fold&rsquo;s front camera was 8 megapixels, and its rear camera was 48MP (main) / 12MP (ultrawide) / and 10MP (telephoto). It then decided that the front selfie camera was 12MP, and the rear was 50MP/12MP/10MP. (The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_fold_specs?hl=en-US&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">correct specifications</a> are a 8MP selfie camera and a 48MP/10.8MP/10.8MP rear camera.)</p>



<p>Bard was at least consistent on the price, the battery size, the dimensions and the wireless capabilities, but couldn&rsquo;t decide whether the Fold runs Android 13 or the upcoming Android 14. (Google doesn&rsquo;t say.)</p>



<p>Google also goofed when asked about the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816339/googles-pixel-tablet-is-a-nest-hub-too-and-still-a-hard-sell.html">Google Pixel Tablet</a>. Its most significant error? The price, which Bard listed as simply $599. In fact, according to Google, the base configuration is $499, a full $100 less. (There <em>is</em> a $599 option, which increases the base 128GB of storage to 256GB, but more notably, a swathe of early Pixel Tablet rumors pegged it as that price.) Bard also continued to have problems with the camera specs, incorrectly characterizing the front and rear cameras as 8MP and a 13MP (main) and 5MP (ultrawide) rear camera. The Pixel Tablet includes 8MP front and rear cameras, with no options for an ultrawide.</p>



<p>Again, we&rsquo;ve reproduced our queries below. You can compare them to the official <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/product/pixel_tablet_specs?hl=en-US&amp;selections=eyJlOCI6ImNHbDRaV3hmZEdGaWJHVjAiLCJJaSI6W1siMiIsIk13PT0iXSxbIjEiLCJNalUyIl1dLCJTNyI6IlRIZDBkVUZqIn0%3D&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Pixel Tablet specifications</a>.</p>

<p>Bing, meanwhile, skated by reporting that the Pixel Fold has a &ldquo;1080p&rdquo; exterior screen. Otherwise, though, it was entirely factually correct on both Google devices, when Google itself wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to trust Google&rsquo;s new AI-powered search vision when it can&rsquo;t even correctly summarize the details of its own products.</p>



<p>At its Google I/O developer conference on Wednesday, Google laid out the foundation for revamping its iconic search engine, which has followed the same basic formula for years. The company aims to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816665/google-plans-to-supercharge-search-with-ai.html">power Google search up with conversational and generative AI</a> &mdash; and, most importantly, put those responses before traditional links and everything else. For the most popular search engine in the world, this is a monumental change.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Google AI search " class="wp-image-1817076" height="760" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-AI-search.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>A Google example of generative AI results atop traditional search links.</p></figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a></div>



<p>The problem with that approach is that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-theyre-cryptobros.html">AI chatbots often make confident-sounding mistakes</a> &mdash; and, true to form, Google couldn&rsquo;t even get the details of its latest Google Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet products exactly right, including the price. We used Google Bard for our tests, not Google Search, but with the same AI eventually underlying both, we think the results are worth highlighting.</p>



<p>Google makes a bold choice when laying out its latest search vision: It puts its AI results right on top. Microsoft and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808784/1808784.html">AI-powered Bing search engine</a> also includes a conversational AI-powered chat interface, but places its AI in a small box to the right of traditional links, at about the height (and priority) of the top search result. In certain cases, such as asking both search engines for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/742457/google-pixel-fold.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">specifications of the Google Pixel Fold</a>, Bing includes an array of specifications from a third-party Web site. In Google&rsquo;s mockups, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-theyre-cryptobros.html">AI chatbots aren&rsquo;t search engines, they&rsquo;re crypto bros</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="bings-right-bard-isnt">Bing&rsquo;s right; Bard isn&rsquo;t</h2>



<p>On the advice of my editor, I asked both Google Bard and Bing Chat for the specifications of both the Google Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. Bard was much more verbose &mdash; but, unfortunately, also more wrong.</p>



<p>Both search engines, to be fair, returned mostly accurate results. We even gave Bard the benefit of the doubt, asking it for the specifications of, first, the &ldquo;Google Fold&rdquo; and then the &ldquo;Google Pixel Fold.&rdquo; But Bard still returned incorrect information about the exterior display, reporting first that its outer 5.8-inch display had a 1080&times;2670 display and an inner 7.6-inch display of 1920&times;1080. It doesn&rsquo;t; the exterior display has a resolution of 2092&times;1080 and an inner display of 2208&times;1840. (Both run at up to 120Hz, another fact Bard left out.) When we asked it a second time, it didn&rsquo;t even distinguish between the inner and outer display, simply stating that it has a 7.6-inch foldable display with a resolution of 1920&times;1080.</p>



<p>(You can see the results of our query below. You may need to open the images in a separate tab. Google lists the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_fold_specs?hl=en-US&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">specifications of the Pixel Fold</a> on its shopping page.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Bard versus Microsoft Bing Pixel Fold" class="wp-image-1817065" height="818" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Pixel-Fold-Bing-v-Bard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Google Bard (left, center) versus Bing Chat (right)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Bard also waffled on the camera specs, first reporting that the Pixel Fold&rsquo;s front camera was 8 megapixels, and its rear camera was 48MP (main) / 12MP (ultrawide) / and 10MP (telephoto). It then decided that the front selfie camera was 12MP, and the rear was 50MP/12MP/10MP. (The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_fold_specs?hl=en-US&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">correct specifications</a> are a 8MP selfie camera and a 48MP/10.8MP/10.8MP rear camera.)</p>



<p>Bard was at least consistent on the price, the battery size, the dimensions and the wireless capabilities, but couldn&rsquo;t decide whether the Fold runs Android 13 or the upcoming Android 14. (Google doesn&rsquo;t say.)</p>



<p>Google also goofed when asked about the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816339/googles-pixel-tablet-is-a-nest-hub-too-and-still-a-hard-sell.html">Google Pixel Tablet</a>. Its most significant error? The price, which Bard listed as simply $599. In fact, according to Google, the base configuration is $499, a full $100 less. (There <em>is</em> a $599 option, which increases the base 128GB of storage to 256GB, but more notably, a swathe of early Pixel Tablet rumors pegged it as that price.) Bard also continued to have problems with the camera specs, incorrectly characterizing the front and rear cameras as 8MP and a 13MP (main) and 5MP (ultrawide) rear camera. The Pixel Tablet includes 8MP front and rear cameras, with no options for an ultrawide.</p>



<p>Again, we&rsquo;ve reproduced our queries below. You can compare them to the official <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/product/pixel_tablet_specs?hl=en-US&amp;selections=eyJlOCI6ImNHbDRaV3hmZEdGaWJHVjAiLCJJaSI6W1siMiIsIk13PT0iXSxbIjEiLCJNalUyIl1dLCJTNyI6IlRIZDBkVUZqIn0%3D&amp;xcust=2-3-1817020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Pixel Tablet specifications</a>.</p>

<p>Bing, meanwhile, skated by reporting that the Pixel Fold has a &ldquo;1080p&rdquo; exterior screen. Otherwise, though, it was entirely factually correct on both Google devices, when Google itself wasn&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>Google <em>is</em> moving to an updated <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816361/googles-bard-workspace-gain-powerful-new-ai-smarts.html">PaLM 2 large language model</a>, with tighter integrations to other Google services.

</div>


<p>Want a 6K monitor? If so, Apple&rsquo;s Pro Display XDR is the only game in town&mdash;and its Mac-centric design makes it unappealing to those using Windows. Dell has finally delivered an alternative, the Ultrasharp U3224KB, which packs 6K resolution as well as a webcam, microphone, soundbar, and USB-C hub. The monitor&rsquo;s sharpness is spectacular but comes at a high price.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html">best 4K monitors</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="what-are-the-dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-specs">What are the Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB specs?</h2>



<p>The standout specification is obviously the monitor&rsquo;s 6144&times;3456 panel. This is a tad higher than Apple&rsquo;s Pro Display XDR, which has a resolution of 6016&times;3384. Dell also opts for an IPS Black panel, a new type of IPS display panel that delivers a better contrast ratio than its predecessors.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 32-inch 16:9 widescreen</li><li>Native resolution: 6144&times;3456</li><li>Panel type: IPS Black LCD</li><li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li><li>Adaptive-Sync: None</li><li>HDR: VESA DisplayHDR 600</li><li>Ports: 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Mini-DisplayPort, 1x Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C with 140 watts Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 2.5Gb ethernet, 1x Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C, 1x USB-C with 10 watts Power Delivery, 1x USB-A</li><li>VESA mount: Yes</li><li>Webcam: 4K HDR&nbsp;</li><li>Microphone: Included</li><li>Speakers: Included</li><li>Price: $3,199.99</li></ul>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB retails at $3,199.99. That&rsquo;s an extremely high price, though certainly not unheard of&mdash;and, with no other 6K option on the market aside from Apple&rsquo;s $5,000 Pro Display XDR, Dell likely feels free to charge what it wants.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-design">Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Dell&rsquo;s Ultrasharp U3224KB has a 6K display, but odds are that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;ll first notice. The monitor throws in a soundbar and 4K webcam, both of which are positioned above the display. It&rsquo;s an odd, top-heavy look that immediately stands out, but it works just as well as if the soundbar was beneath the display.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815065" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB has a solid build made from sturdy silver plastic.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Material quality is solid with sturdy silver plastics that resist flex and provide a convincing faux-metallic look. I do have a nit to pick, however: I found that the plastics in the monitor&rsquo;s bottom left and right corner were too flexible and creaked when the monitor was handled in this area. I doubt it&rsquo;s a functional issue but it&rsquo;s unfortunate to see at this price point.</p>



<p>A heavy stand keeps the monitor firmly planted on a desk. The base is compact, however, and its flat profile helps you retain some use of the desk surface that it does occupy. This is preferable to high-end monitors that use wide, tripod-style stands, which are most commonly found on LG and Samsung displays. The stand adjusts for height, tilt, swivel, and can pivot 90 degrees into landscape orientation. A 100x100mm VESA mount is included for attaching a third-party monitor stand or arm.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-features-and-menus">Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB features and menus</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB has a Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and a whopping 140 watts of Power Delivery. That&rsquo;s important, as 140 watts is enough to fully power a new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/798334/dell-xps-15-9520-review-premium-laptop-with-oled-display-and-polished-design.html">Dell XPS 15</a> (and many other premium laptops with midrange discrete graphics).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This port also acts as a hub which drives a USB-C downstream port, four USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb ethernet port. This makes the U3224KB a capable <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447927/how-to-choose-a-usb-hub.html">USB hub</a>. Do note, however, that the monitor lacks a USB-B upstream port, which means its USB hub capabilities are only available when the USB-C port is connected.</p>



<p>Additional video connectivity is available over HDMI 2.1 and, strangely, Mini-DisplayPort 2.1. Full-sized DisplayPort 2.1 is not available. A Dell representative told me the use of Mini-DisplayPort was due to early technical issues with VESA&rsquo;s development of a full-sized DisplayPort 2.1 connection. Those issues were resolved, but Dell had already locked in its design, leaving the U3224KB with Mini-DisplayPort. Dell also notes that a compatible Mini-DisplayPort 2.1 output can be found on the latest AMD Pro graphics cards. In any case, this makes for a total of three video inputs, all three of which support 6K resolution at 60Hz. Be careful to check&nbsp;the display output standards&nbsp;used by your PC, as&nbsp;older&nbsp;video cards may lack&nbsp;support for an output that can handle 6K.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815068" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB on-screen menus.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>A joystick is used to control the monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menus. Dell&rsquo;s menus are logically arranged and provide a variety of image quality options including color temperature adjustment and up to six-axis custom color adjustment for hue, saturation, gain, and offset (in the Custom Color mode). The monitor also has presets for the sRGB, Rec.709, DCI-P3, and Display P3 color space.</p>



<p>The joystick is joined by a set of touch-sensitive controls on the lower-left bezel that can adjust the volume, mute the microphone, or deactivate the camera. They&rsquo;re normally invisible but light up when a finger or hand comes within about a half-inch of the lower-left bezel. I don&rsquo;t think most people will use them frequently, as controlling these functions in Windows is a quicker, easier option. Still, privacy-minded users might like the option to deactivate the webcam and microphone.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815067" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB comes with a built-in 4K webcam.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The 4K HDR webcam delivers good video quality. It&rsquo;s not a match for a &ldquo;real&rdquo; camera, to be sure, but comparable to the quality of 4K standalone webcams like the Logitech Brio and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394759/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-price-specs-features.html">Dell Ultrasharp Webcam</a>. Video is fairly crisp and provides a lush, saturated look. A built-in microphone can capture audio and picks up strong, clear audio that easily beats most laptop or monitor microphones I&rsquo;ve heard over the past few years. Together, the camera and microphone will help you look and sound your best in video calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Audio quality is respectable, though not amazing. Volume is high and the presentation is crisp when playing less demanding content, like a well-recorded podcast, but the sound muddies in music, movies, and games. Still, it&rsquo;s a big step up from the dinky speakers found in most monitors. The microphone and soundbar have an echo cancellation feature that lets owners attend a video call without headphones.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-dell-ultrasharp-u3224kbs-sdr-image-quality">How is the Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB&rsquo;s SDR image quality?</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB is promoted as the world&rsquo;s first 6K monitor with an IPS Black display panel. So, are the extra pixels noticeable?</p>



<p>Yes, they are. The 32-inch 6K (6144&times;3456) panel packs 220 pixels per inch, a roughly 60 percent improvement over a 32-inch 4K monitor. This pixel density is similar to Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro laptops and a bit less than a laptop with a 4K display. In fact, it might be more accurate to say the extra pixels aren&rsquo;t noticeable&mdash;because it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to see the individual pixels on the display. They only reveal themselves in test images or under magnification.</p>



<p>Whether you&rsquo;ll benefit from the pixel count is another matter. Most modern apps look great at 6K resolution, but older apps that lack proper scaling are extremely difficult to use without turning on WIndows&rsquo; built-in magnification feature, which is cumbersome. Games look fantastic, but running a game at 6K resolution reduces its performance, so this won&rsquo;t be viable on anything but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">the latest GPU hardware</a>. 4K movies and streaming shows look great but, of course, no more so than on a 4K monitor.</p>



<p>The full benefits of 6K are mostly reserved to content creators. It&rsquo;s obviously preferable if you shoot video at 6K resolution, or something close to it. Alternatively, you can edit video at 4K resolution and view a true 4K preview that takes up only a portion of the display. Photographers benefit, too, as the improved resolution makes it possible to edit large photos with less need to zoom in and out of the image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short: 6K resolution looks awesome, but you&rsquo;ll struggle to fully appreciate it unless you&rsquo;re working with content at extremely high resolutions. This isn&rsquo;t a problem, but an observation, and one that should help you decide if a 6K monitor is for you. We live in a 4K world, so you&rsquo;re unlikely to see the benefits of 6K content unless you&rsquo;re creating it yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is more to a monitor than its resolution, however&mdash;and the Dell U3224KB scores well in most image-quality tests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>For Windows PC users, the Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB is the only game in town for getting the maximum number of pixels on a display.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815070" height="852" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pcworld-u3224kb-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Maximum brightness comes in at an excellent 524 nits. That&rsquo;s much brighter than most situations call for (I spent most of my testing with the monitor set to 15 percent of maximum). However, I do think the brightness is useful, as this is precisely the type of monitor that might be mounted in a conference room or an executive&rsquo;s corner office. The monitor remains comfortable to use in a bright room.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815072" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pcworld-u3224kb-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Dell opts for an IPS Black display panel. True to its name, it achieves a luminance as low as .01 nits. That&rsquo;s a big improvement over a typical IPS panel, which can dip only as low as .06 to .03 nits (without a Mini-LED backlight).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is a respectable maximum contrast ratio of 1,710:1. It&rsquo;s a very noticeable improvement over a standard IPS display, yet still quite far behind Mini-LED monitors, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1658523/acer-predator-x32-fp-review.html">Acer Predator X32 FP</a>, and OLED monitors, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">Asus ProArt PG32DC</a>. The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB provides good depth when used in a bright room but struggles with shadow detail in darker scenes, and it can&rsquo;t hope to match the jet-black look of an OLED display panel.</p>



<p>This is a key point. The Dell&rsquo;s contrast ratio is behind similarly priced alternatives, but those alternatives don&rsquo;t offer 6K resolution. Shoppers will need to make a choice between sharpness and depth.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815073" height="816" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pcworld-u3224kb-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Dell U322KB produced a color gamut that spans 100 percent of sRGB, 99 percent of DCI-P3, and 92 percent AdobeRGB. That&rsquo;s an excellent result and beats most similar monitors. Only the Asus ProArt PG32DC, which has a top-quality 4K OLED display panel, exceeds the Dell U3224KB&mdash;and it&rsquo;s still a close call. The Dell should offer a broad enough color gamut to handle any task.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815074" height="897" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pcworld-u3224kb-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color accuracy is solid, too. The Dell U3224KB does fall behind some alternatives, like the ProArt PG32DC, but the level of color error produced by these displays is so small that it&rsquo;s unlikely to be a problem for even the most discerning users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also recorded a gamma curve of 2.2, which is precisely on target, and a default color temperature of 6800K, which is just a tad cooler than the target of 6500K. These are good results.</p>



<p>Understanding the U3224KB&rsquo;s image quality might feel complex, but it&rsquo;s rather easy to simplify. The monitor looks great, but it only beats 4K competitors when 6K content is available.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-dell-ultrasharp-u3224kbs-hdr-image-quality">How is the Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB&rsquo;s HDR image quality?</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB supports HDR and carries a VESA DisplayHDR 600 certification. It performed as promised with a maximum sustained full-screen HDR brightness of up to 669 nits. That&rsquo;s a strong result that exceeds OLED monitors. However, it does fall behind Mini-LED monitors like the Acer Predator X32 FP, which can hit at least 946 nits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>High brightness helps the U3224KB provide a more vivid image and add luminance detail in HDR content. Bright highlights, like a sunset or headlights in a dark alley, are noticeably more detailed than in SDR. However, the U3224KB&rsquo;s modest contrast ratio is a limitation and ultimately dulls the monitor&rsquo;s impact in HDR. The monitor struggles when a small, bright object appears in an otherwise darker image, looking flat and washed-out compared to a Mini-LED or OLED alternative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U3224KB also falls well behind other monitors in its price range. It&rsquo;s only a few hundred dollars less expensive than the Asus ProArt PG32DC, an OLED monitor that&rsquo;s barely dimmer in HDR content and delivers a far more realistic image in dark scenes. The Acer Predator XP32 FP, which retails for $1,500, demolishes the U3224KB&rsquo;s HDR performance with higher marks in both bright and contrast. The Dell looks decent on its own, but it&rsquo;s hopelessly outmatched by price-competitive alternatives.</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-motion-performance">Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB motion performance</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB" class="wp-image-1815069" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Motion clarity is not a focus for the Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB, which comes with just a 60Hz refresh rate.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Motion performance isn&rsquo;t a focus for Dell&rsquo;s Ultrasharp U3224KB, and it shows. The monitor has a 60Hz refresh rate and promises a minimum gray-to-gray response time of five milliseconds. Neither figure is great: Today&rsquo;s best monitors reach up to 500Hz and achieve sub-millisecond gray-to-gray response times.</p>



<p>Fast-moving objects show little clarity as they zoom across the screen. The vague outline of the object is tangible but details, like the color of a person&rsquo;s eyes or the texture of their clothing, are indistinct. Panning the camera in a 3D game will cause significant blur that makes it difficult to focus on any particular object, character or enemy. While the U3224KB&rsquo;s overall performance is not impressive, it&rsquo;s typical for a 60Hz monitor.</p>



<p>Adaptive Sync is missing, as well, so the monitor can&rsquo;t coordinate its refresh rate with the video output from a device. This will cause screen tearing and/or micro-stutter issues in some games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="is-the-dell-ultrasharp-u3224kb-worth-it">Is the Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB worth it?</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB is an exceptional monitor with a razor-sharp 6K image, useful webcam and microphone, and versatile USB hub, but its overall image quality and feature set may not hold up against 4K alternatives. Despite its impressive resolution, the U3224KB&rsquo;s contrast ratio and HDR performance fall behind similarly priced options like the Asus ProArt PG32DC.</p>



<p>Still, a simple fact remains: The Dell Ultrasharp U3224KB is a 6K monitor. Apple&rsquo;s Pro Display XDR also provides 6K resolution but its price, design, and focus on the Mac make it a non-starter for those using Windows PCs. Creators on Windows who want 6K resolution will find the U3224KB is their only option. For now, at least.</p>
