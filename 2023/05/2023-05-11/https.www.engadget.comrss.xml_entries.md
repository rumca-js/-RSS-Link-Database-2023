<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-issues-first-ever-roboblocking-order-against-one-eye">ordered</a> voice service providers to block the global gateway provider One Eye. The FCC says the company, which serves as an “on-ramp” to US phone networks from outside the country, enabled robocall scams like impersonating a major financial institution and calls about bogus “preauthorized orders” placed in consumers’ names. The Biden administration’s FCC has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-removes-companies-robocall-database-195240929.html">focused on</a> increasing its ability to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-cuts-off-voice-provider-193458702.html">enforce</a> robocalls. “This company — what’s left of it — will now have a place in robocall history,” said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “We can and will continue to shut off providers that help scammers.”</p><p>Today’s order is the culmination of an escalating series of actions by the FCC to stop One Eye from facilitating shady robocall campaigns. First, the agency cited the company’s predecessor, PZ/Illum Telecommunication, for transmitting illegal robocalls. Then, in a cease-and-desist letter <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-issues-robocall-cease-and-desist-letter-one-eye">sent</a> in February, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau warned the newly minted One Eye that its rebranding wouldn’t help it avoid consequences while alerting it that a failure to comply would lead to a permanent block. (On the same day, it <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-warns-providers-about-robocalls-one-eye-llc">cautioned</a> US voice providers about One Eye’s activity.) Finally, it <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-accelerates-action-against-illegal-robocall-gateway-facilitator">sent</a> an “initial determination order” in April, another step toward the block it ultimately issued today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FCC’s statement doesn’t specify where One Eye’s headquarters are. The February cease-and-desist letter was addressed to a registered LLC in Delaware, but that could merely be a US branch of a global operation based elsewhere.</p><p>The block has teeth thanks to the FCC’s Gateway Provider Order <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-acts-stop-international-robocall-scams">issued</a> in May 2022. It laid out a new list of requirements for companies routing foreign calls to the US, including (among others) caller ID authentication using the STIR / SHAKEN framework, submitting certification plans, responding to traceback requests within 24 hours and blocking illegal traffic when notified by the FCC.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Enforcement Bureau team has built a fair, transparent, but tough process by which we can essentially shut down access to U.S. communications networks by companies such as One Eye that are targeting consumers with illegal robocalls,” said Enforcement Bureau Chief Loyaan Egal. “Today’s action demonstrates another cutting-edge tool in our robocall enforcement options and represents a landmark date in our efforts to protect consumers from scam calls.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fcc-blocks-robocall-middleman-one-eye-from-future-campaigns-211509369.html?src=rss

## The best smart displays you can buy
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-display-202448797.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-display-202448797.html?src=rss)

<p>/.Smart displays have evolved quite a bit since the initial debut of Amazon’s first Echo Show back in 2017. In fact, the category didn’t really come into its own until Google joined the fray with its own line of hardware about a year later. Now, both of these companies are essentially dominating the smart display landscape, with each offering their own take on a smart assistant with a screen.</p><p>It’s that screen that makes smart displays so much more useful than smart speakers. Rather than just having a voice recite the current weather report, for example, you can see a five-day forecast as well. The same goes for when you ask about your shopping list or calendar; it's simply easier to see the whole list or your day's appointments at a glance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Plus, displays offer other benefits that speakers can't, like watching videos or checking your webcam to see who's at your front door. They're especially handy in the kitchen, where you can use them for step-by-step cooking instructions. And, thanks to touchscreens, you can often navigate through functions and settings a lot faster than using your voice.</p><h2>Amazon vs. Google</h2><p>The first question you should ask is when looking for the best smart display for you is whether you prefer Amazon’s or Google’s ecosystem. If you have a lot of Google products in your home, like Nest thermostats or Nest cams, then a Google-powered model makes more sense. If you have Amazon products, like a Fire TV Stick or a Ring cam, Amazon would obviously be a better choice. Of course, it's perfectly acceptable to have products from competing companies in the same home, but just realize they might not work seamlessly with each other.</p><p>Aside from that, the two systems also offer some unique features. Google, for example, works best if you have an existing Google account and use services like Calendar and Photos. In fact, we especially love Google smart displays because they work well as digital photo frames. You can set it up to automatically pull in pictures of friends and family from your Google Photos library, and the algorithm is smart enough to use what it thinks are the best shots — so less chance of blurry photos or images of your eyes half-closed showing up, for example.</p><p>It might seem like a minor point, but seeing as the display is on standby 90 percent of the time, its secondary function as a digital photo frame is very welcome. All Google smart displays also support YouTube and YouTube TV, step-by-step cooking instructions and all of the usual benefits of Google Assistant, like weather reports. As with Assistant on the phone, it also has voice recognition, so only you can see your calendar appointments and not others.</p><p>Amazon's smart displays, on the other hand, are slightly different. Instead of YouTube, they offer some alternative video streaming options, including Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu. They also come with two browsers (Silk and Firefox), which you can use to search the web or watch YouTube videos – a handy enough workaround given the lack of a dedicated app.</p><p>Amazon devices offer step-by-step cooking instructions as well, thanks to collaborations with sources like SideChef and AllRecipes. In fact, the cooking instructions sometimes include short video clips. But although you can use Amazon's displays as digital photo frames, the process is not quite as intuitive as Google’s, and Amazon doesn’t have anything comparable to Google’s photo-sorting algorithm.</p><h2>The best smart displays</h2><p>Smart displays come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and some are better suited to certain rooms in the home than others. So while we do have some favorite all-around picks, we've also compiled a list of the best smart displays that would suit specific use cases as well.</p><h2>The best Google smart display: Google Nest Hub</h2><p></p><p>We at Engadget tend to prefer Google smart displays because most people are likely already entrenched in the Google ecosystem due to the ubiquity of Google services like Gmail, Calendar and so forth. We also tend to find Google Assistant to be a little smarter than Alexa, especially when bringing up answers from the web. As mentioned earlier, we also really like the tie-in with Google Photos and the smart photo-sorting algorithm.</p><p>Our favorite smart display overall is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtSHViLTJuZC1HZW4tU21hcnQtSG9tZS1EaXNwbGF5LXdpdGgtR29vZ2xlLUFzc2lzdGFudC1DaGFsay8xNjk0MzgyNzk_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYzNiOWY0OC1kZmUyLTM2YmItOWFlYi1kMzFhYmViOWY2ZTcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeGdngcMIvIKLzv0hSsi8nMkjcBcBZYmNJhMwtU5OnGR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-2nd-Gen-Smart-Home-Display-with-Google-Assistant-Chalk%2F169438279%3F">Google's latest Nest Hub</a>. Its 7-inch size is a better fit in more rooms, and its unobtrusive design combined with its soft fabric exterior blends nicely into your existing home decor. It does everything we think most people would want in a smart display, like YouTube videos, step-by-step cooking instructions, smart home controls and the ability to check in on your Nest cams if you have any.</p><p>In fact, the Nest Hub is especially useful if you have a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtRG9vcmJlbGwtQmF0dGVyeS1WaWRlby1Eb29yYmVsbC1DYW1lcmEtV2lyZWxlc3MtRG9vcmJlbGwtU2VjdXJpdHktQ2FtZXJhLVNub3cvOTgzMDU1MzM2PyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmMzYjlmNDgtZGZlMi0zNmJiLTlhZWItZDMxYWJlYjlmNmU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZPJ6lznKdlyBGcq3EKQJ4Bs5YnoEwEo_86asryedjhX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Video-Doorbell-Camera-Wireless-Doorbell-Security-Camera-Snow%2F983055336%3F">Nest video doorbell</a>, as the camera view of who’s at the front door will show up on the screen. An ambient light sensor helps to detect the light and color temperature of the environment and adjusts the screen to match. Plus, if you choose, it can help track your sleep patterns if placed next to your bed.</p><p>Another feature of the Nest Hub is actually a lack of one: It doesn't have a camera. That gives it that additional layer of privacy that many people covet, and it's also a lot more suitable for personal spaces like the bedroom. Sure, you could also cover up a camera with a shutter, but with the Nest Hub you don't have to remember to do that.</p><h2>Runner up: Google Nest Hub Max</h2><p></p><p>If you like Google but you miss having a camera for video calls, or you just prefer a bigger screen, consider the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtSHViLU1heC1DaGFsay80MjUzNTQzNDQ_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYzNiOWY0OC1kZmUyLTM2YmItOWFlYi1kMzFhYmViOWY2ZTcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYDfvvmpWlCAxJ1yBSeGgo33oQcD7aqd7_tYc-XBQDBk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Chalk%2F425354344%3F">Google Nest Hub Max</a>. At 10 inches instead of seven, it works a lot better for watching videos from YouTube and YouTube TV. It's especially useful in the kitchen, where it functions as a kind of portable television, and you can see more of those step-by-step cooking instructions at a glance. The bigger display also means a larger photo frame, which you may prefer.</p><p>As mentioned, the Nest Hub Max adds a camera to the mix. It doesn't have a physical shutter, which is a concern, but you can shut it off with an electronic switch. You can use the camera for video calls with Google's Duo service as well as Zoom, and it can also function as a Nest Cam to help you keep an eye on your house when you're away. Another benefit of the camera is the addition of Face Match facial recognition for authentication purposes, which we found to be a little more accurate than just using Voice Match.</p><p>Last but not least, the Nest Hub Max's camera  adds a unique gestures feature that lets you play and pause media simply by holding up your hand to the screen. It's not entirely necessary, but it's potentially useful if you're in a noisy environment and just want the music to stop without having to shout over everyone. Or perhaps you have messy hands while cooking and don’t want to dirty up the display.</p><h2>The best Amazon smart display: Amazon Echo Show 8</h2><p></p><p>Our favorite Amazon smart display is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FY2hvLVNob3ctOC0ybmQtR2VuLTIwMjEtcmVsZWFzZS9kcC9CMDg0RENKS1NMP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXkxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYzNiOWY0OC1kZmUyLTM2YmItOWFlYi1kMzFhYmViOWY2ZTcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWL5s0Q0GbpnLWDtyTgePVAtvFV_7X3YfnH6cA4gETFk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEcho-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release%2Fdp%2FB084DCJKSL%3F">second-gen Echo Show 8</a>.

Like other Amazon smart displays, it has a built-in camera, but there is a physical camera cover to help alleviate privacy concerns.</p><p>As such, the Echo Show 8 is a compelling choice if you want the option of using your smart display for video calls. Not only is the camera quality fantastic, but the Show 8 has a feature that automatically frames your face and follows your movements during video calls. It’s useful if you want to move around as you’re chatting, or if you have rambunctious children and pets running around the house and you want to involve them in the conversation. You can use the Echo Show 8 to make calls between other Echo Show displays, or through Skype or Zoom.</p><p>As with the other smart displays, the Echo Show 8 also works as a digital photo frame and can be used to keep up with the news, check the weather and control smart home devices. If you want to use your smart display to play music, we also really like the Echo Show 8’s audio quality on account of  its deep bass and rich tone.</p><h2>Runner up: Amazon Echo Show 5</h2><p></p><p>At only 5.5 inches wide, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhLSk4zMzMzP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXkxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYzNiOWY0OC1kZmUyLTM2YmItOWFlYi1kMzFhYmViOWY2ZTcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATfE9NI14fs5J12rgsnjaDRAgEwP_r-yydwiGB0uOQxW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08KJN3333%3F">Echo Show 5</a> is one of the smallest smart displays on the market, and as a result, will work nicely on a desk or a nightstand. In fact, one of the reasons we like the Echo Show 5 so much is that it doubles as a stellar smart alarm clock. It has an ambient light sensor that adjusts the screen's brightness automatically; a tap-to-snooze function so you can whack the top of it for a few extra minutes of shut-eye; plus a sunrise alarm that slowly brightens the screen to wake you up gently.</p><p>The Echo Show 5 does have a camera, which might make you a touch queasy if you are privacy conscious – especially if this is supposed to sit by your bedside. Still, it does have a physical camera cover, which can help ease any fears.</p><h2>Best smart clock: Lenovo Smart Clock 2</h2><p></p><p>Perhaps a smart display doesn't appeal to you because you don't care about watching videos on it. But maybe the idea of a smarter alarm clock like the Echo Show 5 intrigues you.

## Elon Musk says a new Twitter CEO is starting in six weeks

<p>Elon Musk is making good on his promise to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hell-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-but-wont-sell-the-company-025701394.html">step down as Twitter CEO</a> following a poll. The entrepreneur has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656747082571722753">announced</a> that a replacement chief executive will start at Twitter in roughly six weeks. While he hasn't identified the new leader by name, it will be a woman. Musk will stay on as executive chairman and chief technical officer covering &quot;product, software and sysops.&quot;</p><p>Musk said in December that he would honor the results of a poll asking whether or not he should bow out. He didn't give a timeline, but did say he would leave as soon as he found someone &quot;foolish enough to take the job.&quot; He also said he would relegate himself to running software and server teams. He has also abided by the outcomes of other polls for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">major decisions</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4c300c9487f445d58f5006142ad3b893"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!<br /><br />My role will transition to being exec chair &amp; CTO, overseeing product, software &amp; sysops.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656747082571722753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>His tenure has been chaotic since it began in October. He made a point of firing the executive team and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ceo-141551106.html">dissolving the board of directors</a>. Most rank-and-file employees from before the purchase have either been laid off or quit. Twitter's looser content moderation policies under Musk, which have focused on limiting reach rather than bans, have earned praise from some circles but have also prompted an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blog-post-reassure-advertisers-195429153.html">exodus of advertisers</a> that don't want to risk running ads next to hate speech and misinformation. The social network has tried to shift more of its revenue toward subscriptions, but may have had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-180000-paying-subscribers-us-mid-january-075214783.html">only limited success</a>.</p><p>It's not clear how much practical control Musk will have following the leadership shuffle. While he'll no longer be CEO, he'll still have significant influence over Twitter's technology and board decisions. And given that Musk played a role in finding a replacement, the new hire might not be quick to change strategy. Don't be shocked if Twitter maintains the Musk-era status quo, at least for a while.</p><p>This could assuage the fears of some Tesla investors. They've worried that Musk has been distracted from work at his best-known company by focusing on Twitter. With his reduced role, he'll theoretically have more time to devote to his EV brand as it faces mounting competition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-a-new-twitter-ceo-is-starting-in-six-weeks-195504511.html?src=rss

## Elektron's Analog Heat gets a refresh with more effects and a customizable signal path

<p>Elektron’s Analog Heat audio processor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-16-elektron-analog-heat.html"><ins>was already a fantastic tool</ins></a> for adding saturation and warmth to digital instruments, but now the company’s upping the ante <a href="https://www.elektron.se/us/analog-heat-fx-explorer"><ins>with a hardware refresh</ins></a>. Announced at the SuperBooth synthesizer expo in Berlin, Analog Heat +FX picks up where the MK2 left off, with the addition of new digital effects to complement the pre-existing saturation options.</p><p>The titular effects are the standout feature here, as the unit allows for tape emulation, reverb, bit crushing, delay, chorus and more. This is in addition to eight stereo analog distortion units, seven filter types, a two-band EQ and a noise gate. In other words, this little module can do a lot with your sound whether it's a simple keyboard riff or an entire master bus.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another huge new feature is called flow, which lets users easily reshuffle the signal path to create unique sounds. You can insert effects at any point in the signal path, before or after the audio source, and save the results in one of 512 preset slots. The device also encourages users to experiment with the modulation source and the three LFOs for even more adjustment capabilities. There’s also a mode called bass focus that automatically goes from stereo to mono at a preset cross-over point, helping to ensure a fat and focused low end.</p><div id="4121456505df42358b3d0f2d6d7a1c6b"></div><p>The hardware itself got a bit of an update here, with a new pixel-based OLED screen that is larger and brighter than the displays found on previous models. As for inputs and outputs, you get a MIDI in/out, two control inputs for foot switches and the like, multiple stereo ins and outs and a USB port. The USB port lets you plug straight into a computer, via a built-in sound card, to let you warm up (or mangle) audio from your DAW.</p><p>The Analog Heat +FX ships with a PSU-3c power supply and a USB cable. It’s available to order right now and costs $1,000.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elektrons-analog-heat-gets-a-refresh-with-more-effects-and-a-customizable-signal-path-190549864.html?src=rss

<p>Watching the Olympics in 2021 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-tokyo-olympics-134504180.html">was a little complicated</a>, requiring viewers to juggle NBC Broadcasts, the company's Peacock Streaming service and a dedicated NBCOlympics.com website. Today the company announced that watching the Paris games in 2024 <a href="https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2023/05/11/nbc-and-peacock-to-lead-nbcuniversals-coverage-of-the-olympic-games-paris-2024/">will be a lot easier</a> — declaring Peacock the &quot;streaming home&quot; of the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p><p>&quot;In a Summer Games first, the service will stream every sport and event, including all 329 medal events.&quot; NBC says it will also broadcast at least nine hours of daytime coverage on the network, which will then be made available for streaming on Peacock. The streaming service will also host full-event replays, curated video clips, original commentary and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NBC is heralding the coverage as the Olympic Games return to its &quot;true glory, with full stadiums and the world's greatest athletes&quot; since 2018, but the expanded programming is almost certainly a response to backlash over the network's limited coverage of the last summer Olympics. Although the network did make every event available to watch 2021, most of it could only be accessed on NBCOlympics.com, with NBC television and Peacock playing host to limited key events.</p><p>With any luck, NBC's new plans will make watching the games easier than ever. You'll have to wait about a year to find out, though: NBC and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/peacock/">Peacock </a>will kick off Olympic Games coverage on Friday, July 26 2024.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nbc-promises-itll-be-easier-to-watch-the-olympics-in-2024-on-peacock-182204595.html?src=rss

## Facebook Messenger app for Apple Watch is going away after May 31st

<p>Say goodbye to another high-profile Apple Watch app. As <em>MacRumors</em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/facebook-messenger-apple-watch-discontinued/">notes</a>, Meta is telling Facebook Messenger users that the Apple Watch version will be unavailable after May 31st. While you'll still get message notifications beyond that point, you won't have the option to respond. Meta didn't provide an explanation in a statement to Engadget. Instead, it pointed users to Messenger on &quot;iPhone, desktop and the web.&quot;</p><p>Meta (then Facebook) introduced Messenger for the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-09-facebook-messenger-apple-watch.html">in 2015</a>. The app couldn't offer text responses, but you could send audio clips, stickers and similar smartwatch-friendly responses from your wrist. That made it helpful for quickly acknowledging a message without reaching for your iPhone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few factors that may play a role. To start, the limited interaction hurt the app's appeal. That may have affected its potential audience. Meta is also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-begins-its-latest-round-of-layoffs-145019127.html">laying off roughly 10,000 employees</a> and refocusing its efforts in a bid to cut costs. That means cutting less essential projects, and it's safe to presume Messenger for Apple Watch wasn't a top priority.</p><p>Numerous well-known companies have dropped their Apple Watch apps over the years. Meta scrapped its wrist-worn Instagram app in 2018. Slack, Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-has-dropped-hailing-support-on-the-apple-watch-114057975.html">Uber</a> and others have also ditched their wearable clients. In many cases, developers left due to either a lack of demand or a lack of necessity — there's not much point to a native smartwatch app if you'll likely pick up your phone regardless.</p><p>Apple may be aware of this. Rumors suggest watchOS 10 may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-redesigning-watchos-around-widgets-162720331.html">redesigned around widgets</a>. Apps might stick around, but the emphasis could be on quick-glance information rather than navigating apps on a tiny screen. Even if you use Messenger for Apple Watch now, there might not be as much incentive to use it going forward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-app-for-apple-watch-is-going-away-after-may-31st-180252947.html?src=rss

## Scientists discover microbes that can digest plastics at cool temperatures

<p>In a potentially encouraging sign for reducing environmental waste, researchers have discovered microbes from the Alps and the Arctic that can break down plastic without requiring high temperatures. Although this is only a preliminary finding, a more efficient and effective breakdown of industrial plastic waste in landfills would give scientists a new tool for trying to reduce its ecological damage.</p><p>Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute WSL published <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/988366">their findings</a> this week in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoil.2023.1161627/full"><em>Frontiers in Microbiology</em></a>, detailing how cold-adapted bacteria and fungus from polar regions and the Swiss Alps digested most of the plastics they tested — while only needing low to average temperatures. That last part is critical because plastic-eating microorganisms tend to need impractically high temperatures to work their magic. “Several microorganisms that can do this have already been found, but when their enzymes that make this possible are applied at an industrial scale, they typically only work at temperatures above [30 degrees Celsius / 86 degrees Fahrenheit],” the researchers explained. “The heating required means that industrial applications remain costly to date, and aren’t carbon-neutral.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unfortunately, none of the microorganisms tested succeeded at breaking down non-biodegradable polyethylene (PE), one of the most challenging plastics commonly found in consumer products and packaging. (They failed at degrading PE even after 126 days of incubation on the material.) But 56 percent of the strains tested decomposed biodegradable polyester-polyurethane (PUR) at 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit). Others digested commercially available biodegradable mixtures of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid (PLA). The two most successful strains were fungi from the genera Neodevriesia and Lachnellula: They broke down every plastic tested other than the formidable PE.</p><p>Plastics are too recent an invention for the microorganisms to have evolved specifically to break them down. But the researchers highlight how natural selection equipping them to break down cutin, a protective layer in plants that shares much in common with plastics, played a part. “Microbes have been shown to produce a wide variety of polymer-degrading enzymes involved in the break-down of plant cell walls. In particular, plant-pathogenic fungi are often reported to biodegrade polyesters, because of their ability to produce cutinases which target plastic polymers due [to] their resemblance to the plant polymer cutin,” said co-author Dr. Beat Frey.</p><p>The researchers see promise in their findings but warn that hurdles remain. “The next big challenge will be to identify the plastic-degrading enzymes produced by the microbial strains and to optimize the process to obtain large amounts of proteins,” said Frey. “In addition, further modification of the enzymes might be needed to optimize properties such as protein stability.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-discover-microbes-that-can-digest-plastics-at-cool-temperatures-173419885.html?src=rss

It's supposed to be up to twice as powerful as the Steam Deck while delivering a higher-quality display.

## Sonicware’s newest gadget is a granular synth, an effects unit and a sampler

<p>Sonicware is back with another quirky standalone synthesizer in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonicware-liven-lofi-12-groovebox-222019320.html">fairly crowded Liven line</a>. The Liven Texture Lab was <a href="https://sonicware.eu/en/texturelab-2/"><ins>unveiled at the SuperBooth expo</ins></a> in Berlin and features a near-identical layout to some of the other Liven products, with that iconic case and button configuration, but that’s where the similarities end.</p><p>At its heart, Texture Lab is a granular synthesizer, which is when a waveform is sliced and sliced (and sliced) into extremely small pieces, which are called grains. The engine manipulates these grains in various ways to create unique tones. It’s somewhat rare to find standalone granular synthesizers, as the process is CPU-intensive and better suited to software, so Sonicware’s newest entry is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturias-microfreak-gets-sample-playback-granular-synthesis-and-gorgeous-stellar-edition-150008075.html">entering a rather sparse marketplace. </a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Granular synthesis allows for extremely unique and out-there tones, and the Texture Lab goes a step further by adding four-voice polyphony, a two-octave keyboard and a 128-step sequencer that records notes and minute changes in granular processing parameters. While not a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonicware-smpltrek-battery-powered-portable-sampler-groovebox-181357537.html"><ins>full-fledged groovebox,</ins></a> the Texture Lab includes a sampling engine with space for 32 samples of up to six seconds each, recording mono at 16/32kHz. The device can also sample internally and all of these samples can be chopped up for making more granular soundscapes.</p><div id="92d114202f724db2a1b47853532c0871"></div><p>Finally, this device is a robust effects processor, with a granular-based shimmer reverb, an envelope generator, filters, tremolo, a stereo width engine and more. Not only can these effects be applied to your various granular creations, but you can connect any external piece of hardware and run it through the same effects.</p><p>This is truly a standalone piece of hardware, with a built-in battery for on-the-go use and an integrated speaker. Sonicware continues its tradition of attractive pricing, as the Texture Lab will cost just $240 when it launches in June.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonicwares-newest-gadget-is-a-granular-synth-an-effects-unit-and-a-sampler-163231008.html?src=rss

## New York AG fines companies that spammed FCC with fake anti-net neutrality comments

<p>New York State is taking companies to task for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-state-report-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-170517463.html">flooding the FCC with bogus comments</a> supporting the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-14-fcc-repealed-net-neutrality.html">repeal of net neutrality</a>. Attorney General Letitia James has <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-615000-companies-supplied-fake-comments-influence">obtained</a> a total $615,000 from lead generating firms Ifficient, LCX and Lead ID for providing millions of fake comments in an attempt to skew the FCC's 2017 proceedings.</p><p>The broadband industry allegedly asked the trio to attract anti-neutrality input through ads and giveaways, but they instead manufactured fraudulent comments using real identities without permission. LCX and Lead ID directly faked responses for 1.5 million people, James says, while Ifficient served as a go-between that gathered 840,000 false comments from other lead generators. Several of the companies involved in the astroturfing (that is, fake grassroots) campaign had been involved in other attempts to influence regulators and politicians.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LCX and principals will pay $400,000 to New York and $100,000 to the San Diego District Attorney's Office. Lead ID and its principal will pay $30,000 to New York, while Ifficiient will pay $63,750 to New York and $21,250 to Colorado. This is the second batch of agreements New York has secured with companies sending fake comments to the FCC.</p><p>The fines come after a 2021 Attorney General report that found over 18 million of the 22 million comments on the net neutrality repeal were fake. While there were signs of trouble at the time, the FCC under then-Chairman Ajit Pai <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-21-new-york-blasts-fcc-over-net-neutrality-spam-fight.html">fought attempts to investigate</a> and address the spam. Pai had long been an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-28-fcc-chairman-calls-net-neutrality-a-mistake.html">outspoken opponent of net neutrality</a> and generally sided with telecoms on key issues.</p><p>The penalties are relatively tiny, and they won't undo the 2017 decision. Legislators haven't fared much better. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-net-neutrality-and-broadband-justice-act-144550417.html">Senate bill</a> that would have restored net neutrality hasn't gone anywhere, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-ps-end-fight-against-california-net-neutrality-laws-000336621.html">California's neutrality law</a> doesn't do much to help users in other states. The Attorney General's effort is more of a warning to would-be violators: don't expect to emerge completely unscathed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-york-ag-fines-companies-that-spammed-fcc-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments-152249081.html?src=rss

It'll hit those platforms on July 6th.</p><p><em>Gylt </em>is a third-person survival horror game from <em>Rime </em>studio Tequila Works. You play as Sally, who has to sneak around her gloomy town and the dark corridors of her school while evading monsters and looking for her missing cousin. I played a few hours of <em>Gylt</em> on Stadia and enjoyed my time with it. <em>Gylt</em> might be a bit too scary for younger kids and it may not be a great fit for those looking for more depth in terms of gameplay mechanics. However, the solid blend of puzzle solving and spooky setting could make <em>Gylt </em>a decent entry point into horror titles for tweens.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c44d503902964a0bb254a1ca58ca7f45"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/stadia-launch-title-gylt-will-hit-playstation-xbox-and-steam-on-july-6th-145836720.html?src=rss

The streaming service has revealed that the second season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/foundation/"><em><ins>Foundation</ins></em></a> will premiere on July 14th. The show, which is based on a series of Isaac Asimov novels, will return with one episode on that day, and more will follow on a weekly basis.</p><p>The season runs for 10 episodes and it's set over a century after the first season's finale. It features &quot;a vengeful queen&quot; who aims to destroy the Galactic Empire from within, Apple said. The Foundation, meanwhile, has moved into its religious phase. It's promoting the Church of Seldon throughout the Outer Reach and bringing about the second crisis — in other words, war with the Empire.

## 'Mouse' is a first-person shooter inspired by vintage Disney

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-11-cuphead-releases-september-29th.html"><em>Cuphead</em></a> isn't the only game banking on vintage animation to catch your eye. Fumi Games has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzI0MTY0NTAvTW91c2UvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NDVjNWE4YS05MDAyLTRhYWQtODQyYy0xZDBiNzgxYWM1YWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY8duc4mToEsoM_V0ndJnZFJ58x6L8mqBayUUxa1i_dd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2416450%2FMouse%2F">unveiled</a><em>Mouse</em>, a first-person shooter that mimics the "rubber hose" drawing style of 1930s cartoons from Disney and other studios. You play a private detective who has to blast his way through waves of mobster mice as he unravels a "web of deceit and murder." The result is equally charming and disturbing — crooks' heads pop like balloons, and explosions reduce your opponents to ash.</p><p>Fumi isn't leaning solely on nostalgia. <em>Mouse</em> will offer flexibility in how you play. You can charge in guns blazing, but you can also dodge around or meticulously plan your approach. A "Fantastic-o-Matic" upgrade system lets you boost preferred abilities and weapons through <em>Bioshock</em>-like vending machines. You can also expect activities like safecracking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fe39ef88950841bbae7743709a5fe3db"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>There's clearly a lot of work left. Fumi hasn't shared a release date, and the early footage shows barebones maps and gameplay mechanics. Still, <em>Mouse</em> shows some promise. Like <em>Cuphead</em>, the artwork is a refreshing break from what you're used to in its genre — it's neither striving for realism nor replicating the modern cartoon look of <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Valorant</em>. It's just a question of whether or not the gameplay is strong enough to keep you invested after the novelty wears off.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mouse-is-a-first-person-shooter-inspired-by-vintage-disney-134113206.html?src=rss

## The best apps and services for new graduates

<p>New grads can easily find themselves overwhelmed by the responsibilities of post-college life, such as commuting to work, balancing the budget or staying fit. So, maybe skip the gift basket and give them a subscription that helps make adulthood more manageable. Here are the services we most recommend for grads who are just starting out, including a few that are free to try.</p><h2>Commuting</h2><h2>Waze</h2><p></p><p>Many navigation apps can help a grad find their way around an unfamiliar town, but <a href="https://www.waze.com/waze-app">Waze</a> might offer the <em>best</em> way. The free service’s crowdsourced alerts can help drivers avoid construction or gridlock that isn’t always visible in competing apps, including Google Maps — its sibling. Tie-ins with streaming services like Spotify and TuneIn make it easier to soundtrack a lengthy trip without using separate apps. The ads that display while stopped aren’t ideal, but the sacrifice might be worthwhile if it helps a grad arrive on time for a new job.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Transit</h2><p></p><p>If your grad relies on public transportation, <a href="https://transitapp.com/">Transit’s app</a> is virtually a must-have. It provides detailed, real-time mass transit directions in hundreds of cities, letting riders know when to leave and which stops to take. More importantly, it’s integrated with alternative transportation options like shared bikes, scooters and Uber rides. The core app is free, but it’s worth paying $25 per year for a Royale subscription (if it isn’t offered for free by a local agency) to look up any transit line and future schedules.</p><h2>Lyft Pink / Uber One</h2><p></p><p>Ridesharing today is for more than just getting to parties or visiting family — for some, it may be the most effective way to get to work. In that light, a subscription to <a href="https://www.lyft.com/memberships/lyft-pink-monthly/offer-details?offer_id=lyft-pink-monthly">Lyft Pink</a> or <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2cd8d8eb-701c-4377-94c5-920a8345ffac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Uber&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyY2Q4ZDhlYi03MDFjLTQzNzctOTRjNS05MjBhODM0NWZmYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWJlci5jb20vdXMvZW4vdS91YmVyLW9uZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM4MDRmMDFmLWNmZjctNGM5ZC04Mjc2LWIzNmM0N2VmMWNiZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbeRrtIsRm6GXAfGgV-OCawbNx1Rq1iUyW39TERjjh8c&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fu%2Fuber-one%2F">Uber One</a> could easily be a welcome gift. Both $10-per-month services offer discounts on rides and food delivery as well as a handful of other perks, such as Lyft’s free priority pickups and Uber’s access to top-rated drivers. Either service is a good choice, although you’ll want to be sure there are plenty of drivers where your recipient lives.</p><h2>Cloud storage and security</h2><h2>Apple One / Google One / Microsoft 365 Personal</h2><p></p><p>Students can make do with a free cloud account or join a parent’s family plan, but there’s a good chance they’ll want a paid account of their own once they graduate. Thankfully, all the major platform creators have cloud service bundles that cover much of what they need. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2FwcGxlLW9uZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM4MDRmMDFmLWNmZjctNGM5ZC04Mjc2LWIzNmM0N2VmMWNiZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAefCvA7EIsv_GpIBa1EdTRIHZeVNeNcacPOW8Kk96P-D&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-one%2F">Apple One</a> ($17 per month for Individual), <a href="https://one.google.com/">Google One</a> ($20 per year for Basic) and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtMzY1L3AvbWljcm9zb2Z0LTM2NS1wZXJzb25hbC9jZnE3dHRjMGs1YmY_YWN0aXZldGFiPXBpdm90Om92ZXJ2aWV3dGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzODA0ZjAxZi1jZmY3LTRjOWQtODI3Ni1iMzZjNDdlZjFjYmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbjROLuGiSNOx5rVY_WSwwmGac04bwNGU85kRYfcF7hD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-365-personal%2Fcfq7ttc0k5bf%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab">Microsoft 365 Personal</a> ($70 per year) all deliver extra cloud storage as well as services you’re likely to use for entertainment, productivity and security.</p><p>The choice of service depends on what your grad is looking for. Apple One is, unsurprisingly, best for iPhone and Mac users — you get 50GB of iCloud storage, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. Google One, meanwhile, provides 100GB of shareable space, advanced Photos editing features and a VPN to secure your connection. Microsoft 365 Personal, meanwhile, is a big boost to productivity with Office apps, 1TB of storage and security tools like Windows Defender. While these bundles don’t cover every possible need, they can easily save money versus paying for each service on its own.</p><h2>ExpressVPN</h2><p></p><p>A VPN (virtual private network) can be extremely helpful for the security conscious. It can hide sensitive information from prying eyes and help access regional content that would normally be off-limits. There are many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html">good VPNs</a>, but our pick for a grad is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MjU1ZWJmMS02MTg1LTQwM2UtOWJlMi05MWFiNDdhZDFhYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc3Zwbi5jb20vb3JkZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM4MDRmMDFmLWNmZjctNGM5ZC04Mjc2LWIzNmM0N2VmMWNiZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATAqT2sDTkSFNPVqZTkhyGIfXwoO5Wok92u7RSoLOGCL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Forder">ExpressVPN</a>. While it’s not the cheapest at $100 per year, our security reporter Katie Malone says it’s extremely well-rounded. It’s easy to set up, works across many devices, includes a password manager, doesn’t log activity and is even gaming-friendly. Simply put, your ex-student is more likely to keep the VPN running regardless of what they’re doing.</p><h2>1Password</h2><p></p><p>Passwords are already a hassle in school, but they get worse once you leave — how is a grad supposed to remember all those new logins for utilities and other must-have services? That’s why we’re recommending <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=29d07367-7ffa-4e05-9a7f-c1dd19430630&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=1Password&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyOWQwNzM2Ny03ZmZhLTRlMDUtOWE3Zi1jMWRkMTk0MzA2MzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly8xcGFzc3dvcmQuY29tL3ByaWNpbmcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzODA0ZjAxZi1jZmY3LTRjOWQtODI3Ni1iMzZjNDdlZjFjYmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVMIBNuhuji_k6-cflzjqsiZ6sMLwh1JN518zbKPCscY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2F1password.com%2Fpricing%2F">1Password</a>. For $36 per year, it makes sign-ins easier on many of your devices. It can also store credit cards and other sensitive information. And importantly, 1Password is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1password-passkeys-passwordless-login-security-192001946.html">moving to passkeys</a> to access its accounts. A grad won’t have to worry that someone will guess their master password and effectively have access to their entire digital life.</p><h2>Productivity</h2><h2>Buddy Premium / YNAB</h2><p></p><p>It’s important to learn budgeting skills as a graduate, but it can sometimes be a pain to find the right tool — many people even settle for a spreadsheet. But a budgeting app can often provide extra features that a simple spreadsheet cannot. Nattkod’s <a href="https://buddy.download/">Buddy Premium</a> ($35 per year for iOS) and <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB’s</a> namesake app ($99 per year for Android and iOS) make it much easier to track spending and plan for the future. Both visualize expenses in an easy-to-understand way, making it clear just how much you have to spend each month.</p><p>Buddy is particularly helpful for sharing expenses with a partner or roommate, and you can even use an Apple Watch to enter data when you’re settling the bill at a restaurant. YNAB, meanwhile, is a good choice for grads saving up for long-term goals like vacations or that first new car.</p><h2>Todoist Pro</h2><p></p><p>To-do lists can help anyone stay organized, but the free options (such as Google Keep) might not cut it for a grad who suddenly has to juggle more than just classes. If that’s the case, they may appreciate a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c994543b-1b52-4fd2-8241-672e9deecf43&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Todoist&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjOTk0NTQzYi0xYjUyLTRmZDItODI0MS02NzJlOWRlZWNmNDMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90b2RvaXN0LmNvbS9wcmljaW5nIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzODA0ZjAxZi1jZmY3LTRjOWQtODI3Ni1iMzZjNDdlZjFjYmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAScAyydcxo4W7KDrmuSrNc0zRK0T5Fd4Y_7WeC1jl-Hj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftodoist.com%2Fpricing">Todoist Pro</a> subscription as a gift. While the free version already includes advanced features like filtering and labels, the $48 per year for Pro adds genuinely useful extras like reminders, automatic backups, more filters and larger 100MB file uploads. Throw in access across many platforms and it’s an easy choice for someone figuring out how to manage their personal and professional lives.</p><h2>Masterclass Individual</h2><p></p><p>Graduates don’t have to stop learning just because they got their degrees. A subscription to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ece2db60-ed2b-4433-8be0-79f90b069400&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=MasterClass&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlY2UyZGI2MC1lZDJiLTQ0MzMtOGJlMC03OWY5MGIwNjk0MDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFzdGVyY2xhc3MuY29tL3BsYW5zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzODA0ZjAxZi1jZmY3LTRjOWQtODI3Ni1iMzZjNDdlZjFjYmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdBnhALAmvF5IXtVX1o7ujg5geAtPpPDFItNZuQbRBK2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterclass.com%2Fplans">Masterclass Individual</a> may seem expensive at $180 per year, but it could easily help grads learn important personal and professional skills from (often famous) experts in different fields. They can perfect their cooking with Gordon Ramsay, or writing with Margaret Atwood. And importantly, this isn’t just about watching videos — pupils can follow a curriculum that involves finishing real projects. Skillshare ($168 per year) can be a better fit if a new grad primarily values creative skills, but Masterclass may be worth the outlay for honing life skills or simply indulging curiosity.</p><h2>Fitness</h2><h2>Apple Fitness+</h2><p></p><p>If you know a grad who has an iPhone and is eager to get fit, an <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2FwcGxlLWZpdG5lc3MtcGx1cy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM4MDRmMDFmLWNmZjctNGM5ZC04Mjc2LWIzNmM0N2VmMWNiZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATV5H9FNzhFqFfV86vzWOjtpZEfgSMVgDuWJE0iRX96n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-fitness-plus%2F">Apple Fitness+</a> subscription is an easy gift. A relatively low $80 yearly outlay provides access to 12 workout types that cover a wide range of durations and skill levels that can fit into a busy schedule. There are even audio-only running and walking workouts for those who prefer to exercise outside. The service works best when paired with an Apple Watch, but that’s no longer necessary — an iPhone is all they need to participate.</p><h2>Peloton</h2><p></p><p>Peloton’s equipment isn’t always a viable gift for a grad, but a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a98b569a-ef84-42fa-9ade-59f20fb8530c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peloton&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhOThiNTY5YS1lZjg0LTQyZmEtOWFkZS01OWYyMGZiODUzMGMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25lcGVsb3Rvbi5jb20vYXBwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzODA0ZjAxZi1jZmY3LTRjOWQtODI3Ni1iMzZjNDdlZjFjYmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdHWLj0ttdPuaQrJfkjgO0kVhfHQoJ5Bgf2DrPkp17Tb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onepeloton.com%2Fapp">subscription to its app</a> certainly can be. The $13-per-month membership gives Android and iOS users access to Peloton’s well-known trainers as they guide you through a variety of workouts that even include  bootcamps. This is also an ideal gift if your recipient prefers structure — there’s a range of programs that help develop skills, such as running marathons. Add community elements (such as seeing who’s participating in the same workout) and it can help newcomers stay committed.</p><h2>Entertainment</h2><h2>Apple Music / Spotify</h2><p></p><p>There’s a good chance the grad in your life wants to soundtrack their commute or work day, and a subscription to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2FwcGxlLW11c2ljLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgwNGYwMWYtY2ZmNy00YzlkLTgyNzYtYjM2YzQ3ZWYxY2JmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaluM76Eu_1i7umuTiUWhKN6BI6L-kjgqNFLsWmw8Eaq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-music%2F">Apple Music</a> ($99 per year) or <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=449e2503-c6b5-44c5-bdb8-b3045047b3e5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Spotify&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NDllMjUwMy1jNmI1LTQ0YzUtYmRiOC1iMzA0NTA0N2IzZTUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvdGlmeS5jb20vcHJlbWl1bS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM4MDRmMDFmLWNmZjctNGM5ZC04Mjc2LWIzNmM0N2VmMWNiZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXd87DLRARHcGYuhI6yuPcWyV2qGqBYLMjYyJoykiNzQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spotify.com%2Fpremium%2F">Spotify Premium</a> ($10 per month) should provide exactly what they’re looking for. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html">Both services</a> offer ad-free streaming and offline access to large song selections and well-curated playlists on many devices — you can listen to Apple Music on an Android phone, or play Spotify on your favorite game console.</p><p>The choice depends on a grad’s tastes.

The $110 per year no-ads plan ($8 per month with ads) provides access to a library that might not beat rivals in sheer quantity, but includes plenty of new and back-catalog material from Disney’s many huge franchises.

<p>The same noise-canceling ability and overall clarity that make AirPods a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">good match for iOS</a>, also make the buds well-suited for video chats and casual listening while you work on your laptop. AirPods are designed to pair automatically with your iPhone, but pairing them with a MacBook usually requires a few extra steps. If you’ve already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-connect-airpods-to-your-phone-153049788.html">connected them to your iPhone</a> and you’re using the same Apple ID on your MacBook, your buds may already show up in your laptop’s list of available Bluetooth devices.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/panasonic-delays-production-new-tesla-battery-improve-performance-2023-05-10/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the company has delayed the battery's mass production and has decided to kick things off between April and September 2024 instead, so that it would have enough time to improve its performance. &quot;Mass production rescheduled to begin during [the first half of the fiscal year ending in March 2025] to introduce performance improvement measures that will further enhance competitiveness,&quot; the company has revealed in its earnings report.&nbsp;</p><p>The 4680 battery format has the potential to boost the range of electric vehicles by over 15 percent. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023"><em>Nikkei</em></a> previously said that it could extend the range of the Model S from 404 miles on a single charge to around 465 miles.

<p>Games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> don’t come along often. The 2017 title came 31 years into the franchise’s history and somehow felt familiar while simultaneously remixing or entirely removing core tenets of the series. To put it mildly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-02-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.html">the changes worked</a>. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is the biggest-selling Zelda game of all time and was an unqualified success with critics and players alike.</p><p>What in the world do you do for an encore?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Internally, Nintendo decided to get right on that, announcing a direct sequel was in development only two years after <em>Breath of the Wild</em> arrived. The result is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk3QjJZV0ZYLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXh1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNThmNTk5Zi0zMjNmLTQ3YjctYTEyZS1hNTFlNTEzM2E3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAez4pBh2hyWHrDPKgshpnI0uYd4P7qpluKt8T4En0Ep3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB097B2YWFX%2F%3Fth%3D1"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, a game that is<em> not</em> a complete reinvention. Instead, after successfully blowing up the Zelda format, Nintendo is giving players even more – more of Hyrule to explore, and more freedom to dream up how to tackle the many, many challenges the game throws at them.</p><p>Perhaps even more than its predecessor, though, <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> demands patience. There’s an overwhelming amount of things to do, locations to see, puzzles to solve and enemies to defeat here. And as I tried to play through it as quickly as possible, to see as much of the world as I could for this review, I ended up more frustrated than satisfied. Fortunately, I then decided to slow down and indulge my curiosity, a decision that made the game far more rewarding and made me eager to explore at my own pace, without worrying about getting to the end.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce4a3d10-ef74-11ed-abbb-2d0a18df043b" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> kicks things off in a fashion that’ll be familiar to anyone who played <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. A quick prologue reveals the dark wizard Ganondorf and a calamity known as the Upheaval – events that leave Link grievously injured and Zelda missing (stop me if you’ve heard this one). The twist comes when Link awakes in a sky kingdom populated by ancient and powerful technology, courtesy of the Zonai clan. Lest you think, like me, that Nintendo just invented a new mysterious culture with a new set of powers to replace the Guardians from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, the Zonai were actually briefly mentioned in the previous game.</p><p>The first few hours of the game take place entirely in the sky, a fascinating setting with a host of new challenges and enemies. But here the game retreads the prior entry here as you need to journey to a handful of shrines to get a new set of abilities, just like you did on the Hyrule plateau in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. Once that’s done, you’re able to descend to Hyrule proper and get exploring.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce49c7e2-ef74-11ed-bafe-1a5b0615ecfd" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> gently guides you towards a few locations to get you started – but you can go anywhere you want, if you’re intrepid enough to try. The game definitely doesn’t hold your hand, and it took me a surprisingly long time to get my bearings and feel confident against the many monsters you’ll come across. At the start, Link is woefully underpowered, which makes finding the dozens of shrines dotting Hyrule crucial, as this is the quickest way to get more hearts, stamina and learn new fighting techniques.</p><p>I was also eager to find the numerous towers that dot the land, as those are how you reveal more of the Hyrule map. Six years later, Hyrule still feels positively massive, and navigating it without filling in the map is an exercise in frustration. In retrospect, though, I probably was too aggressive about journeying beyond the first few areas the game reveals to you, as I ran into numerous enemies I was simply not powerful enough to take on. My advice: stick to the game’s script and focus on the first few quests it gives you before going into full explorer mode.</p><p>In addition to the many shrines, the game will quickly implore you to search out four regions of Hyrule to investigate disturbances affecting the areas. (If you played <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, you can surely guess where those areas are.) This is where you’ll find the game’s four areas that harken back to the dungeons in Zelda games of yore. Just like before, you’ll need to help the citizens of each region before you can advance – but to keep things fresh, all the big dungeons are in the sky.</p><p>As much as I enjoyed revisiting the vast Hyrule overworld, the different gameplay elements and scenery of the sky areas made this feel novel. These main dungeons feel more similar to the Divine Beasts from <em>Breath of the Wild </em>than the levels found in Zelda games of old, but this time out they’re more visually distinct and connected to the region of Hyrule you’re visiting. The bosses of each are also a lot more creative and interesting than the variations of Calamity Ganon from last time out, too.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce49c7e1-ef74-11ed-9a6e-34bdd9a9fab4" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Another thing that will be familiar to <em>Breath of the Wild</em> players is the game’s presentation. As a direct sequel, there’s no noticeable change to how Hyrule and its inhabitants are rendered this time. Obviously, the sky islands and underground caverns were not present in <em>BotW</em>, so those areas gave the designers a chance to come up with impressive new visuals. The sky areas were particularly striking to me, though the underworld has a creepy, alien atmosphere that adds a whole new vibe to the game.</p><p>Nintendo’s art direction is impeccable, as usual, but six years on from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> it’s fair to say I sometimes wanted a bit more. I’ve been playing the <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> expansion <em>Burning Shores</em> – that series has a similarly vast open world to these recent Zelda games, and having that in the back of my mind made me imagine what Hyrule could look like on more powerful hardware. I’m not saying I want a fully photorealistic Zelda game; the semi-cartoonish style has always been part of the charm. But it’s hard not to imagine just how spectacular this game could look on more powerful hardware. Of course, that’s not Nintendo’s strategy and it hasn’t been for years – but one can dream.</p><p>That said, the Switch hardware does show its age in one significant area. Frame rate drops are a bit more common in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> than I’d like. To be clear, this isn’t a major issue that renders the game unplayable by any stretch of the imagination. Generally, things run solidly at 30 fps, but the more advanced physics at play here occasionally causes some stutters. You’ll also get some dropped frames if too much is happening on screen, like big battles with multiple enemies in the rain. I never felt like these problems were enough to keep me from playing, but they are noticeable and show that Nintendo is pushing the Switch as hard as it can here.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="Screenshots from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce3bbe20-ef74-11ed-bf5f-277a0347d501" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>You may be wondering what makes <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> more than just a <em>Breath of the Wild</em> remix. There are two major components that make it stand out. First are the two new areas above and below Hyrule proper. Both the sky islands and underworld add completely new challenges and gameplay elements. For example, one set of sky islands has less gravity than everywhere else in the game, so jumps carry you further. It may sound like a little thing, but it actually changes the way you go about fighting enemies – for example, a jumping slash attack can deliver multiple blows as you slowly float back to the ground. But it also leaves you more vulnerable, since you can’t pull out your shield in the middle of this move. If you time it wrong, you can take serious damage in a counter-attack.</p><p>The underworld areas are perhaps the most treacherous you can visit in Hyrule. That’s thanks to the persistent gloom enveloping those regions, something that makes the monsters below even more powerful. If you get hit, not only do you lose hearts from your health bar, but those hearts actually “break” – they can’t be refilled unless you use a special elixir or visit particular waypoints scattered throughout the map. Naturally, since it’s pitch-black underground, navigating is a challenge as well. You’ll want to come well-stocked with brightbloom seeds, which can be found in caves throughout Hyrule. Dropping those illuminates the area, and you can also take special potions that make you glow on your own.</p><p>The underworld quest line provides a second set of tasks beyond the ones found in the Hyrule overworld. There aren’t any dungeons underground as there are up in the sky, but there are still significant quests and enemies to find below the surface. And from what I’ve played so far, these aren’t just side quests – they intersect with the main goal of finding Zelda. It’s easy to forget about the underworld while journeying through Hyrule proper, looking for shrines and helping residents in all corners of the map, but you’ll gain valuable skills and progress the story in major ways by diving underground as well. If you’re getting stuck or running out of steam, delving into the deeps is a good way to change things up.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce492ba0-ef74-11ed-8ffc-2c8431ef8375" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>But easily the most significant change is in the abilities Link has, thanks to his “Purah Pad” (a new name for the Sheikah Slate from <em>BofW</em>). Two of the abilities, Ascend and Recall, are useful but don’t fundamentally change the way the game is played. Ascend lets you dive straight upwards through roofs or rocks to reach new areas quickly, while Recall rewinds time on specific objects to move them backwards. They can be handy for sure, but you’ll need to master the other two powers to get anywhere in <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em> One is called “Fuse,” which lets you stick objects you find around the world onto your weapons or arrows to enhance them. This is a requirement, because most of the weapons you find in the world have been decayed by Ganondorf’s emergence.</p><p>The good news is that you can stick all the monster parts you find around the world onto these weapons to greatly increase their power. For example, you can stick bokoblin horns on to your swords to make them stronger, but you can also fuse the tail of an ice lizard to a weapon and get its freezing power. However, these weapons still break far too often, so you’ll constantly want to be stocking up your inventory and investigating what combos of weapons and additional items work best. This goes for arrows, too: instead of being able to find or buy fire arrows, for example, you’ll need to attach a fire fruit to your arrow to set things aflame.</p><p>And then there’s Ultrahand. This takes the Magensis power from <em>BotW</em>, which let you move metallic objects around, and supercharges it. Now, you can pick up almost anything you see – and you can stick objects together to build basically anything you want. What really makes your creations useful are the Zonai tools you’ll find around the world, things like fans, wheels, flame-emitting objects and much more. If you have a board and a fan, you can fashion a makeshift hovercraft, for example. Or if you need to reach a far-off location, try building a bridge.</p><p>As the game goes on, it does a great job of nudging you towards building more complex and useful tools. The possibilities are near-limitless, and I’m really looking forward to seeing videos of all the ridiculous things that people try to build. (For example, the hilariously flammable war cart <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hands-on-preview-a-sequel-with-endless-creative-potential-130047291.html">that my colleague Sam Rutherford built</a>.) I was initially worried that I wouldn’t be quite creative enough to fully take advantage of the potential that Ultrahand provides, but totally wild creations are rarely required. Usually, it’s a matter of sticking two or three things together to achieve a goal, and the game makes it pretty clear what you need to do. The quick shrines, most of which you can get through in five or 10 minutes, also are good at showing you what kinds of things are useful to combine.</p><p>You can also use Fuse to combine Zonai objects together with your weapons and shields. One of my favorite combos is sticking a springboard to a shield – so when enemies hit it, they go flying, giving you a chance to counter-attack or run away. Attaching a fire device to your weapon, meanwhile, lets it spew flames as you swing it. Again, the possibilities are vast, and it’s going to be a lot of fun seeing what kinds of weapons and other contraptions people come up with to suit their own play styles.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="Screenshots from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce49c7e0-ef74-11ed-bdbf-4fcbe1705d9d" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>This all adds up to a game that, despite significant shared DNA with <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, feels new and vital. I have fond memories of my time traversing Hyrule in <em>BotW</em>, and I was eager to jump back into the world again. The overworld map may be the same, but plenty of the locations have changed significantly, which provided a distinct feeling of time passing between the games as well as offering new puzzles and challenges. The frequent dips into the sky or underworld, meanwhile, provide plenty of fresh, all-new areas to explore and challenges to overcome.</p><p>All this said, I also would be remiss if I didn’t mention the difficult, sometimes unforgiving challenge this game can occasionally present. Since there’s minimal guidance as to where you can and should go, it’s easy to find yourself in enemy encounters where you’re totally overmatched. And while most of the shrines are well done, there are some that are absurdly difficult for no apparent reason.</p><p>My “favorite" so far is one where you lose all your items and armor and have to figure out how to defeat enemies with just the tools provided to you. In this case, there were about eight high-powered machines, and while there were some little war machines to create, there’s also no shield in the shrine. Even with 10 hearts, making two mistakes was enough that I would die and lose my progress. It was <em>incredibly</em> frustrating, and there was no reason for it to be so hard.</p><p>And the impact of Fuse and Ultrahand cannot be overstated. These new tools make experimentation a hallmark of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> in a way it hasn’t been before. Now, in addition to exploring every corner of Hyrule, you’ll also need to try lots of different combinations of tools, weapons, found objects and Zonai devices to find the solution a puzzle demands. Or you can fritter away hours making contraptions from whatever you find laying around. In a lot of ways, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was already a creative sandbox that let gamers tackle the various adventures it offered in any order and any fashion they chose. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, that’s even more true.</p><p>If you want to spend all your time spelunking in the underworld, feel free. If you’d rather hunt down shrines at the expense of all else to maximize your stamina and hearts, that works too. If you only want to engage in building objects with Ultrahand when the game requires it, that’s fine – it makes it clear when you need to build various contraptions to advance. There’s enough guidance to set you on your path when you get started, but you can also ignore that and just roam the wilds. Do so at your own risk, though – it’s rough out there.</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk3QjJZV0ZYLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXh1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNThmNTk5Zi0zMjNmLTQ3YjctYTEyZS1hNTFlNTEzM2E3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAez4pBh2hyWHrDPKgshpnI0uYd4P7qpluKt8T4En0Ep3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB097B2YWFX%2F%3Fth%3D1"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> isn’t the series reinvention that we got in 2017, but that’s OK.

<p>Teenage Engineering has launched a new field recorder called the <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/tp-7">TP-7</a> that was designed to record interviews, music and any kind of audio with, in the company's words, &quot;zero friction in the highest possible quality.&quot; It's the latest entry to its &quot;Field&quot; series of interoperable products, which includes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-op1-tx6-expensive-fun-181029889.html">OP-1 synthesizer</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-tx-6-mixer-153033794.html">TX-6 mixer</a> released last year. Like the TX-6, the TP-7 is about as big as a deck of cards and can fit comfortably in your hand. It has a motorized &quot;tape reel&quot; at the center that you can use to easily scrub through or pause your recording and to navigate the menu.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a rocker on the left side of the recorder that you can also use to scrub through audio, along with a button right below it that quickly changes recording modes. While you can use its built-in microphone to record audio just fine, you can also plug in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-enters-the-microphone-space-with-the-gorgeous-cm-15-181721397.html">external mics</a> through its three stereo two-way jacks. Take note that the jacks can accommodate other audio equipment, as well, such as Teenage Engineering's other Field devices.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The TP-7 also has a USB-C port that you can use to transfer data or to charge it. If you use the device for interviews, you can connect it to an iPhone through that USB-C port or via Bluetooth and fire up the company's iOS app to get automatic transcriptions. The recorder can last up to seven hours between charges, has a built-in speaker in addition to the microphone and 128GB of internal storage.</p><p>Teenage Engineering calls the TP-7 &quot;a device engineered in every detail to do only one thing and to do it well,&quot; one that's &quot;perfect for... journalists, lawyers and medical professionals.&quot; But like most of the company's products, the TP-7 doesn't come cheap. It's listed for <a href="https://teenage.engineering/store/tp-7">$1,499 on Teenage Engineering's website</a> with a note that says it's coming sometime this summer.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineerings-tp-7-field-recorder-costs-an-eye-watering-1499-114007098.html?src=rss

It sports a 5.8-inch external display and a wide 7.6-inch internal screen when it's opened. It has a new 9.5-megapixel external camera and an 8MP internal shooter, and its rear setup features a 48-megapixel main camera, a 10.8MP ultra-wide and a 10.8MP telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom. In a lot of ways, the Pixel Fold is like last year’s flagship Pixel 7 Pro, but foldable, with the same Tensor G2 processor.</p><p>Google apparently had to redesign a lot of components to make it into what is a pretty slender widescreen foldable. We got to see one in person (because we’re Engadget), and the screen has a wider aspect ratio than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series. The bezels are… chunkier too, but that hasn’t put us off too much. The company hasn’t confirmed a shipping date, but it’ll be &quot;sometime next month.&quot; It’s offering pre-orders for the foldable if you’re already sold on the concept.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-hands-on-finally-a-real-rival-for-samsungs-foldables-185253034.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-tablet-hands-on-basically-a-500-smart-display-with-a-detachable-screen-185151133.html">Google Pixel Tablet hands-on</a></h2><h3>A $500 smart display with a detachable screen</h3><h3></h3><p>Though it was initially teased at last year’s Google I/O, the Pixel Tablet is finally ready for purchase.

With an 11-inch screen, a rounded-rectangle shape and a mesh fabric covering the speaker base, the Pixel Tablet looks incredibly similar to the Nest Hub Max.

## Fairphone launches a fully repairable set of over-ear headphones

<p>It’s been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-06-05-fairphone-hits-production-goal.html">ten years</a> since Fairphone launched with the laudable goal of making a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-06-ethical-smartphone-conscious-consumption.html">better phone</a> than its competitors. Not better in the spec-list sense, but by building it with greener materials and ensuring that they are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-3-plus-repair-camera-swap-153053319.html">easily and comprehensively repairable</a>. More importantly, the company has sought to improve the working conditions of the people building the devices in the first place. That’s by paying fairer wages or offering workplace training and other benefits that major manufacturers might be unwilling to do. All the while attempting to produce gear that can at least stand proud alongside brand-name devices costing two or three times as much.</p><p>Now, Fairphone is launching its first pair of over-ear headphones, Fairbuds XL, with the same focus on utility and repairability. The company says they’re the “most sustainable headphones on the market,” with almost all of the parts user-replaceable and available to buy. They can’t just be repairable and last a long while, however, they also have to sound good enough that you’ll genuinely want to use these over what else is in the market. Specs-wise, you won’t just get the basics, but active noise cancellation (ANC), multiple audio modes, two-point Bluetooth connection and a two-year warranty that’s likely to include hardware support for a lot longer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fairbuds XL are available either in speckled black or speckled green. I was loaned the green model for two weeks, and while the black looks like every other dull-ass pair of cans on the market, the green is utterly gorgeous. I love the orange contrast cabling and the lovely pop of copper on the four-way joystick, and enjoyed walking around in public with these on.</p><p>The design, with its visible wire connections and fold-in arms, is a generation or two behind the cutting edge. You know, your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">Sony XM5s</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html">B&amp;W Px7s</a> and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-25-bose-quietcomfort-35-review.html"> Bose QC45s</a>, with hidden wires, hinged earcups and an overall more elegant setup. I don’t think it’s an issue unless you’re suffering from a serious case of status anxiety, but if you are, you’re probably not thinking about buying these.</p><p>As for the hardware, there’s the aforementioned four-way joystick, a dedicated ANC lozenge button and a USB-C port, and that’s it. This minimalism carries across to what else is in the box: A recycled polyester / nylon carry bag and a little paper manual. There’s no USB-C charging cable, audio adapter or anything else, since Fairphone assumes you already have this stuff, or can just as easily buy it from its store.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Fairphone's Fairbuds XL on a table surrounded by books." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ff2a9f00-ee49-11ed-9d57-cfac7766b588" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>Fairbuds XL comes with 40mm dynamic drivers, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and an Ambient Sound Mode. It has an 800mAh battery which the company says will last for 26 hours with ANC or for more than 30 hours with it switched off. You’ll get around 320 hours of standby time and, once that’s exhausted, charging from cold is pegged at three hours. Supporting Bluetooth 5.1, Fairbuds XL offers dual-point connectivity, letting you hook up and switch between two paired devices. This switching was mostly reliable, although I found there were some device combinations – like an Android smartphone and my mac OS laptop, that it simply refused to play nicely with. Weighing 330 grams (11.6oz), the cans don’t outstay their welcome on your head, or your ears. The earcups are soft enough that I’m not forced to take them off because they’re uncomfortable.</p><p>Inside, those 40mm diameter drivers have a frequency response running from 20Hz to 20KHz. That puts it in the same bracket as a number of low and mid-budget sets on the market, of which this probably sits at the higher end, price-wise. Since it lacks any real background in sound, Fairphone sought out help from Sonarworks, a sound calibration company that works with a number of pro audio companies and artists. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-sonarworks-soundia-headphone-audio-app.html">SoundID</a> software will let users calibrate their audio profile to tweak how sound comes out of their headphones for a more personalized experience.</p><p>Now on the whole, I do rather like the sound that comes out of the Fairbuds XL. I’m not a massive fan of some of the genres which modern audio tests calibrate for, preferring instead something calmer, cleaner and more atmospheric. One thing I’ve always used to test a headphone’s quality is to see how well you can hear the breaths of the horn players during <em>Finale</em> from the <em>Tron Legacy</em> soundtrack, which are really clear here. Or how alive Max Haymer’s piano feels when playing his jazz reworking of <em>Optimisti</em>c that you think you’re in the room. London Grammar’s <em>Stay Awake </em>feels urgent, more meaningful here than in some headphones I’ve tried.</p><p>The ANC, meanwhile, was very reliable at drowning out a lot of the ambient noise in my office, inside and out. It totally eliminated the sound of my own typing, the sound of a vacuum cleaner, the building work a nearby neighbor was doing and a crying baby out in public. The one time I had an issue with it was taking a stroll around my local area and getting a face full of wind, but there’s no strong wind setting in the mobile companion app like you’ll find on other products.</p><p>In order to offer a greater level of customization, Fairphone is also launching a Fairbuds App for iOS and Android. This will allow you to change the EQ presents – tuned by Sonarworks – for a similar level of tweaking as you could find in SoundID. The app also offers the usual bunch of guides, tutorials and access to customer service, as well as the promise of future software updates. You’ll also be able to order replacement parts directly from the app, which should help prompt you to seek out a fix if things start to go wrong.</p><p>There are four sound profiles: Amsterdam (standard), Copenhagen (more treble), Tokyo (more bass) and Boston (heavy bass). I’ll be honest, I found that only really Amsterdam and Boston offered much real difference, and even then, the changes weren’t massive. In fact, I’d say that I’d opt for Amsterdam over Boston even if I was listening to something pretty bassy like Low’s <em>More</em>, with its wonderfully teeth-rattling glitchcore overdriven bass. Suffice to say, I feel like the sound profiles need to be more distinct here, but it’s something that Fairphone should be able to improve upon in the coming months.</p><figure><img alt="Image of the Fairbuds XL partially-disassembled." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/1e150cc0-ee4a-11ed-a7eb-a13f1f19a041" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, Fairphone’s obligation stretches beyond the idea of simply making the hardware modular and repairable. The company says Fairbuds XL uses 100 percent recycled aluminum, 100 percent recycled tin in its solder paste and 80 percent recycled plastic. It added that it has integrated Fairtrade Gold into its supply chain, and uses 100 vegan leather for both the ear cushions and headband.</p><p>In terms of working conditions for the people who made them, the company will pay 0.55 USD per headphone made to “fill the living wage gap of production line workers.” And that it is “working with the supplier on improving working conditions based on workers’ needs.” It will also back carbon-reduction projects to help reduce CO2 emissions to ensure the headphones are essentially climate-neutral.</p><p>These are all laudable, but even Fairphone serially admits that the effort it makes can only make a small difference in the grand scheme of things. Its work is limited both by its size and relatively small market share, which means that it can’t do everything that it would like to. As much as it can say it’s producing the fairest device on the market, it can’t claim ownership of a halo that it doesn’t deserve. The best it can hope for, however, is to try and push the technology world toward approaching a more sustainable approach for its products.</p><p>(This is a good moment to share a gripe about the company’s <a href="https://shop.fairphone.com/en/accessories/true-wireless-stereo-earbuds">True Wireless Earbuds</a>, which it launched alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-4-5g-preview-103011717.html">Fairphone 4</a>. These are made with fair and recycled materials, and were dubbed as “e-waste neutral,” but weren’t modular or repairable. Given most TWS earbuds have sealed-in batteries, they become effectively unsalvageable when they break. Fairphone offered replacement cases, tips and buds, but  it seemed to join the tide as opposed to swimming against it. With the Fairbuds XL, the focus has moved back toward an audio product that sails closer to Fairphone’s true ethos)</p><p>Fairphone’s overall ethos is that its products are – with the above exception – user-repairable, and easy enough that anyone should be able to take them apart and keep them going for years to come. The company has already shared a list of parts you can buy from its online store, which includes a new battery, left and right speaker modules, headband assembly and cover, as well as the ear cushions. Prices range from €19.95 (around $22) for the battery all the way to €79.95 (around $88) for a new speaker module, which connects to the setup with an integrated USB-C cable.</p><p>As for the ANC selection button, four-way joystick and the specific PCBs inside the earcups, those can be repaired, but right now, only at the company’s repair center. This, to me, seems pretty fair, since users probably won’t be comfortable taking a soldering iron to their cans. The deal is that you can swap in modules to keep this thing going for as long as possible, but if you want to keep it going with completely-original parts, you’ll need more expert help.</p><p>Fairphone customarily ships out its loan units for review with an iFixit #00-size Phillips-head screwdriver in the package. This is because it wants reviewers, and by extension potential buyers, to know how easy it is to take apart its products and put them back together. Imagine if Apple, Samsung, John Deere or any of the other companies that are regularly behind anti right to repair legislation had a similar attitude. As usual, I didn’t start disassembling the Fairbuds XL until I’d spent enough time listening to them, just in case something broke, but I needn't have worried.</p><p>The easiest repair to make is swapping out the battery, which requires you to pop off the outside cap on the left earcup. If you’ve got strong fingernails, you can lever out the battery and swap in a replacement in half a minute if you’re on the slow side. Removing the ear cushions to replace them is similarly a matter of just twisting them a quarter-turn to unlock them from their mounts. This is easy stuff, which makes it all the more frustrating that most companies won’t let users make these sort of common repairs.</p><p>Feeling braver, I then opted to detach the speaker modules from the headband in their entirety to mimic the process of replacing one. You just need to pop out the battery, twist off the ear cushions and then you can slide out the USB-C cable sticking up top. After that, you need to unscrew just two small screws which hold the whole assembly to the headband. The process took all of two minutes, and that was probably because I was going slow to avoid messing up.</p><p>Fundamentally, the Fairbuds XL follow through on the usual Fairphone promise of a modular, almost infinitely-repairable device. It has many of the necessary fundamentals to make them a worthwhile purchase for many people, including good ANC, long life and a comfortable design. What it lacks, for now, is a certain dynamism in its sound profiles that would give users more choice in how  tunes are presented. Thankfully, that’s something that could be fixed in a later update, which is something that Fairphone has historically been very good at doing. In fact, if you’re happy with very good sound, and want to help make the world a slightly better place in doing so, then I’d say these are a very solid bet.</p><p>The name is a <em>bit </em>silly, however.</p><p>Fairbuds XL will be available to buy in Europe from tomorrow, May 11th 2023, on Fairphone’s website, priced at €249 (around $275).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-launches-a-fully-repairable-set-of-over-ear-headphones-080017046.html?src=rss

## Cruise's robotaxis are heading to Houston and Dallas

<p>Cruise's robotaxis are continuing their push across the Lone Star State. The self-driving car company has announced it plans to begin supervised testing in two more Texan cities, Houston and Dallas, joining its earlier move into Austin (yes, the home of still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robo-taxi.html">robotaxi-less Tesla</a>). For now, the expansion is focused on familiarizing the car with the areas, rather than picking up passengers. Residents of the two cities can expect to start seeing Cruise's robotaxis cruising down the streets with a safety driver inside.</p><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Cruise/status/1656283003457503232">tweet sharing the news</a>, Cruise said supervised testing in Houston should start in a matter of days while Dallas will be &quot;shortly thereafter.&quot; Cruise's robotaxis are already available on a limited basis overnight in Austin and Phoenix and all day in certain areas of San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The speed General Motors-owned Cruise is advancing has brought some concerns. In January, San Francisco's Transportation Authority asked regulators to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-asks-california-regulators-to-halt-or-slow-driverless-vehicle-testing-083906662.html">limit or temporarily pause Cruise</a> and competitor Waymo's expansion, citing repeated cases of their cars inexplicably stopping in traffic and blocking emergency vehicles. As of yet, things have done anything but slow down. Since the request, Cruise celebrated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-robotaxi-1-million-driverless-miles-170051724.html">one million fully driverless miles</a> on top of making its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-self-driving-taxis-can-now-operate-around-the-clock-in-san-francisco-144419506.html">robotaxis available at all times in San Francisco</a> — though full access is only for employees.</p><p>Right now, there's no set date for when the public will have access to rides in Houston or Dallas. Going off the timeline of other Cruise expansions, it will likely take at least a few months until anyone can hail a self-driving car in either city. Even then, it will probably start with a small group of people and only at night. Anyone interested in taking one of Cruise's robotaxis has to sign up for a waiting list and be accepted to create an account. The company says its limited available cars will keep its services invite-only for the time being.</p><div id="feb8cb1275eb4ba2b5fe22c405b21ed7"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’re getting bigger in Texas…<br /><br />Introducing our next 2 cities— Houston and Dallas! <a href="https://t.co/9z8PBCl0Zr">pic.twitter.com/9z8PBCl0Zr</a></p>— cruise (@Cruise) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cruise/status/1656283003457503232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote></div>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cruises-robotaxis-are-heading-to-houston-and-dallas-094531398.html?src=rss

<p>Google's excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-order-the-google-pixel-7a-185253414.html">Pixel 7a</a> just hit the market for an already solid price of $499, but you can now save more thanks to a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtUGl4ZWwtN2EtVW5sb2NrZWQtQW5kcm9pZC9kcC9CMEMxSFoxVjU2Lz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXh3LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MzYwY2FhYS01NzA3LTQ5ZjAtOWNjYi00YTI0ZTI3YmQ2ZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARq-M1hVPCRUgb11nWcqWllMYoycLluUBL8qUDv2CQMT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android%2Fdp%2FB0C1HZ1V56%2F%3Fth%3D1">deal at Amazon</a>.

Google has nailed the balance between price and performance, offering the same Tensor G2 chip as the Pixel 7, along with a 90Hz display, wireless charging and a higher-resolution rear camera.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two big changes over the Pixel 6a are a new high-res 64-MP main cam in back, along with a front 13-MP selfie camera can record videos in 4K. The Pixel 7a beats other smartphone cameras in its price range so handily for photography and video that it actually needs to be compared to flagship devices like the Pixel 7 Pro and Samsung's S23 Ultra.&nbsp;</p><p>The extra resolution goes a long way to eliminating any concerns about the lack of a telephoto, as you can zoom in four times and still get a 16-megapixel image. And Google's Night Sight mode remains the best in the business, even though it does add a little more noise than we expected.&nbsp;</p><p>In sum, the Pixel 7a delivers 95 percent of what you get from the regular Pixel 7, but for $100 less.

## Disney+ and Hulu will merge into a single app later this year

<p>A &quot;one-app experience&quot; that combines Disney+ and Hulu content will launch in late 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger has announced during the company's <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-q2-fy23-earnings-results-webcast/">latest earnings call</a>. He <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/disney-hulu-one-app-experience-later-in-2023-1235609003/">said</a> the company will continue offering Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ as standalone options, but combining services &quot;is a logical progression&quot; of its direct-to-consumer offerings &quot;that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers, while giving bundle subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content...&quot;</p><p>Since Comcast still owns 33 percent of Hulu, this announcement suggests that Disney could be thinking of buying the cable TV and media company's stake. Iger didn't elaborate on the company's plans, though, and only said that Disney has had &quot;constructive&quot; talks with Comcast about the future of Hulu.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to announcing the combined streaming app, Iger has also revealed that Disney+ is getting another price increase after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html">adding $3</a> on top of its ad-free streaming tier's monthly fee in December. He didn't say when the company is raising the service's prices, but when it does, the ad-free and ad-supported tiers will cost more than $11 and $8, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>While Disney <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2023/05/q2-fy23-earnings.pdf">reported</a> (PDF) a 26 percent decrease in operating losses for its streaming business, a $659 million loss is still massive. The price hike's announcement didn't come out of nowhere, seeing as the company <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-10/disney-lost-4-million-subscribers-in-the-second-quarter-but-streaming-lost-less-money#:~:text=Disney's%20streaming%20businesses%20posted%20an,the%20end%20of%20fiscal%202024.">promised</a> investors that the business will be profitable by the end of the 2024 fiscal year. The question is whether the combined Disney+ and Hulu app could convince new users to pay for a subscription — or for old subscribers to come back. Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2023 after shedding 2.4 million users in the previous quarter.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/disney-and-hulu-will-merge-into-a-single-app-later-this-year-083536664.html?src=rss

## Sony's Xperia I V phone is a photo and video powerhouse

<p>Yes, Sony is still making smartphones, and its latest is the flagship <a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-launches-new-xperiar-1-v-smartphone">Xperia 1 V</a> designed for both photographers and vloggers. It features a new stacked, backside-illuminated (BSI) sensor along with features aimed at content creators found in its Alpha-series cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>The Xperia 1 V has a new image sensor called "Exmor T for Mobile" designed to be faster and work better with computational (AI) photography, while offering "approximately double" the low-light performance of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-xperia-1-iv-smartphone-has-the-worlds-first-true-optical-zoom-lens-071003899.html">Xperia 1 IV</a>, Sony said. As you'd expect in a flagship, it offers other high-end features like a Snapdragon 8 Gen2 Mobile Platform, a 6.5-inch 4K 120Hz OLED HDR display, a 5,000 mAh battery that allows for up to 20 hours of continuous 4K playback, up to 12GB of RAM and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that, Sony is promising "best in class" gaming performance, thanks to a Game Enhancer function that provides visual and auditory support. It also lets players livestream their gaming directly to YouTube.&nbsp;</p><div id="22afdd6cfbbb4e69aeae15af91f749e6"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The key feature is clearly the camera system, though. The main 24mm f/1.9 equivalent 52-megapixel camera features a Type 1/1.35-inch (about 12mm diagonally) Exmor T sensor that's 1.7 times larger than the Xperia 1 IV's sensor, Sony said. It also comes with an ultrawide 12-megapixel camera and an 85-125mm 12-megapixel optical telephoto zoom, like the one on the Xperia 1 IV. The front 12-megapixel camera has a Type 1/2.9-inch sensor.&nbsp;</p><p>Purists will be able to shoot video and photos using the professional modes that allow for full manual control. Chief among those is the Photography Pro mode designed for creative control. It also allows live streaming while letting creators see viewer comments in real time.</p><figure><img alt="Sony's Xperia I V smartphone debuts vlogging features like 'Product Showcase'" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/58b85410-efce-11ed-8bc6-754e29ca255d" style="height: 1713px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>If you set it to Basic mode, though, you'll get a good dose of computational imaging seen in other Android phones. Those include a Night mode and color settings for subjects like flowers and a blue sky. It also delivers real-time eye autofocus and tracking, along with high-speed continuous shooting of up to 30 fps with auto-exposure and AF enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>For vloggers and content creators, it now features the same Product Showcase setting found on Sony's vlogging cameras like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-12-megapixel-full-frame-zv-e1-is-a-low-light-vlogging-beast-140009036.html">ZV-E1</a>. The new sensor also promises improved skin tones, thanks to extra saturation available on the sensor. It also has a new voice priority mic placed near the rear camera that can pick up voices even in busy outdoor locations.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Sony's Xperia I V smartphone debuts vlogging features like 'Product Showcase'" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/eac9c7e0-efcd-11ed-9bff-7168f4905caa" style="height: 1351px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>One cool feature that might justify the price alone for many video shooters is the ability to use the phone as a monitor for select Sony Alpha cameras. The Xperia 1 IV could do that as well, but the new model offers multiple display options with waveforms, gridlines, and zebra lines normally only found on professional field monitors. You can also control settings and record content to phones, features that weren't available before. Meanwhile, the phone's microphones can capture sound while monitoring audio via the Xperia 1 V's headphone jack.</p><p>As with past Xperia models, the catch here is the price.

## Roland S-1 Tweak Synth is the most compelling member of the Aira Compact family

<p>Last year during Superbooth Roland unveiled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rolands-aira-compact-199-synth-drum-machine-t-8-j-6-e-4-070020662.html">Aira Compact</a> series – its first true competitors to Korg’s wildly successful Volca line. Now the company is back for Superbooth 2023 with a new addition to the family, the S-1 Tweak Synth. Like the T-8 and J-6, the S-1 uses Roland’s Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology to recreate the sound of an iconic instrument from its past, the SH-101. While the core of the S-1 is ultimately quite familiar, in true Roland fashion there’s a lot of modern features packed in as well. And in even truer Roland fashion, many of them are buried in a bewildering array of indecipherable menus and button combinations.</p><p>I’m going to get this out of the way right now, because it’s a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-verselab-mv-1-groovebox-vocalists-hands-on-080016948.html">recurring theme</a> in almost every review I write of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-tr-6-s-review-classic-drum-machines-808-909-portable-143001780.html">Roland product</a>. The interface here is truly mind boggling once you get beyond the immediate hands-on controls. Almost every knob and button has <em>at least</em> one shift function. Many of them aren’t labeled. And the only visual feedback you’re given for anything is via a four-character, seven-segment LED display. A seven-segment LED display in 2023! I dare anyone to tell me what the hell “Nod.d” means without looking it up in the manual. And what about the D-Motion button suggests that this is where the probability and substep options are located? I’m not trying to suggest that I should be able to figure out every feature on an instrument right away without reading a manual. But I also shouldn’t feel like a lost ball in the tall weeds. Especially not when we’re talking about an entry level $200 synth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c67b9465e39041fc8523b2a2a877267e"></div><p>The clunky interface here is particularly frustrating because the S-1 is otherwise kind of great. It actually has a decent amount of hands-on controls. It offers far more depth than any of the previous Aria Compact entries, even if you never touch the shift button. There’s an LFO with six different waveform options, including random. The oscillator section allows you to blend together a saw and square wave with pulse width modulation, as well as a sub oscillator and noise source. And, unlike the original SH-101 which was monophonic, the S-1 is polyphonic so you can play actual chords (up to four notes).</p><p>And the oscillators sound great. I’m not always the hugest fan of Roland’s ACB sound engine, but it shines here. Thick bass, acid leads and 16-bit JRPG arps are all easily attainable and satisfying. This is easily the best sounding member of the Aira Compact family.</p><p>The filter is excellent too. It stops <em>just</em> shy of self oscillation, but still gets pretty sharp and can certainly endanger your eardrums if you have your headphones up too loud. But at the lower end of the cutoff spectrum you get a surprising warmth and silkiness from this dirt cheap emulation of a classic analog circuit.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Roland S-1 Tweak Synth" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/68cd92f0-efb7-11ed-affa-8e7c38346a09" style="height: 1125px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Roland even threw in a delay, seven reverbs and four chorus options. The reverbs are merely ok, but the delay is a perfectly solid digital effect. You can even set the delay time to 1/128 and crank the … Anb(?) reverb model to get howling metallic textures that are out of this world. The choruses, pulled from the Juno and JX-3P are truly excellent. It’s just a shame they’re buried in the arcane menu system because I want to turn them on for almost every patch I make.</p><p>There’s a solid arpeggiator, and you can even record directly from the arpeggiator into the 64-step sequencer. That’s pretty handy for laying down glassy high notes then going back in and overdubbing some bass to accentuate the chord changes. I will say though, I haven’t quite figured out how to get to 64 steps. By default sequences are 16 steps, there is no obvious way to go beyond that and I was not provided a manual with my review unit.&nbsp;</p><p>Roland also added motion sequencing to S-1, so you can tweak settings as you’re recording to slowly increase the amount of delay over the course of a pattern. Or even go into the menu and turn on and off the chorus, or change the sub-oscillator tuning on a per-step basis. It really opens up a lot of possibilities on an instrument this small and affordable. You can ratchet notes, set per step probability, and there’s even Step Loop for quickly mangling your sequence into new riffs on the fly, though that is far more useful on a drum machine.</p><figure><img alt="Roland S-1 Tweak Synth" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/68cd44d0-efb7-11ed-bffb-c4b77fd9556f" style="height: 1125px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>If the feature list for the S-1 ended here, that would be perfectly fine. But Roland added more. So. Much. More. Maybe too much more.</p><p>There’s a draw and chop function, which allows you to create custom waveshapes for even wilder tones. Then use the multiplier on your freshly drawn waveshape, or the comb on your chopped wave for hard-synced and dissonant metallic noises. You can also turn the noise source into a sort of pulsing riser effect. Though, I was unaware of this when I accidentally activated it while messing around one afternoon and couldn’t for the life of me figure out what was going on. This is one of those many unlabeled features hidden behind a seemingly arbitrary button combination. (For the record, you hold down shift then press 1 and 2 simultaneously to cycle through a few different riser modes.)</p><p>The one last feature worth mentioning (I think), is a bit of a head scratcher. D-Motion allows you to change parameters by picking up the synth and tilting it about. It’s a fun novelty for a few minutes, but it doesn’t feel practical. Though, at least it makes more sense on the small, battery-powered and portable S-1 than it does on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-roland-sh-4d-is-a-groovebox-disguised-as-a-synthesizer-080026322.html">SH-4d</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Roland S-1 Tweak Synth" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/68ce0820-efb7-11ed-bff3-21728d8e24c6" style="height: 1125px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond that the S-1 resembles the rest of the Aira Compact line. It’s plastic, has a rechargeable battery built in and weighs next to nothing. There are 3.5mm MIDI, sync and audio jacks for connecting other gear. And USB-C for charging, but also for sending audio and MIDI to computers, phones and tablets. My one other minor gripe, physically at least, is that the mushy keys are painfully small. Playing chords on this thing is a bit of a headache. But not much more so than on any other instrument of this ilk, like the Modal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-review-virtual-analog-170031324.html">Electronics Skulpt</a> or a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-11-korg-announces-volca-analog-synth-series-we-go-eyes-on.html">Volca Keys</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Roland S-1 Tweak Synth" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/68ccf6b0-efb7-11ed-bfe3-3c3264a29132" style="height: 1125px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The S-1 Tweak Synth is both the most compelling and most frustrating member of the Aira Compact series. It has plenty of hands-on controls, sounds great and is deceptively powerful for the price. But it is also, perhaps, too complex. It tries to do too many things and ends up feeling cluttered and confusing. Which is the exact opposite of what you want from what is essentially a $200 music toy.</p><p>What made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/korg-volca-fm-2-synthesizer-152847286.html">Korg’s Volcas</a> so successful wasn’t their laundry list of features, it was their simplicity. They sounded good enough, were affordable, and unintimidating. Roland seems to have gotten the first two parts of the equation down. Now it just needs to work on the last ingredient.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/roland-s-1-tweak-synth-is-the-most-compelling-member-of-the-aira-compact-family-070014423.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">Google's I/O event</a> this year was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-everything-announced-at-the-event-193758196.html">jam-packed</a> with new product launches and an in-depth introduction to its new generative AI offerings. The star of its new set of device was, perhaps, the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-hands-on-finally-a-real-rival-for-samsungs-foldables-185253034.html">Pixel Fold</a>, a veritable rival to Samsung's foldables powered by a Tensor G2 chip. Like the Samsung Galaxy Fold, it opens like a book so you can fully use its 7.6-inch display, though it also comes with a 5.8-inch external display. It's now available for pre-order and will set you back $1,799 when it starts shipping in June.&nbsp;</p><div id="eb6941f8ad0e4daf956f0f5f6cc196e1"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The company has also unveiled its new mid-range phone, the Pixel 7a, that will cost you $499. In addition, the Pixel Tablet is now available for pre-order for the same price. You can use the 11-inch tablet as a smart home display with Google Assistant and Chromecast when it's attached to its speaker dock. On its own, it can last for 12 hours, and while it doesn't come with a stylus, it does support third-party pens.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But the most important and relevant unveiling of the event was the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-its-multilingual-code-generating-palm-2-language-model-180805304.html">PaLM 2 AI language model</a>, which is the technology behind its Bard AI chatbot and which will power new features across its products. Bard will soon have the ability to decipher images in your queries and respond with images in turn — it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-transitions-to-palm-2-and-expands-to-180-countries-172908926.html">now available</a> without a waitlist in 180 countries. Gmail will have the ability to craft responses to emails for you, while Photos is getting a Magic Editor that can move objects in your pictures. You can get a glimpse of all Google announcements in a condensed version of its I/O keynote above.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-google-io-2023-keynote-in-under-18-minutes-052059113.html?src=rss
