## Is there a future for protest in Britain? Standing in the muted republican crowd, my fears only grew | Andy Beckett

<p>The days of anarchic, festive demonstrations seem to be over in the face of draconian laws, threatening letters and pre-emptive arrests</p><p>Last Saturday morning, it felt strange setting out to take part in the republican protest in London while knowing that its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">organiser had already been arrested</a>. A queasy mixture of mild shock, anxiety and defiance sat in my stomach all the way to Trafalgar Square. Demonstrators in longstanding authoritarian countries must be used to such sensations, but as someone who since the 80s has done most of their protesting in Britain, this sense that peaceful street politics was no longer necessarily tolerated by the authorities was new and unsettling.</p><p>When I got to the square, it was reassuring to see that there was still a demonstration, but less so to realise that it was smaller than expected – a few hundred people – and that much of it was squashed into a narrow space between the National Gallery and a huge temporary wall, running almost right across the square, which appeared to have been built that morning specifically to make the protest as invisible as possible. Police ringed the demonstrators, while a constant stream of coronation-goers squeezed past. The usual atmosphere of the square on protest days, as one of Britain’s freest public spaces, was almost completely absent. Instead, the possibility of a crowd crush, more arrests or a confrontation never seemed far away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/republican-protest-britain-police-public-order-act">Continue reading...</a>
