The success of that first movie opened the door for Marvel to explore lesser-known comic book characters and also seemingly gave them the green light to go all-in on comedy beats (for better or for worse.)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 definitely raises some questions. Like what's Adam Warlock actually doing in this movie? How did they make High Evolutionary so despicable so quickly? Are kids gonna be okay after all that intense animal stuff? Why didn't Star-Lord have his helmet and boots?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3!!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThe Mandalorian Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQeT-vLiwE\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fbBhcK0CDg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wXeRQtK6PM", "date_published": "2023-05-11 19:17:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
