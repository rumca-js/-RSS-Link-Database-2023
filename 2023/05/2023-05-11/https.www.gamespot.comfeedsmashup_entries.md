<p>If you're worried about wearing out your Joy-Cons playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom over the next couple months, never fear. Hori has you covered with <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4VN8TTF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">this gorgeous Tears of Kingdom-themed edition of its excellent Split Pad Pro</a> </span>, which costs $60 and releases August 31 (though that could be a placeholder date). Preorders are sold out at this time, but we imagine it'll be available to order again.</p><figure style="width: 1500px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4136893-zeldatearsofthekingdomhorisplitpadpro.jpg"><img alt="Hori Split Pad Pro - Tears of the Kingdom edition" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4136893-zeldatearsofthekingdomhorisplitpadpro.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Hori Split Pad Pro - Tears of the Kingdom edition</figcaption></figure><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4VN8TTF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Preorder at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><p>The Hori Split Pad Pro is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/">GameSpot's current pick for best Switch controller for handheld-focused players</a>, and for good reason: it gives you a full-sized, ergonomic controller experience in handheld mode. The buttons, the sticks, triggers, and D-pad are all much larger on the Split Pad Pro than they are on the stock Joy-Cons. So considering how cramped the standard Joy-Cons are, especially if you've got big hands, the ergonomics of the Split Pad Pro are a big relief.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-edition-of-best-switch-handheld-controller-revealed/1100-6514092/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom producer Eiji Aonuma has beaten the new game 20 times, and claimed that he is still discovering new stuff.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-9-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-part-5/">new interview</a> published by Nintendo (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eiji-aonuma-has-completed-tears-of-the-kingdom-20-times-heres-his-advice">IGN</a>), Aonuma advised that the game is more fun when you take frequent detours. Aonuma wanted to dissuade players from rushing to the ending, instead taking the time to explore side-paths. He said, "When testing the game, I sometimes needed to rush ahead to clear the story, but later on, as I started to go off on side paths, I realized...it's a whole different game!"</p><p>He emphasized that the fusion abilities are key to this sense of discovery. Aonuma stated, "Even when sticking things together, there are so many different combinations that even I don't know all of them. I even discovered something new the other day while shooting the gameplay demonstration video."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-producer-eiji-aonuma-has-beaten-the-game-20-times/1100-6514088/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We're a mere three weeks away from the release of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and apparently Sony had one last big trailer for us that puts the focus on a couple of the new Spider-folks we'll be meeting in the film: Miguel O'Hara aka Spider-Man 2099, and a house cat known only as Spider-Cat.</p><p>On top of getting more time with Miguel, this trailer includes a ton of gorgeous new out-of-context shots of the Spider-Verse. While we don't know what it all means, this trailer is showing us that the second Spider-Verse flick might be even more beautiful than we're expecting. And we're expecting it to be pretty dang beautiful. Watch the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse will see Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and the other Spider-people from the first movie return alongside dozens or hundreds of new Spider-folks. Together, they're facing The Spot, a man whose body is made up of dimensional warps. Sounds like he's uniquely equipped to battle this dimension-hopping Spider-crew.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-across-the-spider-verse-trailer-reveals-the-spider-cat/1100-6514083/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">The way I see it, James Gunn has two main thematic modes: gleeful nihilist, and sappy idealist. It might seem like an odd pairing to some, but these two facets go together so well that they frequently blur into each other--like peanut butter and jelly. For the full James Gunn experience, you need them both.</p><p dir="ltr">But while the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have all the sappiness, their darker side isn't really all that dark. Vol. 3 definitely moved the needle in the right direction on that imbalance with Rocket's newly revealed backstory and some of the High Evolutionary's other atrocities.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-is-a-reminder-we-still-need-r-rated-james-gunn-movies/1100-6514081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Xbox Hardware Exec Wants To Bring Quick Resume To Windows

<p>Microsoft is reportedly looking to bring Xbox-style quick resume to Windows. As reporter Tom Warren spotted on <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1656675385000734724">Twitter</a>, Xbox's head of hardware Roanne Soanes focused on the potential of "quick resume" tech at an Asus ROG Ally streaming event.</p><p>Soanes speculates about the possibility of playing a game on a desktop PC, and then resuming the same game from the same point on a portable device like the Ally. She then points out that similar tech exists on Xbox, so it's a question of how to bring that to other devices. She said, "How do we think about integrating [quick resume] into Windows platform? How do we think about really working with developers and publishers, not just our own, but also more broadly with third party?"</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Microsoft dropping hints that it&rsquo;s thinking about bringing Xbox Quick Resume or something similar to Windows.

<p>Destiny 2's next season of content is getting deep, and that's not a metaphor.

In a new teaser trailer, Bungie has also confirmed that Commander Sloane is still alive--and as teaser art showed off, sporting a new Taken-infected arm--and has tasked us to investigate something beneath the waters of Titan.</p><div>          </div><p>Previous clues in Lightfall have suggested that an "enemy of the Witness" on Titan, but there's no word yet on if this kaiju-sized entity will be friendly to humanity.</p><p>Spelunking in the deep is going to require some new gear, and for Season 21, the theme is aquatic. Players will be able to get their hands on a set of armor ornaments that add an oceanic flair to your gear, ranging from flowing fin-like robes to hard choral armor, and what appears to be catfish whiskers on top of the Hunter hood.

## The Best Businesses In GTA Online

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984341-gtabusiness.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> Money is what makes the world go around in GTA Online. Whether players are earning their own cash in-game or using real-life money to then acquire in-game currency, money is the focal point for most of the gameplay elements in Los Santos. Players need it in order to purchase luxury vehicles, property, and most everything else they interact with in GTA Online. While players can always buy Shark Cards for extra cash, the more efficient way to bring in cash is to start a business.</p><p>Businesses have become a staple in GTA Online since they were introduced post-launch. Instead of players repeating missions and heists, businesses give players a chance to make money in diverse ways. Businesses allow players to make their own money far more efficiently than traditional methods used prior by players in Los Santos. Players can choose to invest in certain businesses and sometimes see that investment returned within a matter of days. However, players need to be smart with their money and choose the right businesses to run. There are some enterprises that are more likely to go under than others, which plays obviously want to stay away from. Alternatively, there are also businesses that can turn a profit extremely quickly. We've outlined some of those top-performing businesses in GTA Online below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bunker Running</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984342-br.png" /><br /><em>A Bunker in GTA Online</em><br /><h3><p> One of the most welcome additions to GTA Online has been the Bunker. This is a form of business that allows players to craft and sell weapons, as well as store vehicles, and serve as a hub of operations. There are several locations players can choose for their Bunker, which we've gone over in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-bunkers-to-buy-in-gta-online/2900-4057/">previous guide</a>. For players looking to get a jump start on earning extra cash, running a Bunker is one of the best ways to do so.</p><p>Players will mainly focus on delivery missions when running a Bunker, which can take players all over the map. Depending on the size of the order, players will need more vehicles than just they can handle, so it's wise to have a friend help out. If players manage to find a friend to help with the delivery, then a full slate of supplies can sell for up to $750,000. Of course, this also requires players to fully upgrade their Bunker so they can have access to additional supplies and features. This is simply investing further in the business, though. With enough effort, Bunker running can yield players millions of dollars in a short amount of time.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Special Cargo Warehouses</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984343-scw.png" /><br /><em>A warehouse in GTA Online</em><br /><h3><p> Purchasing a Special Cargo Warehouse is perhaps the best way to make money as a solo player in GTA Online. Not only can it be done with the push of a button from a CEO's office, but it can be managed extremely easily. The main goal for players is to secure shipments of cargo to store in a large warehouse. Players can either source one crate at a time or up the ante and source three crates per shipment. Then, once players have the maximum amount of nine crates, they can sell them for a total of $126,000. This is only the maximum for solo players, though. With a large crew, players can store over 100 crates of cargo and then sell all of them for over $2 million. Whether you're going at it solo or with a friend group, running a Special Cargo Warehouse can be extremely profitable right off of the bat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Vehicle Warehouse</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984344-vw.png" /><br /><em>Vehicle Warehouses can turn a nice profit.</em><br /><h3><p> The business of importing and exporting vehicles through a warehouse is one of the best business models in all of GTA Online. Not only does this give a chance for players to make solid money selling cars, but they get to source and keep luxury vehicles and supercars. Of course, this will diminish profit slightly, but players will be making so much extra cash it's doubtful many will notice. To start, players can stock up on as many low and mid-range vehicles as possible. Once they have enough in each of their warehouses, they won't be given any more missions for them. This means the only imports players will receive are vehicles of much higher quality. Speaking of the missions, players can go on a variety of them in order to source their vehicles. There are some annoying tasks, like escaping police, but most of them don't take much time. Once players have completed the mission, they can either choose to store or sell off the vehicle they just sourced.</p><p>All players need to begin this business is a Vehicle Warehouse. Once they have this piece of property, they can start completing missions right from their laptop. When players want to sell a vehicle, they can talk directly to the dealer and make around $75,000 per transaction, as long as they're only selling top-end vehicles.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Arcade</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984345-ta.png" /><br /><em>Arcades are both cool and profitable to own.</em><br /><h3><p> This is one of the most vital businesses that players need to own if they want to make stacks of cash every night. The Arcade was added with the Diamond Casino Heist DLC and essentially acts as a base of operations for players looking to rob the casino. With players owning the arcade, they're able to plan out their heist on the Diamond Casino &amp; Resort. The heist is an enjoyable one, offering different ways of dealing with security and robbing the vault inside of the resort. While that alone makes the Arcade worth it, players can also earn passive income from being the owner of a thriving business. Of course, this will be pennies compared to robbing the resort but earning more income is always a bonus. Finally, one of the more underrated aspects of owning the Arcade is access to the Master Control Terminal. This allows players to manage their other properties, such as the next entry on this list.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Own the Nightclub</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984346-otn.jpg" /><br /><em>Partying all night has its perks.</em><br /><h3><p> A staple of GTA Online businesses is the Nightclub. Like the Arcade, the Nightclub can act as a base of operations for other properties and businesses players have in Los Santos. While the Nightclub isn't the most profitable business in GTA Online, it does allow players to earn passive income. On top of that, players can hire workers to secure products that players can then sell for a huge payday. During the times players aren't looking to make large amounts of money, they can actually run the Nightclub. There's an opportunity to customize just about everything about the club, from the lights to the drinks to the DJ. The Nightclub is a terrific business to have some fun while also making money on the side.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cocaine Lockup</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3984347-cl.png" /><br /><em>Illegal money is still money.</em><br /><h3><p> Finally, we have one of the most tried and true businesses in GTA Online, Cocaine Lockup. This business takes very little effort to run and produces a solid amount of passive income. Players can start by purchasing a cheap Clubhouse and then buy a cocaine lockup to start inside. Then, players need to purchase staff to make the cocaine and equipment to produce it. From there, the player's job is essentially complete. Every now and then players will need to buy more supplies for the lockup but this is a relatively inexpensive cost. The Cocaine Lockup isn't a huge money-making business but it allows players to make some passive income on the side while running their more hands-on enterprises.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>Like my favorite metroidvania games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox/">The Last Case of Benedict Fox</a> is built around solving a mystery. It can go too far in its efforts to be deeply mysterious, especially in its first half, but engaging puzzles and unsettling art direction pull you along, even when mediocre combat and platforming mechanics get in the way of the fun. There's an interesting story in The Last Case of Benedict Fox, one wrapped up in an interesting world of supernatural intrigue that I want to know more about. It just takes a while to fully uncover its best parts.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Last Case of Benedict Fox, you play as the titular detective, who breaks into a strange manor in order to investigate a ritual he wants to perform. The answers he seeks, unfortunately, reside in the minds of a young couple who are now dead. Thankfully, Benedict is connected to an eldritch-like demon who grants him supernatural powers, including the ability to go into the minds of those freshly dead. Going into Limbo--as Benedict calls it--transports you into a space of sprawling mind palaces, each filled with the deceased's worst nightmares, insecurities, and traumas transformed into physical monsters. As you explore further and farther, you find the necessary memories to unlock new parts of the manor in the real world and piece together the steps to the ritual.</p><p dir="ltr">If all of that sounds a little convoluted and leaves you with many questions, that seems to be what The Last Case of Benedict Fox is going for, simply dropping you into a densely layered situation without the necessary build-up to fully grasp what's going on. The game holds its cards too close to the chest, unfortunately--going so far as to hide for the entire first half of the game what exactly the ritual that Benedict is researching even does and why he's looking for it. The plot swings way too far past intriguing and mysterious into confusing territory for the first half of its runtime. This makes for a deeply unwelcoming opening, which sets up a story and character motivations that are difficult to parse, with names, dates, lore, and jargon quickly thrown at you with little in the way of explanation. Once you manage to get a ways into the game, The Last Case of Benedict Fox graciously begins answering a few of the questions it poses, giving you more of a reason for wanting to explore its riveting Lovecraftian-inspired world, but it still just takes way too long to get there.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-case-of-benedict-fox-review-fair-deal/1900-6418064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Elden Ring Has Now Sold Enough To Give Everyone In New York A Copy

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring's</a> sales numbers continue to rise, with publisher Bandai Namco revealing as part of its most recent financial statements that the From Software-developed RPG has sold 20.5 million copies since its launch in February 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a pretty big number, and up around 500,000 units since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-breaks-20-million-sold-ahead-of-one-year-anniversary/1100-6511715/">Bandai Namco previously reported unit sales back in February</a>. In fact, it's enough so that every person in the state of New York could snag a copy. New York's population, as of the 2020 census, is estimated at around 20.2 million people.</p><p dir="ltr">The new sales figure is an impressive feat, especially when compared to other heavy-hitting titles that were released around the same time. For comparison, Kirby And the Forgotten Land, a first-party title from Nintendo that was released in March 2022 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-is-already-the-best-selling-kirby-game-ever/1100-6508998/">became the best-selling Kirby game of all time</a>, has sold around 5.27 million units. Earlier this month it was announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, the AAA sequel to Sony's Horizon Zero Dawn, has sold around <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/09/20-years-of-guerrilla-the-story-of-a-playstation-studio/">8.4 million since its release</a>. For even more context, From Software's entire trilogy of Dark Souls games (from which Elden Ring heavily draws upon) has sold around 33 million units combined.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-has-now-sold-enough-to-give-everyone-in-new-york-a-copy/1100-6514074/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Expect More Game Companies To Keep Buying One Another, EA Says--And For EA To Get More Involved

<p dir="ltr">When you consider EA's prestige, media properties, incomprehensibly large net worth, and past purchases (Codemasters, Glu, Respawn), it can seem a bit surprising that the company hasn't played an even more active role in the games industry's recent consolidation trend. However, EA CEO Andrew Wilson has now confirmed that it's not for a lack of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">During EA's Q4 and FY 2023 earnings call, Wilson stated that not only does he anticipate more acquisitions and mergers in the entertainment industry going forward, but he loves the idea of EA becoming a "meaningful consolidator" itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"Will there be industry consolidation? Will there be broader entertainment consolidation? If I was predicting the future over the long term, I would say that's an almost certainty at some level," Wilson said. "I would love for us to have the scale to be a meaningful consolidator in that space. I think that we have tremendous assets with respect to the future of entertainment."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expect-more-game-companies-to-keep-buying-one-another-ea-says-and-for-ea-to-get-more-involved/1100-6514072/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Long To Beat Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the long-awaited sequel to 2017's Zelda: Breath of the Wild, finally arrives this week. Breath of the Wild reinvented the Zelda formula to focus more on exploration and curiosity, which meant your adventure in Hyrule could last for as long as you wished to explore it. Tears of the Kingdom is similarly massive, with a sizable story and tons of side quests, adventures, and secrets to uncover. Here's what you need to know about how long it takes to beat The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><h2>How long is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom?</h2><p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom allows a massive amount of freedom in how you approach combat and exploration, which means that play times are bound to differ. Some players will want to explore every inch of a new region and conquer all the Shrines, while others will run straight towards their next story objective. Even for story-focused players, you'll probably need to farm for certain resources or equipment. It will take most players approximately <strong>50 hours to complete its story</strong>. Keep in mind, of course, that even that estimate can vary greatly.</p><p>If you spend more time exploring and completing a decent number of Shrines and side quests, you can expect that to add more time. For that reason, an <strong>average playthrough is probably closer to 65-75 hours</strong>. That includes the main story plus some of the optional content, but not nearly all of it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6514064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Based on the 1992 novel of the same name, director Yorgos Lanthimos is back with another dark sci-fi film featuring an all-star cast. Poor Things tells the story of Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) who is brought back to life by scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). In her journey of discovery of this new life, in an act of rebellion, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick but degenerate lawyer. </p><p>The first trailer dropped Thursday echoing a lot from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, mixed in with Bella's determination for liberation and finding her own self-identity and a lot of Victorian-style sci-fi imagery.</p><div>          </div><p>This is Stone and Lanthimos' second collaboration after 2018's Oscar-winner The Favourite, which was also written by Poor Things scribe Tony McNamara. Production began in 2021, with the cast taking shape later that year.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lobster-director-gives-us-an-even-wilder-sci-fi-follow-up-with-poor-things/1100-6514063/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Disney CEO Bob Iger has joined the chorus of media and technology executives to comment on the potential of artificial intelligence to disrupt the market. As part of <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/10/walt-disney-dis-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/">Disney's latest earnings briefing</a>, Iger said advances to AI represent "some pretty interesting opportunities" for the company that could yield "substantial benefits" down the road. But there are concerns, too.</p><p>Iger said Disney is already using AI systems to create "some efficiencies" to help serve customers better, though he did not get into specifics. "Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours, and we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that," he said.</p><p>At the same time, Iger admitted that AI will probably be a "highly disruptive" force, and one that could become "extremely difficult" to manage. Iger said there are real concerns about AI and its impact on "IP management."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-ceo-says-ai-has-major-potential-and-could-be-highly-disruptive/1100-6514057/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In the five years since Ghost Recon: Breakpoint first released, the game has largely been forgotten about. When it does enter the conversation, it's usually as an example of how chasing trends and diluting the core experience to appeal to the widest market possible probably isn't a good idea. But for those fans who have stuck with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-breakpoint-support-has-ended/1100-6502187/">Breakpoint over the years</a>, there's a surprisingly great game buried underneath its live-service design.</p><p>In a new episode of GameSpot's No HUD, Jake Dekker examines how stripping Breakpoint of its live-service elements and focusing on a more realistic and unforgiving experience transforms it into an edge-of-your-seat tactical-action game.</p><p>With some help from Ghost Recon expert Deef, changing the game into a more strategic and slow-paced experience is surprisingly easy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-breakpoint-gets-immersive-mode-this-mo/1100-6474457/">as thanks to an update that Ubisoft made</a> several years ago, Breakpoint's overall challenge can be fine-tuned in Immersive Mode.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-breakpoint-can-actually-be-very-immersive-if-you-know-what-to-do/1100-6514058/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Not every game can be The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, receiving nigh-perfect scores from dozens of outlets. In the latest episode of The Kurt Locker, Kurt Indovina puts the spotlight on some of his favorite 6/10 titles, like Wanted: Dead.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, Kurt says Wanted: Dead is his favorite 6/10 game this year. Sure, it's a bit of a mess and only features one karaoke song: 99 Luftballons. But Kurt loves it for its wackiness, especially the ramen knowledge.</p><p dir="ltr">Kurt argues that review scores mean different things to different people. "For a lot of people, a 6 can be an immediate 'no, thank you.' But the thing is bad games, even the most aggressively mediocre ones, can be loved and great games in their own right," he says.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/learn-to-love-the-6-10-games/1100-6514059/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After a long road of game-fixing patches, massive updates, and a hit anime tie-in series, Cyberpunk 2077 is in a much healthier state now when compared to its original December 2020 launch. While work on a sequel has commenced, there's still a very good reason to visit Night City in the near-future as an expansion is on the way.</p><p>Details on the Phantom Liberty expansion has been kept under tight wraps since it was first announced, but developer CD Projekt Red has revealed a few fascinating tidbits of information ahead of its eventual release. Here's everything that we know about it so far.</p><h2>Release date</h2><p>Phantom Liberty is aiming for a 2023 release date, but anything specific beyond that is unknown. There's a good chance that the reveal date will be confirmed soon, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-news-coming-in-june/1100-6512848/">CDPR says that its marketing campaign will kick off in June</a>. That puts the announcement squarely in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-summer-game-fest-2023-press-conferences-schedule/1100-6513776/">Not-E3</a> season territory, with Summer Games Fest being one possible venue for a release date announcement. Alternatively, CDPR could release a new episode of its Night City livestream, which is where the company has made big Cyberpunk 2077 announcements in the past.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-gameplay-changes-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514048/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney CEO Comments On Fight With Florida Governor Ron DeSantis

<p>The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger has commented on the ongoing legal battle it is waging against Florida governor Ron DeSantis. As part of <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/10/walt-disney-dis-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/">the company's latest earnings briefing</a>, Iger said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-escalates-battle-with-gov-desantis-files-lawsuit-alleging-first-amendment-violation/1100-6513602/">Disney's recently filed lawsuit speaks for itself</a>. That said, he reiterated that it is Disney's belief that DeSantis is trying to strip away Disney's special Reedy Creek district as a means of retaliation for Disney's opposition to the "Don't Say Gay" legislation in Florida.</p><p>"This is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida," Iger said.</p><p>DeSantis is seeking to remove Disney's "special district" status in Orlando. Walt Disney himself convinced Florida legislators back in the '60s to give him a special district allowing the company to act semi-autonomously on its grounds when the entertainment legend was establishing EPCOT as a real city of the future. The city never panned out. But the Reedy Creek district and special status remained, and Disney has benefitted in a business sense for decades.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-ceo-comments-on-fight-with-florida-governor-ron-desantis/1100-6514055/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Reviews have officially gone live for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and just like its predecessor Breath of the Wild, this sequel is earning critical acclaim from most outlets.

<p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is so much more than a sequel to Breath of the Wild. While this newest entry in the Zelda franchise is most recognizably similar to that 2017 game, it builds upon the foundation so thoroughly and transformationally that it feels like a revelation. This is The Legend of Zelda at its finest, borrowing the best pieces and qualities from across the franchise's history and creating something new that is emotionally resonant, captivating, and endlessly rewarding.</p><p dir="ltr">Breath of the Wild upended the Zelda formula by presenting a vast and lush open world to explore--a reenvisioning of the unguided experience of the original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Tears of the Kingdom follows in its predecessor's footsteps with a similarly naturalistic setting, but the world has changed in subtle ways. Not everything is exactly the same or where you'd expect it to be, and the map is marked with myriad opportunities for exploration and curiosity. Once again, you'll hardly ever round a corner or crest a hill without finding something else to do or engage with. Hyrule feels serene even as it bustles with life and activity. The score is as majestic as it is unintrusive, accentuating a dire battle or narrow escape with an exciting up-tempo rendition of the theme and then easing off with softer tones to let you breathe in the atmosphere.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of the reason that the world feels so different this time is that your tools for engaging with it are so much more flexible. Like the Great Plateau in Breath of the Wild, you don't even enter the open world until you've found four key abilities in a tutorial area. Together, these abilities are the engine that drives Tears of the Kingdom--in the same way Breath of the Wild was centered on exploring wilderness using your slate of abilities, these new tools center Tears of the Kingdom around building and experimenting to overcome obstacles in inventive ways. It's a beautifully implemented evolution of what made Breath of the Wild so special. While it's more ambitious than Breath of the Wild in how much you can express your own creativity, it also manages to do this without buckling under its own weight.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
