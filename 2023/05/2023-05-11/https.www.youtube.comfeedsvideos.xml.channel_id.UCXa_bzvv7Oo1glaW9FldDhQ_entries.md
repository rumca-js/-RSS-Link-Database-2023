We'll have a much greater sense of how hard the sci-fi RPG is likely to hit when Microsoft and Bethesda show it off next month at the Starfield Direct. It'll be the first time that we'll be seeing it since its gameplay debut last year, and hopefully, it'll make a much stronger impression. 

Hopefully, it'll also be a significant improvement over BGS' previous games where its technical and visual aspects are concerned. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said that Microsoft has done a much better job with assisting Starfield's development than it did with Redfall, and though many will obviously find it hard to take his words at face value after how Arkane's shooter turned out, our hope is that he'll be proven right when the game releases this September.
