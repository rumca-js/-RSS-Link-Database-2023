In today's Daily Fix:
The International Olympic Committee has announced a new addition to their eSports lineup: Fortnite. No, it's not quite what you think. In a recent earnings call, WB Discovery revealed that Hogwarts Legacy hit a major milestone: $1 billion in sales. In other Hogwarts Legacy news, a new patch is live that lets you do to the in-game spiders what Potter and Friends did to those boggarts in Prof. Lupin's closet (basically turn them into something really silly). And Riot Games has reached a settlement in a discrimination lawsuit, and it's going to cost them a decent chunk of change.
