On the surface it\u2019s just Daisy Jones &amp; the Six but the band are all Muppets and there\u2019s a lot less sexual tension, but there\u2019s actually more to it than that. Mayhem stars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/lilly-singh-a-little-late-youtube-nbc\">Lilly Singh</a> (one of those YouTube-famous curios you have never heard of, but it turns out she\u2019s actually more renowned than most people alive and has 13.4 million followers on Instagram) as Nora, a messily aspirational girlboss whose life is in cheerful disarray and she needs a big win at work and maybe a love triangle subplot to achieve her destiny. Have you seen that story before? Of course you have, but you have not seen it with a band of Muppets, and that is the point: every time a chair turns around and the character is a puppet, I laugh. Every time Animal says anything, I laugh. Though the story throughline is fairly cornily safe \u2013 an ancient touring band need to record their first ever album, but keep getting distracted because they are all jolly little puppets, and I haven\u2019t seen to the end but I assume they do record the album then play a sold-out show \u2013 the levity of the puppets cranks everything up to a higher level.
