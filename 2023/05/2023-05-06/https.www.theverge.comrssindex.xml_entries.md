  <p id="S5fXjj">A race to reserve usernames is kicking off on Discord.</p>
<p id="gNfZye">Starting in the next couple of weeks, millions of Discord users will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23710259/discord-new-username-discriminators-number-tag">forced to say goodbye</a> to their old four-digit-appended names. Discord is requiring everyone to take up a new common platform-wide handle. For Discord, it’s a move toward mainstream social network conventions. For some users, though, it’s a change to the basics of what Discord <em>is </em>— a shift that’s as much about culture as technology.</p>
<p id="cMktiG">Discord has historically handled usernames with a numeric suffix system. Instead of requiring a completely unique handle, it allowed duplicate names by adding a four-digit code known as a “discriminator” — think TheVerge#1234. But earlier this week, it announced it was changing course...</p>

  <p id="OBLRF6">Bluesky, the chaotic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23708385/bluesky-weather-report-moderation-app-store">invite-only “errors and asses” platform</a>, told its users today there’s a new rule: no heads of state. I’m guessing the posters are too feral to be trusted.</p>
<p id="mmKX8l">In some sense, this is understandable. The thing is still in beta. The team is tiny, and actively juggling moderation while trying to ship features. I’m not sure who got invited, but <em>something</em> prompted today’s announcement.</p>
