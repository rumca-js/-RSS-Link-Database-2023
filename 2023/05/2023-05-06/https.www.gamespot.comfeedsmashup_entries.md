<p>I first heard of Exp Share--a mechanic where all party members gain experience points regardless of if they're in battle--in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-pokemon-games-ranked/2900-3915/">Pokemon</a>. Many RPGs have some level of it. Sometimes, it's just for members of your current party. Sometimes, it's for the entire roster. Its absence or limited implementation especially stands out when revisiting older games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-4-golden-review-stay-golden/1900-6400482/">Persona 4</a> and comparing them to newer ones like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-scarlet-violet-review-a-braviary-new-world/1900-6417994/">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>. Despite what might seem like a minor quality-of-life feature at first, its presence--or lack thereof--can have a big impact on a game, causing you to play much differently than you otherwise would.</p><p>I'm calling it Exp Share because that's what it's called in Pokemon, and it doesn't seem to have another widely recognized name. In Pokemon's case, Exp Share started as an actual item that you could give to an individual Pokemon so that it would gain experience even without being involved in a battle. It was especially convenient for raising low-level monsters into regular party members. Exp Share eventually turned into an item that distributed experience points to your entire team. Starting from Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee, it was built into the game as a default mechanic rather than an item that you needed to obtain.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4134438-exp-share-pkmn.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4134438-exp-share-pkmn.jpg" /></a></figure><p>It wasn't an addition that stayed unique to Pokemon, though. Just in the past year, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and One Piece Odyssey both offered their own version of Exp Share. These games have multiple characters with distinct abilities, enough to encourage players to experiment with them. In Xenoblade 3 especially, it felt almost criminal to ignore your Heroes (seventh party member) when there were so many character classes to try. All members of your main party are there to stay, but it would've been a daunting task for even the most diligent player to level up each of the Heroes separately. By allowing Heroes to accumulate experience points even when they're not in battle, it opens up opportunities for experimentation and variety that would otherwise be untenable.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-exp-share-has-evolved-in-modern-rpgs/1100-6513761/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Best Cheap Mini Arcades

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134468-mini_arcades__1_.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">So, you want to have your very own home arcade, but you don't have anywhere to put it. Just a few short years ago, that would have meantâ€¦ not having a home arcade. But the future is now, and there are a ton of home arcade systems that can fit on a counter, wall, or even in the palm of your hand. They range from 1:1 replicas of original cabinets--simply scaled down--to new form factors that allow for comfortable play despite a much smaller size.</p><p dir="ltr">The best budget-friendly mini arcades are well-constructed, include classic games, and serve as great home decor when you're not actively playing them. We've also included a couple cabinets that, while not functional as games themselves, are the perfect complement to your other systems and will add that extra level of flair. They're not completely non-functional, either, as you'll find out they have a nice hidden feature that will actually give you more options for displaying your entire mini arcade collection.</p><p dir="ltr">Not all of these systems are just "mini." A few are truly micro, capable of easily sitting on your work desk so you can get in a few minutes of playtime during your lunch break, and there's nothing quite like putting several of them side by side to make your own diorama-style arcade. If you want to make your own tiny snack bar or tiny bathroom with marker-writing all over the walls, that is up to you. Of course, that'll eat into your budget, which you were trying to avoid increasing by buying cheap mini arcade cabinets, but you live your own life.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Numskull Polybius</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134469-numskullpolybius.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $140</strong></p><p>If we want to get really pedantic, the Numskull Polybius cabinet isn't actually an arcade cabinet, because Polybius isn't a real arcade game. Based on an urban legend that first popped up in the early 2000s, the Polybius cabinet includes features often mentioned in the stories, including a hypnotic video effect, a very simple control scheme, and even fake licensing stickers from the State of Oregon. Because it doesn't actually play games--only a video--the Polybius cabinet actually serves a different purpose: a USB hub. With 10 USB ports in the back, you can use it to plug in your other mini cabinets and save wall outlet space.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/quarter-arcades-Official-Polybius-Numskull/dp/B09NC1PHW3?th=1&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>New Wave Toys 1942</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134471-newwave1942.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p><strong>$90</strong></p><p>Alongside Numskull, New Wave Toys is one of the absolute best brands for mini arcade units, and its 1942 cabinet is an excellent choice. Coming with both Capcom's 1942 as well as 1943: The Battle of Midway, the system features real wood, a lit marquee, a diecast coin slot, and a menu to access the dip-switch settings that were included on the original version. It absolutely looks the part, like it was pulled directly from the '80s and shrunk down, right down to the wood grain running vertically down each side. You can even connect it to a TV if you want a bigger display, but the built-in screen is no slouch.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Wave-Toys-RepliCade-Playable/dp/B09H3PCRBL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=E1CGD1TTZ1SB&amp;keywords=new wave toys 1942&amp;qid=1683309028&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;sprefix=new wave toys 194,toys-and-games,76&amp;sr=1-1">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>New Wave Toys Missile Command</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134474-newwavemissilecommand.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $180</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Missile Command was one of the best arcade games from Atari's '80s heyday, and it's one that has, oddly, not been copied too much in the years that followed. New Wave Toys' version shrinks the game down to a fraction of its original size, complete with functional buttons and even a trackball. There's also a lens included to mimic the shape of an old CRT screen without having to worry about the tubes and other delicate components, and you get a tiny user manual and shipping box to give you the full arcade cabinet experience.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Wave-Toys-Missile-RepliCade/dp/B0BQNX2S6J/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1WTCWW9LNSYNK&amp;keywords=new wave missile&amp;qid=1683309332&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;sprefix=new wave missi,toys-and-games,181&amp;sr=1-1">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Numskull Ms. Pac-Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134475-numskullmspacman.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p><strong>$150</strong></p><p>Like all of Numskull's Quarter Arcade cabinets, the Ms. Pac-Man design puts heavy emphasis on authenticity. The system includes a screen at the correct angle--far more horizontal than most modern systems--as well as a beautiful lit marquee. It's the real arcade ROM rather than a MAME version, giving you the closest possible gameplay experience to the arcade original. It also includes an attract mode, playing a clip of the game to entice anyone over at your home to give it a try, and with real wood and gorgeous artwork, it truly looks like the original cabinet was hit by a shrink ray.</p><div><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Official-Ms-Pac-Man-Scale-Replica-Arcade-Cabinet-17-inches-tall/814460700">See at Walmart</a> </div></div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Numskull Dig Dug</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134478-numskulldigdug.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p> <strong>$170</strong></p><p>Dig Dug remains a unique and fantastically engaging arcade game more than 40 years after its release--and yes, it's even unique when compared to its inferior sequel. The Numskull version shrinks the original system down to a 1/4 scale but doesn't sacrifice detail. The artwork and shape of the cabinet are exactly as they were on the genuine arcade cabinet, just much smaller, and the dip-switch settings can be adjusted via the software for a customized game experience. As with the other Numskull cabinets, it has a gorgeous light-up marquee and replica coin door, as well, making it look great on a shelf.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/quarter-arcades-Official-Cabinet-Numskull/dp/B08KHK8JY7?th=1&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Numskull Galaga</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134479-numskullgalaga.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $150</strong></p><p>One of the greatest arcade shooting games of all time--and superior to its most-famous rival, Space Invaders--Galaga remains a classic because its gameplay is so simple and timeless. Defending against waves of invaders is a ton of fun, and its very simple control scheme makes it the perfect choice for a 1/4-scale arcade cabinet. The Numskull Galaga cabinet is an authentic tribute to the real cabinet, complete with access to the dip-switch settings and the classic artwork. It's also a game nearly everyone knows, so it's sure to get some attention if you leave it out when guests come over.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Official-Galaga-Scale-Replica-Arcade-Cabinet-17-inches-tall/979652251">See at Walmart</a> </div></div><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>New Wave Toys Change Machine</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134482-newwavechangemachine.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $70</strong></p><p>Like the Polybius cabinet, the New Wave Toys Change Machine doesn't play a game, nor does it actually give you change--instead, it functions as a USB hub. Sporting five USB 2.0 ports and one USB 3.0 port, it also comes with charging and surge protection so your devices will stay in top shape. The machine itself is made of wood, plastic, rubber, and metal, and it even comes with some tiny gold coins and a "temporarily out of service" light that you can turn on and off. Having the arcade games is great, but if you don't give people a place to get their tokens or quarters, how are they supposed to play them?</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Replitronics-USB-Charge-Machine-not-specific/dp/B085FXGH38?th=1&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>My Arcade Contra</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134484-myarcadecontra.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $60</strong></p><p>The Contra series is probably best-known for its console games, particularly the original on NES and the entries across SNES and Genesis, but it actually began its life as an arcade title in Japan. With the My Arcade Contra Micro Player, you can experience the game's 10 stages at home or on the go, complete with co-op functionality via a linking cable and another cabinet. The game uses a vertical screen, making it quite a bit more anxiety-inducing than the console versions, but it sure does look good.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Arcade-Playable-Collectible-DGUNL-3280/dp/B0845TDGL6?th=1&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Neo Geo Mini</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134485-neogeomini.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $60</strong></p><p>Released shortly before the huge storm of home arcade cabinets first arrived, the Neo Geo Mini is a remarkably versatile little device that is perfect for SNK or fighting game enthusiasts. Containing a huge number of games--40, to be exact--the King of Fighters and Metal Slug series are both well-represented, and there are also a number of sports games and action games to choose from. Along with its built-in screen, it supports TV play via mini-HDMI, and save states let you pick up where you left off without losing any progress. You can even choose from a few different marquee stickers to best fit your own game preferences.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEOGEO-International-Version-Pre-Loaded-Classic-pocket/dp/B098LC7BJM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Shodown-Limited-not-machine-specific/dp/B07T3J5Z3F?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Neo Geo Mini Bundle</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arcade1Up NBA Jam Countercade</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134487-arcade1upnbajamcounter.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $230</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Arcade1Up has made home versions of some of the best arcade games of all time, and while not all of them have gotten the mini cabinet treatment, we're happy that NBA Jam did. This classic Midway basketball game has been made into a two-player countercade version. There is plenty of room on the control deck for both players to access the sticks and buttons, and it also includes a lit marquee and even a headphone jack so you can play at night without bothering your family or neighbors. It's the perfect size to keep on a table for quick access or easily stored for when friends come over and want to shoot one from downtown.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1807441046781212916?u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arcade1Up Pong Countercade</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4134490-arcade1upcountercadepong.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong> $230</strong></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the other games on this list, the Arcade1Up Pong 2 Player Countercade doesn't feature a screen perpendicular to the controls--instead, it's a head-to-head system that lets you play intense Pong matches against another player. Small enough to not take up too much space, it features dials for precise movements of the paddles, and the aesthetics just screams late '70s with its ugly-beautiful browns, yellows, and oranges. Is it the most advanced system you can buy? No, but Pong remains an all-time classic.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-1Up-Arcade1Up-Pong-Player-Countercade/dp/B09B1F8MGB?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />

## How Castlevania: Aria Of Sorrow's Tactical Soul System Inspired A New Generation Of Metroidvanias

<p dir="ltr"><em>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, May 6, 2023. Below, we look back at how the successor to Symphony of the Night is still influencing the genre.</em></p><p dir="ltr">From the Souls-ian hack-and-slash of Blasphemous to the pastel beauty of the Ori series, the sheer volume of metroidvanias in today's gaming market can overwhelm even the most die-hard enthusiast. But while most fans will always correctly consider Castlevania: Symphony of the Night as the most influential entry in Konami's lauded series, there were other games that had a big effect on today's metroidvanias--and I would argue 2003's Aria of Sorrow is the best of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Aria of Sorrow is the third Castlevania game for Game Boy Advance, though it's much more memorable than its two predecessors. It's the fourth "Igavania"-style entry in the series, meaning that it has the same exploration and RPG mechanics first inaugurated by Symphony of the Night and designer Koji Igarashi. Its grand new innovation, the Tactical Soul system, would be the next step forward for the franchise, and it's a mechanic that's inspired many of the metroidvanias that have emerged over the years.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-castlevania-aria-of-sorrows-tactical-soul-system-inspired-a-new-generation-of-metroidvanias/1100-6513882/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
