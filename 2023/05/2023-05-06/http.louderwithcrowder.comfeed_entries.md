	The word out on these streets was that after the Florida legislative session, Ron DeSantis was going to announce his run for president. Well, the Florida legislative session is over. DeSantis <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-law-order" target="_blank">has a new list of conservative reform wins</a> that should appeal to GOP primary voters if they care about those things (the jury is still out). And while he had no future plans to announce, DeSantis did take the time to slap around a reporter.</p><p>The reporter was unintelligible. Boring boring boring, "protesters." Blah blah blah "cultures wars." Yackity schmackity "appeal to the American voters."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

I know like people in your industry will dress it up with a euphemism and they’ll say it’s "health care" to cut off the private parts of a 14 or 15-year-old – that is not health care. That is mutilation. And so when we’re standing up against that, we’re protecting these kids.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>As far as the number of protesters who showed up to act what critics say was "insurrection'y?" Let's say it was a thousand of them. Over 4.6 million people vote for DeSantis to do what he said he was going to do and did. So suck it.</p><p>The streets are talking today that DeSantis is going to announce a presidential run next month and bypass the "exploratory committee" deal that politicians usually do. Look, I'm a clear DeSantis guy. I've made that clear. I'll vote for whoever is wearing the red jersey in November 2024. Until he gives me a reason to feel otherwise, DeSantis is my dude. Being said, it's shit or gets off the pot time.</p><p>Waiting until the end of the legislative session made all the sense in the world. Especially after a session that added to the wins column. DeSantis has to realize that now is his only opportunity. There is no 2028. Primary voters will have moved on to someone else.</p><p>He needs to make his intentions clear by June. Everything he has done for the past year has said that he's in. Now he needs to say the words himself.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Megyn Kelly shares stunning facts on Fox News's collapse post-Tucker Carlson: "Down 59 Percent"

Tucker talked about how much he loved God. Rupert's fiance agreed that she loved both God AND Tucker. Atheist Rupert Murdoch who is freaked out by religious talk... freaked out. He dumped his fiance, and Carlson suddenly no longer has a home at Fox News.</p><p>For the sake of argument, let's accept that as 100% true. And it was Murdoch being petty that caused him to fire his #1 star. Keep that in mind as Megyn Kelly lays out the STUNNING collapse of Fox News since that day. It starts with the network being down in the 8:00 PM time slot 47% overall and FIFTY-NINE PERCENT in the 25-54 demo.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/megynkelly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@megynkelly</a> on the genuinely remarkable, instant collapse of Fox's ratings in the wake of its decision to fire the most popular host in the history of the medium:<a href="https://t.co/pJgewdxmlG">pic.twitter.com/pJgewdxmlG</a><br />— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1654467957806751744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>They’re left with about a third of their audience. I mean that’s stunning and I looked up and down the board at the rest of the prime time which, with all due respect to the daytime, is all anyone gives a sh*t about over there at Fox News. The prime time pays the bills. Period.</blockquote><p>All of the Fox News prime-time hosts are down big too. Even more embarrassing? They have lost REPEATEDLY to MSNBC. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>It lends credence to the popular internet theory that Fox News is the one leaking "embarrassing" Tucker Carlson videos to Media Matters in order to save face and justify his firing. And then sent a "cease and desist" letter to Media Matters to stop when they realized the videos were only making Tucker more popular.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Heavy metal icon, shocked to find trans activists demand total fealty, doubles down on "transphobic" comments

There is no common ground with radical, progressive activists. Snider agreeing with the left on everything EXCEPT genital mutilation surgery on minors has gotten him kicked out of an LGBTQ+AIIP parade in San Francisco.</p><p>The lack of common ground is what's key here. Because Snider agrees with the right on almost NOTHING. He's anti-MAGA using his hit "We're Not Gonna Take It" and pro-gun-control zealots using it. Not only that, but on the same day he retweeted <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/paul-stanley-kiss-twitter-statement" target="_blank">the infamous Paul Stanley tweet</a>, he also tweeted his dislike of Ron DeSantis and the "Parental Rights in Education" bill. </p><p>That's okay. Unlike the left, I DON"T demand total fealty. "The Price" is the mad notes. Snider's mantra of "if it's not metal, it's crap" got me through '85 - '93. And if I had a textbook covered in a brown paper bag, I would still be able to doodle the Twisted Sister logo.</p><p>It's possible the only issue Dee agrees with the right on is that maaaaaaaaybe trans activism has been allowed to go too far.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You know what? There was a time where I "felt pretty" too. Glad my parents didn't jump to any rash conclusions!

Why not?</blockquote><p>That is an excellent question and you should have tea with JK Rowling over it sometime.</p><blockquote>I've recently stated I do not believe young children are ready to decide their gender allocation. I believe their choices should be supported and accepted by their parents, but I do not think kids have the mental capabilities to make rational, logical decisions on things of a magnitude that will affect them for the rest of their lives. I do not believe they are mentally developed enough.</blockquote><p>I know that. Dee knows that. Paul Stanley knows that even if a PR rep made him apologize. Yet, for whatever reason, activists seem determined to target children.</p><blockquote>The Transgender community needs moderates who support their choices, even if we don't agree with every one of their edicts. For some Transgender people (not all) to accuse supporters, like me, of transphobia is not a good look for their cause.</blockquote><p>Again, I know that. Dee knows that. Paul Stanley knows that even if a PR rep made him apologize. The community would counter with "f*ck you transphobe" and see if you have any sponsors they could target if <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-assaulted-speech" target="_blank">they don't attack you outright (with the full support of media and the White House).</a></p><p>Welcome to 2023. Where it is no longer common ground to say let adults do what's right for adults, leave kids alone, and cutting off your genitals should be treated at least on the same level as getting your driver's license or buying a pack of cigarettes. Methinks Dee Snider is about to find out how little his "allies" care about his lifetime of support.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
