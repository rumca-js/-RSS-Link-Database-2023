<p>Resilient UK growth may well prevent the Bank of England from ending its run of increases</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor" title="">Bank of England</a> is confronting some stark and uncomfortable facts. Not since 1977 have British households faced food prices rising at a faster pace, while the headline rate of inflation is stuck above 10% – higher than in any other G7 nation.</p><p>It is against this backdrop that City economists reckon the central bank will raise interest rates for a 12th consecutive time on Thursday, with predictions for a quarter-point rise from the current level of 4.25%.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/07/inflation-may-be-about-to-fall-but-the-interest-rate-pain-is-not-over-yet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Haaland’s direct play has edged the City manager away from pitfalls of purism – but will it be enough against Real Madrid? </p><p>It is a little over nine years since Pep Guardiola first took on Carlo Ancelotti as a manager. Guardiola’s Bayern Munich had sealed the Bundesliga title almost a month earlier, often registering 1,000 passes in a game, and his football seemed unstoppable. For 18 minutes in the first leg at the Bernabéu, Bayern continued to seem imperious. Then Ancelotti’s Real Madrid countered and Fábio Coentrão squared for Karim Benzema to score. Bayern continued to dominate the ball; Madrid continued to look dangerous. It finished 1-0.</p><p>In retrospect, before Guardiola and Ancelotti meet in another semi‑final at the Bernabéu on Tuesday, that game seems a defining moment. What had happened in the semi-finals against Internazionale in 2010 and Chelsea in 2012, a Guardiola team bossing possession and being caught on the counter, had happened again – and this time without the same sense of outrageous bad luck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/06/carlo-ancelotti-is-the-great-pragmatist-standing-in-pep-guardiolas-path-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This extraordinary show of ‘precision in a country where nothing works’ made a powerful impression</p><p>As the soft drizzle in London gave way to a downpour, Charles was crowned king in Westminster Abbey, and the feeling came over many of us, if not all, that some things are the more marvellous for being a bit silly and unfathomable. No, republicans did not celebrate; they took their placards and their yellow T-shirts to Trafalgar Square, where their voices could (almost) be heard against a backdrop of marching bands and pealing bells.</p><p>But the choral singers of Britain celebrated, and the trumpet players and the embroiderers, the gilders and the girdlers, the umbrella-makers and the manufacturer of Goddard’s silver polish. Which sorcerer conjured this preposterous vision for the nation? This almost-fairytale? Practically speaking, we know his name: he is the Duke of Norfolk, a bespectacled aristocrat who looks, in mufti, like he might run an upmarket car showroom in Sheringham. But facts take you only so far. The true necromancy seemed, somehow, to come from elsewhere; a place both unknown and utterly indescribable, though I will try my best.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/it-was-ludicrous-but-also-magnificent-the-coronation-stirred-every-emotion">Continue reading...</a>

Bruno Le Maire isn’t the only politician to try his hand at an erotic novel, but one passage has been singled out for attention<p>Sex in novels is frequently terrible and occasionally so excruciating as to verge on the actionable; indeed, a legal precedent that would penalise writers for scorching their readers’ retinas with the sheer heat of embarrassment might function as a useful deterrent. Literature needs all the fans it can get; protect us from the throbbing gristle and heaving mammaries of a thousand overheated imaginations. Institute a particular ban on the word moist, and freedom of speech be damned. Alas, it would be too late to curb the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/02/french-minister-bruno-le-maire-steamy-novel-turns-up-heat-on-macron" title="">creative enthusiasms of Bruno Le Maire</a>, the French economy minister whose most recent novel, <em>Fugue Américaine</em>, has erm, risen to prominence courtesy of a dilated anus. Protect your eyes and do not enquire further.</p><p>Naturally, much of the truly gripping stuff is going on beyond the page. Le Maire stands accused of fiddling while Paris burns, amusing himself on his typewriter as France’s citizens stand on the barricades protecting their pension rights and railing against the callousness of the Macron administration. This feels harsh: everyone has a right to a life outside work and writing about an anus seems small beer compared with eating one on national television in a celebrity game show, or hosting frothing rightwing debates, were one, say, to be a sitting member of parliament.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/06/non-minister-bruno-le-maire-spare-us-the-derriere-sex-scenes-and-stick-to-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Met hobbled Republic’s plans with early arrests but the protest group  insist their support is growing</p><p>The bronze statue of Charles I on horseback on the corner of Trafalgar Square had been boxed off for the day, with armed police stationed above it. The symbolism was not lost on the protesters from the Republic organisation, those latter-day parliamentarians, who had chosen that spot on the coronation procession route to voice their opposition to the monarchy.</p><p>They had come for the day dressed in spring yellow, in contrast to the uniform red, white and blue of the hats and waistcoats and umbrellas of the crowds around them. As the royal procession passed on its way to Westminster Abbey they made sure that the three-word opinion of perhaps a quarter of the British public was heard above the clatter of the Household Cavalry, at a volume unfamiliar from previous state occasions: “Not my king!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/not-my-king-they-chanted-then-the-police-took-their-megaphones">Continue reading...</a>

## Guy Gunaratne: ‘Writing the Abu Ghraib bit of the book took its toll’

<p>Booker-longlisted in 2018 for their debut novel, In Our Mad and Furious City, the Londoner talks about the follow-up, the slippery life story of a terror suspect, and<em> </em>the fellowship of Ali Smith during a time of stress</p><p>Guy Gunaratne is sipping lemon and ginger tea at the end of a larynx-taxing week recording the audiobook of their latest novel, <em>Mister, Mister</em>. The book is set partly in east London, where we’re meeting before they catch an evening flight home to their wife and two young children in Malmö, Sweden. For the author of 2018’s Booker-longlisted <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/06/in-our-mad-furious-city-guy-gunaratne-review">In Our Mad and Furious City</a></em> (or <em>Mad</em>, as they handily call it), the zigzag itinerary has become a routine: the new book, initally sparked by the controversy surrounding Shamima Begum, was completed during a three-year fellowship at Cambridge, which they took up in 2019 shortly after becoming a father. “The university gave me a room and a desk; no lecturing, just writing.” Then the pandemic hit. “It was tough. When I was younger I dreamed of a project that would transform you – where you’d be a different person at the end of it – and that’s certainly been true of this, but I wouldn’t want to do it again.”</p><p>A difficult second novel, at least for the author, <em>Mister, Mister</em> is a rollercoaster coming-of-age picaresque, set against 40 years of bloodshed in the Middle East, from Desert Storm to Islamic State, and narrated by a fatherless young Londoner, Yahya, half-English, half-Iraqi, raised in a refuge by Muslim women before becoming a poet-preacher whose tub-thumping lyrics echo dangerously around the world in an age of keyboard warriors only too ready to step out from behind the screen. The book starts with Yahya held as a terror suspect, having recently returned from Syria – and he’s just sliced off his own tongue, spilling his life’s twists and turns solely in writing for the eponymous Mister, the shadowy British official quizzing him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/06/guy-gunaratne-writing-the-abu-ghraib-bit-of-the-book-took-its-toll-mister-mister">Continue reading...</a>

On the morning of the coronation of Charles III, British television is showing what appears to be the buildup to the buildup.

Lagerfeld’s designs were peppy and sellable. But the monochrome palette, the bouclé wool, the pearls, the silk jersey, the uncorseted black dress, the neat little shoulders and narrow silhouette, the androgyny and uniform aesthetics, the quilting and tweed, the chains and braids, the camellias, the handbag, the logo and – above all – Chanel No 5 perfume, whose sales keep the business running? Those were invented by one woman, the genius Coco Chanel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/06/men-put-on-the-style-at-the-met-gala-but-the-karl-lagerfield-theme-was-a-fashion-faux-pas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If Harry Kane does finally leave Tottenham in the summer then it’s in this type of match they will miss him most of all. The England captain’s 28th goal of the season took him ahead of Wayne Rooney into second place in the Premier League’s all-time list of top scorers and delivered a first victory as interim head coach for Ryan Mason to revive their hopes of qualifying for European competition.</p><p>While this was far from a vintage performance against Roy Hodgson’s in-form Crystal Palace side who could feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point, none of that really matters when you have Kane in this kind of form. Created and scored by the striker who turns 30 in July, his winning goal on the stroke of half-time could be the encouragement Spurs need to nail down a place in Europe next season and perhaps even convince Kane that the grass is not always greener on the other side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/tottenham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## I’m glad you’ve bought an electric vehicle. But your conscience isn’t clean | John Naughton

<p>First, you’ve got to drive a long way before you overcome your EV’s embedded carbon debt. And then there’s the trouble with the minerals in its battery…</p><p>So you’ve finally taken the plunge and bought an electric vehicle (EV)? Me too. You’re basking in the warm glow that comes from doing one’s bit to save the planet, right? And now you know that smug feeling when you are stuck in a motorway tailback behind a hideous diesel SUV that’s pumping out particulates and noxious gases, but you’re sitting there in peace and quiet and emitting none of the above. And when the traffic finally starts to move again you notice that the fast lane is clear and you want to get ahead of that dratted SUV. So you put your foot down and – whoosh! – you get that pressure in the small of your back that only owners of Porsche 911s used to get. Life’s good, <em>n’est-ce pas</em>?</p><p>Er, up to a point. True, there’s nothing noxious coming out of your exhaust pipe, because you don’t have one; and the electric motors that power your wheels certainly don’t burn any fossil fuel. But that doesn’t mean that your carbon footprint is zero. First of all, where did the electricity that charged that big battery of yours come from? If it came from renewable sources, then that’s definitely good for the planet. But in most countries, at least some of that electricity came from non-renewable sources, maybe even – shock, horror! – coal-burning generating stations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/06/electric-vehicle-conscience-clean-batteries-carbon-emissions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Wagram)<br />With star guests to the fore and Damon Albarn co-producing, the stylish Malian singer-songwriter speaks her mind on her wide-ranging third studio album</p><p>The Malian singer <a href="https://fatoumatadiawara.com/en/">Fatoumata Diawara</a> has always been about the future. The image of her toting an electric guitar – which she has said is a first for a female Malian singer – tells you as much, as does her new video, Nsera, a dazzling parade of Afro-futurist images with “Fatou” in assorted stunning costumes. Her two previous albums have remained broadly in Mali’s <em>wassoulou</em> traditions while introducing western elements, a process taken further on <em><a href="https://fatoumatadiawara.lnk.to/londonko">London Ko</a></em>, which is co-produced with Damon Albarn – the two have remained friends since she appeared on his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/09/africa-express-finale-concert-london">2012 Africa Express tour</a>.</p><p>It’s a sprawling, chequered affair, with six of its 14 tracks co-written with Albarn (she on guitar, he on synths), while the rest co-opt a stellar cast of collaborators. There’s much to admire: Diawara’s agile, forceful vocals; her championship of the feminist cause (Sete is her second song on the subject of FGM); a gallop with the brilliant Cuban pianist Roberto Fonseca on Blues; a slinky tribute to brotherhood with Ghanaian rapper M.anifest; and the funky party piece Tolon, with Nigerian star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/african-music-stars-struggle-to-get-visas-to-europe">Yemi Alade</a>.

## Ed Sheeran: Subtract review – a grownup record that swings from coping to not coping

<p>(Asylum/Atlantic)<br />Framing his recent grief and depression in a gauzy wash of sound courtesy of producer Aaron Dessner, the embattled songsmith continues to deal in powerful universals</p><p>As I finished writing this review, the news broke that Ed Sheeran had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/04/ed-sheeran-verdict-not-liable-copyright-lawsuit-marvin-gaye">cleared of infringing copyright</a> in his latest high-profile trial, one that has been so frustrating that the singer-songwriter threatened to “quit music” if the courts didn’t find in his favour. He is also mourning the recent death of his <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/23494154.ed-sheeran-nan-nancy-mulligan-inspired-song-dies/">Irish grandmother</a>, the subject of his 2017 song <a href="https://youtu.be/87gWaABqGYs">Galway Girl</a>. Appositely, the British singer-songwriter’s fifth studio album details what an absolute humdinger your early 30s can be. Billed as his starkest and most candid record yet, – (AKA <em>Subtract</em>) concludes Sheeran’s run of mathematically themed albums with a diaristic account of how slings and arrows can come at a successful singer-songwriter, often out of nowhere.</p><p>The title suits the contents. There is one major loss at the heart of this record, and some near misses; you may consider Sheeran’s recent period of depression – another of <em>Subtract</em>’s recurrent themes – as a kind of defining emptiness around which the album orbits. The most obvious absence in these 14 tracks is that of Jamal Edwards, the late SBTV founder who died suddenly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/20/jamal-edwards-sbtv-founder-and-music-entrepreneur-dies-aged-31">in January 2022</a>. He and Sheeran had been close, to the point where many had wondered if they were more than friends – a rumour Sheeran can now <a href="https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/features/ed-sheeran-the-year-that-pulled-his-year-apart-cover-story-subtract-27770/">chuckle fondly over</a> in interviews. A grime entrepreneur whose DIY <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sbtv/featured">YouTube channel</a> did much to crowbar Black British music towards the mainstream, Edwards’s early support lent the singer-songwriter no little credibility, often in short supply from other quarters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/06/ed-sheeran-subtract-review-a-grownup-record-that-swings-from-coping-to-not-coping-aaron-dessner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When my doctor said the operation could help a medical condition, it led me to wonder about the history of this ancient procedure</p><p>The day before I had the chop, I visited the National Gallery in London to study a painting of the baby Jesus. Without wishing to get too CSI: Bethlehem about this, there is very little physical evidence to warrant the title <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/workshop-of-giovanni-bellini-the-circumcision" title="">The Circumcision</a>. In this painting by someone from the workshop of Giovanni Bellini, the sumptuously bearded mohel, tasked with removing the foreskin, hides the operation from our view with his hand. Look as I might, I could see neither knife nor holy penis.</p><p>The day after my encounter with Jesus, I am due to have a centimetre of my foreskin removed for a condition called <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/phimosis/" title="">phimosis</a>, which means tight foreskin. While phimosis is normal among male infants as the foreskin is attached to the glans in early development of the penis, in adults the condition is pathological. I have not been able to find out how many British males have been circumcised as adults, but my urologist told me it is not uncommon: during what he hilariously called “insertive sexual intercourse”, the foreskin retreats, causing tearing if it is non-retractable. Tearing didn’t happen in my case, but the attachment of foreskin to glans caused soreness and, without wishing to suggest this was a cosmetic procedure, looked wrong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/06/and-cut-what-it-was-like-being-circumcised-in-my-60s">Continue reading...</a>

## Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review – a blockbuster with maverick energy

<p><strong>Respawn Entertainment/ EA; PlayStation 5 (version tested), Xbox Series X/S, PC</strong><br />The influence of Hidetaka Miyazaki saturates the rhythms of combat, character acrobatics and sweeping vistas of the finest Star Wars game in years</p><p>Whatever you feel toward the game director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/aug/06/hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-souls-deracine-fromsoftware">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>’s fantasy oeuvre – <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Sekiro</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>, a constellation of hits often referred to as the “Soulsborne” set – the impact of his studio FromSoftware’s work on the blockbuster video game industry is, with the arrival of <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, indisputable. This most mainstream of brand-Disney endeavours has been shaped in ways both obvious and subtle by the gravitational force of Miyazaki’s one-time niche designs.</p><p>You play as Cal Kestis, a maverick Jedi unconcerned by the traditions of his order (you can dress Cal in any old scrubby T-shirt and cargo pants you collect in a remote treasure chest; no monkish robes here), who wields his lightsaber (also customisable) like a rapier. The rhythm of fights against droids, stormtroopers and 15ft rancors is moderated by participants’ stamina, which drains with each strike, recuperating only in moments of retreat – a quintessential Miyazaki design. Health is restored at glowing meditation spots, places of sanctuary where ability points are spent expanding Cal’s moves, but which also resurrect the local enemies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/06/star-wars-jedi-survivor-game-review-hidetaka-miyazaki">Continue reading...</a>

As the music began, a simple song growling on lone double basses, this enigmatic interior slowly started to undulate. The stage took on the appearance of a womb as seen on an ultrasound scan. Amniotic fluid never looked so classy. In the corner, a dead body lay on a trolley.

<p>Handel and Purcell from the Royal Chapel, Versailles leads a trio of albums in honour of Charles III. And bass-baritone Christopher Purves turns to Lieder</p><p>• Whether out of Gallic graciousness or republican envy, the French <strong>Chœur et Orchestre de l’Opéra Royal</strong>, directed by Gaétan Jarry, have released <strong><a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/9464924--the-crown-coronation-anthems">The Crown</a> </strong>(Château de Versailles Spectacles), a timely account of English coronation anthems, trumpet fanfares, drum rolls and shouts of “God save the king!”. It was recorded, in honour of Charles III, at the <a href="https://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/palace/royal-chapel#the-last-building-of-louis-xiv">Royal Chapel, Versailles</a>, last December. The music, by Purcell and Handel, was written for the coronations of James II <a href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/royals/james-ii">in 1685</a> and George II <a href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/royals/george-ii-and-caroline">in 1727</a>. Both composers made settings of My Heart Is Inditing, entirely different in mood, Handel’s rather more lavish, each included here. Of Handel’s four coronation anthems, Zadok the Priest – a royal acclamation of the people of Israel to their king – remains the most stirring and spectacular.

## Rick Edwards looks back: ‘I don’t know what my dad said to make me smile like that’

<p>The TV presenter turned podcaster on causing trouble at school, why he’s geeky about science and how being on TV changed him</p><p>Born in Enfield, north London, in 1979, Rick Edwards is a TV presenter turned podcaster, author and radio presenter. A Cambridge University graduate, he studied maths for one year before switching to natural sciences. After graduating, he became a poster boy of mid-noughties hangover TV, as a host on T4 and E4 Music. Since then he has diversified with political shows, quizzes and now BBC Radio 5 Live’s breakfast show and a science podcast, Eureka!, which he co-hosts alongside Dr Michael Brooks. He is married, to the actor Emer Kenny, and they have a baby boy.</p><p><strong>Before Bake Off ‘showstoppers’</strong> existed, my mum was churning out impressive cakes. This one, for my eighth birthday, is one of many magnificent creations she produced: it’s a depiction of a moonscape. I’m not entirely sure why she went with blue icing, and it has a union jack flag on it, which is quite patriotic but frankly inaccurate. It is lovely, however, and solid evidence of my interest in space and science stuff. It would have been one of those “close your eyes” cake reveal moments, and while my mum took the photo my dad was making me laugh from behind the camera. I look as if I can’t quite contain myself. This is the face of unvarnished, unadulterated joy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/06/rick-edwards-looks-back">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Could this be the ultimate spring braise? Devour with the nuttiest new potatoes you can find …</p><p>Our long, cold, dark winters mean spring pod vegetables arrive late up here in Lancashire. But when they do finally make an appearance, they are plentiful, so we always try to make the most of them while we can. At The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jan/27/clitheroe-top-gastropubs-lancashire-uk">Parkers Arms</a>, I often pair peas and beans with local nutty new potatoes, a braise that reminds me of my mother every time I make it. On warm days, she’d make something similar, then put it in the fridge overnight and serve it cold the next day on butter lettuce. I’ve added a few sliced spring onions to the mix, because their delicate allium acidity balances the sweetness of the peas; or, even better, add some shredded wild garlic leaves, if you’re lucky to have a patch nearby (the forests and grounds around us at the Parkers have been carpeted with the stuff recently). Spring braises such as this are quick to assemble, and don’t require long cooking, either – with fresh, seasonal ingredients such as this, the less you do to them, the better they always taste.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/06/baked-garden-peas-vegan-braise-recipe-spring-onions-jersey-royals-stosie-madi">Continue reading...</a>

One night, after weeks of looking for answers, she started hearing “what some might call God, what some might call your higher consciousness” via a two-hour-long, completely sober encounter she initially mistook for a psychotic break.</p><p>“I woke up in the morning and called all my healthcare workers and explained what happened, and they all said: ‘Oh that’s a spiritual awakening, congratulations.’” She shakes her head. “I was like: ‘What the fuck are you talking about? You’re saying what I’ve been doing therapy for, and meditating for, and searching for, was to have an incredibly surreal, terrifying, nearly psychedelic experience?’ They were all, like: ‘Yep, that’s the goal.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/06/kesha-gag-order-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Central banks raising interest rates makes it harder to fight the climate crisis | Thomas Ferguson and Servaas Storm

<p>Higher rates slow the renewable energy transition and shield oil and gas producers from competition by low-carbon producers</p><p>In late 2021, consumer price inflation surged in many countries. Prices shot up again following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In response, central banks drastically tightened monetary policy – raising interest rates from near zero to around 5% or more. Since the interest rate hikes have failed to bring down core inflation to the target rate of 2% favored by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB), the pressure for further rate hikes has been insistent.</p><p>We have long doubted that central bank rate rises could control the new inflation at a socially acceptable price. In most countries, wages lag well behind inflation. Too much of the rise in prices clearly reflects the impact of higher profit margins and obvious supply bottlenecks.</p><p>Thomas Ferguson is professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and director of research at the Institute for New Economic Thinking</p><p>Servaas Storm is a senior lecturer at the Delft University of Technology</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/06/central-banks-interest-rate-hike-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

Now, I’m working harder and the money is getting scarcer. What happened?” You might think this, in 2023, as a college professor or a cab driver or a journalist or a factory worker. This is America – our entire economy is built on making millions of jobs worse, in order to make a few people very rich.</p><p>What would be remarkable is if – when you realized that your once-good job was being made worse in order to satisfy the profit hunger of some faraway investment banker – you were able to actually do something about it. That, in our nation, would be news. That would be something for everyone to cheer for. The plain old workers standing up against enormous companies to stop the process that is turning their careers into execrable “gigs”. Is it a fairy tale? No, my friends.

<p>Many flavours and cultures collide in these excitingly spiced lettuce wraps stuffed with tangy minced chicken, aubergine and a quick pickle</p><p>This is a fresh dish with a lot of body, with the tamarind bringing smoky, sweet and tangy notes. Tamarind is a brilliant ingredient that can be taken in any direction – sweet or savoury. You can buy it in paste form, but I prefer using a block of semi-dry tamarind flesh that you soak in hot water and push through a sieve. Serve the chicken mix in lettuce to create a fun sharing experience, with everyone around the table tucking in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/06/chicken-aubergine-tamarind-lettuce-cups-recipe-quick-pickled-vegetables-melissa-thompson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>King Charles III will be crowned in a taxpayer-funded extravaganza. None of it addresses the challenges in the real world</p><p>• Elsie McDowell is an A-level student from south London. She was the 2023 winner of the Hugo Young award, 16-18 age category</p><p>The coronation of King Charles III couldn’t come at a worse time for young people. After the chaos caused by Covid, and with teacher’s strikes (which I support) ongoing,<strong> </strong>it is yet another day off school in the crucial run-up to GCSE and A-level exams. Perhaps this is a cynical way to view the first anointing of a British head of state in 70 years, but it’s hard to see this as nothing more than an expensive disruption to my day-to-day life.</p><p>I wondered if I was alone in thinking this, so I asked around my school.

<p>Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, Michael Jackson ... In the era of #MeToo what to do with the great art of scary monsters and super creeps?</p><p>Five years ago, in November 2017, I published an essay titled What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men? It went viral right at the peak of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement" title="">#MeToo</a> avalanche. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/harvey-weinstein" title="">Harvey Weinstein</a> accusations had just been made public, followed by allegations against the comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck" title="">Louis CK</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/al-franken" title="">senator Al Franken</a>, TV news stars Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer and many more. All this was set against the backdrop of the dawning of the Trump era, which was ushered in by the soon-to-be-president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/10/trump-access-hollywood-tape-evidence-jean-carroll-trial" title="">Access Hollywood tape</a>, in which he described grabbing women by the pussy. Over the next months and years I travelled to college campuses to discuss this issue, and found the students I spoke to were as confused as I felt. Could they still watch Shakespeare in Love? Could they enjoy Louis CK in Parks and Recreation? Could they still listen to David Bowie?</p><p>I’ve spent my life being disappointed by beloved male artists: John Lennon hit his first wife; TS Eliot was antisemitic; Woody Allen began a relationship with his partner’s daughter Soon-Yi; Roman Polanski pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey (now Geimer). When I started to write about this problem, I realised I didn’t want to compile a catalogue of monsters – after all, wasn’t the history of art already that? I was trying to find out not about the artists, but about the audience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/06/can-i-still-listen-to-david-bowie-a-superfans-dilemma">Continue reading...</a>

She compares portraits and discerns a marked shift in the 18th century when he seems to become “more beautiful, symmetrical, and whiter<em> </em>in complexion”.</p><p>If visual art has hitherto seemed like a peripheral detail in the appraisal of his work, <a href="https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/bio/dr-farah-karim-cooper/" title="">Karim-Cooper</a>, a professor of Shakespeare studies, connects this paled image to a metaphorical whitewashing: the man we celebrate today is not the one who lived and worked in Elizabethan England but a reconstructed fantasy, built to serve as an emblem of white excellence and imperial Englishness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/06/the-great-white-bard-by-farah-karim-cooper-review-reclaiming-shakespeare">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘What is this insane war?’: a philosopher on Ukraine’s frontlines

<p>Polarizing French intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy embedded with Ukrainian defenders for revealing and damning new documentary</p><p>In the fall of 2022, Bernard-Henri Lévy, one of France’s most famous and polarizing public intellectuals, traveled to Ukraine for a series of visits along the fault lines of the Russian invasion. He witnessed bombed-out apartment buildings in Kyiv, where he had once met with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and where civilians were still liable to be awakened in the night by Russian blasts. He accompanied miners deep into the earth in Pavlograd, toured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, joined the Ukrainian navy on a patrol outside Odesa, met with commanders of an international legion in a nondescript room whose only decoration was, inexplicably, a Big Mouth Billy Bass.</p><p>Such is the collage of lasting images captured in Slava Ukraini (“Glory to Ukraine”), Lévy’s documentary filmed over 10 trips to the country: devastating, resilient, admirable, often infuriating, sometimes surreal, at times relaxed and even a little funny. The 95-minute documentary, Lévy’s second film on the conflict, traces the three-month arc of the Ukrainian counter-offensive through many of the occupied eastern territories, from Kyiv to Bakhmut, Lyman, Izium, Kharkiv and Donbas, culminating with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/11/reports-of-wounded-soldiers-being-abandoned-as-russia-retreats-from-kherson-city">liberation of Kherson</a> in November.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/06/slava-ukraini-documentary-bernard-henri-levy-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## The Muppets Mayhem: it is impossible to watch this brilliant series without a massive grin

<p>There is just no TV show that wouldn’t be improved by adding Muppets. This hilarious series is packed with cameos from celebs who are all having the time of their lives</p><p>If you get out of your Westminster bubble and sit and think about something for once, you’d realise that essentially every film or TV format would be improved with the addition of Muppets. Pride and Prejudice but Mr Darcy is bright purple. The Devil Wears Prada with Miss Piggy as Miranda Priestly. A Superman reboot where Clark Kent is the only human actor in the whole thing. Seinfeld but Kramer is an 8ft-tall Big Bird-type. Think further outside of the box: Gogglebox could be improved with Statler and Waldorf; for First Dates, replace Fred with Kermit, and Merlin with Animal. Thinking about this has actually ruined the next week of TV for me. Every time I watch something with humans in it, I’ll be pining for Muppets.</p><p>Anyway, there’s The Muppets Mayhem (Disney+, from Wednesday 10 May), at least, which is brilliant. On the surface it’s just Daisy Jones &amp; the Six but the band are all Muppets and there’s a lot less sexual tension, but there’s actually more to it than that. Mayhem stars <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/lilly-singh-a-little-late-youtube-nbc">Lilly Singh</a> (one of those YouTube-famous curios you have never heard of, but it turns out she’s actually more renowned than most people alive and has 13.4 million followers on Instagram) as Nora, a messily aspirational girlboss whose life is in cheerful disarray and she needs a big win at work and maybe a love triangle subplot to achieve her destiny. Have you seen that story before? Of course you have, but you have not seen it with a band of Muppets, and that is the point: every time a chair turns around and the character is a puppet, I laugh. Every time Animal says anything, I laugh. Though the story throughline is fairly cornily safe – an ancient touring band need to record their first ever album, but keep getting distracted because they are all jolly little puppets, and I haven’t seen to the end but I assume they do record the album then play a sold-out show – the levity of the puppets cranks everything up to a higher level. It’s just really, really funny to see a perfectly round, 3ft-high Muppet driving a van while Lilly Singh has a career crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/06/the-muppets-mayhem-it-is-impossible-to-watch-this-brilliant-series-without-a-massive-grin">Continue reading...</a>

## UK Eurovision entrant Mae Muller: ‘In our hearts and minds it’s Ukraine’s year’

<p>The artist explains that she had been preparing to put out her debut LP – but is happy for now in ‘the biggest safe space on the planet’ with I Wrote a Song</p><p>In January, pop star Mae Muller wrote a song she thought would be perfect for Eurovision. A few days later one of her managers called asking for an urgent meeting over a cup of tea. “I was worried my career was over!” the 25-year-old north Londoner laughs. “Then he said ‘what do you think about doing Eurovision?’. He had a whole PowerPoint presentation with all the statistics, and I was like ‘hun, I’m all in’. The Eurovision gods must have been speaking to me because I already had the song.”</p><p>The song in question is Muller’s catchy, Dua Lipa-esque I Wrote a Song, a bolshy meta-hit about channelling anger at an ex into pop poetry. Muller’s gut instincts were right: it does indeed tick a lot of Eurovision boxes. “First and foremost it’s a bop, you can dance to it, it’s easy to sing along to,” lists Muller. “And no matter what language you speak, everyone can sing the ‘da da da da da’ bit,” she adds, referencing the song’s earworm post-chorus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/06/uk-eurovision-entrant-mae-muller-ukraine-i-wrote-a-song">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘So many people don’t believe anything – only what makes them money’: Ruth Wilson on being a Hollywood outsider

<p>The Affair star on #MeToo hypocrisy, the violence of cosmetic surgery, and why she steers clear of social media</p><p>Ruth Wilson hitches the skin by her ears to demonstrate how she’d look if she had “those little wires” sewn into her face, by which she means a thread lift. “Just that would make the world of difference,” she says. She is 41 and “everyone” around her talks about Botox “and what to fill their face with”. This is not in response to any question of mine. This is Ruth Wilson freewheeling on how confusing she finds the notion of “female empowerment” in 2023. “As an actress, everyone does it. Very few resist. I haven’t done anything – yet. But it’s in my head as like, ‘Well, do you decide not to and therefore potentially look older than your peers? Or do you just give in?’” Yesterday she read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/well/live/preventative-botox-wrinkles.html" title="">in the New York Times</a> that people should get Botox in their 20s to stop wrinkles forming. “I mean, are they joking? I find it so … ” she emits a plosive exhale of despair. “It’s mad! It’s massive violence.” Why can’t a woman age on screen? Or age, full stop?</p><p>But this is nothing new, she says. She sits back against the banquette of the cafe in the photographic studio where we’ve met. Women don’t help ourselves; never have. She plucks examples – Tudor fashion, she says, pretending to cinch her waist with a corset. “Like, <em>humpf</em>.” Or Elizabethans painting their faces with lead-based ceruse that ate their skin and made their hair fall out. “We’re like, ‘Wow’, today. But in 200 years, they’ll be looking back at images of women now going, ‘What were they doing?’ ‘What is<em> </em>that? You’re blowing your face and lips up.’ Yet it’s a multibillion-dollar industry. And women are part of that industry, perpetuating this ‘empowerment’.” Later, she will apply the same charm and forthright common sense to torpedo Hollywood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/06/ruth-wilson-interview-the-second-woman-luther-the-affair">Continue reading...</a>

Opposite me, cross-legged, sits the middle one, aged three, blond hair standing on end. I turn over a card, revealing a picture of a triceratops. I turn over another card: a diplodocus. I let out a puff of exasperation – really, I want to swear – and return both cards to the face-down position.</p><p>The middle one turns over a card: a pterodactyl. Then another: also a pterodactyl. He takes both cards, adds them to his pile and goes again.

<p>Save excess fat from frying bacon by simply mixing with balsamic and a little crushed of garlic – warm it up a little, and it’s superb as a dressing on any salad</p><p>Victoria Glass, author of <a href="https://nourishbooks.com/shop/good-waste-victoria-glass/">Too Good to Waste</a> (Nourish Books, 2017), says that reducing waste is not about being perfect, but about doing your best. “I’ve often got a bit of meat fat lurking in the fridge, for example, and I often warm it up in a pan and turn it into a salad dressing.”</p><p>Salty bacon fat goes really well with earthy beetroots in particular, and Glass’s book has a lovely beetroot, basil, bacon and green bean salad that uses her bacon fat vinaigrette, which is best served warm. My take on her dish involves drizzling some over chunky wedges of little gem, tomatoes and basil with extra bacon, to create a breadless BLT salad of sorts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/06/how-to-turn-leftover-bacon-fat-into-a-brilliant-salad-dressing-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

## Sherry trifle at the Smiths: how we watched the last coronation

<p>We were of a generation that couldn’t help but take an interest in 1953, writes <strong>Margaret Drabble</strong>, but Charles inherits a grotesquely unequal realm</p><p>Our family watched the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1953/jun/03/queenmother.monarchy">coronation of Elizabeth II</a> with our neighbours, as we didn’t have a television set. We were invited next door for sandwiches and sherry trifle with the queen, and she was more impressive than Andy Pandy and Muffin the Mule, whom we children used to sneak round to view on the quiet. My parents disapproved of television, though they later succumbed when they found my very much younger brother was culturally deprived and isolated because we didn’t have one. He and my father discovered that they loved watching The Lone Ranger together. I’ve always been grateful to the Smiths next door for taking pity on us on 2 June 1953. My sisters and I were embarrassed that we never asked them back. To anything, ever. I’m still embarrassed.</p><p>We Drabbles weren’t ardent royalists, but we were of the generation that couldn’t help but take an interest in the monarchy, and I suspect that I owe my name, subliminally, to Princess Margaret Rose. The war had made most of us patriots, and there was a general feeling that the royal family had done us proud. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/17/new-elizabethan-era-remembered-elizabeth-reign">new Elizabethan age</a> beckoned, and there in blurred black and white was our very young, very beautiful, and very dignified sovereign, newly married to a handsome prince – how could we resist? It was an utterly memorable piece of pageantry, that scored itself into our imaginations for life. It was all the more powerful because we saw so few moving images in those days, and very few sherry trifles. We hadn’t yet emerged from the age of austerity, and rationing didn’t end for over a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/sherry-trifle-at-the-smiths-how-we-watched-the-last-coronation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wagner chief says his forces will pull out of Bakhmut while Ukraine says they are reinforcing positions; Zaporizhzhia villages near frontline evacuated</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/05/wagner-chief-yevgeny-prigozhin-rages-at-russia-generals-and-threatens-bakhmut-pullout">his forces will leave Bakhmut</a></strong>, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies and asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date.</p><p><strong>Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses </strong>suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness</strong> for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism.</p><p><strong>Ukraine said two people have been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region</strong> and electricity distribution networks have been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and the Kherson regions.</p><p><strong>Some residents left Kherson city in cars and buses</strong> on Friday, and others stocked up on groceries, ahead of a 56-hour curfew <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/ukraine-residents-kherson-prepare-for-curfew-after-night-of-heavy-shelling">due to begin on Friday evening</a>. The announcement of the curfew prompted speculation in Kherson that the city is about to be used as a launch point for the long-anticipated Ukrainian counterattack.</p><p><strong>Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. </strong>The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days.</p><p><strong>Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</strong> in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine.</p><p><strong>A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism”</strong> over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria.
