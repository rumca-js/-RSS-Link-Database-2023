<p>For the last few years, you’ve been able to say “Stop” to tell Google Assistant to end an alarm early without the need to preface your command with “Hey Google.” It’s a handy feature Google first debuted on <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1486002169404874762?s=20"><ins>Assistant-enabled smart displays and speakers</ins></a> before later rolling it out to Pixel smartphones. And for the most part, it works like a charm, though one person recently discovered a fun quirk of the feature that involves the Pixies classic “Where Is My Mind?”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/134so18/i_finally_figured_out_why_my_alarm_kept_turning/">Reddit post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixies-where-is-my-mind-dismissing-alarms/"><em><ins>Android Police</ins></em></a><em>, </em>Pixel user “asevarte” recounts how their morning alarm would go off and sometimes turn off moments later for seemingly no reason. “Maybe once every other week or so, I would wake up 30 minutes later on my backup alarm, with no indication as to why the first shut itself off,” they told the Google Pixel subreddit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e731bad521434791b93d33eb513fddb8"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Earlier this week, asevarte decided to wake up early to get to the bottom of the issue. Thankfully, it didn’t take long to find the culprit. Their alarm was set to play a Spotify playlist that features “Where Is My Mind?” If you’re a Pixies fan, you know exactly where this is going. The <em>Surfer Rosa</em> cut opens with bassist and vocalist Kim Deal singing “Ooh” before frontman Black Francis says, “Stop,” and the song, following a brief pause, then continues. The section caused Google Assistant to prematurely end asevarte’s alarm. They had the playlist set to shuffle, which is what made identifying the bug tricky.</p><p><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixies-where-is-my-mind-dismissing-alarms/"><em><ins>Android Police</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>recorded a video of the oversight in action, and sure enough, playing “Where Is My Mind?” ends an alarm early. Interestingly, other songs that feature a prominent “stop,” such as “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen, don’t appear to trigger Assistant’s Quick Phrases feature in the same way that “Where Is My Mind?” does. <em>Android Police </em>speculates the reason for that could be that in those other songs “stop” is backed by instrumentals. That lines up with complaints Assistant users have had over the years that the feature doesn’t work when they try to use it while their smart display, speaker or Pixel device is playing music.</p><div id="647216d7e92041ffaf2dc676fcd7d96a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sorry about that! ⏰📱🛑<a href="https://t.co/EtCQ2FPkIJ">https://t.co/EtCQ2FPkIJ</a></p>— PIXIES (@PIXIES) <a href="https://twitter.com/PIXIES/status/1653669158817607680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>If you’re curious about what the Pixies think of all this. The band’s official Twitter account caught the original <em>Android Police </em>story. “Sorry about that!” the account tweeted.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pixies-apologize-for-sabotaging-your-google-assistant-alarm-212914115.html?src=rss

<p>If you’ve been following the Apple rumor mill since last year, you may recall the iPhone 15 Pro has been widely expected to feature a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-solid-state-buttons-ming-chi-kuo-083518207.html"><ins>set of touch-sensitive solid-state buttons</ins></a>. It now looks like Apple won’t replace the iPhone’s physical buttons for at least another year. In a <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/307563939/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Q4-FY23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"><ins>shareholder letter</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-cancellation/"><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em></a>, Apple supplier Cirrus Logic said “a new product that we mentioned in previous shareholder letters as being scheduled for introduction this fall is no longer expected to come to market as planned.”</p><p>Cirrus is best known for producing a handful of components that go into the iPhone’s Taptic Engine. Apple is the firm’s largest customer, accounting for 79 percent of its revenue in 2022. <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/307563939/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Q4-FY23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"><ins>In November</ins></a>, Cirrus told investors and analysts it was working on a new high-performance mixed-signal (HPMS) component (that’s the same category of part as the Tapic Engine), and that it would arrive in smartphones sometime in 2023. This week, Cirrus said it had “limited visibility” into the product’s future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reports suggesting the iPhone 15 Pro would feature a set of solid-state buttons originated from <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1585852274680950784?s=20"><ins>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</ins></a>, who said last fall the company was planning to replace the physical volume and power buttons on its next flagship phone with touch-sensitive buttons. Last month, Kuo <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/two-iphone-15-pro-models-removal-of-solid-state-button-design-negatively-affects-cirrus-logic-and-a456d5e7386c"><ins>revised his forecast</ins></a>, noting Apple had decided to change plans due to “unresolved technical issues before mass production.” If nothing else, the development is a reminder to treat smartphone leaks with skepticism, particularly those that circulate months and sometimes years in advance of a product’s announcement.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-iphone-15-pro-probably-may-not-feature-solid-state-buttons-as-previously-rumored-174416328.html?src=rss

<p>You can soon log into your Netflix account and build bridges, towers, zeppelins and other structures with jiggly talking balls of goo. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-01-10-ios-android-and-mac-stats-for-world-of-goo.html"><em>World of Goo</em></a>, the physics-based hit game by indie developer 2D Boy, is being remastered for mobile exclusively for the streaming giant. And when it launches on May 23rd, you can play it for free, with no ads on in-app purchases, regardless of your membership tier.&nbsp;</p><p>The physics game first launched in 2008 for Microsoft Windows and Wii before it made its way to Android and iOS, Mac OS, Linux and Switch in the years that followed. To win a level in the game, you'll have to use the balls of goo to build structures and get over pits, hills and other obstacles. There are several species of goo, and each one comes with its own unique ability.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The remaster still features the same levels, puzzles and areas, but the art has been updated to double the resolution of the original game. It has also been optimized for modern screen sizes so that it would look good on any device. The game will save your progress across devices, but take note that it tracks each profile separately.&nbsp;</p><div id="2f84deae629a4524a2401adfbe5415db"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Back in March, Netflix announced its plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-plans-to-add-roughly-40-more-titles-to-its-mobile-game-library-this-year-140014333.html">add roughly 40 more titles</a> to its gaming library, in hopes that you can find at least one that appeals to you. Back then, Netflix VP of external games Leanne Loombe said users are mostly drawn to three specific types of games, including titles they recognize from elsewhere and ones that encourage daily play. <em>World of Goo</em> certainly fits those two categories.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-launching-a-remastered-world-of-goo-on-may-23rd-133027485.html?src=rss

The case also supports wireless charging, making it convenient to power them up with various pads and stands you may have around your home.

## Apple's 'Silo' is simply transcendent sci-fi TV

<p>You've heard this premise before: In a post-apocalyptic world, the remnants of civilization live in a stratified society, governed by oppressive rules as they struggle to maintain their humanity. Then, a hero appears and threatens to topple the social order. We've seen this story repeated so often throughout the history of dystopian fiction — most notably in Fritz Lang's masterpiece, <em>Metropolis </em>— that<em>&nbsp;</em>I wasn't immediately excited when Apple first announced <em>Silo</em>, an adaptation of Hugh Howie's wildly popular <em>Wool</em> novels. Surely, this can't top Bong Joon-ho's bonkers <em>Snowpiercer</em> (itself adapted from an '80s French graphic novel), so why even bother?</p><p>Well, I was wrong. Spearheaded by Graham Yost <em>(Justified</em>), <em>Silo </em>exemplifies everything I love about great science fiction. It wrestles with complex ideas and moral questions, it's filled with memorable and realistic characters, and it features a truly distinctive setting: a 144-story self-sustaining underground city that's reminiscent of <em>The Matrix's</em> Zion. In this case, though, the population seems mostly content with their situation. There's no memory of the world before the silo, so most people concern themselves with keeping the city running instead of breaking out. Why rock the bunker?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d7b190c51f3743d8861b120d4b4b0aa3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>But, echoing a theme from HBO's excellent <em>Station Eleven </em>and <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, survival is insufficient. Some can't help but wonder about the nature of the silo: Is the video feed of the destroyed outside world real, or is it some sort of trap to keep them underground? Who, exactly, determines who can get pregnant? And what can they learn from the artifacts left behind from the previous civilization?</p><p><em>Silo </em>makes a strong impression from the start. We're introduced to Sheriff Holsten (David Oyelowo), a well-liked law man who goes about his morning and makes a shocking announcement: He wants to go outside. The gravity of his declaration is instantly made clear, even though the show doesn't explain it up front. We later learn that anyone who asks to go out <em>can</em>, but it's essentially a death wish. All of this is conveyed almost wordlessly at first, thanks to the strength of Oyelowo's performance.</p><figure><img alt="Rebecca Ferguson and David Oyelowo in Silo." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/e498a6d1-eb94-11ed-bffd-0162ff89b49e" style="height: 999px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>I can't help but love a show that begins so confidently. Throughout the first two episodes, <em>Silo </em>makes it clear that you're in good hands. Yost and his writing team — which includes Jessica Blaire (<em>On Becoming a God in Central Florida)</em> and Cassie Papas (<em>Tyrant</em>) — take time to introduce every character, establish their motivations and build a greater mystery. The impeccable production design makes the silo seem genuinely lived in. And the direction from Morten Tyldum deftly balances intimate drama with epic visuals (the silo has no elevator, just a very long stairwell that seems to go on forever).</p><p><em>Silo </em>is the rare show where every word speaks volumes, every gesture seems meaningful, and every element of the frame tells a story. It's also filled with grounded and believable performances across the board: There's Rashida Jones as Allison, the Sheriff's wife, someone who's eager to start a family but also can't help but be curious about the history of the silo. Rebecca Ferguson <em>(Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation </em>and <em>Fallout</em>), ostensibly the star of the show, doesn't really get much screen time until the second episode, but she paints a convincing portrait of a world-weary engineer who just wants to solve the murder of her friend.</p><figure><img alt="Silo on Apple TV+" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/e4980a90-eb94-11ed-bb3f-07a9496b0f8e" style="height: 999px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Of course, this wouldn’t be a dystopian story without some sort of greater conspiracy going on. The silo’s leadership is clearly hiding something from its citizens – though the mayor (played by Geraldine James) also seems genuinely concerned about the well-being of her people. There's a sense that even those in power are only trying to do their best, but may be faced with hard decisions to keep society going.&nbsp;</p><p>You’d think after being somewhat burned by <em>Lost</em>, <em>The X-Files</em> and other shows centering on major sci-fi mysteries, I’d be less inclined to commit to yet another one. But <em>Silo</em> is so compelling, I just can’t help it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-silo-review-wool-tv-show-123024485.html?src=rss

## Crypto giant Binance is reportedly facing US probe for violating Russian sanctions

<p>Binance is reportedly facing yet another investigation by the US Justice Department, and this time, it's over possible violations against sanctions imposed against Russia. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the agency is looking into whether the cryptocurrency exchange allowed Russian customers to move money as a way to go around US <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-apple-pay-google-pay-224811327.html">sanctions on the country's</a> financial institutions. The news organizations' sources also said that Binance is discussing the possibility of settling with the DOJ regarding previous allegations that the exchange was also used to move money to circumvent US sanctions against Iran.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'll recall, United States and the European Union imposed sanctions against Russian financial institutions following the invasion of Ukraine. Mykhailo Federov, Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister, asked major crypto exchanges to freeze all Russian and Belarusian accounts at the same time, but Binance was one of the companies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-crypto-exchange-refuses-to-freeze-russian-accounts-080546197.html">refused to do so</a>. Back then, a spokesperson said that unilaterally banning people's access to cryptocurrency &quot;would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists,&quot; because it would affect ordinary users and not just Russian oligarchs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the DOJ truly is looking into Binance's activities related to Russian sanctions, then it's merely one of the investigations the exchange is grappling with. The DOJ and the Internal Revenue Service started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-exchange-binance-money-laundering-140037194.html">looking into reports</a> that Binance is being used for money laundering schemes in 2021. And just earlier this year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-giant-binance-charged-with-violating-us-trading-and-derivatives-laws-170817954.html">charged Binance</a> and its founder Changpeng Zhao (pictured above) for not asking users to verify their identities, offering unregistered crypto derivatives and for implementing measures to avoid US regulation. Binance told us at the time that it found the charges &quot;unexpected and disappointing.&quot;</p><p>This time, it told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement: &quot;In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.&quot; The spokesperson continued that the company now observes strict know-your-customer protocols similar to the ones employed by traditional banks. &quot;Our policy,&quot; they said, &quot;imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money,&quot; While they didn't specifically address the allegations, the statement sounds like a denial that the company's service allowed Russian users to flout US sanctions.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/crypto-giant-binance-is-reportedly-facing-us-probe-for-violating-russian-sanctions-094505840.html?src=rss
