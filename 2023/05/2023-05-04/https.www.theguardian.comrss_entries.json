It\u2019s downcast yet full of new ideas \u2013 but will fans take to it?</p><p>E<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">d Sheeran</a> famously keeps one eye on the numbers. A decade ago, he established his trademark, a pop take on the sensitive singer-songwriter trope with a healthy relationship to rap and R&amp;B that has allowed him to flit across genres, imposing his indelible style on everything from Afrobeats to Eminem and Bring Me the Horizon collaborations. It\u2019s the smartest thing a pop star could do at the dawn of the streaming age, where success is tied to your ability to feature on as many genre-themed playlists as possible \u2013 a strategy borne out by Sheeran\u2019s 150m record sales \u2013 but also proof of fairly absurd talent: if it was that easy, everyone would be doing it. Under the circumstances, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by how wholeheartedly Sheeran has thrown himself into his fifth album, Subtract, a noticeably different prospect to previous albums.</p><p>He has not merely tapped Aaron Dessner of US indie band the National and co-producer of Taylor Swift\u2019s folksy lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore to produce; he\u2019s also eschewed his usual songwriting collaborators. Intriguingly, their absence hasn\u2019t affected Sheeran\u2019s commercial melodic facility: Colourblind seems as likely to soundtrack wedding first dances as Perfect or Thinking Out Loud; Curtains and Spark land their hooks quickly; the tune of Sycamore is disarmingly lovely. You even wonder if the songwriters-for-hire were holding him back: by far the least memorable song is the one pop super-producer Max Martin had a hand in, the underwhelming Eyes Closed; it\u2019s conspicuously better when Sheeran tries something different, like the gorgeous, Beatles-y middle eight of Dusty.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/ed-sheeran-subtract-review-easily-his-best-ever-album\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/ed-sheeran-subtract-review-easily-his-best-ever-album", "date_published": "2023-05-04 23:01:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Facebook and WhatsApp owner urged by UK bank to act on fraud as scams soar", "description": "<p>TSB says 80% of cases in its main fraud categories come from scams on Meta platforms including Instagram</p><p>Meta has been urged to take action to protect customers from fraud, after TSB said scams via the social media company\u2019s platforms Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have soared.</p><p>The UK bank said there had been a huge jump in the number of scams originating from Meta-owned sites and apps, releasing research that shows they now account for 80% of cases within TSB\u2019s three largest fraud categories: impersonation, purchase and investment.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-fraud-scams-tsb-meta\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-fraud-scams-tsb-meta", "date_published": "2023-05-04 23:01:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Party time for Napoli fans as they clinch the Scudetto \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>The <em>Partenopei</em> are champions of Italy once again.

That insight was rediscovered in the late 20th century, leading to the modern consensus of cognitive science: we think we see and hear the outside world directly, but most of our experience is created by the brain, meaning its best guesses are based on limited information as to what might really be out there.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, his expertise means he is ideally positioned to make a pitch to the UK to forge a closer relationship over foreign and defence policy.<br /><br />\u201cI believe I have arrived at a good moment with the making and the finalisation of the agreement on the Windsor framework which has rebuilt trust between the EU and the UK,\u201d he says in his first interview.<br /><br />\u201cObviously the very rich relationship between the UK and the EU has been affected by Brexit, but the foundations of the relationship are very strong and we are both fighting jointly to reestablish security in Europe after the terrible attack by Russia.\u201d<br /><br />Asked why the Northern Ireland negotiations succeeded, he compliments both sides, but acknowledges the invasion of Ukraine also concentrated minds.<br /><br />\u201cAs with most things in international relations, there is not one cause for the change, but many causes. Certainly personalities make a difference. The arrival of prime minister Rishi Sunak, the foreign secretary James Cleverly and the Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, alongside the very clear willingness on our side shown by vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and the Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, has been fundamental.</p><p>\u201cBut what has also been fundamental is that all Europeans are jointly facing one of the biggest threats for decades to their security, their livelihood and their values. So in a way it has been easy to have a group of people, very conscious of the challenges they are facing and very pragmatically oriented, to show a willingness to go beyond Brexit and rebuild a strong relationship.\u201d<br /><br />He is also careful to suggest the two sides have to learn to walk together before they run. The meat and drink of his future work will be the implementation of the revised protocol and future of the trading and cooperation agreement, including talks on British participation in the Horizon research programme, or the EU Retained Law bill, a measure ministers are rethinking as they look at the implications of an automatic end-of-year scrapping of 4,000 EU laws that had been kept on the statute book to ensure continuity.<br /><br />He pointedly flags his concern over the UK\u2019s illegal migration bill if it requires a breach with the ECHR. \u201cThe European Union considers that this is a fundamental issue, and we do hope that our partners also will continue supporting both the European Court for Human Rights and, of course, the Council of Europe, which is one of the backbones for the respect for human rights in the European continent,\u201d he says.<br /><br />On the positive side, he welcomes British involvement in the European Political Community, a still fledgling institution and the brainchild of the French president Emmanuel Macron that brings together nearly 50 EU and non-EU states at heads of government level to discuss common concerns. Britain attended the first meeting of the EPC under Liz Truss\u2019s leadership and now London has agreed to host the fourth meeting, expected in the first half of 2024. \u201cThe EPC does fill a vacuum and, as such, is a very useful structure for European leaders,\u201d Serrano says.<br /><br />Nor does he rule out the start of regular EU-UK summits. \u201cIt is not on the table yet, but such meetings are normal for the EU with third countries to which it is very close. Would it be a normal evolution and development for the future? Probably yes, but it is for the leaders to decide.\u201d<br /><br />But it is in the field of defence, an area left out of the withdrawal agreement, that he sees as the greatest potential for closer cooperation. He says that \u201cever since the agreement between Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac at St Malo in 1998 the UK has been at the forefront of developing EU defence policy. The UK has always been behind most of the initiatives that have been developed in the architecture of security and defence policy.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/new-eu-envoy-recognises-willingness-to-rebuild-relationship-between-uk-and-eu\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/new-eu-envoy-recognises-willingness-to-rebuild-relationship-between-uk-and-eu", "date_published": "2023-05-04 05:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story review \u2013 a ravishing, romp-packed prequel", "description": "<p>Shonda Rhimes\u2019s gorgeous triumph of a spin-off follows Queen Charlotte across two timelines.
