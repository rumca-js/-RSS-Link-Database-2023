After a series of technical issues at my hosting provider (downtime on
2023-03-08, 2023-04-23, 2023-05-02, 2023-05-03) I've now moved </span>

It's slightly more expensive ($10/m vs $8.49/m, primarily driven by
storage) but it should be more reliable.

I thought a bit about whether I'd like to go fully static and put this
all on Github Pages, but I enjoy being able to play around with
dynamic bits (like <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/introducing-shrubgrazer">Shrubgrazer</a>).  And even for <a href="https://www.bidadance.org/">sites</a> <a href="https://www.beantownstomp.com/">I manage</a> that serve via
Pages I still like having preview versions on my VPS here for easy
development.
