With the coronation of Charles III just around the corner, I thought I'd celebrate in the only way I know how: by creating a mini-series of videos telling the stories of various rebels, radicals and republicans throughout the centuries who have tried (with varying degrees of success) to consign the British crown to history.

In this second episode of what I'm calling "Treason Fest 2023", we're looking at how the British Monarchy became obsessed with maintaining its own popularity, how that obsession almost brought-down the institution under Queen Victoria and how King Charles might similarly place it at risk.
