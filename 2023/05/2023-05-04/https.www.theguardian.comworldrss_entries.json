We fight on our own territory\u2019</p><p>Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Air raid sirens are sounding in Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine, as Ukraine\u2019s armed forces report that there are explosions in Odesa.</p><p><strong>Moscow has accused Kyiv of attempting an overnight drone strike on the Kremlin with the aim of killing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. </strong>The Kremlin said two drones had been used in the attack but were disabled by Russian defences. In a statement on its website, the Kremlin said it considered the attack a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the life of the president of the Russian Federation.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy denied Ukraine was responsible.</strong> \u201cWe don\u2019t attack Putin, or Moscow, we fight on our territory,\u201d he said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US could not confirm Russian reports that Ukraine targeted Putin.</p><p><strong>Russian shells killed 21 civilians in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson region on Wednesday,</strong> Zelenskiy said, including hitting a hypermarket, a railway station and residential buildings.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said Ukraine would soon start a counteroffensive on its own soil against Russian forces.</strong> \u201cThis is why I am sure we will soon have aircraft. Because we will soon conduct an offensive, and after it I am sure we will be given planes,\u201d he said.</p><p><strong>Russia launched its third nightly round of attacks on Kyiv in six days, </strong>authorities in the Ukrainian capital said on Wednesday, with a drone hitting a building in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine\u2019s air force command said its forces destroyed 21 of the 26 Iranian-made Shahed drones, while Kyiv officials said air defence systems eliminated those sent over the city, with no initial reports of casualties or destruction.</p><p><strong>A fuel storage facility near a key bridge in Russia\u2019s south-western region of Krasnodar was on fire in the early hours of Wednesday,</strong> the regional governor said, but there were no reports of casualties. Russia\u2019s state-owned Tass news agency has reported that the fire at an oil facility in Volna was caused by \u201cthe fall of a drone\u201d. Smoke from the fire can be seen from across the Kerch Strait in occupied Crimea.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy has said the White House did not advise him about the leak of highly classified US intelligence documents that received widespread attention around the world last month. The failure to brief him was </strong>\u201cunprofitable for us\u201d, he said. \u201cIt is not beneficial to the reputation of the White House, and I believe it is not beneficial to the reputation of the United States.\u201d</p><p><strong>A group of Nordic countries have backed Ukraine to become a member of Nato and the EU after a joint statement during Zelenskiy\u2019s visit to Finland.</strong> Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland issued a joint statement in which they said: \u201cThe Nordic countries will continue their political, financial, humanitarian and military support for as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy is due to make a visit to the Netherlands on Thursday,</strong> where he will deliver a speech and will have meetings with the prime minister, Mark Rutte, and members of parliament, according to the Dutch government.</p><p><strong>German police said Zelenskiy would travel to Berlin on 13 May though a security source later said public disclosure of the visit was premature</strong> and it was now unclear if it would go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ukraine and the EU have reached an agreement to continue their \u201ceconomic visa-free\u201d deal for another 12 months.</strong> The initial deal was struck last year after the outbreak of war. It means that Ukrainian businesses will be able to continue to sell goods to the EU without any quotas, export duties or tariffs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-and-eastern-regions-zelenskiy-denies-responsibility-for-kremlin-drone-attack\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-and-eastern-regions-zelenskiy-denies-responsibility-for-kremlin-drone-attack", "date_published": "2023-05-04 00:29:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "Health minister accuses pharmacists\u2019 lobby of \u2018dishonest scare campaign\u2019 on medicine shortages in Australia", "description": "<p>Mark Butler says group is \u2018deliberately misleading consumers\u2019 and a phased rollout of the scheme will avert a surge in demand</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/04/australia-news-live-federal-budget-aged-care-cost-of-living-interest-rates-indigenous-voice-albanese\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>Australia\u2019s pharmacy lobby is \u201cdeliberately misleading consumers with a dishonest scare campaign\u201d by claiming 133 strengths and combinations of medicines are in short supply, a spokesperson for the health minister, Mark Butler, has said.</p><p>In response to reforms that will see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/25/threat-to-your-safety-ama-campaigning-against-pharmacists-prescribing-medication-for-minor-conditions\">patients with certain stable but chronic conditions able to buy 60 days\u2019 worth of medicine on a single prescription</a> instead of 30 days, the Pharmacy Guild said 17% of the 325 eligible medicines had shortages.
