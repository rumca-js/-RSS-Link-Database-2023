<p>The Biden administration said Thursday that the U.S. government will ask for public guidance on its own plans to use AI inside government agencies.</p>



<p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said that the agency &ldquo;will be releasing draft policy guidance on the use of AI systems by the U.S. government for public comment.&rdquo; It comes as administration officials including Vice President Kamala Harris meet with the chief executives of Alphabet, Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI&mdash;the four companies at the heart of AI development in the United States.</p>



<p>&ldquo;AI is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, but in order to seize the opportunities it presents, we must first mitigate its risks,&rdquo; the administration said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-promote-responsible-ai-innovation-that-protects-americans-rights-and-safety/&amp;xcust=2-1-1809479-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">statement</a>. &ldquo;President Biden has been clear that when it comes to AI, we must place people and communities at the center by supporting responsible innovation that serves the public good, while protecting our society, security, and economy.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The OMB&rsquo;s AI policy will be released this summer, with the idea that the public will have a chance to comment before the government acts. Specifically, government agencies would be able to &ldquo;responsibly leverage AI to advance their missions and strengthen their ability to equitably serve Americans,&rdquo; the statement added.</p>



<p>The administration also said that it would work with&nbsp;leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, and Stability AI, to participate in a public evaluation of their own AI systems, to ensure they were consistent with U.S. policy. The National Science Foundation also announced $140 million in funding to launch seven new National AI Research Institutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The immediate problem is that AI has evolved rapidly, with or without input from either the government or even outside major tech companies like Google. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no putting the AI genie back in the bottle,&rdquo; said Craig Burland, CISO with Inversion6, a cybersecurity company.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Clever humans will find new ways to use this tool&mdash;for good and bad,&rdquo; Burland said in an emailed statement.&nbsp;&ldquo;Any regulation will largely be ceremonial and practically unenforceable.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Biden administration earlier on Thursday <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808666/president-biden-proposes-a-30-tax-on-cryptocurrency-energy.html">proposed a 30-percent tax on cryptocurrency</a>. </p>

## The best Windows Photos feature is finally coming back

<p>Microsoft is finally, thankfully, reinstating the Spot Fix feature in Windows 11&rsquo;s Photos app.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m mildly obsessed with the Photos app. I&rsquo;ve been enraged that you can&rsquo;t use <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397798/how-to-use-paint-3d-magic-select-tool-to-edit-out-shapes-objects-and-people-from-photos.html">Paint3D&rsquo;s Magic Select tool</a> to edit out backgrounds. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/558927/photos-is-the-most-frustrating-app-within-windows.html">fumed at Photos&rsquo; instability</a>, mildly praised Microsoft for fixing it, then wondered why there are <em>two</em> Photos apps in Windows &mdash; and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html">that the old one is better</a>. </p>



<p>But the one feature that I&rsquo;ve come to rely on (and that Microsoft removed!) was the Spot Fix tool. And it&rsquo;s finally coming back.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t care that Microsoft is just adding this back to the Microsoft Insider Dev and Canary channels &mdash; the channels that Microsoft says don&rsquo;t necessarily guarantee that the code will end up in every users&rsquo; hands. I&rsquo;m just happy that Microsoft is at least bringing it back.</p>



<p>What is Spot Fix? It&rsquo;s nothing that you can&rsquo;t find in Photoshop, with its Heal tool and the ability to &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; backgrounds onto a portion of the image. All Spot Fix does is take a small circular region (the size is adjustable), use AI to look for anomalies, and then erase them. It&rsquo;s quick, simple, and oh so necesaary to my workflow.</p>



<p>Why? Because any review of a laptop or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">a Thunderbolt dock</a> includes photos, and any photo taken with a smartphone camera exposes dust and dirt. Simply using the product as one is supposed to generally adds a tiny amount of dust, which is revealed by a smartphone camera if not my weary eyes. While touching up a photo isn&rsquo;t always necessary or desirable &mdash; sometimes it&rsquo;s good to show how easily a laptop can attract fingerprints, for example &mdash; there are many cases where it just tidies up the image.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Photos Slideshow" class="wp-image-1809463" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Photos-Slideshow.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft is updating the Windows 11 Photos app to include an improved Timeline that makes Photos a presentation app, too.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Photos&rsquo; Spot Fix helped me do that, just as easily as I can highlight a word or phrase and delete it in Microsoft Word. And who wants to pay a subscription fee to Adobe just to do a quick touchup that Microsoft can do? That&rsquo;s Spot Fix in a nutshell. </p>



<p>(My second favorite feature in Photos is Auto Enhance, which simply uses AI to improve your photo. It can be a little heavy-handed, and less important as smartphone cameras have improved, but it&rsquo;s still a great one-click touchup feature.)</p>



<p>The imminent Photos update also includes some interesting new features: a new slideshow experience, and an improved timeline view.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="Windows Photos Timeline" class="wp-image-1809462" height="801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Photos-timeline.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1200" /><figcaption>The updated Photos app promises an improved Timeline that meets expectations.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>The new Slideshow assumes that you&rsquo;ll want to view your photos in Photos, making it a presentation as well as an editing app. Slideshow does something that Google Photos has done for years &mdash; if you&rsquo;d like, you can create a small montage of photos, complete with styles, animations, and even audio. It looks sharp.</p>



<p>Microsoft is also re-introducing the timeline scrollbar to the All Photos, OneDrive, and iCloud Photos gallery views which groups photos by year and month, Microsoft said. (You would think this would be a basic part of Photos already, but, again, this is Photos.) &ldquo;With the scrollbar, you can now easily jump to any point in time and find the photos you want,&rdquo; the company said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/03/photos-app-for-windows-11-update-brings-improvements-for-windows-insiders/&amp;xcust=2-2-1809428-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>.</p>



<p>Either way, I&rsquo;m just happy that my Photos app is back to something to what it can and should be.</p>

## Why every laptop should have built-in 5G support

<p>I still remember<strong> </strong>that magical feeling. It was 2003 and I had bought my first mobile phone that was connected to the internet. Suddenly, I could surf the web wherever I was, and the world became a little more open.</p>



<p>Today, the idea of a phone without a constant connection to the internet would be summarily rejected by most people, but when it comes to our laptops, we have different expectations. While there are plenty of lightweight travel computers, they rarely support mobile broadband. Out of the more than 2500 laptops on the price comparison service Prisjakt, only 32 have 5G support. </p>



<p>Similarly, our mobile phone subscriptions are usually designed only for mobile phones. In other words, anyone who wants to use their computer in cafes, libraries, buses, stations and airports has to deal with a lot of unnecessary hassle to get connected.</p>



<p>Personally, I think it is time to make computers permanently connected, and there are several reasons why now is the right time:</p>



<ol><li>The need has increased. During the pandemic years, many people realized that sitting in the office for 40 hours a week is unnecessary&mdash;and our coffee shops are now full of people working and studying on their laptops.</li><li>The range of computers that are lightweight and have good battery life is growing. My own machine weighs less than a kilo and can last almost an entire working day without recharging if I&rsquo;m stingy.</li><li>Electronic sim cards (esim) have been widely adopted. You no longer need a physical SIM card for mobile browsing, and the cost of equipping a computer with mobile broadband is not very high.</li><li>Esim also makes it easy to offer mobile subscriptions that work on multiple products. Today, it is a matter of course that we can use, for example, Spotify, Netflix and other streaming services on more than one device. Similarly, it would of course be possible to sell mobile subscriptions that work on multiple devices. These already exist today, but they are far from standard.</li><li>I think the most important reason why even our computers should be constantly connected is 5G. This new generation of mobile networks is designed to give all devices a fast and stable connection. The industry is talking about self-driving cars and smart home gadgets&mdash;but it could also mean a revolution for our computers.</li></ol>



<p>Of course, it is already possible to surf with Wi-Fi in many places. The problem is that it often requires incomprehensible passwords, complicated logins and unreliable connections. Believe me, as a remote worker, I&rsquo;ve seen it all. Using an open Wi-Fi network is also a much less secure solution than surfing via the mobile network.</p>



<p>The alternative is to use your mobile phone&rsquo;s internet-sharing feature, but even this is an emergency solution that can be annoyingly slow.</p>



<p>Developing computers that are always connected would be a natural development. Just as natural as when mobile phones became always-on 20 years ago.</p>

## Corsair’s first PCIe 5.0 SSD is now available (and surprisingly affordable)

<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to find a new desktop or motherboard that&rsquo;s compatible with insanely fast PCIe 5.0 SSDs. But it&rsquo;s even harder to find the drives themselves &mdash; a few months after the first examples became available to consumers, they&rsquo;re still frequently sold out at pretty much all online listings. Hopefully the first Gen 5 drives from Corsair, one of the most prolific memory purveyors and a popular choice among gamers in particular, will help ease the crunch on these speedy new storage drives. </p>



<p>The MP700 is Corsair&rsquo;s very first PCIe 5.0 SSD, available in the ubiquitous full-sized M.2 2280 format. Corsair claims 10GB/s read and write on the 2TB drive, typical of Gen 5 drives with their next-gen interface and NAND memory. The smaller drive is rated for 9.5GB/s and 8.5GB/s read and write, respectively. If your system isn&rsquo;t quite ready for that, both drives are backwards compatible with Gen 4 and Gen 3 M.2 slots. </p>



<p>Despite the gaming focus, Corsair omits any <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677185/galax-pcie-5-0-ssd-hits-retail-shelves-with-massive-heatsink-in-tow.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">bombastic coolers on its drives</a>. Maybe that&rsquo;s why the prices are surprisingly affordable: $170 for the 1TB drive and $290 for 2TB, shipping within one business day <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Storage/M-2-SSDs/MP700-PCIe-5-0-%28Gen-5%29-x4-NVMe-M-2-SSD/p/CSSD-F2000GBMP700R2#tab-tech-specs&amp;xcust=2-3-1809085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Corsair&rsquo;s online store</a> (at least at the time I&rsquo;m writing this). That may not sound like a bargain compared to, say, a $135 2TB Gen 4 drive, but that has approximately half the speed. Sadly, you might have to wait a year or two if you want a Gen 5 SSD that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1711467/seagates-lightsaber-drives-are-elegant-ssds-for-a-more-civilized-age.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">officially Jedi-approved</a>. </p>

## Everyone has to change their Discord name

<p>Discord is a mess. That&rsquo;s not just one fuddy-duddy tech writer&rsquo;s opinion, it&rsquo;s effectively the official word from Discord itself. As part of an effort to be more straightforward and user-friendly, the chat and VOIP platform is reworking its username system and ditching &ldquo;discriminators,&rdquo; the four-digit codes followed by a pound symbol (or hashtag to you youngins) in favor of a standard universal username. Unfortunately, that means everyone will need a new one. </p>



<p>&ldquo;Our current usernames can often be too complicated or obscure for people to remember and share easily,&rdquo; says Discord co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://discord.com/blog/usernames&amp;xcust=2-3-1808895-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">In a blog post</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23710259/discord-new-username-discriminators-number-tag&amp;xcust=2-3-1808895-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>), he says that the original purpose of the discriminator was so that users could quickly hop on to different chat and voice servers without running into the dreaded &ldquo;your desired username is taken&rdquo; message. But after eight years and hundreds of millions of users, Discord is a different place, and it&rsquo;s intimidating and confusing to new users. The post says that almost half of friend requests fail thanks to a missing discriminator and/or the wrong character casing. </p>



<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re talking about a tool that&rsquo;s popular with gamers, so plenty of them might actually <em>like it </em>that way. &ldquo;Our current username format has been one of the things that makes Discord unique, and that this change makes our usernames look a lot like those on other platforms,&rdquo; says Vishnevskiy. I can imagine a lot of Discord users clinging to the current system, in a sort of communications equivalent of the &ldquo;git gud&rdquo; attitude. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, Discord is going to move to a more conventional system, whether gamers like it or not. Users will be given prompts to update their usernames &ldquo;In the coming weeks.&rdquo; By default, your current Discord username (minus the pound sign and digits) will become your new Display Name, regardless of what your new standard, case-ambivalent username is. Server Nicknames will remain in place, unchanged. </p>



<p>Discord&rsquo;s play for an easier user experience and more broad appeal is hardly unique. Mastodon, a decentralized short message platform that&rsquo;s risen in popularity as an alternative to the quickly imploding Twitter, recently unveiled a more conventional and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/&amp;xcust=2-3-1808895-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">straightforward onboarding experience</a> for new users. </p>

## Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot is now open to everyone

<p>Starting today, Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">Bing AI chatbot service</a> is available to anyone to use. The dreaded waitlist is going away and, personally, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. </p>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507212/how-to-run-chatgpt-or-bing-as-a-windows-app.html">ChatGPT</a>, Bing chatbot works by drawing information from the world wide web. All you have to do is ask it a question and you&rsquo;ll receive a human-like response (albeit of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-theyre-cryptobros.html">potentially questionable accuracy</a>). The whole thing is powered by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/research/gpt-4&amp;xcust=2-3-1808784-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GPT-4</a>, which is a language model created by OpenAI. To access the chatbot, just sign in to the new Bing with your Microsoft credentials and then you&rsquo;ll have immediate access to the open preview version. Easy as pie, right?</p>



<p>Bing Chat is getting a hefty update, too. The chatbot will feature image and video answers, chat history, restaurant bookings with OpenTable, more Edge integration and plug-in support, and so on. I&rsquo;m more of a visual person, so the idea of a chatbot responding with images and video is cool. Sometimes an image is worth more than a thousand words&hellip; or something. </p>



<p>The most prominent upgrade is the Actions feature, which you can use in both Edge and Bing. This upgrade has the AI performing tasks without jumping between the two sites. For example, if you ask the chatbot to recommend a new restaurant, it will bring up reservation times and then help you book it. I&rsquo;m all about convenience and streamlining tasks, so this news is exciting to me. For more information, check out the video below.</p>

## President Biden proposes a 30% tax on cryptocurrency energy

<p>Cryptocurrency has been the bane of PC gamers for years, as &ldquo;mining hardware&rdquo; built around high-end consumer graphics cards <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394187/gpu-sales-spike-by-20-percent-fueled-by-cryptocurrency-miners-and-laptop-sales.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">created a massive shortage of GPUs</a>. But crypto mining has even more disastrous implications for the environment, as astonishing amounts of electricity gets devoted to creating digital coins. After years of relative inaction from the US federal government, President Joe Biden is proposing a steep tax on energy used for crypto mining. </p>



<p>Biden laid out his plan this week in a direct proposal to American legislators. The DAME Act sounds like something that Sam Spade might write if he quit being a private eye and ran for Senate, but the odd acronym stands for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/&amp;xcust=2-2-1808666-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Asset Mining Energe excise tax</a>. Citing the environmental impact of electrical energy production as well as higher energy prices for everyone else, DAME&rsquo;s final result would be a massive 30 percent tax on the energy used for cryptocurrency mining. </p>



<p>&ldquo;Alongside these known costs and risks, cryptomining does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity,&rdquo; says the proposal. &ldquo;Instead, the energy is used to generate digital assets whose broader social benefits have yet to materialize.&rdquo; The post on the White House&rsquo;s official website cites a report from the US Energy Information Administration showing crypto mining taking up more kilowatt-hours than personal computers did in 2022, just behind televisions and lighting. Estimates for worldwide cryptocurrency energy production put it <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/environmental-cost-cryptocurrency-105210515.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMF-a_yJfN_gUcbBYRGANMKMiuqqpuHfwBTA0I6vtn4BWQSe_NPinYyUeNjmoww3AupMDaUAEVuPq_mftvclwhk-r_bhlsrcB8ns_X4aD3nrlpWa_q2g57ThtZodhwOdsuC4mOCFDmbM7UZRwzxaQCD84nW85zhYlmB2kjjapf9z&amp;xcust=2-2-1808666-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as high as 240 terawatt-hours per year</a> &mdash; about as much electricity as used by the entire country of Australia. </p>



<p>The DAME Act is not the first time that US government entities have attempted to directly legislate cryptocurrency mining, either to curb it or boost it. Though laws pertaining to crypto are still in their infancy, cryptocurrency can be considered either securities or commodities on the federal level, and is therefore subject to taxes based on its value in US dollars. Cryptocurrency exchanges are covered under the Bank Secrecy Act and other federal financial laws. One of the Biden administration&rsquo;s priorities has been creating a more comprehensive national policy on cryptocurrency regulation. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/cryptocurrency-laws-and-regulations-by-state/&amp;xcust=2-2-1808666-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to Bloomberg Law</a>, dozens of new bills addressing cryptocurrency have been introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate. </p>



<p>Some individual states are also engaging in the cryptocurrency market. A few have restricted their involvement to defining terms of currency transfer that allow them to engage with the regulatory framework, and some state courts have simply defined crypto exchanges as money transmissions under existing laws. Some have gone further: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/04/texas-bill-limiting-benefits-for-crypto-miners-unanimously-passes-committee-vote/&amp;xcust=2-2-1808666-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">In Texas</a>, where relatively low electricity costs have attracted cryptocurrency miners and crypto &ldquo;farms,&rdquo; the state Senate has proposed a bill that will allow the electrical grid operator to more closely regulate crypto miners&rsquo; activities and energy credits.</p>



<p>The impact of cryptocurrency production on the electrical grid has become an international issue. In addition to massive amounts of energy being legally converted into digital assets, without generating (as the White House puts it) &ldquo;the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity,&rdquo; illegal cryptocurrency farms have been discovered <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/609723/spanish-cops-searching-for-drugs-find-an-illegal-crypto-farm-instead.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">tapping into the electrical grid to steal power</a>, and botnets often try to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448894/sneaky-software-turns-your-pc-into-a-bitcoin-mining-zombie-and-owns-up-to-it-in-the-eula.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">siphon off computer power from infected PCs</a> for cryptocurrency mining. China and a few other countries have outlawed cryptocurrency exchanges, though more out of a desire to regulate money transfers than to curb electrical use. </p>



<p>Despite growing interest in cryptocurrency regulation, Biden&rsquo;s DAME Act has little chance of becoming federal law in the short term. With Republicans in control of the House of Representatives and Democrats in control of the Senate, both on razor-thin margins, passing any legislation at the moment is bitterly contentious. Impactful policy changes on this level will almost certainly have to wait until after the next election cycle in 2024, assuming one party or the other gains more complete control of the legislative and executive branches. </p>

<p>A few Thunderbolt docks trace their lineage to the Mac world, where direct Thunderbolt display connections are more common than the HDMI or DisplayPort ports of the Windows world. Satechi&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 Dock falls into this category, with three upstream Thunderbolt 4 connections in addition to a handful of USB connections. </p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a problem for a Windows laptop, though it&rsquo;s doubtful you already own a display with the correct Thunderbolt 4 connection. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need to match the ports on your monitor with an intermediary cable. That means purchasing an additional <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Premium-Aluminum-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B083KX4F6K/&amp;xcust=2-2-1788942-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">USB-C (Thunderbolt) to HDMI cable</a> or two, which will cost an extra $20 or so per cable. Alternatively, you could also <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1679616/thunderbolt-displays-are-tomorrows-laptop-docking-station.html">buy a Thunderbolt-equipped display</a>, though those are still relatively uncommon and expensive! </p>



<p>Either way, you&rsquo;ll likely be tacking a few extra dollars on top of the cost of Satechi&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 Dock, a choice which other docks don&rsquo;t force upon you. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://b2c-contenthub.com/article/817152/plugable-5-in-1-thunderbolt-hub-review.html?customize_changeset_uuid=f89e91ed-a0a1-441e-a15c-ecbe26d9e25a&amp;customize_theme=pcworld-com-child-theme&amp;xcust=2-1-817152-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/817152/plugable-5-in-1-thunderbolt-hub-review.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<p>Satechi&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 Dock measures 7.5 inches long by 3.5 inches deep, with no vertical stand or mounting option. A 135W power brick delivers power to the dock, which then passes 96W of power to your laptop via a 31-inch Thunderbolt 4 cord that ships inside the box. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve never run into a situation where a dock has overheated. Satechi&rsquo;s dock didn&rsquo;t break that trend, and the dock&rsquo;s aluminum and plastic chassis dissipated heat just fine. There&rsquo;s a small LED indicating when the device is powered on (white for power, yellow for powered and connected), but no power button.  </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Dock" class="wp-image-1790349" height="617" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Satechi-dock-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The front of the Satechi Thunderbolt  4 Dock, which scrimps a bit in terms of charging and SD card access.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Satechi&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 Dock mounts a UHS-II SD card reader on the front of the dock, without a microSD option. Next to it is a single USB 2.0 5Gbps port, with BC 1.2 charging, which can deliver up to 7.5W of power. Unfortunately, the dock passed only 3.8W, which will charge a smartphone slowly. (On the other hand, you can always plug your phone into a free Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear of the dock, which transferred a hefty 12.2W, enough to fast-charge a smartphone.) The front of the Satechi Dock also includes a headphone jack, plus the USB-C port for the cable connection to your laptop. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Satechi&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 Dock has too many quirks to make it a viable solution for most Windows PC users. We&rsquo;d advise you to look at one of our other Thunderbolt docks instead.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Two Kensington security-lock ports are mounted on the side of the dock. On the rear, Satechi includes three 10Gbps USB-A ports, none of which deliver any power at all. There&rsquo;s also a gigabit Ethernet port, the three upstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, and the power connector.</p>



<p>We chose to test the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Dock using a direct Thunderbolt connection to one 4K display, and an intermediary cable to another 4K display. Both took a few seconds to establish a connection, but did so. (We tried connecting to a third 1440p display using the third port, just to check, but the dock wouldn&rsquo;t establish a connection, which is fine.) We consider establishing the two 4K connections, however, to be the standard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Dock" class="wp-image-1790348" height="662" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Satechi-dock-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You&rsquo;ll have a few USB-A ports on the back of the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Dock to choose from, as well as three Thunderbolt 4 ports.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In our tests, we streamed 4K60 video from both online and offline sources, with very few dropped frames, including video played back from an external hard drive. We saw a few hiccups when playing back video from Netflix, and video streamed from Amazon Prime played back in a lower resolution than expected. After further tests, including a speed test that measured the performance of the dock&rsquo;s Ethernet port, we concluded that it was the ISP, not the dock, at fault.</p>



<p>We did find, however, that this Satechi dock will occasionally disconnect, randomly, perhaps twice a day. We also experienced the same thing with a second, different Satechi dock, so perhaps it&rsquo;s something with the internal design. It&rsquo;s an irritating annoyance, though not catastrophic: The attached displays simply disconnected for a second or so, then reconnected. Nothing else seemed to change. </p>



<p>What we&rsquo;ve come to find in our tests of both the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">best USB-C hubs and dongles</a> is that manufacturers aren&rsquo;t afraid to mix and match ports and features. At press time, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/817152/plugable-5-in-1-thunderbolt-hub-review.html">Plugable&rsquo;s 5-in-1 Thunderbolt Hub</a> was our pick for the best Thunderbolt hub&mdash;but it offers a lot less (for a lot less money) than the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Dock does. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind spending a bit more for additional features (and cables), Satechi&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 Dock is a decent pick. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll find slightly more affordable options in our dock roundup, with dedicated display ports that should match your existing monitor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I love a powerful laptop that can do it all. Whether it&rsquo;s gaming or office work, I appreciate a machine that allows me to easily switch gears at the drop of a hat. If you&rsquo;ve been shopping around for such a rig, you&rsquo;re in luck. Newegg&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*l6kYCuH720&amp;mid=44583&amp;ul=2-2-1808677-1-0-0&amp;murl=https://www.newegg.com/core-black-msi-gp-series-vector-gp76-12ue-270-gaming/p/N82E16834156191" rel="nofollow">MSI Vector GP76 for $1,259</a>, which is a whopping $540 off of the original price. This machine features powerful components as well as a giant display with a high refresh rate. Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>



<p>The Vector is packing an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s enough oomph for streaming video, playing most games on higher graphics settings, and handling almost any work task you can throw at it. The 17.3-inch display is huge with a ridiculously high refresh rate of 360Hz, a resolution of 1920&times;1080, and a response time of 3ms. If you&rsquo;re playing a competitive game where every second matters, then visuals should be nice and smooth. </p>



<p>This is a killer deal. It&rsquo;s so killer, in fact, that we don&rsquo;t expect it to last very long.</p>

## You won’t need a password to use Dashlane’s password manager

<p>The passwordless future is here, one in which you don&rsquo;t need to slap long strings of random characters into a form for account access (much less remember them). Well&mdash;kind of, as it&rsquo;s still early days. Companies are moving toward a reality of logging in with just a phone and a safeguard like a fingerprint or a PIN, though. In that spirit, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dashlane.com/blog/dashlane-passwordless&amp;xcust=2-2-1808372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dashlane announced on Wednesday</a> it will begin allowing users to ditch their master passwords.</p>



<p>New users will likely see this option first in Dashlane&rsquo;s password manager. According to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230502006222/en/Dashlane-Introduces-Passwordless-Login&amp;xcust=2-2-1808372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">press release</a>, the expected launch for new users is happening in the &ldquo;coming months&rdquo; on mobile. Meanwhile, this password alternative will reach existing users &ldquo;later this year.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Dashlane already <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dashlane.com/blog/ushering-in-the-passwordless-future-at-dashlane&amp;xcust=2-2-1808372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">began supporting storage of passkeys</a> last summer, but that form of passwordless authentication won&rsquo;t be powering the new login method. In an interview with The Verge, Dashlane&rsquo;s chief product officer described passkeys as not &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23708302/dashlane-passwordless-login-no-master-password-passkey&amp;xcust=2-2-1808372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">quite ready</a>,&rdquo; with the CEO sharing concerns about passkeys and difficulty moving between different operating systems. So despite Apple, Google, and Microsoft backing and promoting passkeys&mdash;and rival 1Password&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-with-passkeys/&amp;xcust=2-2-1808372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">upoming implementation of passkey login this summer</a>&mdash;Dashlane is striking out on its own with its password-free login.</p>

<p>The Passwordless Login process looks a lot like passkeys, however. While on your phone or tablet, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to initiate the login with a PIN or biometrics (e.g., facial identification or a fingerprint). An secure exchange of encryption keys takes place between your device and the Dashlane servers, and then you&rsquo;re in. It&rsquo;s a form of authentication that shields more effectively against phishing and the use of easily guessed credentials.</p>



<p>Dashlane also plans to offer protection against account lockouts if you lose your authenticating device. You can regain access from another authenticated device, or through use of a recovery key if you don&rsquo;t have one.</p>



<p>This week saw <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806627/rip-passwords-google-accounts-now-support-passkeys.html">Google add a passwordless login to its accounts</a> as well&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t have to wait for it. Launched on Wednesday, passkey support is available now (and you can use our instructions for how to set it up). But don&rsquo;t count the humble password out just yet. Until passkeys and other similar methods become widespread, passwords still require your attention and maintenance. Our easy tips for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/696828/">upping your online security</a> can simplify that job, though.</p>

<p>Bad console ports aren&rsquo;t the only indignity PC gamers are suffering right now. A subset of <em>Call of Duty</em> players found that the Season 3 patch for <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> and <em>Warzone 2</em> broke those games completely, with AMD Vega-based graphics card owners (including people on APUs with integrated graphics) left out in the cold. In desperation, one such affected gamer even sent <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/cods-season-3-update-broke-the-game-for-a-bunch-of-players-and-theyre-so-upset-one-sent-the-devs-a-pizza/&amp;xcust=2-3-1805943-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a pizza to the developers&rsquo; office</a> with the message &ldquo;Help Vega please.&rdquo;</p>



<p>You can only imagine what that person was thinking when crossing the line of normal communication. Possibly: <em>Maybe if I feed them, they will have the energy to fix the game for us</em>. Poor Vega owners&mdash;they were a loyal minority when AMD was still working on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393729/amd-radeon-rx-6800-rx-6800-xt-review.html">its return to fighting shape</a>, and this is their thanks.</p>



<p>Speaking of graphics cards, hardware hasn&rsquo;t been so fun to navigate over the past few years, either. First came the pandemic squeeze, in which the miners swooped in and bought up most everything, causing short supply and astronomical street prices. Then when availability improved, suggested retail prices didn&rsquo;t. If you were formerly a mid-tier graphics card buyer, what you&rsquo;ll pay now for GPUs is much higher than before, even accounting for inflation. </p>



<p>Three generations ago, Nvidia&rsquo;s 70-class cards cost less than $400&mdash;the GeForce GTX 1070 was $379 in 2016 (about <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm&amp;xcust=2-3-1805943-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$475 in today&rsquo;s dollars</a>). But the current GeForce RTX 4070 is an eye-watering $600 at list price, or 26 percent more than the inflation-adjusted price of the 1070. And as we all know, inflation has been wild over the last year. Had it stayed more normal, the jump in MSRP would be even bigger.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>So if your budget hasn&rsquo;t increased with time, you have to drop down to a lower class of graphics cards when upgrading. Well, maybe. If you can afford more than $200, you have options, as you can see in our recommendations for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">the best graphics cards</a>. But under $200? Well, your main choices are an old graphics card, or hopping over to the console side of the fence. Our resident graphics card guru and bossman Brad Chacos recently snagged a deal on an Xbox Series S for $150.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a whole gaming machine for less than the cost of a graphics card, with less likelihood of running into annoying performance issues in games. Which&hellip;sucks. The best you can do is find catharsis in hearing other people voice your own frustrations with the situation. Which, for the record, the PCWorld staff does in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2mCajQb2jc&amp;xcust=2-3-1805943-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a recent episode of The Full Nerd</a>. One of the things discussed: Sony as a central figure in the bad ports.</p>



<p>Given my recent return to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1516001/why-i-switched-from-pc-gaming-to-console-gaming.html">console gaming</a>, I&rsquo;m insulated from a lot of these issues. About all I use my PC for these days is playing <em>Overwatch 2</em> with friends, and that game can run on a potato. (Possibly literally&mdash;while working on another article, I found that <em>OW2</em> sort of works on five year old basic integrated graphics, so&hellip;) But I&rsquo;m not smug or gleeful about it. After the pandemic years, these circumstances are difficult to watch, and must be an even harder pill to swallow.</p>

## Slack GPT will bring AI chatbots to your conversations

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Slack has become the latest developer to commit to integrating AI inside of its platform, with a new Slack GPT integration that will use chatbots as your own personal business assistants. But Slack GPT also highlights another AI quirk that may fly under the radar: its short-term attention span.</p>



<p>In March, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1534320/several-bots-will-be-typing-on-chatgpt-for-slack.html">Salesforce&rsquo;s Slack division announced a ChatGPT app</a>, allowing the OpenAI chatbot to be pulled into the Slack conversational interface. Now, Slack is expanding that: Slack GPT will support ChatGPT, the Claude chatbot, and Slack&rsquo;s own eventual Einstein GPT chatbot as well.</p>



<p>Slack&rsquo;s taking a simple approach. To avoid forcing users to scroll back through reams of chat text (say, after returning from vacation) Slack GPT will simply summarize it all for you. Slack&rsquo;s vision involves using AI to &ldquo;take notes&rdquo; and summarize the next steps to take after a conversation. Slack&rsquo;s Native Assisted Writing is also taking pages from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424421/ai-text-generation-is-moving-mainstream.html">Canva&rsquo;s Magic Write</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661649/forget-bing-microsoft-365-copilot-looks-like-ais-killer-app.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot</a> and providing a way to draft an email to follow up with a client or sales lead &mdash; even automating the process when a new Salesforce CRM lead triggers a response.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the future Slack sees for itself. Einstein GPT will be a sales-optimized AI, so that it be less focused on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html">crafting original <em>Seinfeld</em> dialogue</a> and more designed around closing a potential deal. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Slack Slack GPT AI Summary" class="wp-image-1807487" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AI-Generated-Summaries.gif?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Slack&rsquo;s Slack GPT in action, summarizing a conversation.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Salesforce / Slack</p></div>



<p>Slack is using AI for immediate action, though, which is what we&rsquo;ve been using AI for, today. The problem is what Slack users may want AI to help with, though &mdash; and what it will be unable to do.</p>



<h2 id="dont-forget-about-ais-short-term-memory">Don&rsquo;t forget about AI&rsquo;s short-term memory</h2>



<p>AI&rsquo;s weaknesses are more than just &ldquo;hallucinations&rdquo; of made-up data. Because of the immense computational complexity of AI interactions, most AI &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; eventually fizzle out. Bing, for example, caps conversations at 20 interactions before the conversation is &ldquo;wiped&rdquo; and the user must start over. ChatGPT has similar limitations, though they&rsquo;re not as sharply defined. Eventually, however, the AI &ldquo;forgets&rdquo; some or all of what is being discussed.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s immensely annoying when Slack chats or Outlook emails quietly disappear because an organization doesn&rsquo;t want to store an old email or chat because of cost or legal reasons. But it&rsquo;s immediately obvious when an email disappears, because it simply vanishes. What an AI won&rsquo;t tell you is the entirety of what it&rsquo;s summarizing or providing advice upon. </p>



<p>The problem is that Slack can&rsquo;t tell you either. &ldquo;The range of interactions [Slack GPT] can access will vary by use case and what type of information is most appropriate to complete the task at hand,&rdquo; Slack said in a statement provided by a company representative. &ldquo;This is something we&rsquo;ll be continually evaluating as we integrate generative AI natively into Slack.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Slack Slack GPT AI Writing" class="wp-image-1807486" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AI-Assisted-Writing.gif?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Slack GPT can also be used to write with AI.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Salesforce / Slack</p></div>



<p>That may mean that Slack might be able to <em>summarize</em> months of chats, but it won&rsquo;t be able to keep up the <em>conversation</em> about them without forgetting something that you told it a while ago. It&rsquo;s like needing to remind colleagues again and again of what you previously agreed upon.</p>



<p>According to Slack, ChatGPT developer OpenAI&rsquo;s API policy allows for a maximum retention of thirty days. That means that an AI conversation around a months-long project might only be &ldquo;known&rdquo; by ChatGPT for thirty days, max. Other app providers will have their own rules, Slack says, including Einstein GPT.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are still in early days building out our strategy for native generative AI,&rdquo; Slack added. &ldquo;As with any generative AI, best practice is providing targeted queries that yield higher quality answers, which is top of mind.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be amazed at what AI can do. But as more and more companies start to build in AI into their software, we may rely on it more and more. The problem is that your memory goes back decades. AI doesn&rsquo;t, and right now you can&rsquo;t depend on it to do so.</p>

## Razer Blade 16 review: An absolute powerhouse with a dual-mode display

</div>


<p>The Razer Blade 16 disguises an embarrassment of gaming riches inside an unassuming enclosure. It boasts the latest and greatest tech from Intel and Nvidia and is one of the most powerful laptops we&rsquo;ve ever tested. It&rsquo;s also the first to feature a dual-mode, mini-LED display that acts as either a native 4K panel at 120Hz or a native 1080p panel at 240Hz, giving you the ability to play richly textured games at high detail while also running eSports titles and twitchy shooters at a blazing refresh rate. And you get all of this gaming goodness in Razer&rsquo;s typical solid, unibody chassis.</p>



<p>When you are not gaming, the 16-inch, 16:10 display at 4K provides a huge, high-res canvas for content creation. It looks and feels much larger than the previous Razer Blade 15 that has a 15.6-inch display with a wider 16:9 screen ratio. It&rsquo;s a pound heavier than its 15-inch predecessor, but it&rsquo;s still not a hulking gaming laptop. The sophisticated design and roomy display lets the Razer Blade 16 double as a primary work laptop for graphics pros in addition to being a ripping mobile gaming rig. If viewed as two laptops in one, perhaps then you can begin to stomach its sky-high price.</p>

<h2 id="razer-blade-16-specs-and-features">Razer Blade 16: Specs and features</h2>



<p>Are you sitting down? We ask you to remain seated while we tell you the price of our Razer Blade 16 test system. Ready? It costs $4,299.99 from Razer and features the following specs.</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i9-13950HX</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 32GB</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> 16-inch UHD+ (3840 x 2400) 120Hz / FHD+ (1920 x 1200) 240Hz</li><li><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p with physical privacy shutter</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Thunderbolt 4 USB Type-C, USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, 3 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, combo audio jack, SD card reader</li><li><strong>Networking:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</li><li><strong>Biometrics:</strong> IR webcam</li><li><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> 95 Watt-hours</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.61 x 13.98x 0.87 inches</li><li><strong>Measured weight:</strong> 5.52 pounds (power brick weighs 2.0 pounds)</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: $4,299.99</li></ul>



<p>Our Razer Blade 16 test system is the flagship model, and there are less expensive models if your laptop budget doesn&rsquo;t extend past $4,000. The line starts at $2,700 for a system with RTX 4060 graphics and the same Core i9-13950HX CPU as our test system. It lacks the dual-mode, mini-LED display, however, but its panel offers the high resolution (2560 x 1600) and fast refresh rate (240Hz) that&rsquo;s split across both modes of our test model. In between these two models that bookend the line are three models that feature either RTX 4070 or RTX 4080 graphics, one of which boasts the dual-mode, mini-LED screen.</p>



<h2 id="razer-blade-16-design-keyboard-trackpad">Razer Blade 16:  Design, keyboard, trackpad</h2>



<p>Razer has established its own minimalist design aesthetic, one that stands in stark contrast to many gaming laptops that use aggressive graphics, giant logos, and huge vents to draw attention. Razer&rsquo;s confident design approach doesn&rsquo;t seek your attention, but it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the Blade 16. It&rsquo;s a matte-black slab of beauty. The chassis is made from T6 anodized aluminum, and it feels rock solid. There is little to no flex on the keyboard deck and lid protecting the display.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 lid" class="wp-image-1801796" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-lid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The laptop weighs 5.52 pounds, which is about average for a 16-inch 16:10 laptop but 1.1 pounds heavier than the 15.6-inch 16:9 Blade 15. Two other 16-inch 16:10 models&mdash;the 5.29-pound Acer Predator Triton 500 SE and the 5.44-pound HP Victus 16&mdash;weigh a bit less.</p>



<p>The only logo you&rsquo;ll find on the entire enclosure is Razer&rsquo;s triple-snake badge on the center of the lid. When seated in front of the Blade 16, you wouldn&rsquo;t know which brand of laptop you are using. That&rsquo;s what I mean by a confident design approach. Only Razer does this, so you would almost assuredly say &ldquo;Razer&rdquo; if you were forced to hazard a guess as to the maker of this understated, minimalist, matte-black laptop. The only items that interrupt the sea of black are a pair of small stickers for THX Spatial Audio and Intel Core i9 on the front-right corner of the keyboard deck.</p>



<p>I have only two small issues with the Blade 16&rsquo;s chassis. For one, it&rsquo;s a fingerprint magnet. The matte finish attracts prints and oils and is hard to wipe clean. It&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer for such an expensive, otherwise exceedingly attractive laptop. For another, the cutout on the front edge of the keyboard deck is too narrow, which makes opening the lid a bit more difficult than it should be. More often than not, I needed to employ a fingernail to lift the lid.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 keyboard" class="wp-image-1801797" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Mechanical keyboards have shown up on some premium gaming laptops recently, including the Alienware x17 R2 and MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V that have mechanical keyboards with Cherry MX switches. And while the Blade 16 definitely qualifies as &ldquo;premium,&rdquo; it features a standard laptop membrane keyboard. The keys feel firm and responsive but lack the deep travel and tactile feedback of mechanical switches that many gamers appreciate. It is an anti-ghosting keyboard that supports six simultaneous key presses, however, so it should allow you to keep up with the action.</p>



<p>Following Razer&rsquo;s streamlined design approach, the Blade 16 lacks a number pad. I like having the keyboard centered below the display and don&rsquo;t miss the numpad. And with per-key RGB lighting, you can always highlight the keys needed for gaming if you find yourself losing your positioning on the keyboard. There is no other RGB lighting outside of the keyboard. At first glance, I thought the logo on the laptop&rsquo;s lid was illuminated, but it&rsquo;s just painted in green.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 touchpad" class="wp-image-1801798" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-touchpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The touchpad is enormous. I mean, it&rsquo;s absolutely huge. And a joy to use. It accurately recorded my swipes, pinches and other gestures and offers a soft click response with the perfect amount of travel. It also does an admirable job with palm rejection and never accidentally moved the cursor when I was typing even though it covers a vast swath of the wrist rest.</p>



<h2 id="razer-blade-16-display-ports">Razer Blade 16: Display, ports</h2>



<p>The Blade 16 offers two mini-LED displays in one. You get a native 3840 x 2400 panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and a native 1920&times;1200 panel with a 240Hz refresh rate. This dual-mode arrangement lets you play twitchy shooters at a blazing 240Hz at a 1080p resolution and richly textured games in glorious 4K. You are able to change between the two modes with the Razer&nbsp;</p>



<p>Synapse app. Switching between the two modes, however, requires a reboot so you can&rsquo;t switch back and forth without stopping what you are doing, closing all your open apps, and restarting the machine.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 display" class="wp-image-1801800" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Games look fabulous in either mode on the 16-inch 16:10 panel. And the extra vertical space compared with a widescreen 16:9 display offers added room for multitaskers to juggle multiple windows when not gaming. And in 4K mode, the panel offers graphics pros a large, high-res canvas on which to work. The display is rated for 1,000 nits and, thus, supports HDR1000. It also can display 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. The display is certainly bright, and colors appeared accurate and vibrant, but my own display testing with a lux meter resulted in readings a fair bit lower than the 1,000-nit rating. It hit a maximum of 630 nits in 4K mode and 540 nits at 1080p.</p>



<p>It would be laughable if a $4,000+ laptop served up a paltry 720p webcam, but that&rsquo;s not the case with the Blade 16. It features a modern 1080p camera that produces images and video that&rsquo;s worlds better than that of a 720p cam. It also features a physical privacy shutter so you can rest assured no one is peeping you when the webcam isn&rsquo;t in use.</p>



<p>The Blade 16 also boasts premium audio output. The large chassis allows room for not two but four speakers&mdash;two tweeters and two subs. The tweeters fire upward from behind speaker grills that flank the keyboard, while the subs fire downward from underneath each side of the system. Their sound is dynamic; I heard separation between the highs and mids, and the bass response is surprisingly full. The Blade 16 is the rare laptop where you don&rsquo;t need headphones or an external speaker to enjoy music playback. And there&rsquo;s enough oomph to fill a small room, and the sound remains free of distortion at maximum volume.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 ports" class="wp-image-1801803" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The port selection covers both types of USB ports so you don&rsquo;t need to carry around an adapter, and one of the USB-C ports offers Thunderbolt 4 support. There&rsquo;s also an HDMI port, which makes for an easy connection to an external display if you find the Blade 16&rsquo;s screen isn&rsquo;t big enough for some games. And graphics pros will appreciate the inclusion of an SD card reader for easy data transfers. Lastly, the Blade 16 offers the latest wireless networking standards with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>



<h2 id="razer-blade-16-performance">Razer Blade 16: Performance</h2>



<p>Our Razer Blade 16&nbsp; test system features a Core i9-13950HX CPU and GeForce RTX 4090 graphics. The 13th-gen Core i9-13950HX features Intel&rsquo;s hybrid architecture with performance and efficiency cores; it has eight performance cores, 16 efficiency cores, and a total of 32 processing threads. The RTX 4090 is Nvidia&rsquo;s current flagship mobile GPU. The laptop also supplies an ample 32GB of RAM and a roomy 2TB SSD.</p>



<p>The Blade 16 got off to a bit of a slow start with testing. On PCMark 10, it trailed other high-end gaming laptops with 12th- and 13th-gen Intel Core i7 and i9 processors. Still, with a PCMark 10 score north of 7,000, it will be able to handle productivity tasks without breaking a sweat.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 PCMark 10" class="wp-image-1801805" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-PCMark-10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The Blade 16 moved up the chart on HandBrake, besting both systems with 12th-gen Core i7 chips. It still was last among its 13th-gen Intel competition.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1801807" height="618" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-HandBrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. It&rsquo;s not surprising that the Blade 16 bested the three systems with 12th-gen Intel processors, but we were a bit shocked to see it trail the MSI Titan GT 77 HX 13V and Asus ROG Strix G that feature the nearly identical Core i9-13980HX CPU by as much as it did.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 Cinebench" class="wp-image-1801810" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-Cinebench-R20.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="899" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 id="razer-blade-16-graphics-performance">Razer Blade 16: Graphics performance</h2>



<p>We now get to the headlining tests that target the Blade 16&rsquo;s RTX 4090 GPU. On 3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy and Port Royal tests, the Blade 16 posted insanely high scores, but it should be noted that both were a step or two behind the RTX 4090-based MSI Titan GT 77.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 Time Spy" class="wp-image-1801814" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-3DM-Time-Spy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="897" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 Port Royal" class="wp-image-1801816" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-3DM-Port-Royal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="906" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>On our real world game benchmarks, the Blade 16 did exceedingly well. It took top honors on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Running at 1920&times;1080 resolution at the Highest quality preset, the Strix G18 averaged an impressive 170 fps. That&rsquo;s 10 fps better than the MSI Titan GT 77. The Blade 16 and MSI Titan GT 77 traded spots on Metro Exodus, with the Blade 16 averaging 76 fps to the MSI&rsquo;s 88 fps. Both were clearly superior to the three laptops with RTX 3080 Ti graphics as well as the RTX 4070-based Asus ROG Strix G18.</p>



<p>One last note on 3D graphics and gaming&mdash;the Blade 16 gets loud under heavy loads. Keeping thermals in check for the high-powered Core i9 CPU and RTX 4090 requires the cooling fans to crank up to a pretty good level of volume, but it&rsquo;s not any louder than the typical gaming laptop. Thankfully, its speakers are loud enough to drown out the fan noise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. The Blade 16 lasted more than 7 hours, which would be a bit below average for a regular laptop but is outstanding among the high-powered gaming set.</p>

<h2 id="razer-blade-16-conclusion">Razer Blade 16: Conclusion</h2>



<p>Bleeding edge technology never comes cheap, and the Razer Blade 16 is certainly proof of that. But its $4,300 price tag begins to look a bit more reasonable (less unreasonable?) when you consider the similarly configured MSI Titan GT 77 HX 13V costs $5,300&mdash;a cool grand more than the Blade 16. And while the Blade 16 was a step behind the MSI on most of our tests, it&rsquo;s still one of the most powerful laptops we&rsquo;ve ever tested while also boasting a better design. If you are going to spend this much on a gaming laptop, I&rsquo;d argue it had better look the part in addition to acting the part. The Razer Blade 16 offers one of the coolest designs among gaming laptops. And the mini-LED, dual-mode display provides stellar performance and added versatility to help you digest the hefty price.</p>

<p>Many arbitrary holidays exist (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/tin-can-day/&amp;xcust=2-1-696828-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tin Can Day</a>, anyone?) but World Password Day is one that the PCWorld Staff fully supports. We&rsquo;re all for ditching weak passwords&mdash;especially when shoring up your security takes only a little effort.</p>



<p>Follow these four easy suggestions and you&rsquo;ll thank yourself for years to come. Not only will data breaches and hackers stop being immediate threats, but you won&rsquo;t have to scramble to remember a collection of user name and passwords. Plus, a new form of account protection is starting to roll out, and it&rsquo;s even simpler than passwords.</p>



<p>And trust us, you want to safeguard yourself. Data breaches are common these days, and if Bitwarden&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ARiP0NzPRVEEKTJoNZHJGx6rZhTVBwiPFUp6Rb_pnIw/edit#slide=id.g232aeb7ad4e_0_22&amp;xcust=2-1-696828-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">latest survey results</a> are any indication, an unhealthy majority of people reuse passwords (85 percent among their respondents) and a notable amount still use a variant of &ldquo;password&rdquo; (19 percent). Oof.</p>

<p>Password managers make better account security so easy. You only have to memorize only one strong password to safeguard all your other login info. (Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393960/how-to-pick-the-perfect-password.html#toc-3">how to come up with a good master password</a>.)</p>



<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t have an issue finding a password manager that suits you, either&mdash;it&rsquo;s perfectly normal <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html">to have reservations about them</a>, but there are so many options out there. Want something that integrates seamlessly with your phone or browser? Google, Apple, and Firefox&rsquo;s password managers are basic but solid. Hate the idea of all your passwords sitting in the cloud? Try KeePass or one of its variants. Need support for advanced two-factor authentication methods, like a YubiKey? Many paid services include it. Password managers are also expanding their services to include support for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806627/rip-passwords-google-accounts-now-support-passkeys.html">passkeys</a>, a simpler yet more secure method of account protection.</p>



<p>Paying for a good solution isn&rsquo;t always necessary, however, as you&rsquo;ll see when going over our lists of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">best paid password managers</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394076/best-free-password-managers.html">best free password managers</a>. The kinds of features that unlock when paying for services are helpful indeed, especially if you&rsquo;re using multiple devices or want to secure the passwords of multiple people, but they don&rsquo;t tend to be absolutely vital otherwise. That said, our go-to solution&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407081/dashlane-password-manager-review.html">Dashlane</a>&mdash;makes managing passwords dead simple and only costs $33 per year, or $2.75 per month. It&rsquo;s money well spent for the added security (and the extra polish).</p>



<p>And don&rsquo;t worry if you try one service and don&rsquo;t like it. Exporting and importing password databases is simple.</p>



<h2 id="use-strong-unique-passwords-for-everything">Use strong, unique passwords for everything</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="table showing how fast a password can be cracked" class="wp-image-696843" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/terahash-brutalis-hash-combo-100878058-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Companies like Terahash can combine several hundred GPUs to crack short passwords&nbsp;instantly. This chart shows how longer passwords can make the process impossibly long, even with such computing power on hand.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Terahash / Twitter</p></div>



<p>Even websites that barely register in your memory deserve a strong, unique password. If you&rsquo;ve left behind traces of personal information&mdash;or financial information, like stored credit card info&mdash;unauthorized access to your account could lead to future headaches.</p>



<p>Normally, remembering a strong, random, and unique password for <em>every </em>place you visit on the internet would be a pain in the rear. These days, it seems like everything requires a login. But with a password manager (which of course you&rsquo;ve just set up!), you no longer have that responsibility. So long as you have the browser extension or app installed on your phone, you can let it choose a password for you. Just tell it how many characters in length and what mix of them. (Security experts currently recommend 24 characters in length, randomly generated with numbers, letters, and special characters.) The fun part is that because you don&rsquo;t have to memorize each password yourself, long and complex strings aren&rsquo;t a hassle.</p>



<p>If you want to <em>really </em>level up your login security, you can also use strong, unique user names, too. With a password manager tracking everything, being randominternetuser13960 on one site, ithurtstomove4582 on another, and pizzadaze2259 on a third is a cinch. Have to use an email address for your login? Gmail and some other email providers let you create aliases by adding a plus sign (+) and phrase after your account name. So for example, you could use emailaddress+likesbooks@gmail.com to distinguish that particular site.</p>



<h2 id="enable-two-factor-authentication-too">Enable two-factor authentication, too</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="iOS 2FA SMS" class="wp-image-630248" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ios-2fa-sms.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security while logging in.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p>We hate to say it, but these days, strong passwords alone aren&rsquo;t enough to ward off threats. Data breaches happen, and so do moments of being caught off-guard by phishing attempts.</p>



<p>Two-factor authentication adds another layer to your login process. Instead of having immediate access to your account upon entering your user name and password, you&rsquo;ll have to input more information and pass another security check before access is granted. (You can read more about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403535/two-factor-authentication-faq-sms-authenticator-security-key-icloud.html">how 2FA works</a> in our explainer, which also gives more details on the common forms available.)</p>



<p>Like using a password manager, two-factor authentication doesn&rsquo;t have to be a cumbersome addition to your login process. Apps like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://authy.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-696828-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Authy</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://getaegis.app/&amp;xcust=2-1-696828-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Aegis</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://raivo-otp.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-696828-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ravio</a> make accessing your 2FA codes on multiple devices simple, and support easy security measures like biometric authentication to protect those codes from prying eyes.</p>



<p>We of course recommend enabling two-factor authentication on as many accounts as possible, but at minimum, do it for major accounts like email and financial services&mdash;places with info that could wreak havoc on your life if someone else got unauthorized access. Also consider protecting your Amazon, social media, Steam, and work accounts (and their info ripe for use in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)&amp;xcust=2-1-696828-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">social engineering</a>) in this way, too.</p>



<p>For sites that don&rsquo;t have two-factor authentication&mdash;which sadly includes a large number of e-commerce sites&mdash;you can help limit damage from unauthorized account access by not leaving your credit card information or address on file.</p>



<h2 id="use-a-passkey">Use a passkey</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google concept illustration for passkeys" class="wp-image-1807522" height="425" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/key-visual.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Most people will probably use a phone for their passkey storage, but they work with Windows PCs, Apple hardware, and security keys, too.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>This may be a bit novel for most people to use just yet, but there&rsquo;s new form of account authentication is here and finally spreading out into the vast wild. They&rsquo;re called passkeys, and they cut out a lot of the hassle of using passwords&hellip;while also providing strong security out the gate.</p>



<p>You just need a device like a phone or a tablet to serve as an authenticator. It&rsquo;ll be registered to your account when you generate the passkey. Afterward, you&rsquo;ll get prompts on the device to authorize logins, which you&rsquo;ll approve using face identification, a fingerprint, or a PIN. It&rsquo;s incredibly simple, and more importantly, passkeys are more resistant to the current effects of data breaches. Because they are an asymmetrical form of encryption, a hacker can&rsquo;t guess at your passkey based on the compromised website&rsquo;s encrypted login data. Only you have the other part of the puzzle, and it&rsquo;s a different kind of piece than the part saved to your website account.</p>



<p>You can read more about passkeys in our coverage of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806627/rip-passwords-google-accounts-now-support-passkeys.html">Google&rsquo;s recent launch of passkey support</a> for its accounts (as well as in Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys&amp;xcust=2-1-1806627-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806627/rip-passwords-google-accounts-now-support-passkeys.html">own excellent overview</a> of the topic), but basically, this is the future of online security. It eliminates the hassles of passwords, along with the pressing need for two-factor authentication, and should make protecting your accounts <em>much</em> easier. Especially since password managers will soon start allowing you to save your passkeys to a vault, making them as flexible and accessible as passwords.</p>
