Microsoft is also massively upgrading Bing Chat with lots of new features and even plug-in support.</p>\n<p id=\"CESRgS\">This open preview launch comes nearly two months after Microsoft experimented with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23641683/microsoft-bing-ai-gpt-4-chatbot-available-no-waitlist\">removing the waitlist</a> for its new Bing Chat feature.
