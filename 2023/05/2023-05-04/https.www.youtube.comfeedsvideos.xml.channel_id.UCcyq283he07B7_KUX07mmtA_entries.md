Sgt. 1st Class Jacob Braun breaks down every piece of gear a US Army Ranger would carry in their aviator kit bag during a night-raid mission. The bag includes protective gear, ammunition, and a Samsung Galaxy phone. Braun explains why each item is integral to a Ranger's mission. According to the Army, Rangers are the branch's "premier special operations light infantry raid force."

According to Braun, Rangers specialize in infiltrating enemy territory, completing their objective, and rapidly withdrawing, often at night. The Army's 75th Ranger Regiment is headquartered at Fort Benning, Georgia (soon to be renamed Fort Moore).
