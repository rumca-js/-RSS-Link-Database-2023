## Ed Sheeran: Subtract review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>Atlantic Records</strong><br />Grief and his wife’s brush with cancer inspired Sheeran to make this insular record with Aaron Dessner of the National. It’s downcast yet full of new ideas – but will fans take to it?</p><p>E<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran">d Sheeran</a> famously keeps one eye on the numbers. A decade ago, he established his trademark, a pop take on the sensitive singer-songwriter trope with a healthy relationship to rap and R&amp;B that has allowed him to flit across genres, imposing his indelible style on everything from Afrobeats to Eminem and Bring Me the Horizon collaborations. It’s the smartest thing a pop star could do at the dawn of the streaming age, where success is tied to your ability to feature on as many genre-themed playlists as possible – a strategy borne out by Sheeran’s 150m record sales – but also proof of fairly absurd talent: if it was that easy, everyone would be doing it. Under the circumstances, it’s hard not to be impressed by how wholeheartedly Sheeran has thrown himself into his fifth album, Subtract, a noticeably different prospect to previous albums.</p><p>He has not merely tapped Aaron Dessner of US indie band the National and co-producer of Taylor Swift’s folksy lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore to produce; he’s also eschewed his usual songwriting collaborators. Intriguingly, their absence hasn’t affected Sheeran’s commercial melodic facility: Colourblind seems as likely to soundtrack wedding first dances as Perfect or Thinking Out Loud; Curtains and Spark land their hooks quickly; the tune of Sycamore is disarmingly lovely. You even wonder if the songwriters-for-hire were holding him back: by far the least memorable song is the one pop super-producer Max Martin had a hand in, the underwhelming Eyes Closed; it’s conspicuously better when Sheeran tries something different, like the gorgeous, Beatles-y middle eight of Dusty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/ed-sheeran-subtract-review-easily-his-best-ever-album">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>St George’s, Bristol<br /></strong>The combination of musical curiosity, exceptional playing and Zen-like atmosphere made for an electrifying start to this eight-concert tour</p><p>This collaboration between <a href="https://manchestercollective.co.uk/bio">Manchester Collective</a> and guitarist <a href="https://seanshibe.com/">Sean Shibe </a>promised to be electrifying and so it was: boundary-pushing and genre-defying being fundamental to both their approaches, all achieved with unassuming flair. In this first outing of their <a href="https://manchestercollective.co.uk/rosewood">eight-concert tour</a>, the transatlantic programming was an invitation to the audience to be as curious about the nature and power of sound as they themselves clearly are. By way of acclimatisation, the Collective’s artistic director violinist Rakhi Singh and Shibe on electric guitar began with two of John Cage’s Six Melodies, the almost folk-like simplicity of the instruments’ responses to each other played out in an infinite variety of ways, with the remaining two pairs of melodies interlaced into the overall sequence as though offering periodic Zen zoning-out.</p><p><a href="https://www.universaledition.com/david-fennessy-4082">David Fennessy</a>’s Rosewood was named for the aromatic wood used to fashion guitar fingerboards, but has also given its title to this tour and its meditative theme. Originally a solo piece performed by Shibe’s teacher Allan Neave, Fennessy rejigged it for Shibe as the plural Rosewoods with string quartet – as the collective’s practice – all close-mic’d, but blending carefully with the acoustic guitar. The sequence of five reflections on light and, within it, moments of poised silence had a captivating quality, particularly its central movement with gentle guitar figurations. At the end came a radiant calm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/04/manchester-collective-sean-shibe-rosewood-review-st-georges-bristol">Continue reading...</a>

It will not make Charles III the king. He is that already. He became king when his mother died last year, and after a smoothly performed and sensibly low-key accession process. The line of succession is also firmly set.</p><p>Nor will the coronation make any difference to the king’s ability to carry out his constitutional role as Britain’s head of state. It will confer no new power on him.

<p>In the race to create the new Instagram, rivals morph into each other, losing what makes them special in the first place</p><p>Technology writers are sadly (some gleefully) announcing the latest admission to the social media morgue: the formerly ascendant photo-sharing app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bereal-your-friends-for-real/id1459645446">BeReal</a>.</p><p>The app had been a huge success, jumping from 1m to 20m users in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/10/bereal-tops-53m-installs-but-only-9-open-the-app-daily-estimates-claim/">just seven months</a>. Central to its success was its positioning as the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bereal-doomed-online-authenticity/">anti-Instagram</a>, a platform trading on authenticity that offered a glimpse of our friends’ “real” (read: mundane) lives. But its active daily users <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/bereal-social-media-cultural-shift">more than halved</a> between October 2022 and March 2023, down from 20m to 6m. Its expected demise not only forces us to ask how “authentic” a photo-sharing app can ever be, but whether we actually want the authenticity it sells.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/04/bereal-instagram-social-media-apps-fail">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Insula Orchestra/Equilbey (Erato, two CDs)</strong> <br />Laurence Equilbey and her orchestra champion compatriot Louise Farrenc’s orchestral works, revealing energy and verve to rival her 19th-century peers </p><p>L<a href="https://www.musicbywomen.org/composer/louise-farrenc/">ouise Farrenc</a> was born in 1804, just a few years before Schumann and Mendelssohn, and her music inhabits the same early Romantic world as theirs, with its roots particularly in Beethoven and sometimes indebted also to Weber. Farrenc lived and studied in Paris, where her piano teachers included Hummel and Moscheles; she went on to have a successful career as a pianist, and became a professor of piano at the Paris Conservatoire – the institution’s only female professor in the whole of the 19th century – but at that time women were unable to study composition there, and so from the age of 15 she took lessons privately with Anton Reicha.</p><p>Musical life in Paris in the 1830s and 40s was dominated by opera. Symphonic concerts were rare, not only because the symphony itself was still viewed very much as a German genre, but also because orchestras were few and far between in the capital. So Farrenc composed mostly piano and chamber pieces – the 1849 Nonet, for wind quintet and string quartet, is probably her best known work. Apart from two sets of variations for piano and orchestra and an unfinished piano concerto, all of her orchestral music, three symphonies composed between 1842 and 1847, and two overtures from 1834, is brought together on these discs from <a href="http://laurenceequilbey.com/en/">Laurence Equilbey</a> and her period-instrument orchestra, Insula.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/04/louise-farrenc-symphonies-1-3-overtures-review-insula-equilbey">Continue reading...</a>

In my first week, the Sex Pistols’ Anarchy tour came to the poly. Punk showed us anything is possible: anyone can start a group, unbound by fashion, political orthodoxy or gender. This creative explosion was fuelled by the rising unemployment and urban decay of the 70s and a reaction to the years of terror of [serial killer] Peter Sutcliffe. Everything was simmering. So many bands and performers would rise out of that, unbound by the constraints of the previous decade.</p><p><strong>Dave, I understand you spent your youth attending parties at the </strong><strong>Highland Room</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Blackpool’s legendary </strong><strong>northern </strong><strong>soul venu</strong><strong>e.

Ian Levine went to the same school as me in Blackpool, but was a few years older. Chris Lowe [from Pet Shop Boys] was in the year below.

<p>The Windsors come with a very large staff, some of whom may be visible this weekend at King Charles’s coronation. But don’t dust off your CV – you probably don’t qualify<br /></p><p>Modern monarchy can feel a bit pointless. If there’s no pomp, there’s no point, surely? Duchy Original oaten biscuits and broad bean <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/king-charles-camilla-coronation-quiche-signature-dish">coronation quiche</a> are tragically deficient in the shock, awe and fabulousness department compared with George IV’s 100-course banquets on a 4,000-piece silver gilt dining set, with real fish swimming in a channel running through <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/trails/the-grand-service">the centre of his table</a>. But there is still a touch of the old autocratic mystique. An <a href="https://www.insider.com/the-firm-royal-org-chart-who-works-for-queen-2022-01">investigation by the US media company Insider</a> in January 2022 revealed 1,133 royal employees, including a “carpet planner” and “deputy yeoman of the plate pantry”. The palace dismissed Insider’s database of staff as “a series of ill-informed and baseless claims”. However, King Charles seems committed to keeping his end up in terms of flunkeys: the 2022 annual review of Clarence House (Charles’s residence since 2003) alone revealed it employed the equivalent of 101 full-time staff, including “four chefs, five house managers, three valets and dressers and a couple of butlers”.</p><p>Although the royal household significantly slimmed down in the 19th century, a proliferation of secretive sinecures, archaic titles, brocaded uniforms and feathered headgear remain. It is described by former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker in his 2019 book about royal excesses, … And What Do You Do?, as a “medieval mountain of absurdity”: equerries, pages, aides-de-camp, ushers and “enough chaplains to organise a football knockout competition”. “They are there to ease the monarch’s passage through life,” says Adrian Tinniswood, author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/25/behind-throne-domestic-history-royal-household-adrian-tinniswood-review">Behind the Throne: a Domestic History of the Royal Household</a>. “But there’s another side to it – surrounding the sovereign in an aura of mystique, of magic almost. Those traditions remind us that even though we would like to think the royals are just like us, of course they’re not. Because if they were, what’s the point of them?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/04/swan-wrangling-and-steamy-trysts-the-unusual-lives-and-jobs-of-the-kings-entourage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This adaptation of Henry Fielding’s sexy period romance is recast as a tale of a moping wally falling for a dullard – and the spark never lights</p><p>A period romance, based on a classic 18th-century novel where “love conquers all”? It needs a big moment – that scene where hero and heroine realise they are definitively entwined, the air between them crackles and we, the swooning audience, become, in that instant, as committed to their love as they are. In the first episode of Tom Jones, a dramatisation of Henry Fielding’s 1749 book, the moment … never comes. The spark never lights. As a result, the show is four hours in workmanlike pursuit of nothing much.</p><p>Solly McLeod, fair of hair and square of temple, is the foundling Tom. He was abandoned as a newborn in the house of wealthy country magistrate Squire Allworthy (James Fleet) and brought up by the squire and his sister Bridget, lovingly but without any pretence that their ward is anything other than low-class. Partly, this is due to the household also containing the toxically snobby William Blifil (James Wilbraham), the result of Bridget’s brief marriage to a posh berk.</p><p>Tom Jones is on ITVX.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/04/itvx-tom-jones-review-there-is-absolutely-zero-chemistry-between-these-actors">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The drummer has long been curious about music beyond thrash metal, playing with everyone from Ice-T to John Zorn. Now his debut solo album is bringing it all together</p><p>At the tender age of 21, Dave Lombardo helped change modern music. The drummer was the propulsive force behind <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/slayer">Slayer</a>’s third album, 1986’s Reign in Blood: a record that upped the ante of thrash metal, kicked the doors open for further extremity and remains a landmark of the genre.</p><p>“I don’t think we thought we were creating something special,” says Lombardo, now 58. “I don’t think we knew <em>what</em> we were doing. We just knew that whatever it was, it felt good.” Lombardo left and rejoined Slayer several times over their four-decade run, and suggests the band’s combative nature shaped its sound and approach. “We’re like brothers in constant battles. There are always rifts in families, so I feel that was just the nature of the band. In a lot of ways it drove the band to be as aggressive as it was.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/04/i-worried-it-was-self-indulgent-dave-lombardo-on-slayer-going-solo-and-shaking-his-banana">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These tiny 1980s home arcade machines are returning to a table near you – updated, upgraded and packed with classic video games</p><p>In the early 1980s, before the arrival of affordable home computers and major consoles, handheld electronic games were the most desirable hi-tech toys out there. From Mattel’s Soccer and Auto Race, to the legendary Nintendo Game &amp; Watch series, these pocket-sized gadgets were the kings of the Argos winter catalogue.</p><p>Among the many emergent designs, however, the tabletop games were my favourites. Astro Wars, Caveman, Tron … these beautiful devices were designed to resemble miniature arcade machines, complete with teeny joysticks, buttons and detailed artwork. Most featured built-in vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs) which were capable of emitting light and colour, unlike the dour monochrome screens found on LCD-based electronic games such as Game &amp; Watch. They ate up batteries but that didn’t matter: they were designed to be played at home so most could be plugged in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/04/tabletop-arcade-video-game-machines">Continue reading...</a>

## Toasties and Blockbusters: my time with Big Sam and why I hope he saves Leeds | Max Rushden

<p>As a radio co-host Allardyce was far from tactically rigid and it is delicious to imagine him beating Pep Guardiola in his first game</p><p>A couple of weeks before the start of the season, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly">Guardian Football Weekly</a> panel were asked for our most outlandish predictions for the season. Barry Glendenning suggested Liverpool wouldn’t make the top four. Jonathan Wilson thought there was a good chance of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/21/roy-hodgson-returns-as-crystal-palace-manager"> Roy Hodgson coming out of retirement</a> and ensuring Crystal Palace’s survival. Philippe Auclair was confident Chelsea would spend half a billion pounds on attacking midfielders, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/11/i-felt-at-home-thomas-tuchel-devastated-by-chelsea-sacking">sack Thomas Tuchel</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/02/chelsea-sack-manager-graham-potter-after-less-than-six-months-in-charge">then Graham Potter</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/06/frank-lampard-confirmed-as-chelsea-caretaker-manager-until-end-of-season">bring in Super Frank Lampard</a> to oversee a 100% losing record.</p><p>These predictions all seemed far-fetched, but not ridiculous. It was then I argued that in early May <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/03/leeds-confirm-sam-allardyce-as-manager-sack-javi-gracia">Sam Allardyce would claim</a> to be on the same level as Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp while criticising the criminal justice system for not releasing Sammy Lee from jury service to help him try to keep Leeds in the Premier League.

Made up of young Black art students including Piper, the collective instigated conversations about racism and visibility in art while promoting a distinctly Black British political identity. Though the group only lasted for five years, it is now considered a cornerstone in the development of the Black arts movement and an early meeting point for many who would go on to become internationally renowned figures in the art world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/04/police-shootings-and-poignant-messages-the-blk-art-group-40-years-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Imanol Alguacil’s side look set for the Champions League after beating Madrid, with thanks owed to one player in particular</p><p>A little after the clock struck 12 on the night when David Silva, 37, ran 10 kilometres, completed more passes, won more possession, made more tackles, created more chances and provided more assists than anyone else; the delirious, noisy night when everybody bounced about and he led his team – the fifth of a career that began 19 years ago and isn’t ending any time soon – to victory over the European champions and the cusp of a Champions League place for the first time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/apr/29/barca-real-madrid-sociedad-football">in a decade</a>, his manager was asked what exactly they were giving him up in San Sebastián. For a moment Imanol Alguacil paused, then a smile crept across his face. “Our thanks,” he said.</p><p>The Real Sociedad coach was not, he insisted, just speaking for everyone here but everyone everywhere: “For all football fans and everyone who loves the game”. Mostly, though, he spoke for the 35,314 people inside the Reale Arena, <em>txuri-urdines</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/05/imanol-alguacil-unable-to-contain-passion-real-sociedad-quench-trophy-thirst-copa-del-rey-final">like him</a>, who are living the best days of their lives and who stood to applaud as Silva finally departed in the 90th minute of his 907th match, his work done the way only he can do it. Clapping so hard their hands hurt, they accompanied him to the touchline, where Alguacil lifted him in his arms, and then they began bowing before him. “It makes you proud that he is with us,” the coach said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/04/real-sociedad-are-living-their-best-days-with-david-silva-at-the-heart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A demon on the pitch, Manchester City’s striker is also turning heads with his fashion sense – fun, colourful and never less than eye-catching</p><p>Whether or not you care about football, odds are you’re familiar with Manchester City’s Erling Haaland. The 6ft 4in striker, highest scorer in the Premier League and Norwegian nepo baby (his father played for Leeds and City), has emerged as the most exciting footballer in the modern game. Able to plunder goals like no other player, at just 22 he’s already racked up numbers that border on comic (a record-breaking 35 goals in 31 Premier League games this season following last night’s win against West Ham)<strong> –</strong> doing so by moving in the box like an elegant bull in an otherwise robustly defended china shop.</p><p>Huge, with bee-stung lips, Thor-like hair and a body forged on cooked liver and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy4_LDYYCm0">blue-top milk</a> that somehow manages to be both wiry and thick, he has also revealed himself to be a snappy dresser. He has appeared on the covers of GQ and Icon magazine, a Zoomer Ronaldo with a weakness for fun Dolce &amp; Gabbana prints, big watches and the sort of conspicuous logos typified by Baden Baden-era Wags. All of which he likes to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erling.haaland/">document on Instagram</a>.

<p></p><p>When Aditya moved from India in 2014 to Lincoln, Nebraska, to pursue his PhD in marketing, it took time to build new friendships. “As a gay man, I hadn’t been ‘out’ in India, but over the years I joined various networks,” he says. In June 2017, three years after moving, he decided to throw a picnic party to celebrate his birthday. When a mutual friend asked him if one of the older PhD advisers could join them, he had no idea they were destined to become best friends. “I didn’t know Isabel, but I said it was fine. The guest list was mostly young gay men so I was a bit worried she’d feel left out.”</p><p>The party was held at a lake near Lincoln. Before Isabel arrived, she asked their mutual friend what to bring. “They told me he loved tea, so I ended up buying PG tips,” she laughs. Aditya was thrilled with the gift. “My first impression was that she seemed quite shy. Over the day, I was keeping an eye out to make sure she was included.” Despite his concerns, Isabel had “a blast” and felt very welcomed by Aditya’s friends. “I thought he was very serious at first, but he was really interesting and a very good host.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/04/how-we-met-hes-one-of-the-kindest-people-with-an-unparalleled-sense-of-humour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fifteen questions on general knowledge and topical trivia, plus a few jokes every Thursday. How will you fare?</p><p>Welcome again to the Thursday quiz, accurately described in the comments last week by someone called “fishworld” as a test of “knowing stuff about things”. Unfortunately, while some of the stuff is topical news that you will have seen on the Guardian website, some of the things are completely obscure and entirely at the whim of a capricious nerdy quiz master. There are bonus points available in the comments if you can spot oblique references to Doctor Who, but beware, you can lose points for needless quibbling. And this week we are going to try leaving the comments open for a little longer, as due to something called “time zones”, there are some people for whom this is, essentially, the Friday quiz. Be kind to each other and have fun!</p><p><strong>The Thursday quiz, No 106</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/04/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-106">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Met Gala allows us to gawk at the latest fashions, but functional design has provided us with astonishing curios for millennia</p><p>As attendees of the Met Gala stalked the stairs of the Metropolitan Museum of Art earlier this week, fashion gawkers around the world gathered around laptops and cellphone screens to marvel at the excess of jewels, creative costuming and perhaps most importantly, the <em>trends</em>. Last year it was all about sheer mesh and corsets; a few years back it was metallics and lace. To go by Monday night’s display, grapefruit-size rosettes are likely headed to a clothing rack near you.</p><p>We’re living in an era when fads are able to move through the global population with unprecedented swiftness, and sometimes it seems like we’re living in a time of unprecedented absurdity. But while the first condition can be blamed on our digital age, the second is only a mirage. Human fashion has always been delightfully strange and deeply ridiculous. When have people not wanted to stun and to charm? To own weird little tchotchkes and hoard shiny shells?

## The Experience Machine by Andy Clark review – how our brains really work

<p>A cognitive philosopher explains how prediction, rather than perception, is the mind’s secret weapon</p><p>Do we see the world directly, or do we make some of it up? It was the great 19th-century scientist Hermann von Helmholtz who first argued that some unconscious process of logical reasoning must be inherent in optical and auditory perception. That insight was rediscovered in the late 20th century, leading to the modern consensus of cognitive science: we think we see and hear the outside world directly, but most of our experience is created by the brain, meaning its best guesses are based on limited information as to what might really be out there. In other words, we are constantly filling in gaps with predictions.</p><p>The Sussex-based cognitive philosopher Andy Clark provides an engaging overview of what he slightly over-claims to be this “new theory” of predictive processing. It is demonstrated in enjoyable and surprising ways: for example, by “<a href="https://mooney.icsi.berkeley.edu/mooney/" title="">Mooney images</a>”, which at first look like random monochrome noise, until you are shown a more detailed second version; you can then “see” (and can’t unsee) the real image in the original. Your predictions have now been updated to be more accurate. People, it turns out, can also be primed to hallucinate Bing Crosby singing White Christmas <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11934126/" title="">while listening to pure white noise</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/04/the-experience-machine-how-our-minds-predict-and-shape-reality-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What we long suspected is now scientific fact: there’s a magic chemical connection between mood, strength and longevity</p><p>Exercise, in whatever form, and for however long, just makes life feel better. I feel it myself after a walk up Arthur’s Seat here in Edinburgh, a jog around the Meadows, or a sweaty hot yoga session in Leith. The physical benefits of movement such as lowered blood pressure, reduced risk of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992225/">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/exercise-linked-with-lower-risk-of-13-types-of-cancer.html">cancer</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311630225X">healthy ageing</a>, are well-known, and we’re beginning to understand more about the mental health benefits as well.</p><p>One of the most interesting health research projects of the past decade or so has looked at how exactly exercise makes us feel good. Research shows that there appears to be a clear scientific reason, that we can see at a cellular level. When muscles contract, they secrete chemicals into the bloodstream. Among these chemicals are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psyp.13799">myokines</a>, which have been referred to as “hope molecules”. These small proteins travel to the brain, cross the blood-brain barrier, and act as an antidepressant. They do this by improving our mood, our ability to learn, our capacity for locomotor activity, and protect the brain from the negative effects of ageing. This has been referred to as “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926334/#:~:text=Studies%20conducted%20on%20exercise%20showed,41%2C42%2C55%5D">muscle-brain cross-talk</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/04/exercise-mental-health-hope-molecules-mood-strength">Continue reading...</a>

Some even found her approach so “cold and insincere”, they said they would rather be ghosted.</p><p>While the clinical approach is clearly not for everyone, leaving a friendship is rarely easy, no matter how you choose to do it.

Outside in the waiting room on a Sunday in early February, 15 or so young faces are squashed against the glass of the partition doors, with dozens more children and parents behind them; they’re yakking, laughing, mucking about, but above all, they are desperate to get back into the room for the next round and play more chess.</p><p>The clamour is proof of what amounts to a Corsican chess revolution. There are now almost 7,000 licensed chess players on the island with a population of 340,000; more than 25 times the rate in mainland France. Corsica welcomed its first international master, <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/654213">Michaël Massoni</a>, in 2013, and first grandmaster, <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/36083534">Marc’Andria Maurizzi</a> – France’s youngest ever at 14 years old – in 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/may/04/we-use-chess-as-a-spine-the-corsican-movement-teaching-children-moves-beyond-the-board">Continue reading...</a>

Except Styles has never – at least not publicly, or to anyone’s knowledge – performed this song. Instead, it joins the many examples of fake performances created by artificial intelligence.</p><p>Fans were delighted. “Suddenly I am no longer afraid of AI,” commented one listener, and on videos of other AI-generated Styles songs (he’s made to duet with Taylor Swift, for example) there are multiple requests for more. “Make him sing take me to church [by Hozier],” writes one fan, and “SING SAD GIRL BY LANA [del Rey]”, bellows another. Fans wanting their favourite artists to cover songs they enjoy is hardly a new phenomenon, but with advances in AI, there’s no need to involve the artist at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/04/harry-sing-lana-del-rey-how-ai-is-making-pop-fans-fantasies-come-true">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A woman who has lost the power of speech forms a connection with a language teacher who is losing his sight in the Korean author’s striking examination of selfhood</p><p>One of the two central protagonists of Han Kang’s Greek Lessons, the 2011 novel from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/man-booker-international-prize-serves-up-victory-to-the-vegetarian-han-kang-deborah-smith" title="">International Booker prizewinner</a>, which has just been translated from Korean into English, has lost the power of speech. The book explores the extent to which this sudden disappearance of words, which first befell the unnamed woman when she was a teenager and has now recurred at a particularly vulnerable moment in her life, amounts to a more catastrophic rupture with language. For the woman appears almost to repudiate any other ways of communicating, eschewing written notes to her therapist or attempts to convey information through sign language.</p><p>Almost from the start the reader suspects that the woman’s silence represents a more profound alienation from meaning or, perhaps, a sense of being overwhelmed that might be traced back to her childhood, when the letters and phonemes that fascinated her simultaneously threatened to “thrust their way into her sleep like skewers”. As a mute teenager, she learned to exist beyond language, “absorbing the flow of time like balls of cotton”; now, recently bereaved by the death of her mother and by the loss of custody of her son following a divorce, she retreats again, into the featureless privacy of her apartment by day and the streets by night, attempting to exhaust herself enough to sleep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/04/greek-lessons-by-han-kang-review-studies-in-silence-and-solitude">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC; Arkane/Bethesda<br /></strong>Despite occasional flourishes, Arkane’s latest game feels fundamentally at odds with itself</p><p>Redfall’s developer, Arkane Austin, is previously best known for Prey, a beautifully intricate sci-fi adventure that encouraged players to be creative in their fight against its alien menace. You could activate computer touchscreens by shooting them with a toy crossbow, or squeeze through tiny gaps in the environment by transforming into small inanimate objects. It included a handful of guns, but using them always felt like a failure of imagination on the player’s part.</p><p>By comparison, guns are all Redfall has. It’s the same old parade of incrementally more powerful firearms seen in games such as Borderlands and Destiny, striving to excite the player through what they can <em>have </em>rather than what they can <em>do</em>. These guns are not Redfall’s biggest problem, but they symbolise where Arkane has strayed from the path. This might be the studio’s largest and most technologically ambitious game, but its expanse of a New England town and packed armoury amount to modest entertainment at best.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/04/redfall-review-vampire-shooter-is-sucked-dry-of-fun">Continue reading...</a>

## Return of the king: what can the movies teach us about the coronation?

<p>Icy rejection in Welles’s Chimes at Midnight, Chalamet stripped to the waist, a swaggering Chris Hemsworth – which will Charles channel on Saturday?</p><p>On the morning of Saturday 6 May, King Charles III will waken to the realisation that this is the day which he has anticipated, or perhaps dreaded, all his life. Yet there is no reason to suppose he will be nervous. He is a veteran of royal occasions by the thousand and, specifically, his own two weddings which he experienced at the ages of 32 and then 56; perhaps he once imagined his coronation would happen sometime between these two. Now he is 74 and, if anything will cloud the experience for him, it might be the memories of his parents’ recent (and comparably momentous) funerals.</p><p>But how do we imagine he will feel about his role in this sumptuous ritual which is in its way a survival from Britain’s pre-Reformation Catholic past? And is there anything in the movies to help us? The most famous coronation scene in cinema comes to us via Shakespeare, in the form of Henry’s icy rejection of Falstaff on his coronation day in Orson Welles’s Chimes at Midnight, his concatenated mashup of Richard II, both parts of Henry IV and Henry V. Keith Baxter’s Hal – his face nightmarishly shot from below, from Falstaff’s supplicant position, in fact – humiliates Welles’s desperately cringing rascal, when this scapegrace former pal presumes to approach him on the day itself, sensationally disrupting the ceremony: “I know thee not old man.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/04/king-charles-coronation-movies-orson-welles-timothee-chalamet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This very British circus is low down the US news agenda, but still they are enjoying it. It will be a good day for Charles lookalikes </p><p>One of the more startling aspects of living abroad is adjusting to the reduced importance of things considered very important back home. I remember the moment I realised that little below the level of a change in prime minister or an act of terrorism would make the news list in the US. It was like the first time you see one of those maps produced by countries that aren’t Britain and in which Britain isn’t at the centre of the universe. (The Australian one really blew my mind on this front.)</p><p>In the US, nobody cares who Suella Braverman is – to be fair, a sentiment shared by a great number of Britons at home – or who’s in and out at the BBC. I once heard an American publishing executive refer to Britain as a “small foreign market”, triggering a similar out-of-body experience, plus some apparently unshiftable residual jingoism.

<p>She is famous for painting solitary women. But, far from being the recluse of popular myth, this pupil of Whistler, admirer of Cézanne and lover of Rodin was ahead of her time</p><p>There are a few better examples of the tendency to see female artists’ work through an overly biographical lens than the case of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/02/gwen-john-hero-anne-enright">Gwen John</a>. Her best-known paintings – quiet interiors often featuring solitary women as subjects – have fostered a myth of the reclusive artist for whom external location was irrelevant.</p><p>“The chairs and curtains and all other paraphernalia are often written about as idiosyncrasies of hers,” explains Alicia Foster, author of a new book about John and curator of the first major UK show of her work for nearly 20 years. “But artists such as Paul Cézanne, whom she adored, and Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard also adopted similar setups at the same time. And while John’s painting of a woman in a room is supposedly indicative of a lonely female artist who doesn’t go out much, the work of Cézanne and the others apparently says all sorts of interesting things about art. It’s a lazy reading. John was active in two of the great centres of art when they were at their most vibrant. What is actually important about her work is not her isolation, it is her connections.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/04/gwen-john-art-pallant-house-gallery-rodin-augustus-john">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This candid memoir lays out the complexities of caring for an ailing partner</p><p>Sarah Tarlow built her academic career as an archaeologist researching grief and mourning. Archaeologists have always studied bodies, but Tarlow’s interest is in “mortuary and commemorative practices”, the relationships between the living and the dead. Some of the bodies unearthed by her peers tell stories of care: people who lived many years with injuries or diseases incompatible with survival in the absence of constant attention from others. These finds, Tarlow says, are regarded as evidence of selflessness, even humanity itself, though other mammals behave similarly and caring for someone disabled is not necessarily a purely altruistic act. Now she has written her own memoir of care, followed by the remaking of the relationship between the survivor and the deceased.</p><p>In 2013, Mark, Tarlow’s partner of 15 years and the father of her three children, developed the first symptoms of a degenerative disease that was never fully diagnosed. In May 2016, while Tarlow and her children were out on a rare family visit, Mark took a fatal overdose of a drug he had bought online and kept hidden until he judged he’d lost enough to be sure about ending his life while still being able to do it. It was not, Tarlow insists, an irrational decision. Mark was not mentally ill: “Being dead is sometimes better than being alive.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/04/the-archaeology-of-loss-by-sarah-tarlow-review-a-clear-sighted-view-of-caring-and-grief">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As WGA members put their pens down again, a look back on the last industry-shifting strike </p><p>Earlier this week, the Writers Guild of America officially launched an industry-wide strike in light of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers’ continued refusal to meet them on reasonable ground in their negotiations for a new collective contract.</p><p>The union has fought for a guaranteed number of on-the-job weeks for TV staffers, pay structures to compensate for the residual fees eliminated by streaming, and regulations to rein in the looming existential threat of artificial intelligence. The organization representing the studios and networks countered with a staunch refusal to curtail the amount of work that can legally be done for no money, and proposed a “day rate” for comedy writers that essentially turns the process of making TV into a form of freelance employment at-will. These groups must now play chicken for the soul of art in America, which directly hinges on the fundamental human right to do your job under financially livable conditions. The other path at this decisive fork leads to a clear dead end for moving pictures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/04/2007-writers-strike-bond-movie-heroes">Continue reading...</a>

## The Laureate review – writers throuple up in sinisterly erotic literary thriller

<p>The scandalous love triangle between poet Robert Graves, his feminist wife and a charismatic American writer is the subject of this erotic and entertainingly silly film</p><p>Britain’s premier literary throuple is the subject of this gamey, borderline-silly but watchably acted movie, which might have sat more comfortably as a three-part Sunday night TV drama. Robert Graves (Tom Hughes) is the poet traumatised and creatively blocked by his experiences in the great war, Nancy Nicholson (Laura Haddock) is his forward-thinking feminist wife, and Laura Riding (Dianna Agron) is the charismatic American writer who comes to live with them in a scandalous menage.</p><p>Laura entrances them both sexually and stirs Robert’s stagnant juices in every sense, leading him to invent an entire pagan aesthetic around his adoration for her as the “goddess” at the centre of his poetic being – with Nancy’s slightly wan permission. But Riding’s irreverent lustiness is to infuriate the fusty male circles of literary London, particularly TS Eliot (Christien Anholt) who is portrayed, perhaps justly, as an obnoxious hypocrite and bore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/04/the-laureate-review-writers-throuple-up-in-sinisterly-erotic-literary-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

## The unspoken truth about gardening? It is a relentless, unwinnable war

<p>Peace is simply not possible in my garden. If I snooze, I lose. The green tide just keeps coming and I can never beat it back</p><p>Television gardeners are a serene species. A snip here, a bit of potting there, their spades breaking earth rich and dark as they murmur wise and loving words. The soundtrack is as soft and gentle as the songs of the birds a-chirping their gratitude from the bushes and trees. All is well in the gardens of the television gardeners.</p><p>Cut to any gardening show I might present. There would be no birdsong for a soundtrack, only heavy metal, as brutal as the sound of my spade hitting another unmovable rock. When Lemmy got Motörhead together he said its music would be, “loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speed-freak rock’n’roll. It will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die.” Yes, Motörhead’s sound will be just the ticket for my gardening show. Not for me the standard vibe of working with nature. It’ll be man v nature, a battle with only one winner, which won’t be me.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/04/the-unspoken-truth-about-gardening-it-is-a-relentless-unwinnable-war">Continue reading...</a>

## Zandra Rhodes’ forever fashion: ‘If you look closely, my coat needs a clean. But it still feels special’

<p>The designer made this in 1969 and has worn it ever since – at first just for special occasions, then on any day she wants to feel glamorous</p><p>I designed this coat early in my career – I think it was around 1969. I’d wanted to design something that’s lovely to wear and feels fabulous – and it does feel fabulous. It has one of my prints on the suede collar, and the suede has a scalloped edge with little holes punched out, so it looks rather lace-like. I think coloured shearling is very cheery, though it could have been done in a gorgeous black or a natural colour, which would have looked quite hippy-ish for those days. All these years later, it’s not falling apart so it must have been made incredibly well.</p><p>This was a sample piece and they would have made several, though I don’t know how many. I don’t think I gave it a name – now, I just call it my fabulous red coat. I can’t remember how much it was sold for, but it would probably seem ridiculously cheap now. I do occasionally still have people getting in touch who bought my designs, asking me to value them or for advice on how they can get them mended or cleaned, but I’ve never seen another one of these coats.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/04/zandra-rhodes-forever-fashion-if-you-look-closely-my-coat-needs-a-clean-but-it-still-feels-special">Continue reading...</a>

New startups are hoping to change the game</p><p>When Emma Cihanowyz was in middle school, she and her friends used code words to talk about their periods. If someone asked for a “missile”, it meant they were looking for a tampon. “Shields” meant pads. “We spoke like we were at war,” she said. “The biggest thing for us was making sure that we could take products to the bathroom without the boys seeing.”</p><p>Now Cihanowyz is 21, a senior at Penn State, and a student activist who campaigns for free sanitary products in all campus bathrooms. She’s no longer afraid of boys, or anyone, knowing she’s having her period.

<p>Resolution of disagreements over Northern Ireland protocol – along with threat from Russia – responsible for improved relations</p><p><br />Pedro Serrano, the new EU envoy to London, senses he may have come to the UK at a propitious moment, saying there are signs that both sides “want to advance the relationship on many fronts” now that the disagreements over implementation over the Northern Ireland protocol are largely resolved.<br />With a background as the former chief of staff to the EU high representative Josep Borrell and, before that, the head of the defence department of the EU external action service, Serrano is a genuine heavyweight diplomat. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, his expertise means he is ideally positioned to make a pitch to the UK to forge a closer relationship over foreign and defence policy.<br /><br />“I believe I have arrived at a good moment with the making and the finalisation of the agreement on the Windsor framework which has rebuilt trust between the EU and the UK,” he says in his first interview.<br /><br />“Obviously the very rich relationship between the UK and the EU has been affected by Brexit, but the foundations of the relationship are very strong and we are both fighting jointly to reestablish security in Europe after the terrible attack by Russia.”<br /><br />Asked why the Northern Ireland negotiations succeeded, he compliments both sides, but acknowledges the invasion of Ukraine also concentrated minds.<br /><br />“As with most things in international relations, there is not one cause for the change, but many causes. Certainly personalities make a difference. The arrival of prime minister Rishi Sunak, the foreign secretary James Cleverly and the Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, alongside the very clear willingness on our side shown by vice-president Maroš Šefčovič and the Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, has been fundamental.</p><p>“But what has also been fundamental is that all Europeans are jointly facing one of the biggest threats for decades to their security, their livelihood and their values. So in a way it has been easy to have a group of people, very conscious of the challenges they are facing and very pragmatically oriented, to show a willingness to go beyond Brexit and rebuild a strong relationship.”<br /><br />He is also careful to suggest the two sides have to learn to walk together before they run. The meat and drink of his future work will be the implementation of the revised protocol and future of the trading and cooperation agreement, including talks on British participation in the Horizon research programme, or the EU Retained Law bill, a measure ministers are rethinking as they look at the implications of an automatic end-of-year scrapping of 4,000 EU laws that had been kept on the statute book to ensure continuity.<br /><br />He pointedly flags his concern over the UK’s illegal migration bill if it requires a breach with the ECHR. “The European Union considers that this is a fundamental issue, and we do hope that our partners also will continue supporting both the European Court for Human Rights and, of course, the Council of Europe, which is one of the backbones for the respect for human rights in the European continent,” he says.<br /><br />On the positive side, he welcomes British involvement in the European Political Community, a still fledgling institution and the brainchild of the French president Emmanuel Macron that brings together nearly 50 EU and non-EU states at heads of government level to discuss common concerns. Britain attended the first meeting of the EPC under Liz Truss’s leadership and now London has agreed to host the fourth meeting, expected in the first half of 2024. “The EPC does fill a vacuum and, as such, is a very useful structure for European leaders,” Serrano says.<br /><br />Nor does he rule out the start of regular EU-UK summits. “It is not on the table yet, but such meetings are normal for the EU with third countries to which it is very close. Would it be a normal evolution and development for the future? Probably yes, but it is for the leaders to decide.”<br /><br />But it is in the field of defence, an area left out of the withdrawal agreement, that he sees as the greatest potential for closer cooperation. He says that “ever since the agreement between Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac at St Malo in 1998 the UK has been at the forefront of developing EU defence policy. The UK has always been behind most of the initiatives that have been developed in the architecture of security and defence policy.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/new-eu-envoy-recognises-willingness-to-rebuild-relationship-between-uk-and-eu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shonda Rhimes’s gorgeous triumph of a spin-off follows Queen Charlotte across two timelines. It’s a comic, emotive pleasure – with plenty of sex</p><p>Tighten your corsets, ladies. Straighten your waistcoats, gentlemen. Adjust your powdered wigs, anyone who has one. Welcome to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bridgerton">Bridgerton</a> extended universe in the gorgeous six-episode romp from Shondaland, written almost entirely by Rhimes herself, that is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81476183">Queen Charlotte</a>. Before the action begins, we are given stern guidance by Shonda/Lady Whistledown/Julie Andrews, and when that trinity speaks, you listen. “This is the story of Queen Charlotte from Bridgerton. It is not a history lesson – it is fiction inspired by fact. All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional. Enjoy.”</p><p>I do love a pre-emptive strike by a writer, even more so when it is clearly the result of a middle-aged woman having had quite enough of your shit. She might as well have written, “It’s a Regency romance, not an AJP Taylor lecture. Either watch it or go and bring me your dirty clothes so I can put a wash on. God, you treat this place like a hotel.” Eyeroll, credits.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/04/queen-charlotte-a-bridgerton-story-review-a-ravishing-romp-packed-prequel">Continue reading...</a>
