<p>Gamepad maker 8Bitdo <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-c-wired-controller/">unveiled</a> a cheaper version of its beloved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdo-ultimate-controller-wireless-nintendo-switch-pc-android-150115393.html">Ultimate Controller</a> today. The new Ultimate C 2.4G Wireless Controller is a $30 wireless accessory in purple or green color options. It’s compatible with Windows, Android, Steam Deck and Raspberry Pi.</p><p>As its name suggests, the new gamepad connects wirelessly using an included 2.4GHz USB dongle. 8Bitdo describes it as a “simplified” version of the popular Ultimate series of controllers while “offering the same ultimate quality.” As for what “simplified” means, the company appears to have helped scale back production costs by skipping the charging dock (using cable charging instead) and the profile-toggling switch from the more expensive variants. It also doesn’t support the company’s Ultimate Software for customizations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>8BitDo says the gamepad can last up to 25 hours of playtime and recharge fully in two hours. In addition, it supports asymmetrical rumble, although vibration feedback only works on Windows. The controller also works in wired mode and is plug-and-play on PC.</p><p>The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-170545714.html">expanded into modern console-style controllers</a> last year after making its bones on nostalgic gamepads mimicking classic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-29-8bitdos-revamped-nes-classic-controller-preorder.html">NES</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-01-8bitdo-wireless-snes-controller-switch-sn30pro-review.html">SNES</a> inputs. The Ultimate line’s design is much closer to today’s Xbox controllers, including asymmetric stick layouts. The more expensive 2.5GHz version is still available for $50, while the Bluetooth variant costs $70. You can pre-order the new model from Amazon ahead of its scheduled May 31st release date.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/8bitdo-launches-a-30-version-of-its-ultimate-controller-214509427.html?src=rss

## Strong iPhone sales aren't enough to offset a big downturn in Mac shipments

<p>Apple had its second &quot;bad&quot; quarter in a row. Bad, of course, is a relative term — the company's revenues declined again, but Apple is still making a positively massive amount of money. Specifically, the iPhone and Services categories, both of which have been Apple's biggest money-makers for years now, saw revenue gains year-over-year. But this wasn't enough to offset declines everywhere else: the Mac, iPad, and Wearables / Home / Accessories divisions all shrank compared to this time a year ago. As such, Apple's overall revenue dropped a modest three percent year-over-year to $94.8 billion, while net income of $24.2 billion was down less than one percentage point. Like I said, not exactly a bad quarter, but given that the company's sales and profits almost always are up, it's worth noting when they aren't.</p><p>The strong iPhone sales (up two percent to $51.3 billion) marked a record the March-ending quarter, despite the fact that the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro arrived last September. And Apple's services business, which has been growing steadily over the past five years to surpass all other products the company offers (besides the iPhone, of course) hit another record with $20.9 billion in revenue (up five percent year-over-year).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mac sales plummeted from $10.4 billion a year ago to only $7.2 billion this quarter past, down 31 percent overall. That's less than IDC predicted a month ago when it <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/04/10/mac-shipments-collapse-40-year-over-year-on-declining-demand">said Mac sales dropped by 40 percent</a>, but the general forecast of hugely diminished interest still rings true. iPad sales weren't hit as hard but still dropped 13 percent to $6.7 billion for the quarter despite major updates to the product lineup last fall. Finally, the wearables / home category, which encompasses products like AirPods, the Apple Watch and the HomePod lineup, dipped less than one percent, so there aren't any significant red flags around that.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is kicking off the usual call with investors at 5PM ET, and we'll update this story with anything we learn.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/strong-iphone-sales-arent-enough-to-offset-a-big-downturn-in-mac-shipments-210358753.html?src=rss

## House lawmakers ask for investigation into Apple store labor practices

<p>Apple is facing additional scrutiny over its alleged crackdown against <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-accused-of-illegally-firing-pro-union-workers-140058541.html">pro-union retail workers</a>. House Representatives Emanuel Cleaver and Sylvia Garcia have <a href="https://cleaver.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-cleaver-garcia-call-nlrb-investigation-allegations-unfair-labor">sent a letter</a> to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) asking for an investigation into alleged labor abuses at Houston and Kansas City, Missouri stores. The politicians are concerned about claims Apple fired five Kansas City staff in retaliation for unionization efforts, and disciplined multiple Houston employees for attempting to organize.</p><p>In March, the Communications Works of America union (CWA) filed charges with the NLRB over the purported retaliation. The CWA believes Apple used thin pretexts to fire and intimidate employees, such as slightly late arrivals and even typos in timesheets. Some of the workers were reportedly forced to sign a release of claims against the company if they wanted a severance package. These practices are illegal, Cleaver and Garcia say.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The House members also pointed to the NLRB's January finding that Apple was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-labor-regulator-says-apple-violated-workers-rights-102524891.html">violating labor rights</a> with rules barring leaks and discussions of employment conditions. The representatives are worried about a &quot;recurring pattern,&quot; according to the letter. In December, the board said Apple also broke the law by holding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-apple-violated-federal-law-anti-union-meetings-atlanta-103015927.html">anti-union meetings</a> in Atlanta.</p><p>We've asked Apple for comment. The company has previously argued that it can better care for retail staff without unions. At the same time, it has addressed concerns by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-raising-pay-corporate-retail-082923570.html">raising pay</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-raises-benefits-000123583.html">improving benefits</a> and easing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-unveils-new-rules-on-working-hours-for-retail-employees-003058468.html">scheduling rules</a>.</p><p>The letter doesn't obligate the NLRB to respond, and there's no certainty that an investigation will lead to official action. Even so, it's notable that Apple's stance on retail labor has drawn Congress' attention. It won't be surprising if there's more interest from the federal government, whether or not the NLRB responds to the letter.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/house-lawmakers-ask-for-investigation-into-apple-store-labor-practices-195248699.html?src=rss

<p>The Strong National Museum of Play has <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/world-video-game-hall-of-fame-announces-class-of-2023-inductees/"><ins>revealed</ins></a> this year's inductees into the World Video Game Hall of Fame. There are four games in the class of 2023: <em>The Last of Us, Wii Sports, Barbie Fashion Designer</em> and <em>Computer Space. </em>They were selected based on a number of criteria, including their influence and popularity over time.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the-last-of-us/"><em><ins>The Last of Us</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is the most recent one of the bunch. Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic action adventure has rarely been out of the limelight over the last 10 years. A TV series based on the game debuted on HBO in January and it was an enormous hit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-season-one-hbo-review-080135969.html"><ins>with critics</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-debut-viewers-155019850.html"><ins>audiences</ins></a>. A remake of the original game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-ps5-review-150041410.html"><ins>hit PS5 in September</ins></a> and PC in March, though the latter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-for-pc-is-a-buggy-mess-144036281.html"><ins>had a buggy launch</ins></a>, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Going backwards from there, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wii-sports/"><em><ins>Wii Sports</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>arrived in 2006. Partly because it was bundled in with the massively successful Wii and partly because <em>everyone </em>was playing it, the ever-entertaining sports sim went on to become one of the biggest-selling games of all time. Last year, Nintendo recaptured the magic fairly well on Switch with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-sports-hands-on-reviving-a-surefire-formula-for-fun-130034566.html"><em><ins>Nintendo Switch Sports</ins></em></a> (for the record, my Mii's nickname is Party Gramps).</p><div id="f40e8786a45542fda7161c35648e7707"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Back in 1996, Mattel and Digital Domain released <em>Barbie Fashion Designer. </em>It allowed players to design clothing that they could print and dress their real-life Barbie dolls with. The game was a hit, selling half a million copies in two months.</p><p>“<em>Barbie Fashion Designer</em> became a jumping-off point for the girls’ games movement and shook up the software and gaming scene,&quot; Kristy Hisert, collections manager at The Strong, said. &quot;It also sparked important questions and debate. What does it mean to be a game for girls? Should there even be games ‘for girls’? What are the implications of these games? What are the consequences of gendering games?”</p><p>The final member of the class of 2023 is the first ever commercially available video game. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-09-worlds-first-arcade-videogame.html"><em><ins>Computer Space</ins></em></a> was an arcade title <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-becoming-a-video-game-designer-daniel-noah-halpern-simon-and-schuster-163037446.html"><ins>based on 1962's </ins><em><ins>Spacewar!</ins></em><ins>,</ins></a> which was primarily found on the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer in computer labs. The success of 1971's <em>Computer Space</em> spurred creators Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney to found a little-known company called Atari.</p><p>These four titles are well-deserving inductees into the World Video Game Hall of Fame. This year's other finalists were <em>Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, FIFA International Soccer, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/goldeneye-007-nintendo-switch-xbox-release-date-144644341.html"><em><ins>Goldeneye 007</ins></em></a><em>, NBA 2K, Quake</em> and <em>Wizardry. </em>The Strong, which is in Rochester, New York, will showcase the 2023 inductees (and presumably the ones from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/world-video-game-hall-of-fame-2021-inductees-193936184.html"><ins>previous</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ocarina-of-time-ms-pac-man-ddr-civilization-video-game-hall-of-fame-150454915.html"><ins>years</ins></a>) on a permanent basis in a new World Video Game Hall of Fame space, which will open on June 30th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-and-wii-sports-join-the-world-video-game-hall-of-fame-191514485.html?src=rss

## Lordstown Motors may stop Endurance EV production ‘in the near future’

<p>EV startup Lordstown Motors is still in trouble after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-freezes-production-to-address-quality-issues-210811052.html">pausing production</a> earlier this year. The Endurance electronic pickup truck maker <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/06bd58ea-1f15-4ef0-af1e-92f2b8889156">said</a> today that it expects to stop producing the vehicle “in the near future” if it can’t find a partner to keep it afloat. The warning follows a separate <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465923053745/tm2314209d1_8k.htm">filing</a> from earlier this week saying it could file for bankruptcy if its deal with Foxconn can’t be resurrected.</p><p>“Due to the production delays from early January to mid-April 2023, the failure to identify a strategic partner for the Endurance, and extremely limited ability to raise capital in the current market environment, we anticipate production of the Endurance will cease in the near future,” the company wrote in today’s filing. “To date, we have not identified a strategic partner for the Endurance.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the SEC filing, Foxconn sent a letter to Lordstown on April 21st, threatening to terminate the two companies’ investment deal, which saw the Taiwanese manufacturer investing up to $170 million in the startup. (That followed a previous deal where Foxconn bought its Ohio factory.) In the letter, Foxconn told Lordstown it breached the agreement because the startup’s stock price fell below $1 per share for 30 straight trading days, leading to a NASDAQ delisting notice. Lordstown said it believes Foxconn’s claims are without merit and considers their investment agreement to remain in effect while talks continue. However, it concedes that bankruptcy is on the table if it can’t resolve the dispute “in a timely manner on terms that allow us to continue operating as planned” or find other strategic partners.</p><p>Lordstown <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/lordstown-motors-expects-to-end-production-of-endurance-ev-pickup.html">reported</a> a net loss of $171.1 million in the first quarter of this year, following a loss of $89.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. The EV maker had just $108.1 million in cash (and cash equivalents) on March 31st. Its stock price is currently hovering at 39 cents after peaking at $31.57 in early 2021.</p><p>It’s been a short but bumpy ride for Lordstown, which was only founded in 2018. Two years ago, its CEO resigned after an investigation revealed that executives lied about demand, the viability of Endurance’s technology and its ability to start production on schedule by September 2021. The same year, it became the subject of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-investigation-lordstown-motors-184638125.html">DOJ and SEC investigations</a>. GM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-selling-its-stake-in-troubled-electric-pickup-maker-lordstown-motors-091509553.html">sold its stake</a> in the company last March, although Lordstown did finally begin delivering the first trucks from its initial 500-unit order in November. However, it then froze production in February to address “performance and quality issues” and partnered with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on a voluntary recall to remedy a connection problem that could cut off motor output while driving.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-may-stop-endurance-ev-production-in-the-near-future-180630375.html?src=rss

<p>After months of rumors and leaks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/">Google</a> has confirmed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pixel-fold/">Pixel Fold's</a> existence. It showed off the foldable in an official capacity for the first time in a video posted on Twitter and YouTube. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-will-reportedly-announce-a-foldable-pixel-phone-at-io-next-month-155136945.html">was expected</a> to reveal the Pixel Fold <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-takes-place-on-may-10th-in-front-of-a-limited-in-person-audience-232154501.html">at Google I/O next week</a>. However, as has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-google-pixel-4-camera-official-leak.html">often been the case</a> over the last few years, Google has offered an early peek at an upcoming device before a splashier launch event.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leaked-google-pixel-fold-images-show-a-sleek-nearly-gapless-hinge-160537647.html">various leaks</a>, Google's first foldable phone has a vertical hinge that opens up to reveal a tablet-like display, in a similar fashion to Samsung's Galaxy Fold devices. When the Pixel Fold is closed, you can use a smaller touchscreen that's on one side of the exterior. There's a camera array on the rear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6d65dfdb908d4379b2513be88a679771"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-will-reportedly-announce-a-foldable-pixel-phone-at-io-next-month-155136945.html">Reports have suggested</a> that the Pixel Fold will start at $1,700 and it could be available as soon as next month (the video and a <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/pixel-is-open/">Google Store page</a> simply note that it's &quot;coming soon&quot;).

## Paramount+ tops 60 million subscribers thanks to 'Picard' and the NFL

<p>Paramount+ is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-subscribers-grow-152820376.html">growing quickly</a> even as its competitors recover. Paramount has <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/73058afe-92c5-4456-a600-4a79d83cb168">revealed</a> that its streaming service has over 60 million subscribers, having added 4.1 million in the first quarter. For context, the platform had 43 million users at the end of last spring — that's a nearly 40 percent jump in several months.  Not surprisingly, the media giant is giving credit to its slate of originals and exclusives.</p><p>The service had help from shows like the final season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-3-paramount-plus-preview-review-080010710.html"><em>Star Trek: Picard</em></a>, <em>Tulsa King</em> and the <em>Yellowstone</em> spinoff <em>1923</em>. Paramount+ also touts access to recent movies like <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>. And yes, the NFL playoffs kept customers tuning in. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-showtime-merger-premium-plan-cable-network-170551927.html">Showtime bundle</a> also helped draw in people eager to watch titles like <em>Yellowjackets</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There were other successes. Paramount's free-to-watch Pluto TV service topped 80 million monthly active users thanks to a 35 percent year-to-year jump in viewing hours. The company's increasing reliance on streaming also became clear through financial figures. While overall subscription revenue climbed 50 percent compared to a year earlier, the money flowing from Paramount+ surged 65 percent.</p><p>To some extent, Paramount+ is taking advantage of its rivals' misfortunes. While Netflix has bounced back from last year's rare losses, it still added a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html">modest 1.7 million new subscribers</a> in its first quarter. That's partly due to saturation — at 232.5 million total customers, Netflix doesn't have as much room to grow. Still, this suggests that studio-owned streaming services can fare well against incumbents.</p><p>Don't expect Paramount+ to change its strategy much as a result. The service is still leaning on Star Trek shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-first-season-2-trailer-promises-klingons-and-kirk-181406000.html"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a>, not to mention sports exclusives like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-uefa-champions-league-streaming-rights-soccer-152206370.html">UEFA Champions League</a>. That flurry of new content may come at a cost, as Paramount+ recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-prices-are-going-up-whether-you-get-showtime-or-not-153523879.html">hiked prices</a>. If viewers are willing to stay, though, the investment could easily pay off.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paramount-tops-60-million-subscribers-thanks-to-picard-and-the-nfl-165854248.html?src=rss

## Tesla reopens long-range Model 3 orders after almost nine months

The car is eligible for a $3,750 government subsidy as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla's configurator shows an estimated delivery window of June for the long-range Model 3 in the US. However, the company has not yet re-enabled orders north of the border. The Canadian version of the configurator only says that the long-range Model 3 will be available again later this year.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the long-range Model 3 is listed as having a range of &quot;325+&quot; miles. That's a drop from the 358 miles Tesla previously said the EV would be able to travel on a single charge. In November, it was reported that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-highland-model-3-redesign-report-172945432.html">Tesla was redesigning the Model 3</a> to cut costs, and the revamp may have included changes to the powertrain.

<p>Waymo is <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2023/05/waymo-one-doubles-service-area-in.html"><ins>doubling the operational area</ins></a> for its fleet of self-driving taxis, making what the company calls “the largest fully autonomous service area in the world.” The rapid growth is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-094718022.html"><ins>limited to Phoenix and San Francisco,</ins></a> but Waymo has big plans for both territories.</p><p>In Phoenix, for instance, self-driving cars are no longer limited to just the metro area and will travel to nearby communities like Chandler, Tempe and Mesa. This totals 180 square miles of territory and is four times larger than the initial service area <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-phoenix-public-193945960.html">back when it launched in 2020</a>. Phoenix also hosts a true open beta of the service, as anyone in the area with the Waymo One app can order up a piping hot robo-car. Waymo opened up a second physical ride-hailing station in the city to help shuttle folks to and from the airport.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has only been in San Francisco for several months, so don’t expect the same kind of growth as seen in Phoenix. Still, Waymo says the service is expanding to new parts of the city, like North Beach and Fisherman’s Wharf. You must be enrolled in the company’s Trusted Tester program to hail a self-driving car in the city for now, as the company’s still waiting for a final permit to open up the program to the general public. To that end, Waymo says there are currently “tens of thousands” of San Francisco residents on the waitlist.</p><p>“Waymo One remains the only and largest 24/7 fully autonomous ride-hailing service in the world — serving thousands of rides in multiple key markets — and we’re scaling quickly,” said Saswat Panigrahi, Waymo Chief Product Officer.</p><p>The company touts more than ten thousand trips per week with a proposed increase to 100,000 trips by next summer. To get there, Waymo says it’s implementing software updates to increase reliability, with improved hand gesture detection, more versatile multi-point maneuvers and new tools to deal with inclement weather. The Alphabet-owned brand is also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymos-driverless-taxi-fleet-will-soon-be-completely-electric-180526724.html"><ins>converting to an all-electric fleet.</ins></a> Finally, Waymo hasn’t forgotten about Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-is-starting-driverless-taxi-tests-in-los-angeles-200542496.html"><ins>its newest trial city,</ins></a> saying it continues to “grow rider-only testing operations” in the area.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/waymo-doubles-service-area-for-its-fleet-of-robo-taxis-163353714.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/05/03/xbox-app-april-2023-update/">fine-tuned</a> its discovery features in the Xbox app for PC this week. In addition, the desktop app’s April update adds the ability to sort by accessibility features and view collections based on how long it takes to finish them.</p><p>Microsoft first let developers add accessibility feature tags to their games in late 2021. Now, you can filter the All PC Games list in the Windows app to show results with specific accessibility features like a steady camera, narrated game menus or custom volume controls (among others). The update brings the desktop app up to speed with Xbox consoles, which already included accessibility filtering.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A byproduct of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-app-howlongtobeat-update-181826770.html">HowLongToBeat integration</a> last year, new collections make it easier to find games based on their approximate completion times. The new “Quick Games to Play” and “Longest Games” collections are on the PC app’s Home Screen. For example, HowLongToBeat’s estimates for <em>Mass Effect 3</em> include 24 1 / 2 hours for the main story, an extra 11 hours to complete side quests and 50 total hours for completionists to wrap it all up. So if you’re hoping to avoid games requiring too much or too little investment, browsing these groups could be a handy way to find a starting point for your next adventure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/xbox-app-for-pc-now-lets-you-find-games-based-on-accessibility-features-and-estimated-playtimes-162001538.html?src=rss

## Astronomers finally spot a star consuming a planet

<p>Scientists know that a dying star will become a giant that swallows all the planets within a certain radius, but they've never seen it happen... before now, that is. Astronomers at Caltech, Harvard, MIT and other schools have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/astronomers-spot-star-swallowing-planet-0503">detected</a> a star consuming one of its orbiting planets as it turns into a red giant. A star about 12,000 light-years away, close to the Aquila constellation, became 100 times brighter for over 10 days in an outburst that researchers say represented a hot jovian world falling into its host star's atmosphere and, ultimately, its core.</p><p>The group first observed the burst in May 2020, but took roughly a year to determine what happened. Thanks to the NEOWISE infrared telescope, the team ruled out merging stars. The energy from the outburst was only a thousandth of what it should have been for a star-on-star collision, and there was a stream of cold dust rather than hot plasma. MIT's Kishalay De, who led the paper, also notes that Jupiter's mass is about a thousandth that of the Sun, providing a handy reference point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This phenomenon is believed to be common in the universe, and it's believed that the Earth and other inner Solar System planets will face a similar demise when the Sun dies roughly 5 billion years from now. In that regard, the astronomers confirmed their existing models. Past studies caught stars just before and after they swallowed planets, but never in mid-digestion.</p><p>There are still unknowns surrounding planet-munching stars. This finding helps complete the picture, though, and De <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-astrophysicists-star-eating-planet">tells</a><em>ScienceNews</em> that the next wave of infrared-capable observatories will increase the chances of finding similar events. That, in turn, could illustrate how these apocalyptic processes vary across the cosmos.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/astronomers-finally-spot-a-star-consuming-a-planet-145950652.html?src=rss

The display offers up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and up to 1,600 nits for HDR playback.</p><div id="2dfaaebb1c11474ebdfeb41f47bcc609"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>There's an ultrawide 12-megapixel front-facing camera that's unfortunately positioned on the narrower edge of the screen, which might make things a little awkward for those who prefer to put their tablet in a keyboard dock while taking video calls.

## The best work-from-home and office essentials for graduates

<p>After they’re done celebrating their academic accomplishments, your grad might already have a new job or internship lined up, or they may be very close to a new opportunity. If so, they’ll want a few essentials that will ease them into the working world, whether they’re dealing with a daily commute or logging on from home. Here are a few gift ideas that they’ll appreciate regardless of where they find themselves doing most of their work.</p><h2>LumeCube Edge Desk Light</h2><p></p><p>Even if your graduate already has an upgraded webcam, bad lighting can prevent them from putting their best face forward when virtually speaking with colleagues. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3JWSSOS">LumeCube Edge Desk Light</a> can fix that with its multiple brightness and warm-light settings, plus a bendable neck that makes it easy to adjust the light’s position. Since it’s quite flexible, they can use it for other things, too, including note-taking and live streaming. And we know they’ll appreciate its built-in USB-C and USB-A charging ports, which will let them conveniently power up their phone, earbuds and more while getting all of their work done. <em>— Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Logitech MX Anywhere 3</h2><p></p><p>Today’s office life is more on-the-go than ever, with workers switching between home, office and maybe the occasional coffee shop in between.

And it really does work anywhere — including on glass surfaces. <em>— Kris Naudus, Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>Logitech Brio 500</h2><p></p><p>There’s a good chance your grad will have to take regular video conference calls at their new job, even if they go into the office from time to time.

The Brio 500 shoots 1080p video and they can customize aspects of their feed, including brightness, contrast and additive filters, by using the free Logi Tune software. But most of the time, the cam will do the hard work for them: it has remarkably good auto-light correction, which will help them look better in dark environments, noise-reducing dual microphones and auto-framing with RightSight. If the latter is enabled, your grad can shift in their chair and move around and the Brio 500 will adjust automatically to keep them in the center of the frame. And when they’re not on a call, there’s a handy shutter that covers the camera lens for extra privacy. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><p></p><p>Blocking out the world in an attempt to focus isn’t something that only new graduates do — but they, too, can benefit from having a little help in that area.

The XM5 are Sony’s latest flagship model and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html">best wireless headphones</a> you can get right now by our standards. Sony packs so much into these cans: improved noise cancellation, excellent sound quality, handy touch controls and a 30-hour battery life, just to name a few things. Their redesigned design makes them even more comfortable to wear for hours on end, and their ability to connect to two devices at once means your giftee can easily switch from taking a call on their phone to listening to music on their laptop. <em>— V.P.</em></p><h2>Keychron K10</h2><p></p><p>Laptop keyboards are fine when you’re working on the go, but having a separate keyboard at work or in your home office will make long stretches of typing much more comfortable. There are tons of options out there, but <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k10-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron’s K10</a> would be a good pick for almost anyone. It’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard with Gateron switches that’s neither too loud or too subtle. Keyboards like this are far and away more fun to type on than standard laptop built-ins, and the K10 shouldn’t be too noisy to annoy a cubicle neighbor or a roommate. We like that you can pair it with up to three devices simultaneously and it can be used wired or wirelessly. It also has more than 15 different styles of RBG backlighting, so you can switch between something more subdued and an all-out light show with a few presses of a button. <em>— V.P.</em></p><h2>Sonos Era 100</h2><p></p><p>Laptop speakers are <em>fine</em> for playing music while you work, but to do <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lofi-girl-is-back-and-she-made-a-synthwave-friend-182928515.html">lofi chill hop beats</a> justice, your grad may appreciate a quality speaker.

It looks great on a shelf thanks to its clean, compact design and it comes in white or black, so you can match it to your home’s aesthetic. It has a line-in port for turntable or other auxiliary connections, and is one of Sonos’ first plug-in models that includes Bluetooth connectivity. However, most people will likely use Wi-Fi connectivity and Sonos’ app to control their streaming services of choice.  — <em>Amy Skorheim, Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>BenQ ScreenBar</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CZW5RLVNjcmVlbkJhci1BdXRvLURpbW1pbmctQWRqdXN0bWVudC1TY3JlZW5CYXJfQmxhY2svZHAvQjA3NlZORlpKRz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXdiLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxOGFjNTNkMi1kNDY0LTQyMTUtYjg1OS0zZDM5MmJlMDlmYjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVybDzZqKWKj-u3HcmxQRYifV6lXBsxp7299HUMxEour&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBenQ-ScreenBar-Auto-Dimming-Adjustment-ScreenBar_Black%2Fdp%2FB076VNFZJG%3Fth%3D1">BenQ Screenbar</a> put the finishing touch on our weekend editor Igor Bonifacic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/benq-screenbar-irl-131550958.html">WFH setup</a> – he even said the soft glow helps dispel the gloom of a Canadian winter. The lighting fixture mounts at the top of a monitor, making it ideal for small setups where a desk lamp wouldn’t fit. A sensor automatically dims and adjusts color temperature according to the room’s ambient light, or you can change it yourself with the buttons on top. The one drawback is that the ScreenBar takes up the same real estate on a monitor as a webcam would. If you think your grad will be on a lot of Zoom calls, this might not be the best fit. – <em>A.S.</em></p><h2>Bellroy Transit Workpack</h2><p></p><p>If your grad’s first gig is hybrid, freelance or in-office, there’s a good chance they’ll be on the move a lot. Daypacks and laptop bags specifically designed for work are easy to carry like a standard backpack, but include enough pockets and pouches to organize the necessities of a modern work day.

Grads who plan to travel or are trying their hand at the digital nomad lifestyle will appreciate the multiple hours of juice the Powerstation can deliver to their phone, laptop and peripherals. It can give an iPhone 14 more than three charges and has a trio of USB-C ports to refill multiple devices at once. Best of all for someone entering the workforce, it comes in a fabric-covered case that looks professional.  <em>– A.S.</em></p><h2>Elevation Lab Go Stand</h2><p></p><p>Some advice if you end up buying the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGV2YXRpb25sYWIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvc3RhbmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE4YWM1M2QyLWQ0NjQtNDIxNS1iODU5LTNkMzkyYmUwOWZiNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAShYrosWwbsYJsjNePTbRJmPyYMRVRrEry2iTnSH7czm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elevationlab.com%2Fproducts%2Fgostand">Go Stand</a> for your grad: snag one for yourself, too. This clever folding stand holds a phone or tablet at an adjustable angle, so the screen is easy to read, sans an awkward balancing act. I use one daily to keep my phone visible on my desk and I find it works better than any stand built into a phone or tablet case. It folds to a tiny flat wedge that fits in a pocket when not in use, and it has a nice rubberized, non-skid texture. I ended up buying a second one when my family kept stealing mine. <em>– A.S.</em></p><h2>Roost laptop stand</h2><p></p><p>Hunching to stare at a desk-level laptop is hard on anyone’s back and neck. You can help protect your grad’s posture with a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/">Roost laptop stand</a> that raises nearly any laptop to eye level. I’ve used a previous generation Roost for about four years running and it still works like it did when it was brand new. It folds down to a skinny stick and fits in any pack that can hold a laptop. Once unfurled, it can accommodate nearly any notebook, including larger ones like a 16-inch MacBook Pro. One thing to note is that your grad won’t be able to use their computer’s trackpad or keys when the stand is in use, so they’ll need an external keyboard and mouse. <em>– A.S.</em></p><h2>Uplift standing desk</h2><p></p><p>There are endless brands selling standing desks now, and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51cGxpZnRkZXNrLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE4YWM1M2QyLWQ0NjQtNDIxNS1iODU5LTNkMzkyYmUwOWZiNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUUf9qpnQd8Pn_lvDtrRdk7i1F4a1Isbh7oT1q_MVPJa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.upliftdesk.com%2F">Uplift</a> makes some of the best ones. The V2 model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uplift-standing-desk-irl-163028001.html">I bought</a> has made my workdays far more comfortable. After two and a half years, it still raises up and lowers down multiple times a day, all week long without complaint. If your grad will be working from home, a standing desk will make a difference since experts advise incorporating some movement throughout the day. That said, this is no small investment and the amount of customization Uplift offers verges on overwhelming. If you don’t know exactly what your grad might want, you may be better off skipping the surprise and ordering the unit with them. If that’s not possible, the company does offer <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51cGxpZnRkZXNrLmNvbS9naWZ0Y2VydGlmaWNhdGVzLnBocCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMThhYzUzZDItZDQ2NC00MjE1LWI4NTktM2QzOTJiZTA5ZmI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAARNZ3trhzTVtWwrTqVLtMAs6P27bORDlSDuXQKKdccAR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.upliftdesk.com%2Fgiftcertificates.php">gift certificates</a>. <em>– A.S.</em></p><h2>ErgoFoam Adjustable Foot Rest</h2><p></p><p>A dedicated footrest can help your legs feel more comfortable during those long stretches of being stuck at your desk.

This model has a removable, two-inch base that you can take off if you find the standard height uncomfortable. It can also be flipped over and used as a foot rocker if you want to move your feet around while working. None of this is a substitute for periodically getting up and moving over the course of the day, but when that’s not feasible, it can help. <em>— Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>Nekteck 107W USB-C Desktop Charger</h2><p></p><p>In the eternal struggle to keep all our devices charged, it’s easy to see the convenience of a desktop charging station that puts multiple ports within arm’s reach throughout the workday.

It packs four ports in a relatively compact frame: two USB-C, plus two USB-A for lower-power gadgets. The two USB-C ports top out at 65W and 30W, respectively. The former isn’t powerful enough to charge some heavy-duty laptops like a MacBook Pro at full speed, but it’s still usable, and both can refill many phones, tablets and smaller notebooks quickly. We’ve found Nekteck chargers to be reliable and this device is certified by the <a href="https://www.usb.org/">USB-IF</a>, so it shouldn’t present any safety concerns over time. Best of all, it’s a good deal at $40, and it comes with a six-foot USB-C to USB-C cable in the box. <em>— J.D.</em></p><h2>Sorbus 3-Tier Bamboo Desk Organizer</h2><p></p><p>As you accumulate more papers, accessories and random tchotchkes at your desk, it’s easy for your workspace to become cluttered.

<p>Whether you make music, podcast, stream or simply enjoy listening to any of these things, a good audio interface is going to make all the difference. Your laptop or PC’s built-in sound will be just fine for most pedestrian tasks, but for creators it’s likely going to fall short of what you need.</p><p>The good news is there’s a wealth of options tailored to a variety of specific needs and use cases. The less-good news is that it can be a bit overwhelming trying to decide which one is the best for you. Which is why we’ve cooked up this guide, in which we highlight the best options whether you simply want to record a guitar, or go live to an audience of thousands (or to at least sound good while you work on that number).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And don’t worry about being overwhelmed with jargon, we’ll focus on the task in hand over the kHz and decibels so that you know which is best for the results you want without feeling like you’ve just come out of a math class.</p><h2>Best for those on a budget</h2><p>Audio interfaces aren’t just for creators. Maybe you work from home and want to be able to use a high-quality XLR microphone for work calls. Or perhaps you prefer to have physical controls for your headphones and mic? Or maybe you just appreciate the superior audio from a dedicated device to the one that came with your PC. If so, you likely don’t need to spend too much money - here are three options that won’t break the bank.</p><h3>M-Audio M-Track Solo</h3><p></p><p>It’s certainly not the prettiest device on this list, but what the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NLUF1ZGlvLU0tVHJhY2stU29sby1JbnRlcmZhY2UtUG9kY2FzdGluZy9kcC9CMDhRMU5KU0JRP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXc4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZmM0YzU1MS0xNmVjLTRiZTItYTRmOS1hYjcwZjE0MzU2ZmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVVdrwbc7Ex7wOgGhwNnAm89tVEd3bP9IViJvMFmh_ta&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FM-Audio-M-Track-Solo-Interface-Podcasting%2Fdp%2FB08Q1NJSBQ%3F">M-Track Solo</a> ($49) lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up for in functionality for the price. If you’re just looking for something to plug a microphone or guitar into - or both at the same time - the M-Track Solo is hard to beat.</p><p>For would-be podcasters, there’s also the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NLUF1ZGlvLU0tVHJhY2stRHVvLUludGVyZmFjZS1Qb2RjYXN0aW5nL2RwL0IwOFExVjc3TlI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdzgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRmYzRjNTUxLTE2ZWMtNGJlMi1hNGY5LWFiNzBmMTQzNTZmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARt2DPICSc8L0WKcfNIA7plLHJWIgHQ1TUlQ0COZbCgk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FM-Audio-M-Track-Duo-Interface-Podcasting%2Fdp%2FB08Q1V77NR">M-Track Duo</a> ($70) which adds a second XLR microphone connection so you can invite guests over and record them on their own channel making editing a lot easier - and you won’t need to get intimate with them as you share a microphone. There’s not a lot in terms of frills here, like MIDI or effects, but for the price it’s a solid choice.</p><h3>Presonos AudioBox iOne</h3><p></p><p>Unlike other PC components, like graphics cards, digital sound has natural limits meaning that older devices can still be relevant today - and often at a better price. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QcmVTb251cy1BdWRpb0JveC1pT25lLUF1ZGlvLUludGVyZmFjZS9kcC9CMDBLQk1BSlU4P3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdzgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRmYzRjNTUxLTE2ZWMtNGJlMi1hNGY5LWFiNzBmMTQzNTZmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS893qjVKDOT-3v7vRRmGcCAQdcVe0cF7eCb7Udc6ceR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPreSonus-AudioBox-iOne-Audio-Interface%2Fdp%2FB00KBMAJU8%3Fth%3D1">Presonos’ AudioBox iOne</a> ($70) is one such example. It’s primarily intended for creators that work with music software, but it’s a great all-around audio interface with all the essential connectivity for a now-reduced price.</p><p>As a bonus, the AudioBox iOne works well with iPads, too - not a guarantee at this price point. Though some might find the headphone amplification on the low side, in case that’s a feature important to you.</p><h3>Focusrite Scarlett Solo</h3><p></p><p>There’s a reason why Focusrite’s Scarlett series of interfaces appear on so many recommendation lists - including two spots on this one: They offer a great balance of performance, reliability and price. At around $130, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb2N1c3JpdGUtU2NhcmxldHQtQXVkaW8tSW50ZXJmYWNlLVRvb2xzL2RwL0IwN1FSNloxSkI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdzgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRmYzRjNTUxLTE2ZWMtNGJlMi1hNGY5LWFiNzBmMTQzNTZmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATwL6gxLlFBmKAdaOPsQrUvQ03Tr_aPcd97uhSeST1HD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFocusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools%2Fdp%2FB07QR6Z1JB">Solo</a> is not the absolute cheapest you can find, but it will get you started in streaming, podcasting and beyond just fine. In fact, if you just want a port for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">an XLR mic</a>, improved headphone amplification and easy connections for speakers, the Solo could be the only interface you ever need that won’t feel underpowered or even as your needs evolve.</p><h2>Best for streamers</h2><figure><img alt="Four audio interfaces for streaming are pictured next to each other." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/bc128150-e9c2-11ed-bb8f-9e0d10d1f919" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the streaming category is one of the busiest when it comes to audio interfaces. That’s partly because most Twitchers and YouTubers have several different audio feeds to manage. As such, products in this category come with a software component that lets you pipe your microphone, your group chat and your game audio to different places. Thankfully, this isn’t as confusing as it sounds - not with one of the following devices at least.</p><h3>Roland Bridge Cast</h3><p></p><p>Roland might be best known for its musical equipment, but the company does a sideline in streaming gear and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL0JyaWRnZUNhc3QtLXJvbGFuZC1icmlkZ2UtY2FzdC1kdWFsLWJ1cy1nYW1pbmctYXVkaW8tbWl4ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRmYzRjNTUxLTE2ZWMtNGJlMi1hNGY5LWFiNzBmMTQzNTZmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVQ0ee97fDRMl47lh2vCQ0y1niOW1CwS-6wuKgYbzvOk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FBridgeCast--roland-bridge-cast-dual-bus-gaming-audio-mixer">Bridge Cast</a> ($299) is one of the strongest in this category. There are four hardware volume dials so you can adjust the mix of your mic, chat and game etc. in real time, and you can even control separate “submixes” for you and your audience in real time.</p><p>On top of the mix controls, there are some voice effects, microphone EQ and dedicated mute buttons for everything - these can also be used to trigger samples, too. With the option to pipe in phone audio via an aux port, Roland has made a strong case for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-bridge-cast-audio-streaming-interface-220058414.html">Bridge Cast</a> as the streamer’s interface of choice.</p><h3>TC Helicon GoXLR Mini</h3><p></p><p>The original GoXLR was one of the first audio interfaces that really focused on what streamers wanted. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IZWxpY29uLU9ubGluZS1Ccm9hZGNhc3QtSW50ZXJmYWNlLVByZWFtcC9kcC9CMDdYSDQxRExOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXc4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZmM0YzU1MS0xNmVjLTRiZTItYTRmOS1hYjcwZjE0MzU2ZmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR8LEfFHnntDgcD_8FKowtLop_UUn09F6_OKn1lslCgn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHelicon-Online-Broadcast-Interface-Preamp%2Fdp%2FB07XH41DLN">Mini</a> was released a year later and was a hit in its own right, and remains popular today, long after its initial release. The physical faders give you tactile control over each part of your stream and the connectivity includes a 3.5mm microphone port next to the headphone port - perfect for gaming headsets that use a splitter.</p><p>Additional touches include a !@#$?* button to spare your audience when you get a bit spicy with your language and an optical port so your game console audio sounds pristine. Of course, there’s RGB lighting on the faders which is almost as important as the connectivity, right?</p><h3>Elgato Wave XLR</h3><p></p><p>If you don’t have the budget or, let’s face it, the desk space for a full-sized mixer to control your streams, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FbGdhdG8tV2F2ZS1UYXAtTXV0ZS1NYWMvZHAvQjA5NzM4Q0tLWD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13OC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGZjNGM1NTEtMTZlYy00YmUyLWE0ZjktYWI3MGYxNDM1NmZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZmxGUR8zfqZe1xpP2u7L03WA5GQVOMzwFDEsnDPHcKJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FElgato-Wave-Tap-Mute-Mac%2Fdp%2FB09738CKKX">Elgato’s Wave XLR</a> is the minimalist’s choice. Not only is it discreet, it manages to eke out a lot of functionality from just one clickable knob and a capacitive mute button.</p><p>Despite the simplicity, the Wave XLR still delivers crisp, clear audio. Where it really comes into its own, though, is its modular integration with other Elgato products.

The lightweight USB mixer comes with a screen, but the brains of the operation is the software that creates separate audio feeds for your mic, game, browser and so on.</p><p>For streamers, it means hands on controls and the flexibility of a submix (i.e. the mix you hear and the mix listeners here can be different). Not only is this an elegant solution for those who already have a hardware interface, it means you can enjoy dedicated volume controls for things like YouTube and Spotify when you’re not going live.</p><h2>Best for musicians</h2><p>Whether you pluck strings or drop DJ-bombs, you’re going to want something that provides you all the right ports while delivering rich, bit-perfect sound. Unlike streamers that will want to be able to work with audio from a variety of <em>digital </em>sources, musicians also want to record (and listen to) physical instruments in real time - so all of our selections have a focus on clean sound with good connectivity.</p><h3>Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</h3><p></p><p>Focusrite’s second showing on this list is a little red box that, once you’re aware of it, you’ll start seeing everywhere from live streams to YouTube guitar tutorials.

The preamps - the part that turns your voice or instruments into usable sound – are widely regarded as some of the cleanest at this price range.</p><p>With two combi-ports (there’s no MIDI here) the connectivity is fairly standard, but singers and voice actors in particular will appreciate the “Air” feature that gently adds a sense of space to vocals - a trademark of Focusrite products.</p><h3>Universal Audio Volt 276</h3><p></p><p>When Engadget’s Managing Editor, Terrence O’Brien, reviewed the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Vbml2ZXJzYWwtQXVkaW8tVm9sdC0yNzYtSW50ZXJmYWNlL2RwL0IwOUoxVEwxQjg_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13OC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGZjNGM1NTEtMTZlYy00YmUyLWE0ZjktYWI3MGYxNDM1NmZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfHx0070if0L6jf1uDE1fW-LecER6XxTK4nUl5dYVf59&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUniversal-Audio-Volt-276-Interface%2Fdp%2FB09J1TL1B8%3Fth%3D1">Volt 2/76</a> from Universal Audio he described it as “bringing something special to the table.” It’s a reference to the built-in compressor that emulates the company’s classic 1176 Limiting Amplifier hardware. All you need to know is it’s another tool to make your instrument or vocals sit better in the mix.</p><p>In a world awash with generic audio interfaces, genuinely useful features like this are what makes the Volt series stand out. Alongside the compressor, the Volt 276 has a pair of 5-pin MIDI ports and a button for “vintage” mode. The latter emulates the company’s popular Audio 610 preamp which, according to Universal Audio, was used by Van Halen and Ray Charles. Not bad company to be keeping! At $299, it’s a little on the spendier side, but it's a comprehensive choice for anyone who works with instruments, vocals and outboard MIDI gear.</p><h3>MOTU M6</h3><p></p><p>If you need more connectivity than the standard 2 or 4 inputs, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NT1RVLU02LVVTQi1DLUludGVyZmFjZS1TdHVkaW8tUXVhbGl0eS9kcC9CMEJLUjNZTUI5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXc4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZmM0YzU1MS0xNmVjLTRiZTItYTRmOS1hYjcwZjE0MzU2ZmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdAHXbmEllXDh2JAXlFecFQZ-a-24T8HMFOfOj6UEFhR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMOTU-M6-USB-C-Interface-Studio-Quality%2Fdp%2FB0BKR3YMB9">MOTU’s M6</a> has you covered. As the name suggests, there are inputs for up to six instruments  - four of which can be microphones - and a pair of 5-pin MIDI ports for synthesizers. The M6 can even output CV signals to control even older music gear. The M6 also has dedicated buttons on each input channel for phantom power (for condenser microphones) and real-time headphone monitoring. If all that flexibility wasn’t enough, a small display for volume levels means you have a quick visual reference to make sure you keep your precious recordings out of the red.</p><h2>Best for Podcasters</h2><p>Whether you’re operating from a sound-treated studio or recording under a duvet in the back office, most podcasters have a few needs in common. First and foremost is the option to connect more than one high quality microphone. Second would be the ability to record remote guests easily whether they are using Zoom or calling in on a phone - which requires something called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix-minus">mix minus</a>” and isn’t a standard feature on most interfaces.</p><p>Lastly, many shows will want to be able to play music or audio from other sources in real time. All of the picks in this section exceed those basic requirements, which one is best for you will be determined by budget or specific needs.</p><h3>Focusrite Vocaster Two</h3><p></p><p>From the same company as the acclaimed Scarlett series, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb2N1c3JpdGUtVm9jYXN0ZXItVHdvLVBvZGNhc3RpbmctTGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQvZHAvQjA5WkdUNjRSVj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13OC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGZjNGM1NTEtMTZlYy00YmUyLWE0ZjktYWI3MGYxNDM1NmZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUl85JeWcedOlVFaV_oh-9wJMKhPbZW25ZGW-IvLxA7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFocusrite-Vocaster-Two-Podcasting-Lightweight%2Fdp%2FB09ZGT64RV%3F">Vocaster Two</a> takes all the audio knowledge from its sister series and packages it into a more podcast-friendly format. Not only are there dual XLR mic inputs, there are two headphone ports, each with their own volume control so you and a live guest can podcast together in the same room.</p><p>Thanks to both a 3.5mm and Bluetooth inputs you have multiple options for including “call in guests”. There’s even a 3.5mm output for those who want to make a video-version of their podcast for YouTube - simply plug the Vocaster right into your camera for perfect audio as you record it. What’s more, the “auto gain” and “enhance” features will make sure you and your local guest will sound tippity top without having to apply any external effects.</p><h3>Rodecaster Pro II</h3><p></p><p>If you see yourself taking your podcasting to the next level, then the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2RlLVJvZGVjYXN0ZXItUG9kY2FzdC1Qcm9kdWN0aW9uLUNvbnNvbGUvZHAvQjBCMTdWOE5HWD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13OC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGZjNGM1NTEtMTZlYy00YmUyLWE0ZjktYWI3MGYxNDM1NmZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcX6q7kW5pHTFRPr8Mj6g9Ar9Ltm_M5skkZtbEeD81N1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRode-Rodecaster-Podcast-Production-Console%2Fdp%2FB0B17V8NGX">Rodecaster Pro II</a> from Rode is hard to ignore. With four XLR combi ports, it’s perfect for multi-guest in-person shows, especially as it has physical faders for each channel along with easily accessible mute and solo buttons.</p><p>The Rodecasater Pro II also includes both a 3.5mm/aux port and Bluetooth for plugging in a phone plus dual USB ports that make it easy to feed in audio, like a Zoom call, from a PC or a tablet. Each microphone port has a wealth of effects available to enhance the audio, and the eight rubber pads let you fire off sound effects and intro/outro music at will. The pads can also trigger automated actions like musical fade-ins. In short, the Rodecaster II is quite a powerhouse, but obviously a fair amount more expensive than most interfaces on this list.</p><h2>Best for music listening</h2><p>What we call an audio interface today, we might well have once called a “sound card.” While today’s interfaces also serve up a host of connectivity options, the thing we need them for the most is often just good old fashioned listening to music. While everything on this list will reproduce music to a high standard, Hi-Fi heads might prefer something that will let them interface with more exotic audio formats, audio gear and high-end headphones.</p><h3>Fiio K7</h3><p></p><p>With phono, coaxial, optical and USB inputs, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTc0OTAwMi1SRUcvZmlpb19rN19kZXNrdG9wX3VzYl9kYWMuaHRtbC8_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZmM0YzU1MS0xNmVjLTRiZTItYTRmOS1hYjcwZjE0MzU2ZmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeMI6hd7psmCAevi-riZ8k40chD3-gabSIEp1Vzmi5VO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1749002-REG%2Ffiio_k7_desktop_usb_dac.html%2F%3F">K7 from Fiio</a> is able to handle music and audio from almost any high fidelity source.

Naturally, for the music listener that wants it all, there are jacks for every size of headphone, including 2.5mm and 4.4mm balanced sets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-audio-interfaces-130019808.html?src=rss

<p>Samsung has unveiled its upcoming user interface for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watch-5-pro-is-30-percent-off-right-now-113514406.html">Galaxy Watches</a>, and it comes with new health-related features, with a focus on ones designed to help you get a better quality of sleep. Its new Sleep Insights UI, for instance, now prominently displays your sleep score that's based on several metrics, such as your snoring hours and blood oxygen levels.&nbsp;</p><p>That way, you can easily see why you feel tired even though you've just woken up. Or, you can take note of when you feel especially refreshed in the morning so you can try to replicate anything you did that may have contributed to the quality of sleep you got. In addition, Sleep Coaching is now available on the Watch itself, and not just on its paired phone, allowing you to track your habits more easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung has also added a new running tool called Personalized Heart Rate Zone that analyzes your capabilities and sets five optimal workout intensity levels based on your stats and history. This enables you to set your own goals and achieve new heights when it comes to activity, as you're only competing with yourself.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A product photo showing Samsung's Personalized Heart Rate Zone for the One UI 5 Watch." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/6d84be90-ea76-11ed-be7e-5fb72f5c46fc" style="height: 902px; width: 1558px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>If you like outdoor activities and have a Galaxy Watch Pro, you'll see an improved Route Workout feature that supports running and walking, not just hiking and cycling. Finally, the upcoming Watch UI will have an updated SOS feature that directly connects to an emergency number to relay your location. First responders will also be available to access your medical information when emergency mode is activated. And in case you're 55 or older, fall detection will be activated by default.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung's One UI 5 Watch will officially launch with the next-generation Galaxy Watch series later this year. However, you can register for the beta program on the Samsung Members app starting this month  if you have a Watch 4 or a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review-battery-life-specs-durability-180052187.html">Watch 5</a> device.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A product photo showing Samsung One UI 5 Watch's fall detection, SOS feature and medical info screens." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a135c6d0-ea76-11ed-bf7d-fa761f69d053" style="height: 1010px; width: 1532px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watches-will-soon-help-you-get-a-better-nights-sleep-130001529.html?src=rss

## UK competition watchdog opens review into AI models

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-launches-initial-review-of-artificial-intelligence-models">UK government has announced an initial impact review</a> in response to the continued growth and concerns around generative AI and learning language models. The investigation will reportedly look at how the creation and distribution of AI technology impact five wide-reaching areas: appropriate transparency and explainability; accountability and governance; safety, security and robustness; fairness; and contestability and redress. Overall, the review aims to learn how AI foundation models can, and likely will, impact both competition and consumer protections.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulating bodies tasked with finding the answers include the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which helps people and businesses in competitive markets while working against unethical practices. &quot;It's crucial that the potential benefits of this transformative technology are readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information,&quot; Sarah Cardell, CMA's chief executive, said in a statement. &quot;Our goal is to help this new, rapidly scaling technology develop in ways that ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>New advances from leading AI companies like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google have led generative AI tools and learning language models like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bards-new-experiment-updates-page-lets-you-know-whats-new-091039433.html">Google Bard</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-begins-making-bing-chat-ai-searches-available-to-everyone-102506412.html">Bing Chat</a>, to rise in popularity. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html">companies race to include AI-generation tools</a> and other model-based features, evaluations can determine whether checks need to be put in place.</p><p>The announcement follows last month's news that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-is-creating-a-100-million-ai-taskforce-143507868.html">UK is spending £100 million (~$125.7 million) to launch a Foundational Model Taskforce</a>. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan aim to create &quot;sovereign&quot; AI technology to help the economy without falling into ethical and logistical problems that have arisen with other programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar regulations and concerns are occurring in the US, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-will-invest-140-million-to-launch-seven-new-national-ai-research-institutes-090026144.html">Biden administration also announcing sweeping efforts to evaluate and regulate AI</a>. The US will put $140 million towards seven new research and development centers within the National Science Foundation, garnered commitments from key AI developers to publicly evaluate their systems at DEFCON 31 and tasked the Office of Management and Budget with establishing AI policies for federal employees.

## 'Polite Society' director Nida Manzoor says Spotify knows her too well

<p>Like a delirious cross between <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> and <em>Bend It Like Beckham</em>, Nida Manzoor's debut feature <em>Polite Society</em> isn't your usual coming of age flick. It centers on Ria Khan (Priya Kansara), a British Pakistani teen who dreams of becoming a stunt woman, but finds herself at a loss when her sister decides to marry a handsome young doctor. To help save her sister, she has to overcome the groom’s overbearing mother, a wonderfully sinister Nimra Bucha, and make her way through a series of knock down, drag out fights. It's the only film where you'll find wuxia wire work, a surprisingly aggressive recreation of<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1VWTVwalprS281YyZ0PTI4OHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZjZGYzZmIxLTk0ZWUtNGIyMC1hMTNiLWZjMzdjZTk0NGY5MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVcSu6ohA6pCpDaAb4gXGgIjNk3yCtmVotYD83JMQXA3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUY5pjZkKo5c%26t%3D288s"><ins>a classic Bollywood dance sequence</ins></a> and sisterly bonding all in one place.</p><p>Manzoor started out as a television writer and director, most recently with the critically acclaimed (and also kick-ass) Peacock series <em>We Are Lady Parts</em>. I had a chance to chat with her as <em>Polite Society</em> hit US theaters last week, and I had one major question in mind: How does she live with tech?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="88cc613d0d9e4f55803d23b3464239c9"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Like any modern artist, Manzoor relies on gadgets for work and play, but she leans on her love of music the most. "I'm always building playlists," she said, "I've been relying on Spotify to hook me up with new stuff, and the algorithm knows me better than I know myself at this point." She listens to tunes mostly on a pair of "low key" JBL headphones, but given all of her traveling for film promotion these days, I recommended a pair of AirPods Pro or AirPods Max to help drown out the plane noise.</p><p><em>Polite Society's</em> score, composed by her brother Shez Manzoor and Tom Howe (<em>Ted Lasso</em>), exemplifies the film's cross-cultural sensibilities. It flips between a dhol drum, bombastic orchestral compositions, and hard rocking electric guitar as easily as Priya Kansara delivers a flying kick to the head. (And where else will you find such an inspired recreation of Maar Daala from <em>Devdas</em>?)</p><figure><img alt="Nida Manzoor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/49208dd0-e9eb-11ed-bfa9-e51f4ff9f213" style="height: 1700px; width: 2267px;" /><figcaption><em>Polite Society</em> director Nida Manzoor.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Focus Features</div></figure><p>So sure, Manzoor is a proven music nerd. But what if she could only use one of her existing devices for the rest of her life? (Just imagine a global catastrophe leads us to a <em>Mad Max </em>situation, where only the old gadgets survive.) As a writer, she chose the obvious: Her laptop. "Anything that has letters on it and I can write some jokes, then I'm happy," she said. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-shows-to-binge-watch-over-the-holidays-in-2022-141502077.html"><em><ins>Station Eleven</ins></em></a>, we could always use someone who can document the downfall of civilization as a stage play.</p><p>When it comes to older tech that she misses the most, Manzoor laments the loss of flip phones. "You can get off the phone, flip, and it's kind of a nice punctuation at the end of the call," she said. She also has a fondness for the old modem sounds that connected you to the internet, before broadband and fast cellular networks made it seamless. "There's the simple beauty of being able to only use it at <em>this</em> time<em>, </em>and <em>this way</em>," she said. (That's not too surprising to hear, since criticism of <em>We Are Lady Parts</em> effectively<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/nida-manzoor-polite-society-we-are-lady-parts-series-two-interview"><ins>drove Manzoor off of social media.</ins></a>)</p><div id="ecfc2880756a4c068ed69a2718210906"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Looking ahead, Manzoor is hoping for the day when we can download skills to our brains like Neo in <em>The Matrix</em>. Yes, she wants to learn Kung Fu, but without the months of training her actors went through. That's<a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-neuralink-and-other-bc-is-can-and-cant-do-140014162.html"><ins>not something we can do yet with brain-computer interfaces</ins></a><ins>&nbsp;</ins>(BCIs), but if the technology keeps progressing, it may happen sooner than you think.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/polite-society-nida-manzoor-interview-spotify-120042431.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: White House proposes a 30 percent tax on electricity used for crypto mining

<p>The Biden administration wants to impose a 30 percent tax, called the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-proposes-30-percent-tax-on-electricity-used-for-crypto-mining-090342986.html">Digital Asset Mining Energy or DAME excise tax</a>, on the electricity used for cryptocurrency mining. It explained it wants to tax crypto-mining companies because they aren't paying for the &quot;full cost they impose on others,&quot; including environmental pollution and high energy prices.</p><p>Does mining crypto-currency use that much power? Yes. In April, <em>The New York Times </em>published a report detailing the energy used by the 34 large-scale Bitcoin miners in the US. Just those 34 operations together use the same amount of electricity as three million households. If the proposal becomes law, the government will impose the excise tax in phases. It would start by adding a 10 percent tax on miners' electricity use in the first year, 20 percent in the second, and 30 percent from the third year onwards.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Slack is getting in on the GPT AI trend

<p>At its World Tour NYC event, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/salesforce-buys-slack-210947704.html">Salesforce</a> has introduced Slack GPT, which it describes as a three-pronged vision that integrates AI features into the business messaging app. Slack GPT is comprised of AI-powered features built natively into the app, a new AI-ready platform that was recently made available to developers, and the availability of Einstein GPT in the app that will power its ability to instantly generate insights and summaries. <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2023/03/07/einstein-generative-ai/">Einstein GPT</a> was developed by Salesforce as a generative AI for customer relationship management (CRM) and could assist businesses with tasks related to sales.&nbsp;</p><p>The integrated AI features will give users access to a workflow builder that doesn't require them to know how to code. In it, they can automatically create or update a canvas, which is Slack's tool designed for collaboration. Users can also summon Einstein GPT to summarize Huddle calls and create canvases from those calls, simply by clicking a button. That said, companies don't have to stick to using Einstein GPT only. They can integrate large language models of their choice into the new AI-ready Slack platform, including OpenAI's. In fact, a Claude (Anthropic) app is now available for Slack, while the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/chatgpt-app-for-slack/">ChatGPT app</a> for the messaging service is currently in beta. Salesforce assures customers that Anthropic and OpenAI will not take data from their Slack apps to train their language models.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Salesforce said Slack GPT is being developed to boost users' productivity and gave several examples of how its features could be used. For sales, teams could use those features to auto-generate account channel summaries, create canvases for investors and create customer recommendations. Customer service agents can use AI-generated solutions and responses to quickly resolve issues and auto-generate case summaries. Developers can use the features to scan for channel activities and summarize root cause analysis when identifying solutions for issues in their software. The AI tools could also auto-generate image and copy for blogs, email campaigns and social media posts for marketers. At the moment, Slack GPT's native AI capabilities, the new AI-ready platform and the Einstein GPT app for Slack are still in development, and it's unclear when they're going to roll out.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Slack GPT, Salesforce has also announced its plans to collaborate with Accenture &quot;to accelerate the deployment of generative AI for CRM.&quot; The companies are apparently planning to provide businesses and organizations with the technology and help they need to be able to adopt Einstein GPT to increase productivity and improve customer experiences.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/slack-is-getting-in-on-the-gpt-ai-trend-090054594.html?src=rss

## Biden Administration will invest $140 million to launch seven new National AI Research Institutes

<p>Ahead of a meeting between Vice President Kamala Harris and the heads of America's four leading AI tech companies — Alphabet, OpenAI, Anthropic and Microsoft — the Biden Administration announced Thursday a sweeping series of planned actions to help mitigate some of the risks that these emerging technologies pose to the American public. That includes $140 million to launch seven new AI R&amp;D centers as part of the National Science Foundation, extracting commitments from leading AI companies to participate in a &quot;public evaluation&quot; of their AI systems at DEFCON 31, and ordering the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to draft policy guidance for federal employees.</p><p>&quot;The Biden Harris administration has been leading on these issues since long before these newest generative AI products debuted last fall,&quot; a senior administration official said during a reporters call Wednesday. The Administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-unveils-its-blueprint-for-an-ai-bill-of-rights-175912494.html">unveiled its AI Bill of Rights &quot;blueprint&quot; last October</a>, which sought to &quot;help guide the design, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automated systems so that they protect the rights of the American public,&quot; per <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/10/04/blueprint-for-an-ai-bill-of-rightsa-vision-for-protecting-our-civil-rights-in-the-algorithmic-age/">a White House press release</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;At a time of rapid innovation, it is essential that we make clear the values we must advance, and the common sense we must protect,&quot; the administration official continued. &quot;With [Thursday's announcement] and the blueprint for an AI bill of rights, we've given company and policymakers and the individuals building these technologies, some clear ways that they can mitigate the risks [to consumers].&quot;</p><p>While the federal government does already <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf">have authority to protect the citizenry and hold companies accountable</a>, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-warns-tech-companies-against-ai-shenanigans-that-harm-consumers-175851417.html">the FTC demonstrated Monday</a>, &quot;there's a lot the federal government can do to make sure we get AI right,&quot; the official added — like found seven brand new National AI Research Institutes as part of the NSF. They'll act to collaborate research efforts across academia, the private sector and government to develop ethical and trustworthy in fields ranging from climate, agriculture and energy, to public health, education, and cybersecurity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We also need companies and innovators to be our partners in this work,&quot; the White House official said. &quot;Tech companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure and that they protect people's rights before they're deployed or made public tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>To that end, the Vice President is scheduled to meet with tech leaders at the White House on Thursday for what is expected to be a &quot;frank discussion about the risks we see in current and near-term AI development,&quot; the official said. &quot;We're also aiming to underscore the importance of their role on mitigating risks and advancing responsible innovation, and will discuss how we can work together to protect the American people from the potential harms of AI so that they can reach the benefits of these new technology.&quot;</p><p>The Administration also announced that it has obtained &quot;independent commitment&quot; from more than a half dozen leading AI companies — Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI and Stability AI — to put their AI systems up for public evaluation at <a href="https://defcon.org/">DEFCON 31</a> (August 10-13th). There, thousands of attendees will be able to poke and prod around in these models to see if they square with the Biden admin's stated principles and practices of the Blueprint. Finally, the OMB will issue guidance to federal employees in coming months regarding official use of the technology and help establish specific policies for agencies to follow, and allow for public comment before those policies are finalized.</p><p>&quot;These are important new steps to come out responsible innovation and to make sure AI improved people's lives, without putting rights and safety at risk,&quot; the official noted.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-will-invest-140-million-to-launch-seven-new-national-ai-research-institutes-090026144.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/with-the-help-of-openai-discord-is-finally-adding-conversation-summaries-160030905.html">Discord</a> is making &quot;<a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">big changes</a>&quot; to how identities work on the platform, a move that will force you to change your username, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23710259/discord-new-username-discriminators-number-tag"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported. Up until now, the company has appended four-digit tags to identities as a way to distinguish people with the same username. However, the new system will give everyone a unique username, much like Twitter, Instagram and other services.</p><p>&quot;The whole point of these changes is that we want to make it a lot easier for you and all the new users coming to Discord to connect and hang out with friends,&quot; co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy wrote in a blog post. &quot;We know that your username and identity are important, and we understand that some of you may not like this change and disagree with it.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The original aim with the four-digit tags was to allow you to choose any username you wanted, but it has now become &quot;technical debt,&quot; according to Discord. The company said that the usernames are &quot;too complicated or obscure&quot; for people to remember.&nbsp;</p><p>The new system will be implemented over &quot;the coming weeks,&quot; and you'll receive a message when it's possible to do so. If you've been on the site (founded in 2015) for a long time, you'll get priority over newer users, Discord said. Your previous username and discriminator will continue to function as an alias, so friends will still be able to find you.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/discord-will-force-you-to-update-your-username-074556340.html?src=rss

## Microsoft opens Bing AI for public testing, no waitlist required

<p>Bing AI is now open to all—sort of. Three months after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">debuting its revamped search engine</a>, Microsoft has announced that it's now moving into open preview. You'll still need to sign into Bing on the Edge browser (or the Bing mobile apps) to use the chatbot, but at least you no longer have to deal with a waitlist.</p><p>As if to celebrate this new phase of Bing (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-bing-runs-on-the-new-gpt-4-model-184121316.html">powered by OpenAI's GPT-4</a>), Microsoft is also rolling out several new features. For one, it can go beyond mere text responses to deliver charts, graphs and rich formatting. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-brings-dall-es-ai-image-generation-to-bing-and-edge-152749735.html">Bing Image Creator</a>, which taps into DALL-E to craft AI-generated pictures, also now supports the more than 100 languages that Bing's standard search offers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Bing AI chat" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/41417470-ea2d-11ed-bb7b-f2c7741001ea" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft also says it's working on multi-modal support, which would allow you to upload images to search for specific content. You could, for example, ask Bing to search for furniture that matches a unique bookcase in your home.</p><p>Dedicated users will likely appreciate the addition of conversation histories. Previously, your chats with Bing AI would disappear into the ether. Now, you'll be able to continue older discussions at will. Microsoft is also trying to optimize the user experience a bit: If you click into a link from a chat result, your conversation will be moved into the Edge sidebar for easy reference.</p><figure><img alt="Bing AI chat" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4140b120-ea2d-11ed-afff-117d21ab7d2a" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Slowly, but surely, we're seeing Bing's AI integration blossom from a mere technical test into something that we can rely on as much as Microsoft Office.  The company says it's also working on bringing over context from previous chats into your conversations, and it'll soon be adding share and export features. Improved summarization will also make Bing better at breaking down PDFs, documents or long websites. Beware, college professors everywhere.</p><p>As you'd expect, Microsoft also wants to fashion Bing's AI chat into a genuine platform. The company will soon offer third-party plugins to do things like confirm a reservation through OpenTable, or fetch complex math solutions from Wolfram|Alpha. It'll be interesting to see how Microsoft manages those plugins though: How will those services be approved? And will they be able to access any of your data beyond the conversation they're being used in?</p><p>The Edge browser is getting its fair share of upgrades soon, as well. Microsoft says we'll eventually see a &quot;sleeker and enhanced&quot; interface, thanks to rounded corners and semi-transparent elements. (Let's just hope the company doesn't go all Vista with it.) Edge will also be empowered by Bing AI in new ways: Edge's built-in chat could show you places to watch a particular movie you're searching about. You'll also be able to Bing chat directly about websites you're viewing in the Edge mobile apps.</p><p>Microsoft will surely have more AI and Edge announcements in tow for its Build conference at the end of the month. Mostly, though, I'm wondering how the company plans to pitch Bing's AI chat to general users. Microsoft doesn't need to try very hard to get tech enthusiasts hyped up, but how can it explain why anyone else should care?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-opens-bing-ai-public-testing-no-waitlist-070024329.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-boring-company-plans-to-significantly-expand-after-funding-round-124527584.html">The Boring Company</a> (TBC) can now officially say that it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-boring-company-tunnel-expansion-las-vegas-080509791.html">expanding</a> its tunnel network underneath Las Vegas by 25 miles, which will add 18 new stations to its original plan. If you'll recall, TBC, which is owned by Elon Musk, originally envisioned the Vegas Loop as an underground transportation system with 29 miles of tunnels and 51 stations. Now, the current plan is to build 65 miles of tunnels with 69 stations after the commissioners at Clark County, Nevada have approved its latest expansion.&nbsp;</p><div id="8b27b58f600944728aa5570b9aabc548"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Vegas Loop is expanding - 65 miles and 69 stations!

The lone dissenting vote came from Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick, who raised concerns about the transit system servicing only tourists and not taking resort and casino employees into account. Apparently, Kirkpatrick has been getting calls from people her district, because it's been getting harder and harder for them to get to work due to the tunnels' construction. TBC's lawyer said the company has plans to expand to residential areas near the strip to accommodate workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, the Vegas Loop is still just around 2 miles long with five stops around the Las Vegas Convention Center. TBC plans to dig more tunnels connecting the network to the Harry Reid International Airport, Allegiant Stadium, downtown Las Vegas and even to Los Angeles. <em>TechCrunch</em> says some of the newly approved stations will be located at Las Vegas Boulevard near the airport, as well as in Chinatown, Town Square Las Vegas and Harmon Square.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-boring-company-will-now-build-a-65-mile-tunnel-network-underneath-las-vegas-052042663.html?src=rss
