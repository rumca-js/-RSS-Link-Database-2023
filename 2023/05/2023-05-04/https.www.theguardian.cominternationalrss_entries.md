Schoolkids in loosely assembled groups scampered excitedly through the aisles and about the large swathes of empty outfield seats.

<p>In a terrific acting debut, Park Ji-min visits the country of her birth and decides on a whim to seek out her biological parents – with gripping consequences</p><p>The implacable forces of nature, nurture and destiny are what this movie grapples with; it is a really emotional and absorbing drama about adoption with terrific performances (many from nonprofessional first-timers) and compelling soundtrack musical cues. Franco-Cambodian film-maker Davy Chou directs, co-writing the screenplay with artist Laure Badufle, a Korean adoptee brought up in France whose personal story inspired the film.</p><p>Park Ji-min makes her acting debut in a role that mirrors her own life as well as Badufle’s: a Korean with adoptive French parents. She plays Freddie Benoît, a footloose twentysomething who on a whim comes on a trip to Seoul, checks into a hostel for foreigners and imperiously decides that the polite, French-speaking receptionist Tena, subtly played by author Guka Han, will be her submissive best friend. Freddie is smart, stylish, a badass and force of nature who impulsively invites everyone in a local cafe to join her at her table where she is holding court with Tena and Tena’s shy friend Jiwan (Kim Dong-Seok); she later seduces and then airily rejects him when the poor infatuated guy pathetically declares his eternal love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/04/return-to-seoul-review-absorbing-and-emotional-korean-drama-about-adoption">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With his name in the mix for a Premier League job Ange Postecoglou is helping change attitudes to coaches from outside Europe</p><p>Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou has been mentioned of late as a “surprise candidate” for the vacant Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur jobs. The surprise should be that such links have not materialised sooner, but it is hard to battle the assumption that the best coaches are European or South American. Arsène Wenger came from Japan to take over Arsenal and had a huge influence on English football. Postecoglou, who unlike the Frenchman won the Japanese title, could also be a game changer internationally if he heads to the Premier League and succeeds.</p><p>There is no reason why he would not, provided the right club was chosen. The journey from Australia has been long, hard and impressive. “I didn’t get to this position out of luck,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/01/celtic-ange-postecoglou-michael-beale-luck-jibe">he said earlier this week</a> in response to a jibe from Rangers boss Michael Beale, who said that he was fortunate to have money to spend. “I’ve worked 25 years of coaching to be entrusted at a club like this.
