2021’s Dune did a great job of adapting a dense science fiction novel, but it only gave us half the story. That’s where Dune, Part Two comes in. This highly anticipated sequel covers the second half of Frank Herbert’s original novel, and it introduces a lot of new characters in the process.

Who are these new faces in the Dune-verse? How do they shake up an already complex storyline? Why exactly is Paul riding a Sandworm? Here’s what you need to know about Dune, Part Two after watching the first trailer.

Dune: Part Two stars Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux. The film hits theaters on November 3, 2023.

Top Gun: Maverick proves Star Wars: Rogue Squadron could work, so why can't Disney make it happen? Rogue Squadron was supposed to release in December 2023 but little has been seen of it since its announcement, leading to speculation that it was quietly canceled. However, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy continues to insist that we could still see a Rogue Squadron movie. With Tom Cruise proving the blockbuster appeal of aerial dogfights in 2022's Top Gun sequel, now is exactly the right time for a Star Wars X-Wing and TIE Fighter movie.

## Jedi Survivor’s Lack of Morality Makes it More Fun - Beyond Clips

Star Wars: Jedi Survivor (and Fallen Order) both do an excellent job gamifying the fun parts of being being a Jedi Knight - using the Force, having a Lightsaber, doing flips all over the place - but thankfully, one thing that the studio hasn’t tried to turn into a mechanic is the complex moral challenges of following the Jedi Code. The original Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight did a great job letting players feel like a Jedi, but they also docked them good guy points for choosing/using Force powers associated with the Dark Side, and let’s be real: those are the ones that make for the most fun gameplay. Knights of the Old Republic’s entire narrative is determined by the player making light side or dark side choices, it’s an RPG, not an action game. The Force Unleashed, meanwhile, was fundamentally about using The Force to kick someone’s ass, but it also wasn’t a conventional hero’s journey, as you controlled Galen “Starkiller” Marek. Despite occasional dalliances with the Dark Side, Cal is a hero. He’s a Jedi, and a survivor, and sometimes surviving means bending the occasional Jedi rule - and Jed: Survivor is an action adventure video game, so it’s for the best that players aren’t punished for having a good time.

## Why Order 66 Was The Emperor's Biggest Failure
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGiesN7j2Qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGiesN7j2Qc)

Order 66 is a turning point in the galaxy of Star Wars. Order 66 may be the one moment in galactic history shown the most in Star Wars! Darth Vader started his path with Order 66, scene after scene showing his dark descent. But Order 66 wasn’t exactly the magnum opus that Emperor Palpatine thought it was. Why? Because a whole bunch of Jedi survived to fight the Empire and keep the Jedi religion alive. So how did The Empire fumble the bag this badly? Join us as we break down the Emperor’s biggest failure.

In The Bad Batch, Order 66 is the inciting scene, as is Clone Wars. Order 66 seems pretty thorough- to kill the Jedi, but it actually wasn’t enough; so many survived Order 66, Theme wise, it’s not just about the Jedi who survived Order 66, but the spirits to resist and fight were also Order 66 survivors. Though it traumatized Grogu, Order 66 did not kill him and he and others endured beyond Revenge of the Sith and the scourge of Anakin Skywalker and the Clone Wars remnants. The legend of the Jedi is powerful enough in Star Wars lore, empowering those like Ahsoka Tano. Order 66 may have been intended to extinguish the Jedi, but through the eyes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Order 66 was just a jumping point.

There are also those like Reva; Order 66 may have affected her, but she’s capable along with all known Jedi who survived Order 66, to make a comeback to the side of light. Who survived Order 66 is an ever changing question– the door is never shut and there are more added to all Jedi that survived Order 66. The Jedi that survived Order 66 have way more power than the Emperor could have ever imagined, and are so much more than the sum total of every single Jedi that survived Order 66. The number and the value is incalculable for the Jedi Order and the forces who oppose Emperor Palpatine and what the Empire represents.

## Redfall Review

Redfall reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on PC.

"Redfall is a bafflingly bad time across the board, whether playing solo or with a friend or three suffering alongside you. That it comes in the wake of Arkane’s excellent Deathloop, the enduringly beloved Prey, and the acclaimed Dishonored series honestly beggars belief. Its performance on Xbox Series X is regularly dire, plagued with pop-in, stutters, and a long list of display bugs. It’s beleaguered with bodgy AI enemies that struggle to mount a basic defence, choose appropriate cover, or even effectively navigate the world. The one-note mission design recycles and repurposes itself all the way until the anticlimactic final encounter. Button commands break, characters vanish, and the cheap and static story scenes seem woefully unfinished by typical standards. There may be occasional glimpses of a competent co-op shooter on display but otherwise, Redfall is just like a vampire in all the wrong ways. That is, it really wasn’t ready for daylight in this state, and it sucks."
