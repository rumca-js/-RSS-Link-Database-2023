By the time Final Fantasy 16 launches, it will have been nearly seven years since the launch of the series' last new numbered entry, though honestly, given how Final Fantasy 15 went, it feels like it's been a lot longer since we last got a new mainline instalment in the franchise. 

If, however, FF16 can make good on all of the lofty promises it has made so far – and it sure looks like it may do just that – then surely it's going to be worth the long wait.

Redfall feels like Arkane's Anthem moment. Here's a studio that has made a name of itself as one of the best developers in a specific genre, but has, for some reason, decided to veer completely off track to chase a few trends. Arkane's new open world looter shooter loses so much of what the developer's best games have always been known for, an issue that is exacerbated by the fact that the new things it does attempt, it doesn't really succeed at. 

Redfall is a massive disappointment, and here, we're going to talk about some of the biggest reasons why.
