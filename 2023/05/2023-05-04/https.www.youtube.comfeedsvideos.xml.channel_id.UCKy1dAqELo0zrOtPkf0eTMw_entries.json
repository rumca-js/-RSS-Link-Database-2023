The original Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight did a great job letting players feel like a Jedi, but they also docked them good guy points for choosing/using Force powers associated with the Dark Side, and let\u2019s be real: those are the ones that make for the most fun gameplay. Knights of the Old Republic\u2019s entire narrative is determined by the player making light side or dark side choices, it\u2019s an RPG, not an action game. The Force Unleashed, meanwhile, was fundamentally about using The Force to kick someone\u2019s ass, but it also wasn\u2019t a conventional hero\u2019s journey, as you controlled Galen \u201cStarkiller\u201d Marek. Despite occasional dalliances with the Dark Side, Cal is a hero. He\u2019s a Jedi, and a survivor, and sometimes surviving means bending the occasional Jedi rule - and Jed: Survivor is an action adventure video game, so it\u2019s for the best that players aren\u2019t punished for having a good time.\n\n#IGN #StarWars", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu_SyVXpkLg", "date_published": "2023-05-04 15:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Star Wars: Visions - Volume 2 Exclusive Behind the Scenes Clip (2023) Kathleen Kennedy, James Waugh", "description": "Star Wars: Visions is an animated anthology series featuring celebratory expressions of Star Wars storytelling.

Order 66 may be the one moment in galactic history shown the most in Star Wars! Darth Vader started his path with Order 66, scene after scene showing his dark descent. But Order 66 wasn\u2019t exactly the magnum opus that Emperor Palpatine thought it was. Why? Because a whole bunch of Jedi survived to fight the Empire and keep the Jedi religion alive. So how did The Empire fumble the bag this badly? Join us as we break down the Emperor\u2019s biggest failure.\n\nIn The Bad Batch, Order 66 is the inciting scene, as is Clone Wars. Order 66 seems pretty thorough- to kill the Jedi, but it actually wasn\u2019t enough; so many survived Order 66, Theme wise, it\u2019s not just about the Jedi who survived Order 66, but the spirits to resist and fight were also Order 66 survivors. Though it traumatized Grogu, Order 66 did not kill him and he and others endured beyond Revenge of the Sith and the scourge of Anakin Skywalker and the Clone Wars remnants. The legend of the Jedi is powerful enough in Star Wars lore, empowering those like Ahsoka Tano. Order 66 may have been intended to extinguish the Jedi, but through the eyes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Order 66 was just a jumping point.\n\nThere are also those like Reva; Order 66 may have affected her, but she\u2019s capable along with all known Jedi who survived Order 66, to make a comeback to the side of light. Who survived Order 66 is an ever changing question\u2013 the door is never shut and there are more added to all Jedi that survived Order 66. The Jedi that survived Order 66 have way more power than the Emperor could have ever imagined, and are so much more than the sum total of every single Jedi that survived Order 66. The number and the value is incalculable for the Jedi Order and the forces who oppose Emperor Palpatine and what the Empire represents.\n\n#IGN #StarWars", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGiesN7j2Qc", "date_published": "2023-05-04 13:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Crater - Official Clip (2023) Isaiah Russell-Bailey, Mckenna Grace", "description": "Check out the new Crater clip from the upcoming Disney Plus movie.

That it comes in the wake of Arkane\u2019s excellent Deathloop, the enduringly beloved Prey, and the acclaimed Dishonored series honestly beggars belief. Its performance on Xbox Series X is regularly dire, plagued with pop-in, stutters, and a long list of display bugs. It\u2019s beleaguered with bodgy AI enemies that struggle to mount a basic defence, choose appropriate cover, or even effectively navigate the world. The one-note mission design recycles and repurposes itself all the way until the anticlimactic final encounter. Button commands break, characters vanish, and the cheap and static story scenes seem woefully unfinished by typical standards. There may be occasional glimpses of a competent co-op shooter on display but otherwise, Redfall is just like a vampire in all the wrong ways. That is, it really wasn\u2019t ready for daylight in this state, and it sucks.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxqJ8d9eXks", "date_published": "2023-05-04 08:27:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Is Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Going to Be Too Long? #shorts #spiderman #spiderverse", "description": "The Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is reportedly longer than any other Hollywood animated feature film, and it\u2019s only Part One of an expected two-part Spider-Verse movie slate.
