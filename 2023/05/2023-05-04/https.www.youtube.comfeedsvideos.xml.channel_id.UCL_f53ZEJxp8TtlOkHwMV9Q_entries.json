Peterson and journalist David Zweig discuss his role in breaking the Twitter Files, government censorship in society, the extent to which lockdowns were effective, how they affected children in particular, and how one renegade church would not bow to overzealous regulation.\n\nDavid Zweig is a writer and journalist, with multiple books published, such as \u201cInvisibles\u201d in 2014 and the upcoming \u201cAbundance of Caution\u201d that centers on the effects of the COVID-19 response on schools and children. He was also one of the journalists who helped break the Twitter Files, focusing on the suppression of information to the satisfaction of the U.S. government and the public health establishment.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nElysium Health: Get 25% off your first monthly plan!
