  <p id="aajklC">An audacious new effort to pull carbon dioxide out of the Pacific Ocean as a way to fight climate change is being backed by fossil fuel giants and Big Tech. But the nascent technology, called “direct ocean capture” (DOC), still has a long way to go to prove that it works — and that it won’t cause any new problems.</p>
<p id="qewqkO">Caltech researchers founded the startup Captura, which just <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/04/2661520/0/en/Captura-s-100-ton-carbon-removal-system-to-be-installed-at-AltaSea-at-the-Port-of-Los-Angeles.html">announced</a> a new project today. Captura was founded in 2021 and won a $1 million award from Elon Musk’s XPrize competition the following year. Now, with funding from the US’s biggest gas utility, Captura’s setting up its biggest pilot project yet at the Port of Los Angeles. </p>

  <p id="pcyUBf">Apple surpassed Wall Street expectations and said it had reached an all-time high in services revenue and set a new March quarter record for iPhone revenue in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/">a report</a> on its second quarter earnings on Thursday.

  <p id="NOoe6i">The co-founder of Pluto TV, Ilya Pozin, wants to give away free ad-supported TVs — yes, you read that right. That’s according to a <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/teevee-telly-free-tvs-second-screen">report from Janko Roettgers in his <em>Lowpass</em> newsletter</a>, who says the free television set will come with a second, built-in screen dedicated solely to ads and a soundbar. </p>
<p id="tAk44j">Instead of profiting from TV sales, Roettgers reports Pozin’s new company, called Teevee Corporation, would make money off of the ads that appear on TV’s secondary screen.

However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, for instance, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.</p>

  <p id="MfI12T">One of the reasons to choose an Android phone over an iPhone is the flexibility you get in terms of customization — and there’s really no better example of that than third-party Android launchers.</p>
<p id="EplcV4">If you’ve never come across the term before, a launcher revamps the homescreen of your Android phone. We’re not just talking about a different wallpaper: launchers give you control over icons, colors, menus, and just about every screen handled by the Android operating system. These tools let you manage everything from the number of shortcuts on the homescreen to the way your notifications work; they also give you much more control over how your phone’s interface looks.</p>

<p id="hFocs0">In a lengthy update shared to Netflix’s Geeked Twitter account today, Oda opened up about what it’s been like working with Tomorrow Studios and Netflix on <em>One Piece</em> and how, even though everyone involved in the new series “understand each of the characters,” they also “come from very...</p>

## Dell’s XPS 13 Plus gets 13th Gen Intel processors

    </figure>

  <p id="BDMceJ">Dell has refreshed what might be its boldest and funkiest laptop, the XPS 13 Plus. The new model looks quite similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23284276/dell-xps-13-plus-intel-2022-review">product released last year</a>; the flat keyboard, LED function row, and invisible haptic touchpad remain. But inside, the new model is powered by Intel’s 13th Gen Core processors — specifically, from what I can see on Dell’s website, the Core i7-1360P. </p>
<p id="My9AMN">Honestly, the processor is probably what most needed changing. The XPS 13 Plus I reviewed in 2022 was a nice-looking, well-built machine with a great screen, but it was hot and loud with subpar battery life. Those are big issues for a thin and light laptop, but they’re also issues that a better processor could potentially fix. </p>

  <p id="fDVRnx">WhatsApp is officially announcing and rolling out <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-updates-to-polls-and-sharing-with-captions-on-whatsapp">a series of new features</a> designed to improve the messaging app’s polls and give you more options when it comes to captions. It says these options are rolling out globally now and will be available to “everyone” in the coming weeks.</p>
<p id="aUKyiC">First up, polls, a feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23437786/whatsapp-groups-communities-32-person-video-chats-1024-person">WhatsApp originally launched last year</a>. Currently, polls are multiple-choice by default. That’s great for when you’re asking people to list all the dates they’re free (which is what I mainly see them used for) but less so when you want everyone to pick just one option each. So now there’s an “Allow multiple answers” toggle when creating a poll for this purpose.</p>

  <p id="CqfYAP">According to the calendar, it’s <em>Star Wars</em> Day. You know, the day that just happens to sound like you’re telling someone “May the Force be with you” if you don’t say the date like a normal person and just call it May 4th. But since this has become a small bedrock of a nerd holiday, that means there are often various promotions and deals to take advantage of. Of course, not all of them are <em>good </em>deals (some are downright scruffy-looking), but we’re collecting some worthwhile ones here — ranging from video games and somewhat-relevant tech stuff to a whole bunch of officially licensed Lego.</p>

Nice? Not really. </p>
<p id="iIAC8W">The tunnel system is Musk’s supposedly futuristic idea to alleviate road traffic by shifting some of that bumper-to-bumper traffic underground. The expansion, approved by the Clark County Commissioners, allows The Boring Company to construct 25 miles of additional tunnels for a total of 65 miles and 18 additional stations. </p>
<p id="ULt6C3">The original vision for the Vegas Loop was 51 stations and 29 miles of tunnels — so this represents a pretty big vote of confidence in Musk’s idea of an underground network of Teslas whizzing through tunnels that are only slightly larger...</p>

  <p id="ttntJz">It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Xbox that’s had fans questioning the state of Microsoft’s console gaming business. First, there was news of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697649/microsoft-q3-2023-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">30 percent drop</a> in Xbox hardware revenue, followed by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/26/23689252/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-blocked-uk-cma">CMA’s decision</a> to block Microsoft’s giant $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, and topped off by <em>Redfall</em> launching earlier this week to a very lukewarm reception.</p>
<p id="UoPCvE">When you combine all of this with a quiet year of Xbox releases in 2022, Xbox fans are wondering when Microsoft is going to deliver a slew of triple-A games like we saw with the Xbox 360 generation.</p>
<p id="yjWQhz">“We’re not in the business of out console-ing Sony or out console-ing Nintendo,” says Xbox chief Phil Spencer in an <a href="https://youtu.be/yKwfEQ1eEyM">interview with Kinda Funny Games</a>.

Part of that is relaunching the Peloton app with a new tiered subscription structure.</p>
<p id="lbRwHf">There’s no information on the pricing just yet, but on today’s Q3 2023 earnings call, CFO Liz Coddington said the “app tiers will have different amounts of content variances”  depending on the price.

  <p id="XbTbXr">Uber is announcing a new integration with Alexa today that’ll allow you to track your Uber Eats orders via Amazon’s voice assistant in the US. Amazon says the feature will provide updates about the status of an order from when it’s being prepared right through to when Uber’s driver arrives with your food. You have the option of having Alexa proactively announce each stage of the order process or light up its notification light so you can ask for the update yourself.</p>
