Known only by its working title, Titanfall Legends, Grubb revealed that although the game \"would not be Titanfall 3,\" it would still include a beloved character from the franchise: Jack Cooper's loyal titan, <a href=\"https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/BT-7274\">BT-7274</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to Grubb, the single-player adventure was planned to feature Apex Games Commissioner Kuben Blisk as a playable character, with various Apex Legends characters making appearances and lending their powers to the player. Major details from the Titanfall franchise--like the location of <a href=\"https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ark\">the Ark</a>, for example--would have also played a part in the campaign.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Titanfall Legends was reportedly helmed by former Apex Legends narrative lead <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iambadmofo\">Mohammad Alavi</a>--perhaps best known as the architect behind Modern Warfare's \"All Ghillied Up\" level--until he left the company in January 2022. According to Grubb, Titanfall Legends players would once again pilot and fight alongside BT-7274 (often referred to as simply \"BT\" in Titanfall 2), using Rampart's workshop to repair and upgrade him. This makes sense, given the fact that Rampart and Blisk are on good terms in Apex Legends, and Rampart is also responsible for resurrecting and rebuilding another titan. In Season 9, it was revealed that Rampart <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/videos/apex-legends-official-northstar-stories-from-the-outlands-cinematic-trailer/2300-6455136/\">repaired and repurposed Northstar</a>, the titan belonging to Valkyrie's late father. Titanfall Legends would have seen Rampart using similar methods to bring BT back online after his \"death\" at the end of Titanfall 2.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-titanfall-legends-wasnt-titanfall-3-would-have-featured-apex-legends-hero-report/1100-6511126/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-4-golden-review-stay-golden/1900-6400482/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Persona 4 Golden Review - Stay Golden", "date_published": "2023-02-02 17:30:00+00:00", "description": "<p>A top-tier role-playing game is generally a finely crafted concoction of several ingredients: an interesting setting, an engaging story, enjoyable characters and interactions, and gameplay that makes your interaction with all of the aforementioned elements feel meaningful and worthwhile. When all of these individual factors are developed to high standards, the result is an RPG of exceptional quality--and that is exactly what Persona 4 Golden is.</p><p>This re-release of 2008's excellent PlayStation 2 game takes place in modern-day Japan. The protagonist is a high school student from a big city whose parents have been sent away on business. They send him to live for a year with his uncle--a police investigator--and his young cousin in a small countryside town. Almost immediately upon the hero's arrival, strange things begin to happen in this otherwise dull little hamlet: a string of people turn up dead, and rumor spreads of a supernatural television broadcast that shows bizarre programming. The hero and a crew of his newfound classmates soon discover a horrible secret: there's a separate world within the televisions that twists human desires and hidden feelings in potentially lethal ways, and it's somehow tied to the serial killings. It's up to the group of friends to harness the supernatural power of personas, put a stop to the sinister killing spree, and decipher the secrets behind the TV world.</p><p>The contemporary, real-world-inspired setting of Persona 4 is already an excellent conceit in the heavily fantasy- and sci-fi-driven world of RPGs. But it's far from the only element that sets the game apart from the crop. Unlike most RPGs, Persona 4 operates on something of a time limit. From the day you arrive in the country village of Inaba until the day the school year ends, you advance through the game on a calendar. Dates and deadlines are very important; not only do you have important events in school and in your personal life to deal with, but you also discover that the serial killings follow a specific time pattern. You need to explore and rescue potential victims from the TV world before they are killed--a task that usually takes several days to complete.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-4-golden-review-stay-golden/1900-6400482/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-so-far-in-february/1100-6511121/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "All The Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass So Far In February", "date_published": "2023-02-02 17:22:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Xbox Game Pass both takes and gives away.

Enter Persona 3, the latest in the Shin Megami Tensei series to reach American shores. Luckily, you won't need any previous experience with the Persona franchise to appreciate its uniquely dark sensibilities, though series fans will find plenty of familiar references in which to revel. This is a quality role-playing experience that weaves distinctive gameplay elements into a fascinating story that unfolds slowly but keeps you constantly guessing. It's also atypically mature, but then again, any game that features your party members repeatedly shooting themselves in the head isn't for the squeamish. Indeed, the game's signature mechanic is this: To summon your inner self--or persona--you point a pistol at your head and pull the trigger.</p><p>At the outset of the game, you name your character, who has just transferred to Gekkoukan high school. But it's clear that not everything is kosher at the seemingly average campus. Mysterious creatures called shadows are threatening the locals, spreading an enigmatic disease called apathy syndrome that leaves their victims as listless as the name implies. However, their activity is generally confined to the dark hour: an hour sandwiched between midnight and 1 a.m. Most people are oblivious to this hour, while others are distinctly aware of the creepy dark hour in which the undulating gloom seals most of humanity in gothic coffins. Those unseemly heroes are in touch with their personas, which can be summoned to fight shadows in the realm of Tartarus, where most of them are restricted. At Gekkoukan, known persona users have created the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad and are determined to wipe the shadows off the face of the earth.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable-review/1900-6175580/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-will-be-m-rated-game-could-launch-as-early-as-fall-2024-report/1100-6511117/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Wolverine Will Be M-Rated game, Could Launch As Early As Fall 2024 - Report", "date_published": "2023-02-02 17:12:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Marvel's Wolverine won't be a declawed version of the iconic mutant according to a new report, which claims that the game will be aiming for an M-rating.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/giantbomb\">Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb</a>, developer Insomniac Games is targeting a \"hard-R\" with its interpretation of Wolverine, which will reportedly be a unique take on the character that is divorced from his big-screen incarnation played by Hugh Jackman. \"They'll avoid having any links or anything that evokes the Fox movies, they want it to stand on its own,\" Gubb said. \"I was trying to nail down the setting and heard it will start before he joins the X-Men, which also makes sense for a Wolverine game.\"</p><p>As for a release date, Grubb claims that the game could be out \"as early as Fall 2024\", just a year after the planned release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in 2023, but did note that it could slip to 2025. This may not be an open-world game in the same vein as Insomniac's Spider-Man adventures, with Grubb noting that God of War Ragnarok's semi-open world design is serving as inspiration for how the game unfolds.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-will-be-m-rated-game-could-launch-as-early-as-fall-2024-report/1100-6511117/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-finally-starts-filming/1100-6511115/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Five Nights At Freddy's Movie Finally Starts Filming", "date_published": "2023-02-02 17:11:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The Five Nights at Freddy's movie has finally begun filming.
