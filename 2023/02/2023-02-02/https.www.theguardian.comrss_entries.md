<p>New head coach has done away with ‘finishers’ term yet he still needs to square the Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell circle</p><p>If this is a new chapter of English rugby – as Maro Itoje told us more than once – then the first page of it was less notable for what it said, more so for what it did not. Steve Borthwick’s first team announcement as England head coach and not a single mention of the World Cup, now just seven months away, was uttered. That “finishers” has been done away with – Borthwick preferring the more prosaic “replacements” – only underlined how the Eddie Jones era has been consigned to history.</p><p>Borthwick’s team selection is eye-catching in so far as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/02/england-team-scotland-six-nations-rugby">Manu Tuilagi has been dropped</a> – Joe Marchant has been preferred – Ben Curry and Ollie Hassell-Collins have been handed first starts and first caps respectively and most significantly, Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell continue as the 10-12 axis.

<p>Star players moving (or not) between top rivals has been stirring the pot, as have decisions of England hopefuls and clubs developing the best young talent</p><p>Arsenal’s late bid for the Manchester United forward Alessia Russo and Chelsea’s reported interest in Arsenal’s Katie McCabe stirred the pot. Players moving between rival clubs is far more common in women’s football than in men’s football. Short-term contracts have been the norm, and big-money transfers are a relatively new phenomenon. In the past, often the short deals players were on would expire and they would move for free. With one-year deals and a lack of benefits the norm in the semi-professional and amateur games, it was hard to begrudge players taking whatever opportunity came their way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/02/key-takeaways-in-womens-transfer-window">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An inflationary environment makes care home collapses more probable, given the way they’re financing themselves</p><p>Social policy/The care home sector risks sleepwalking into a crisis of rising costsWhen Britain’s largest care home operator, Southern Cross, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/01/rise-and-fall-of-southern-cross">collapsed in 2011</a>, it heaped anxiety on elderly residents and ignited a debate about the role of private finance in the sector. The company had sold off most of its freehold properties to landlords, leaving it with a <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/southern-cross-trims-rent-as-it-struggles-to-stay-afloat-3f7zpvsfg2n">£230m annual rental bill</a>. Many of these properties were locked into <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/102a1a4a-8ae5-11e0-b2f1-00144feab49a">30-year leases</a> with increasing rents. The bulk of the company’s income came from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/09/cuts-prompt-southern-cross-warning">local authorities</a>, so when councils clamped down on spending, Southern Cross buckled. “This model doesn’t work through hard times,” its chief executive said.</p><p>Those times seem to have returned. A <a href="https://cictar.org/extracting-profits-through-care-home-real-estate/">new report</a> warns that the UK care system now risks sleepwalking into a crisis of rising costs because of how care homes are financed. Investors are piling into the sector, and have spent an estimated £7.5bn buying up healthcare properties over the last five years. The authors estimate that up to half of for-profit care home groups are leasing their homes from landlords. This is a ticking timebomb, they argue: as rents rise in line with inflation, some care home operators may have to increase their fees, even while landlords’ profits soar. They estimate that care home landlords are making £515m in profit annually.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-care-home-sector-trouble-looms-as-rents-rise">Continue reading...</a>

So harden your heart to their pleading, even if they do have tiny children, because: “If every single mum that starts getting a bit teary you’re going to walk away from, you won’t be earning any bonus.” Just get yourself inside the house and fit that prepayment meter, even though it will cut off their gas if they can’t afford to keep their credit topped up, leaving them to shiver in the dark.</p><p>The advice above, given to a Times reporter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/02/energy-regulator-launches-british-gas-investigation-over-prepayment-meters">working undercover</a> for a company employed by British Gas to deal with customers falling behind on their bills, is spine-chilling, and yet it should come as no surprise.

<p>Green Football Weekend raises awkward questions about the game’s readiness to start taking genuinely ambitious action  </p><p>About three years ago, in the thick of a League Two promotion campaign, Michael Doughty began to notice something. An unusually wet winter had flooded Swindon Town’s training pitches, forcing them to trek up and down the country in search of a usable facility. The postponements were piling up. “It would be unseasonably warm, then super-cold, which made performance more difficult,” he remembers. “The effect was really tangible. And I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t a discussion.”</p><p>For Doughty it was a realisation that would set off an unusual chain of events. After retiring from the game he set up a sustainable sportswear brand, but soon realised that he wanted to work in football again. And so, aged just 30, he has returned to his old club, not as a coach or a scout or an ambassador, but as their chief sustainability officer: the first former player to take such a position at an English league club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/02/clubs-dont-take-it-seriously-enough-does-football-really-want-to-tackle-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Mahan Esfahani/Prague Radio SO/Liebreich<br />(Hyperion)<br /></strong>Three 20th century Czech pieces for the harpsichord are full of lively interest in this new recording with Alexander Liebreich and the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra</p><p>You would hear some robust words from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/01/mahan-esfahani-harpsichord-interview">Mahan Esfahani</a> if you dared suggest the harpsichord wasn’t an attractive solo instrument for a concerto – but even he will admit that in the 20th century it took a special kind of composer to write one for it. The latest addition to Esfahani’s eclectic discography highlights three of them, all Czech, all grappling in their time with how to make something modern using an instrument so strongly associated with the past. It’s an ear-opening recording.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/27/bohuslav-martinu-czech-composer">Bohuslav Martinů</a>’s 1935 Concerto for Harpsichord and Small Orchestra begins in emphatically neoclassical style. Stravinsky springs to mind – yet his brittleness is largely bypassed by Martinů in favour of something softer-edged, playful yet sincere. The orchestra is tiny but there’s a lushness in Martinů’s use of it, and intrigue in the way he compares and contrasts the harpsichord with the ensemble’s piano: the two almost swap roles from where you would expect them to be in a more conventional concerto.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/02/harpsichord-concertos-martinu-krasa-and-kalabis-review-esfahani-makes-sparks-fly-as-ancient-meets-modern">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When celebrities reach a certain level of prominence they can’t keep posting online in the same way. People will disbelieve and then get annoyed</p><p>I’ve decided that celebrities should hire me. Not to write their TV shows or movies (although yes, that would also be good), but for a more important social media-based role. My job would be to warn them when they are about to cross The Relatability Line. The Relatability Line is a rope across the entry of your descent into Twitter Hell.</p><p>This job may seem needless but we are living through unprecedented times. At no point in history have normies had this kind of direct access to famous people and their thoughts, and vice versa – I do wish I could have followed @maewest. Added into this mix is the fact there is a generation of famous people, or getting-famous people, who grew up using social media just as much as their fans. They are good at it and funny, they like it, and slinging off content comes to them like breathing. It can be hard for them to know when is best to stop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/the-relatability-shtick-falls-flat-if-youre-too-famous">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The idea is nothing new in other countries, but the UK has been slow to develop housing schemes for older LGBTQ+ people. Now it’s becoming apparent how many people want or need it</p><p>When the clocks struck midnight on new year’s eve and rang in 2023, Steve Busby was on the rooftop of a fancy apartment block in central London watching fireworks light up the Thames. The weeks leading up to Christmas had been a heady mix of meals, drinks, celebrations and friends, most of whom live in the same building of luxurious flats overlooking Westminster, a stone’s throw from Vauxhall, Waterloo and Tate Britain. Not exactly your average retirement home, then – and indeed Busby, a 72-year-old gay man, would never have considered moving to one of those. “What would I do? Risk coming out, or lie about who I am? I knew I could never do it.”</p><p>Busby spent his working life running a business selling handmade silk ties all over the world, but “retirement saw my world change – it was isolating,” he says. Having never married or had children, he had been alone for a few years when the pandemic stopped him from even seeing friends. “It was dreadful,” he says. “Then a friend told me about Tonic. I came to an open day, saw the facilities and the flat, and I knew I wanted to move in and stay here for the rest of my life.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/02/i-knew-i-wanted-to-stay-here-for-the-rest-of-my-life-how-london-got-its-first-lgbtq-retirement-community">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The director of The Sixth Sense and Signs answers your questions about Rupert Grint, Bruce Willis, spoilers and dealing with grief</p><p><strong>Rupert Grint has become a muse of sorts for you. What do you think he brings to his roles that other actors don’t?</strong> <em>Mayfieldblue<br /></em>I’m always looking for a buoyant actor: someone who naturally entertains, who’s very colourful and beautiful to watch and has as many muscles in humour as in drama and poignancy. That’s rare. Rupert has that, coupled with his kindness and incredible professionalism. He’s just the easiest human being to work with. It’s a tricky thing, what we ask actors to do. Sometimes that comes with complications as human beings. With Rupert: zero. He’s a Navy Seal: comes in and can do anything you ask him to.</p><p><strong>I have a theory that you enjoy complete artistic freedom. Am I right that you’ve moved away from huge-budget blockbuster films in order to retain more freedom?</strong> <em>balders1</em><em><br /></em>Yes. Maybe it’s the immigrant-Indian-wanting-to-please-everybody thing. There’s something about me that gets triggered by taking a lot of money and then wanting to please the person that gave me that money. That isn’t healthy. So I pay for the movies and we do them with as small a budget as possible. That allows me to take unusual swings, both in the stories that I’m telling and in the way I’m telling them. And that freedom lets me hear myself better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/02/m-night-shyamalan-a-new-generation-is-discovering-my-movies-dont-talk-about-the-endings">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Coliseum, London<br /></strong>With Bizet’s opera’s menace and casual cruelty to the fore, cracking performances from soloists and chorus alike ensure that this is a tense and atmospheric production</p><p>English National Opera may have been given <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/english-national-opera-arts-council-england-investment-eno">a stay of execution</a> but it knows it has to keep fighting to justify its existence, and its latest revival of Bizet’s Carmen throws a well-aimed punch. Calixto Bieito’s staging, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/22/carmen-english-national-opera-review">first seen here in 2012</a>, has become one of his most enduring at theatres worldwide, and with reason: the Catalan director’s penchant for shocks and violence is right at home in an opera with menace lurking behind every good tune. Alfons Flores’s stark, black set design conjures imposing atmosphere economically, with a gallows-like flagpole, a phone box you can almost smell or a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_bull">Osborne bull</a>. When the stage briefly fills up with the smugglers’ messy fleet of 1970s Mercs it seems almost comically crowded.</p><p>The soldiers in the opening scene set the tone: full of pent-up testosterone, they are not only dangerous but dangerously childish. The women hold their own, however: this staging may have originated pre-Weinstein but, while there’s plenty of casual cruelty, thanks to Jamie Manton’s skilful revival direction it doesn’t feel overly voyeuristic. Manton gets some cracking performances from his cast – the final scene is fingernail-gnawingly tense even though you know what’s about to happen – and Christopher Cowell’s English translation comes across clearly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/02/bizet-carmen-review-calixto-bieto-vivd-revival-eno">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the classic Bill Murray time-loop romcom reaches 30, and the imitators that reuse its concept keep on coming – from Palm Springs to Russian Doll – we ask what makes it so timeless</p><p></p><p>Groundhog Day has reached its 30th birthday – which is still three years and change short of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/02/02/this-is-how-many-days-bill-murrays-character-actually-spent-in-groundhog-day-5657421/">33 years, 350 days</a> it was once estimated Bill Murray’s waspish weatherman spent stuck in a time loop in the film. Viewed simply as a quirky comedy on its release, the film has since seen its reputation transform. And not only because “Groundhog Day” has become shorthand for the drudgery of any endlessly repeating scenario. In 2023, its influence and popularity are greater than ever.</p><p>Some people got it right away. David Lynch was an early admirer while Quentin Tarantino, in a 1994 interview to promote Pulp Fiction, gushed: “Groundhog Day is one of my favourite movies of last year, if not my favourite.” And the number of films which copy its structure has mounted up, from a sci-fi Groundhog Day on a train (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/31/source-code-review">Source Code</a>), Groundhog Day as a horror (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/happy-death-day-review-jessica-rothe">Happy Death Day</a>), Groundhog Day with Tom Cruise (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/29/edge-of-tomorrow-film-review-tom-cruise">Edge of Tomorrow</a>), Groundhog Day but he’s naked (the predictably awful <a href="https://screenmayhem.com/naked-is-groundhog-day-with-marlon-wayans-and-partial-nudity/">Naked</a>).

<p>The challenges are gruelling, the contestants near-superhuman and it looks like a dystopian thriller. So why is Physical: 100 such a charming, lovely watch?</p><p>‘There’s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product,” Apple founder Steve Jobs once said and, although he would have gone out in the first round of the Netflix endurance contest Physical: 100 – he gave up competitive swimming as a youth – he would have had to respect its artistry. The concept, a cross between Squid Game and Gladiators, is the sort of idea you would kick around before last orders, congratulating yourself on your brilliance then forgetting to text Netflix in the morning. But the execution – pulling together 100 of South Korea’s most aesthetically daunting humans, designing tests of athleticism that don’t favour any of them, and wrapping it all together with storytelling and production values straight out of a dystopian sci-fi thriller – is flawlessly Jobsian, even if there is not a turtleneck in sight.</p><p>In the show’s first proper challenge, the 100 face off in a series of one-on-one bouts, trying to grab a medicine ball in order to be the one holding on to it when a three-minute timer runs out. Contestants who did well during the brutal and gruelling qualifying round can pick their opponents, as well as choosing the arena – an obstacle-filled playground that favours more agile athletes, or a sandbag-lined paddling pool that rewards raw power. One of the show’s frontrunners, an Olympic gold medallist gymnast, doesn’t want to pick on anyone, so he asks the other 99 contestants who will step forward. Nobody wants to, so the gymnast chooses the weakest-looking contestant, only for it to emerge that the latter is a breakdancing contortionist who goes after the ball with a parkour-infused feline ferocity that is genuinely unsettling. No spoilers on who wins, but after the competition is over, they have a good-natured dance-off. The loser then has to smash a life-sized sculpture of their own torso with a hammer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/02/netflix-squid-game-meets-gladiators-why-physical-100-is-absolutely-unmissable-television">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Lyric theatre, London<br /></strong>The singer is convincing in the role (first played by Lily Allen) of a mother who hears spooky noises at night in Danny Robins’ well-oiled, blackly comic chiller</p><p>Since it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/aug/12/2-22-a-ghost-story-review-lily-allen-noel-coward-theatre">opened in 2021</a>, Danny Robins’s supernatural story, with its numerous West End casts, awards and killer twist, has become a well-oiled ghostly machine. It is also becoming a launchpad for singers who fancy treading the boards. First came Lily Allen’s feted tenure; now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/07/cheryl-west-end-theatre-222-a-ghost-story-tweedy">Cheryl</a> makes her debut in the glare of the West End.

<p>Eight linked short stories, set mostly in Miami, vividly evoke the experiences of a young Black man in search of a sense of belonging</p><p>You wake up and discover your friend in your kitchen, boiling eggs and reading your copy of Jonathan Escoffery’s If I Survive You. You debate. Is it autobiographical? A novel or a short-story collection? Does the book, like the protagonist, seem unhappy with whatever it is? Why does Escoffery use the second-person point of view so much?</p><p>Why, indeed? As I’m sure you can tell, the second person risks being contrived, distracting, presumptuous, scratchy, puerile and self-conscious. Just don’t do it, writing instructors warn. Unless you’re Escoffery, a young American in whose hands the second person is arresting, intimate, adventurous, attuned, sophisticated and, yes, still self-conscious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/02/if-i-survive-you-by-jonathan-escoffery-review-dazzling-debut-of-racial-identity">Continue reading...</a>

## Nolly review – Helena Bonham Carter is brilliantly camp in Russell T Davies’s impeccable drama

<p>The actor is flamboyant, frank and funny as a Crossroads legend. It’s a joy to watch this warm, thoughtful tribute to soaps, fabulous older women – and showbiz itself</p><p>After his brilliant drama about the Aids crisis in Britain, It’s a Sin, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/22/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2021-no-1-its-a-sin">such a hit</a>, one can only imagine the options that writer Russell T Davies had for what to do next. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/ditch-the-tardis-five-ways-russell-t-davies-could-revive-doctor-who">returned to Doctor Who</a>, of course, but I love the fact that first, he chose to make the wonderful, idiosyncratic Nolly (ITVX), a tender tribute to the TV soap star Noele Gordon, who died in 1985.</p><p>This three-part drama, which is impeccably put together, also serves as a tender tribute to British television in the late 70s and early 80s. As such, it is nicotine-stained, fuggy, floral and blousy, peeking out from over the top of increasingly enormous specs. Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as Gordon, known to her friends and fans as Nolly, and we meet her in the twilight of her career. By 1981, Nolly had spent 17 years playing Meg Mortimer, motel owner and leading lady of Crossroads, the soap that had been built around her star power. The early scenes of Nolly in full flight, as she conducts the cast and crew to her own tune, are funny and vibrant. “Haven’t you read the script?” asks Poppy, a young actor who has recently joined the cast. “No, never,” scoffs Nolly, aghast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/02/nolly-review-helena-bonham-carter-is-brilliantly-camp-in-russell-t-daviess-impeccable-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek and other stars squander their talents voicing harmless but  pointless sequel to 2010’s Puss in Boots</p><p>Somewhat mystifyingly, some top-secret algorithmic function in DreamWorks Animation’s audience-reaction data analysis software has decreed that yet another comeback is in order for the sort of OK-ish and meh-plus character of Puss in Boots, smokily voiced by Antonio Banderas, originally seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,1251483,0.html">in 2004 in Shrek 2</a>, and then in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/08/puss-in-boots-film-review">2010 spinoff feature Puss in Boots</a>. The numbers have come chuntering out of the side of some giant IBM-style computer, the suits have frowningly inspected them, and another tranche of Puss in Boots content has been greenlit.</p><p>Once again, debonair outlaw Puss in Boots – a sort of cleaned-up southern European version of Jack Sparrow – is having sword-twirling adventures, again in the company of his paramour Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek); but now PiB must confront his own mortality, having used up eight of his nine lives. He is on a quest to put off the evil hour by finding the legendary wishing star which once fell to earth like a comet; he and Kitty join forces with the perky mutt Perrito (Harvey Guillén), but must battle other fairytale/nursery-rhyme honchos, including a Cockney crime family in the form of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), and “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney) – to whom all the funny lines are given. Wagner Moura voices the Wolf, who is the grim reaper, wielding a couple of sickles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/02/puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-review-antonio-banderas-salma-hayek">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The New York congressman’s increasingly wild claims have all the thrill-seeking of a man running across a football field naked</p><p>In retrospect, as it often seems to go in these cases, the evidence appears to have been so glaringly obvious, it’s a wonder we were ever taken in. George Santos – like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/23/anna-sorokin-delvey-interview-court-prison-fake-heiress">Anna Sorokin</a>, the “fake heiress” – even had the Scooby-Doo, black-rimmed glasses that might have come from a joke shop selling disguises. When the representative for New York’s third congressional district entered the House last November, he was briefly notable as the Republican’s first openly gay non-incumbent to win a seat.</p><p>Now, his fame resides elsewhere. So wild and untrustworthy have statements made by Santos proved to be – Did his granny really survive the Holocaust? Was his mother’s death really related to 9/11? Did he ever appear in a movie alongside Uma Thurman? – that it would come as no surprise, at this stage, to discover that rather than a 34-year-old man, Santos is actually four children piled on top of each other beneath a trenchcoat.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist based in New York</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>The legal action brought about by 55 former amateur players has a potential impact to affect hundreds of thousands</p><p>It’s been a fortnight since the letters of claim went out in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/amateur-players-launch-lawsuit-against-rugby-authorities-over-brain-injuries">latest round of legal action</a> against World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union. Here in the Guardian we ran an interview with one of the claimants, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/cte-rugby-chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy-legal-action">48-year-old Alex Abbey</a>, who was diagnosed with probable CTE in 2015, 12 years on from the end of a club rugby career in which he suffered multiple concussions. Abbey is one of 55 former amateur players involved in the case. It is a much smaller group than the 225 former professionals involved in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/08/steve-thompson-former-rugby-union-players-dementia-landmark-legal-case">first lawsuit we reported on in 2020</a>, but, for the authorities, it could be even more damaging.</p><p>The 225 are, in the large part, men who played top-level club rugby in the years soon after the game turned professional, an era when they had professional workloads, but amateur attitudes, outdated coaching methods and, as often as not, oblivious medical care. The 55, though, are a more diverse group. It includes men who played club rugby before the game turned professional in 1995, women who played international rugby more recently, but still before their version of the sport was professional, former youth players who never graduated to the senior level, as well as the family of a deceased player who was diagnosed with CTE postmortem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/02/latest-lawsuit-shows-brain-injuries-are-factor-at-all-levels-of-rugby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will Enzo Fernández, Cody Gakpo, Wout Weghorst, Pedro Porro, Anthony Gordon et al prove good signings?</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/BenMcAleer1">Ben McAleer</a> for <a href="http://www.whoscored.com/">WhoScored</a></p><p>Enzo Fernández was Chelsea’s main transfer target for much of January but the deal wasn’t completed until the dying embers of the window. Fernández starred for Argentina at the World Cup, winning the young player of the tournament award. He had also impressed prior to Qatar, shining for Benfica in their seemingly unstoppable march towards the Primeira Liga title. A jack of all trades, the 22-year-old ranks top for passes per game (95.8), second for accurate long balls per game (9.5), and high for both tackles (2.4) and key passes per game (1.8) in Portugal’s top flight. His price tag – a British record at £106.8m – will heap pressure on Fernández to make an immediate impact, but he has taken his rapid ascent to superstardom in his stride. Benfica signed him from River Plate for £9m just eight months ago; now he is the most expensive player ever signed by a Premier League club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2023/feb/02/transfer-market-biggest-deals-premier-league-clubs-january-fernandez-gakpo-weghorst-porro-gordon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A polyphonic retelling of how an Irish priest set out to rescue resistance fighters, PoWs and Jews from Nazi-occupied Rome</p><p>Joseph O’Connor’s earlier work was instrumental in demonstrating that modern historical fiction can mean novels of ideas and the state of the nation rather than works of populist nostalgia. Writing about second world war espionage and resistance is brave in this context – there are so many gold-lettered tales of homosocial derring-do sold to men in airports – but anyone buying My Father’s House with this expectation will find themselves expected to think as well as fantasise.</p><p>Like 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/shadowplay-by-joseph-oconner-review">Shadowplay</a>, My Father’s House is woven through the historical record. There was indeed an Irish priest living in Vatican City involved in running an escape line for resistance fighters, escaped prisoners of war and Jewish people from Nazi-run Rome, and his collaborators share names and biographical details with characters in this book. O’Connor is clear that his characters are “not to be relied upon by biographers or researchers” and that sequences “presenting themselves as authentic documents are works of fiction”. The writer’s challenge is to balance the messy improbability of what actually happened with the structural requirements of the novel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/02/my-fathers-house-by-joseph-oconnor-review-the-priest-who-defied-nazis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My heart went out to whoever lost Rio Tinto’s dangerous capsule in the Australian outback. There but for the grace of God …</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/01/tiny-radioactive-capsule-lost-in-australian-outback-found-by-side-of-1400km-stretch-of-road">Someone lost a radioactive capsule</a>. Someone blundered. I shuddered at the news, because if I had been transporting that tiny object for Rio Tinto in Australia, that someone would have been me. I’m an accomplished loser of things. I may have lost more stuff than I ever had in the first place. This ought not to be possible, but if anyone can make it possible, it’s me. Still – losing a radioactive capsule. Wow. This sets a new benchmark among us useless, butter-fingered, forgetful, careless incompetents. I’m almost jealous, annoyed it wasn’t me. At least I’d then know I could never lose anything as important as this again.</p><p>I leave things in pubs, restaurants, football grounds, airports, aircraft, taxis, buses, tubes and, on one occasion, a dodgem at a fair in Swansea. When I played golf, I’d obviously lose balls. On the only occasion I didn’t lose a ball, I lost a club. Another time I drove off after my round without my golf bag. At home I can’t find things that I had in my hand only moments before. It is terrifying when this happens; they could be anywhere. I know this, because more than once I’ve found that I absent-mindedly dropped my car key in the bin, while on another occasion my wallet turned up in the bottom drawer of the fridge. I frequently put important things away somewhere safe, where no one will find them – including me, because I forget where the safe place was. Some things never ever turn up again.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/02/even-ive-never-mislaid-radioactive-material">Continue reading...</a>

The severity and poise of this calmly paced movie, its emotional reserve and moral seriousness – and the elusive, implied confessional dimension concerning Diop herself – make it an extraordinary experience.</p><p>Kayije Kagame plays Rama, a bestselling author and academic who lives in Paris and is heading to the town of Saint Omer, near Calais, to write what her publishers hope will be some commercially delicious literary reportage about a shocking criminal case.

Two of these use the <a href="https://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Calderdale+Way">Calderdale Way</a>, either the northern section or the southern, both of which involve hill climbs and traverses across fields, hedgerows, stiles – the usual argy-bargy of agricultural rambling.</p><p>The third, easier option is the towpath of the Rochdale canal – and that is what I did, or at least how I began, getting off the train at Sowerby Bridge and heading west. Canals are flat and sometimes circuitous, but they require no navigation skills. You can look around as you amble. As they were built for industry, they take walkers close to the action – people, places, buildings – and there’s plenty to see along this valley.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/02/hike-yorkshire-happy-valley-calderdale-halifax-todmorden-walk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Study suggests tool could be used to reduce energy needs for heating and cooling office buildings</p><p>Every year we shift our clocks forward in the spring, and backwards in the autumn. Originally daylight saving was introduced to save energy; reducing the number of hours that the lights had to be on in office buildings. But as climate changes, can daylight saving be used to reduce the energy demand for heating and cooling our office spaces?</p><p>To answer this question researchers simulated the heating and cooling demands of office buildings for 15 different cities across the United States and analysed the impact that daylight saving could have until the year 2050 under different climate scenarios. Under current climate conditions daylight saving reduced cooling demand by up to 5.9%, but increased heating demand by 4.4%. As we head into a warmer future they found that daylight saving could reduce cooling demand by up to 5.4%, while increasing heating demand by 3.2%.
