Well, that might be if China and Russia ever get their way. And the way they are possibly intending to do this, has everything to do with gold.\n\nFor most of human history, gold or silver has been used as a backing for currency. Even in the case where humans used less valuable coins or notes for trade -- like in the early British pound or ancient Chinese paper money -- these items were always backed by an equivalent amount of something real. However, this changed in 1971, when the US dollar was pulled off the gold standard. Meaning for the last half a decade, no money had any ties to a tangible thing of value.\n\nBut this could be all about to change. As a new partnership between China and Russia means that there has been a lot of under-the-table gold dealing, as well as the possibility of a new global reserve currency created by BRICS that could be backed by gold.\n\nLet me know your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - Is this the end of the US dollar?\n0:28 - Why gold matters to money\n1:48 - The war against the greenback\n3:27 - Masterworks insert\n4:41 - Russia and China's gold partnership\n5:31 - The BRICS currency and gold\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
