What could have happened?", "date_published": "2023-02-02 20:47:34+00:00", "description": "<p>So I lost my job back last year. I didn\u2019t feel like I immediately needed a new job and I\u2019ve never particularly had difficulty finding one so I figured this time I\u2019d bide my time and see if I could get a job I actually wanted as opposed to just whoever offered a big number that looked good.<p>Usually, like most devs, I imagine, I get a number of recruiters flooding into my LinkedIn account, particularly if I have my account set to show I\u2019m open to new jobs. At first, this seemed to be the case, but I was being very selective with who\u2019d I\u2019d talk to. If a recruiter wanted me to jump through hoops, or refused to give me any information about the role/company/etc. they were hiring for id just ignore them.<p>Then around mid-December I just stopped getting any contact from recruiters. Nothing about my LinkedIn profile had changed so I figured people must just be in break for the holidays, and so I decided to just sit around for a while.<p>But it\u2019s February now and I haven\u2019t had a single recruiter reach out to me since December 16th and I have no idea why. Someone suggested reset and reapply the \u201clooking for jobs\u201d status on my account, but that didn\u2019t seem to work.<p>There\u2019s only a couple things I can thing of offhand.<p>1) Remote-status. I\u2019ve read that looking for remote right now might be much more difficult with the flood of candidates into the market, but that doesn\u2019t make too much sense because even though my profile was set to prefer remote, I did get some local recruiters in my inbox for a bit.<p>2) Weird internal ranking system. Not to sound conspiratorial, but I\u2019ve started to wonder if LinkedIn downranks people in searches if they don\u2019t engage, and around November I was ignoring a lot of recruiters. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s likely, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve heard of something like that.<p>For reference, I have around 5 years professional experience, mostly in the .NET enterprise world, but have worked with other things in the last and many things outside of work. Anyone noticed this before? Is there anything I can do to get recruiters to start talking to me again, or am I just in a very bad market?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34632743\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34632743</a></p>\n<p>Points: 24</p>\n<p># Comments: 36</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://maxlab.io/store/edge-ai-camera/", "title": "Show HN: AI model on a $3 chip (esp32)", "date_published": "2023-02-02 20:33:50+00:00", "description": "<p>We finished a design that allows a plug-and-play solution with TensorFlow Lite and a web server with the UI on ESP32.

companies?", "date_published": "2023-02-02 15:21:54+00:00", "description": "<p>Hey everyone,<p>Was just starting the tax process for 2022 and found out about the changes that have been made to Section 174 that take effect this year. Essentially, all R&amp;E expenses must now be amortized over 5 years (instead of taking them as a regular full deduction in the year in which they are incurred), and on top of that all \"software development\" is now an R&amp;E expense. [1][2]<p>This seems like a disaster for any bootstrapped software company. As an example, if you make $100k in income, and spend $90k making the software, at first glance you've got a successful company bringing in a 10% profit margin. Previously, you would have just paid tax on that $10k in profit. Makes sense.<p>Under these new rules, the US actually says \"that $90k you spent to make the software has to be spread over 5 years, and you can actually only take 10% of it in the first year.\" Suddenly you've gone from a profit of $10k to a \"profit\" of $91k for tax purposes. Even at a 30% tax rate (which isn't even close to the top rate in the US), you're staring down a $27k tax bill that you're somehow supposed to pay out of the $10k in actual cash you have left on hand.<p>To be clear, you will eventually get the taxes you pay back over the next 5 years. But how are bootstrapped companies without access to large capital reserves or investment supposed to come up with the money to pay these tax bills while they wait it out? For every dollar you spend on making software, you've now got to have 30+ cents in reserve just to pay the tax bill for the year!<p>I am completely flabbergasted as to how this was thought to be a good idea...it seems like it drastically increases the cost of starting a bootstrapped software company in the US, which is just terrible policy in general.<p>Was just curious -- is this interpretation what others are hearing from their own tax professionals? Is it affecting others and if so how are you dealing with it?<p>[1] https://rsmus.com/insights/services/business-tax/looming-required-capitalization-of-section-174-expenditures.html<p>[2] https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/174</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627712\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627712</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://sotonye.substack.com/p/most-education-is-wasteful-and-immoral", "title": "Most Education Is Wasteful and Immoral", "date_published": "2023-02-02 14:57:23+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://sotonye.substack.com/p/most-education-is-wasteful-and-immoral\">https://sotonye.substack.com/p/most-education-is-wasteful-and-immoral</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627334\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627334</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://prashants.in/blog/how-to-beat-stress-anxiety-worry-toolkit/", "title": "How to Beat Stress and Anxiety", "date_published": "2023-02-02 14:52:41+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://prashants.in/blog/how-to-beat-stress-anxiety-worry-toolkit/\">https://prashants.in/blog/how-to-beat-stress-anxiety-worry-toolkit/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627248\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627248</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420194827/https://www.briansteffens.com/2017/02/20/from-math-to-machine.html", "title": "From math to machine: translating a function to machine code (2017)", "date_published": "2023-02-02 14:41:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210420194827/https://www.briansteffens.com/2017/02/20/from-math-to-machine.html\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210420194827/https://www.briansteffens.com/2017/02/20/from-math-to-machine.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627101\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627101</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626773", "title": "Ask HN: Looking for advice on my situation at work?", "date_published": "2023-02-02 14:17:48+00:00", "description": "<p>I put an extraordinary amount of work effort in the company for 3 years. I worked under the same manager during this period. Last year when performance review meeting happened just like every other year, I was told that you are the best engineer in the whole organization.<p>For these years, I have not got a single dollar raise or promotion. My salary has been the same from the day I joined in 2019.<p>Last year, performance review meeting was different. When mass layoffs were happening, manager brought another engineer on the team. I came to know that this engineer had known him in the past, could be friends. Even though, there was no need for another engineer on the team. My manager told me to train this engineer with same skill-set like you. I am a nice person so I brought this engineer up to speed. From the time this engineer has learnt everything that I have known, my manager has stopped talking to me. My 1:1 meetings has not happened for last few months. I am getting cold shoulder treatment from everyone else on team. This engineer who I taught has been assigned lead role and giving me directions for last few months. The whole situation has become toxic for me.<p>How to handle this situation best?<p>This is top 5 tech companies in Canada. If this is the kind of culture promoted here, how are other companies doing?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
