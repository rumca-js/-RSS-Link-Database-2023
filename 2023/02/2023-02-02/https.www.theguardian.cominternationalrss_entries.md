<p>Vinícius Júnior had more than his goal to celebrate in Real Madrid’s 2-0 win over Valencia in La Liga on Thursday. The Brazilian will also have been glad to escape serious injury after a vicious foul by the centre-back Gabriel Paulista in the second half that ignited a brawl and earned the Valencia player a straight red card.</p><p>Paulista struck a hard kick at Vinícius’ legs after the forward got past him in the 72nd minute, sending him hard to the ground. Vinícius quickly got up and confronted Paulista, shoving him from behind as other players arrived to join the scuffle. The Real defender Éder Militão, who had been substituted earlier in the match, also confronted Paulista as he made his way to the tunnel after being sent off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/02/vinicius-junior-and-marco-asensio-steer-real-madrid-past-valencia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nearly 14,000 people from two Nigerian communities are seeking justice in the high court in London against the fossil fuel giant Shell, claiming it is responsible for devastating pollution of their water sources and destruction of their way of life. The individuals from the Niger delta area of Ogale, a farming community, joined more than 2,000 people from the Bille area, a large fishing community. Shell have been operating on the Niger delta for over 80 years and recently announced that they will be ceasing all operations. The oil company made record-breaking profits in 2022, generating over $32bn in the first three quarters. The oil giant are arguing that they are not responsible for a clean-up of Nigerian communities for spills that they say were caused by&nbsp;criminal gangs over five years ago. Lawyers representing the fishing villages argue that the scale of oil spills in the delta masks a human tragedy on an extraordinary scale</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/nearly-14000-nigerians-take-shell-to-court-over-devastating-impact-of-pollution">Nearly 14,000 Nigerians take Shell to court over devastating impact of pollution</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/02/shell-profits-2022-surging-oil-prices-gas-ukraine">Calls for bigger windfall tax after Shell makes ‘obscene’ $40bn profit</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2023/feb/02/thousands-of-nigerians-seek-justice-for-devastating-impacts-from-shell-oil-spills-video">Continue reading...</a>

Unsurprisingly, it didn’t always feel “cool” to be Somali.</p><p>When this feeling was coupled with the age-old question of who Somalis are, I found it hard to carve out my own sense of identity.
