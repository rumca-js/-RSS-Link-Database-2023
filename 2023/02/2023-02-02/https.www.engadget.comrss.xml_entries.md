<p>As many Apple watchers have predicted, the company's financial results this quarter are a break from the last few years of nonstop growth. The iPhone maker reported a revenue of $117.2 billion for its first fiscal quarter (ended December 2022), which is five percent down year over year, marking the first time Apple's revenue is down since 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a couple of bright spots in the company's performance, namely in its setting a revenue record of $20.8 billion in its Services business and hitting more than 2 billion active devices in its installed base. All-time revenue records were also set in markets like Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Vietnam.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement, CEO Tim Cook said &quot;As we all continue to navigate a challenging environment, we are proud to have our best lineup of products and services ever, and as always, we remain focused on the long term and are leading with our values in everything we do.&quot;</p><p>On its earnings call, Cook said there were three main things that impacted revenue: the &quot;challenging macroeconomic environment&quot;, foreign exchange issues and COVID-related supply constraints that led to delays in the ship times of iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models. &quot;Production is now back to where we want it to be,&quot; he added.</p><p>Apple's decline in revenue is in line with a general slump in the tech industry, with Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-billion-meta-q4-2022-earnings-223814979.html">having just reported</a> revenues that are 4 percent down from the previous year. Alphabet is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-google-q4-2022-earnings-212630246.html">also seeing a slowdown in growth this quarter</a>, and while Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q2-fy23-earnings-report-211718819.html">saw its revenue climb</a>, its earnings missed expectations and profits fell by 12 percent. Amid the economic downturn, tech companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-layoffs-151816595.html">have</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">been</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html">laying</a> off significant portions of their workforce, though Apple doesn't appear to have made similar moves at the moment.</p><p>The company is holding a call to go into detail about its financial results at 5pm ET / 2pm PT today, and we will update this post with any additional news and insight.</p>

## Alphabet's revenues are still growing, but just barely

<p>It's no secret that the huge tech companies are still making money hand over fist, but there's also a noticeable slowdown going on. Google's parent company Alphabet is not immune — the company <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9de1a6b">just reported its earnings results</a> for Q4 of 2022, and just barely grew revenue year over year. The $76 billion the company pulled in during the quarter is up only one percent from Q4 of 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's ad business is the backbone of the company, and revenue slipped there by about 3.5 percent compared to a year ago. But eight percent growth in the &quot;other&quot; category (which includes products like Google and Nest hardware and revenue from the Play Store) and 32 percent yearly growth in in Google Cloud made up for those ad losses. Overall profits, meanwhile, dropped significantly: Quarterly net income of $13.6 billion is down 34 percent year-over-year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, the backdrop for all this is that Google announced a few weeks ago that it is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">laying off about 12,000 employees</a>; that makes up about six percent of the company's overall workforce. At the time those layoffs were announced, we didn't yet know what Google's financials for last quarter looked like, but now we can see that things are slowing down.&nbsp;</p><p>That's all relatively speaking, though. Net income of $60 billion for 2022 as a whole was down significantly compared to the $76 billion in profit Alphabet made in 2021 — but it's still far ahead of the $40 billion the company pulled in for 2020. It looks like the big numbers Alphabet posted in 2021 weren't exactly sustainable, and obviously we don't yet know what 2023 will bring. But we'll be tuning into the company's call with investors, which starts at 4:30PM ET, to see what additional details CEO Sundar Pichai can share about the state of Alphabet in the year to come.</p>

## Amazon's drones have reportedly delivered to fewer houses than there are words in this headline

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon's</a> drone delivery program doesn't seem to be off to a great start. The Prime Air division was said to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-lay-offs-192841878.html">hit hard by recent, widespread layoffs</a>. Now, a new report indicates that Amazon's drones have made just a handful of deliveries in their first few weeks of operation.</p><p>After nearly a decade of working on the program, Amazon said in December that it would start making deliveries by drone in  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-air-lockeford-california-170945262.html">Lockeford, California</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-texas-college-station-161606446.html">College Station, Texas</a>. However, by the middle of January, as few as seven houses had received Amazon packages by drone, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiYTBhNGNkYy1jZWM4LTQxNmEtOWU5My1lMTFiODE3OTEyOWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaW5mb3JtYXRpb24uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2FtYXpvbnMtbm8tZmx5LXpvbmUtZHJvbmUtZGVsaXZlcnktbGFyZ2VseS1ncm91bmRlZC1kZXNwaXRlLXNwbGFzaHktbGF1bmNoIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MzdhYWI1MC0wNTUxLTRlODAtYmM3Yy0zN2I3NjZjMTUwYjkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXQwggHdoCx8gJi1BqMonFdXVpamVAifQ-zzZguYRV5g&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Famazons-no-fly-zone-drone-delivery-largely-grounded-despite-splashy-launch"><em>The Information</em></a><em>: </em>two in California and five in Texas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report suggests that Amazon has been hamstrung by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is said to be blocking drones from flying over roads or people unless the company gets permission on a case-by-case basis. Although Amazon had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-air-faa-approval-drone-delivery-trials-142035317.html">touted its FAA certification</a>, the agency imposed a string of restrictions, which hadn't been revealed until now. It has largely rejected Amazon's requests to loosen the limitations.</p><p>One of the plans the FAA agreed to, according to the report, was for Amazon employees to check no cars were passing on surrounding roads before drones left its Lockeford delivery facility. That depot is on an industrial block, and the drones need to fly over at least one road before getting to any homes.</p><p>Amazon's drones are far heavier than ones operated by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wing/">Wing</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-droneup-expansion-164104899.html">Walmart’s</a> partners Flytrex and Zipline. Those weigh between 10 and 40 pounds. Amazon's drone, on the other hand, weighs around 80 pounds and can only carry a five-pound payload. The report suggests the drone's mass could be causing concern among FAA officials. The agency has given Wing, Flytrex and Zipline permission to fly over roadways — to date, Wing has carried out more than 300,000 deliveries.</p><p>One other aspect that doesn't help Amazon's prospects is that folks who want to receive deliveries by drone need a backyard where packages can be dropped off — so apartment dwellers need not apply. The drone can only carry a certain size of box and it <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1Eczc4a0huLW44NCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDM3YWFiNTAtMDU1MS00ZTgwLWJjN2MtMzdiNzY2YzE1MGI5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfv5ImaAjwtoxfg30UGTlV0tZIVYV_0p1VgKaCcx5Xmq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDs78kHn-n84">dumps packages from 12 feet in the air</a>, further limiting the types of products it can transport.</p><p>“We meet or exceed all safety standards and have obtained regulatory authorization to conduct commercial drone delivery operations," Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti told <em>The Information</em>. "We welcome the FAA’s rigorous evaluations of our operation, and we’ll continue to champion the significant role that regulators play to ensure all drone companies are achieving the right design, build and operating standards." Boschetti added that the Prime Air layoffs, which have reportedly slashed the size of the delivery teams at both locations by more than half, have not affected Amazon's plans for the test sites.</p>

## Columbia researchers bioprint seamless 3D skin grafts for burn patients

<p>The science of grafting skin has come a long way from the days of scraping it off one part of a patient's body and slapping it back on somewhere else to cover a nasty burn or injury. These days grafts are commonly bioprinted like living inkjets using the patient's cultured cells to seed the growing process, <a href="https://news.rpi.edu/content/2019/11/01/living-skin-can-now-be-3d-printed-blood-vessels-included">down to the vascularization</a>. The primary shortcoming of these printed grafts is that they can only be produced in flat sheets with open edges. This method &quot;disregard[s] the fully enclosed geometry of human skin,&quot; argue a team of researchers from Columbia University. Instead, they've devised <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/978314">a novel means of producing skin in virtually any complex 3D shape they need</a> — from ears and elbows to entire hands printed like a pair of Buffalo Bill's mittens.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Creating a " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/45675130-a330-11ed-af77-aab63acf65cc" style="height: 700; width: 527;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Alberto Pappalardo and Hasan Erbil Abaci / Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons</div></figure><p>The team published their findings, &quot;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2514">Engineering edgeless human skin with enhanced biomechanical properties</a>,&quot; in the January issue of <em>Scientific Advances.</em> They<em>&nbsp;</em>explained how they engineered, &quot;the skin as a fully enclosed 3D tissue that can be shaped after a body part and seamlessly transplanted as a biological clothing.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Three-dimensional skin constructs that can be transplanted as ‘biological clothing’ would have many advantages,” Dr. Hasan Erbil Abaci, lead researcher and assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University, said in a recent press release. “They would dramatically minimize the need for suturing, reduce the length of surgeries, and improve aesthetic outcomes.”&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, these uniform grafts have shown superior performance, both mechanically and functionally, than their patchwork alternatives. The Columbia team has dubbed the grafts &quot;wearable edgeless skin constructs&quot; (WESCs). Ok, but can you eat them?</p><p>The process of making these skin prosthetics isn't that far off from the existing techniques which result in flat slabs of skin. The transplant site is first scanned with a 3D laser to create a digital facsimile of the structure. That data is worked through a CAD program to generate a hollow wireframe of the appendige and then printed. This serves as the scaffolding on which the patient's cultured cells will grow. It's coated with skin fibroblasts and collagen then covered by an outer layer of keratinocytes (which make up the epidermis) and growth medium to feed the cells as they mature. As with making flat sheets, the entire process requires around three weeks for the cells to fully set up and be ready for transplant.</p><p>Initial lab tests with mouse models were encouraging. “It was like putting a pair of shorts on the mice,” Abaci said. “The entire surgery took about 10 minutes.” Don't get too excited, mouse skin is not people skin. It heals differently enough that additional animal studies will be required before we start trying it on humans. Such tests are likely still years away.&nbsp;</p>

## Amazon told lawmakers it wouldn’t build warehouse storm shelters

<p>Amazon told lawmakers it wouldn’t build storm shelters in its warehouses after a December 2021 tornado <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html">killed six employees</a> at an Illinois location. Although the company changed its severe-weather response strategy after the incident, it essentially told the elected officials that since building storm shelters isn’t required by law, it won’t do that.</p><p>The company responded to lawmakers Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Cori Bush (D-MO), who <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.12.15%20Letter%20to%20Amazon%20re.%20storm%20shelter%20at%20Edwardsville%20warehouse1.pdf">sent a letter</a> on December 15th, questioning the company’s lack of storm shelters or safe rooms at its warehouses. “Amazon’s apparent unwillingness to invest in a storm shelter or safe room at its Edwardsville facility is made even more concerning by the fact that installing one could be done by Amazon at relatively low cost,” the lawmakers wrote. “This cost is negligible for a company like Amazon, which brought in more than $500 billion in revenue over the 12-month period ending September 30, 2022 and clearly has the resources necessary to protect its workers should it have the will to do so.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Company vice president of public policy Brian Huseman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/amazon-to-lawmakers-we-wont-build-storm-shelters-in-warehouses.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1675358105">responded</a> (via <em>CNBC</em>), “Amazon requires that its buildings follow all applicable laws and building codes.

## Antartica’s only EV had to be redesigned because of climate change

<p>Most electric vehicles get upgrades to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-ev6-gt-first-drive-video-050142389.html">boost performance</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2024-polestar-2-300-mile-range-421-hp-motor-smartzone-sensor-120004604.html">range</a>, but Antarctica's one and only EV has received a tune-up due to the realities of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cop27-climate-agreement-173357879.html">climate change</a>. Venturi has <a href="https://www.venturi.com/en/news/venturi-antarctica-upgrades/">revealed</a> that it upgraded its Venturi Antarctica electric explorer early last year due to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-antarctica-is-hotter-than-its-ever-been.html">warmer conditions</a> on the continent. The original machine was designed to operate in winter temperatures of -58F, but the southern polar region is now comparatively balmy at 14F — and that affected both crews and performance.</p><p>The company has added a ventilation system and air intakes to the front of the Antarctica to prevent overheating in the cockpit, while additional intakes keep the power electronics from cooking. Redesigned wheel sprockets were also necessary to maximize the tracked EV's capabilities. The warmer snow was sticking to the sprockets, creating vibrations as it compacted and hardened. Future upgrades will help restore range lost to changing snow consistency. The Antarctica is built to cover 31 miles, but scientists have been limiting that to 25 miles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Ars Technica</em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/antarcticas-only-electric-exploration-vehicle-gets-an-upgrade-for-2023/">notes</a> Venturi's EV has been in use at Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Station since December 2021. It has two modest 80HP motors and just a 52.6kWh battery (plus an optional second pack), but raw power isn't the point. The design lets station residents perform research without contributing to emissions or polluting a relatively pristine region.</p><p>You might not see Venturi make similar climate-related upgrades for a while. However, the refresh shows how <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tuvalu-climate-change-metaverse-174104228.html">global warming</a> can affect transportation in subtle ways. Venturi and other manufacturers may have to design their next explorers on the assumption that Antarctica won't be as chilly as before.</p>

## 'Star Wars: Visions' Volume 2 debuts May 4th with an Aardman short

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-visions-marvel-studios-what-if-season-one-153109359.html"><em>Star Wars: Visions</em></a> is returning for a second 'season,' this time with a more international scope — including a studio you might not have expected. Disney has <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-visions-volume-2">announced</a> that <em>Star Wars: Visions</em> Volume 2 will premiere May 4th (aka Star Wars Day) with shorts from nine countries, including one from UK stop-motion legend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-wallace-gromit-and-chicken-run-movies-are-coming-to-netflix-182525778.html">Aardman</a>. Details of the project (&quot;I Am Your Mother&quot;) aren't available, but it's directed by <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> veteran Magdalena Osinska.</p><p>Other titles come from 88 Pictures (India), Cartoon Saloon (Ireland), D'art Shtajio (Japan), El Guiri (Spain), Punkrobot (Chile), Studio La Cachette (France), Studio Mir (South Korea) and Triggerfish (South Africa). Some of the creators have illustrious credentials. El Guiri's Rodrigo Blaas is a Pixar alumnus, for example, while Triggerfish has worked on BBC titles like <em>The Highway Rat</em> and <em>Stick Man</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first <em>Visions</em> focused on Japanese anime studios' approach to the Star Wars universe, including well-known names like Production I.G (<em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em>) and Trigger (<em>Kill la Kill</em>). Creators were given more creative freedom than those producing canonical movies and TV shows — they were free to not only pursue different art styles and themes, but to break continuity with the official storyline. That's likely to continue with Volume 2, as series executive producer James Waugh says the anthology is about &quot;celebratory expressions&quot; of Star Wars that open &quot;bold new ways&quot; of telling stories in the space fantasy setting.</p><p>The <em>Visions</em> release date bolsters an increasingly packed Star Wars release schedule at Disney+. It starts with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mandalorian-season-3-arrives-on-march-1st-063057873.html"><em>The Mandalorian</em> season three</a> on March 1st, but will also include <em>Young Jedi Adventures</em> (spring), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-play-ahsoka-hayden-christensen-095105982.html"><em>Ahsoka</em></a> and <em>Skeleton Crew</em>. You'll have plenty to watch, then, even if the animated shorts aren't to your liking.</p>

## Hasselblad X2D 100C: Incredible resolution, beautiful imperfections

<p>After releasing two previous models, Hasselblad seems to have finally nailed the compact medium format camera with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vaHN4MmQxMDBjLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0MmY5YzUxLTQ2NmMtNDY0Zi1iM2UyLTQ0ODAzZmExZjE1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAalXvVFlx9qn1XU5pyi9S1OAxpfaUOeIcME2VNpxLFKo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fhsx2d100c.html">X2D 100C</a>. With a 100-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor that doubles the resolution of the last model, it promises incredible image quality and a stunning design. However, it also has limited autofocus abilities, no video and a large price tag. So is this just a luxury item, or is it good for serious photographers?</p><p>My pro photographer friend Nathanael Charpentier wanted to find out. He was interested in seeing if the X2D could help him take more creative photos compared to his current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">Sony A1</a> and A9 cameras. At the same time, he was looking to use it in select situations to complement, rather than replace his existing setup.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5ab9ef21ff3e469f9aaa8e292e94990f"></div><p>The X2D is obviously going to work well and take great shots in a controlled studio environment, but Nathanael wanted to test it in more challenging scenarios like live events. As such, he photographed a theatrical group, several professional scenarios, musicians and an evening out – with both the Hasselblad and his Sony A1 for comparison. I also took it myself to test in low light, for landscapes and more.</p><p><strong>Body and handling</strong></p><p>The X2D is bound to draw comparisons to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-gfx-100s-review-140025104.html">Fujifilm’s 100-megapixel GFX 100S</a>. On the one hand, Fuji’s model has more advanced technology like eye- and face-detect AI autofocus. However, the Hasselblad offers a better industrial design, handling and build quality.</p><p>Physically, they couldn’t be more different. Where the GFX 100S looks like other Fuji mirrorless cameras but larger, the X2D is sleeker and more modern. It has nearly the same design and controls as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-19-hasselblad-x1d-ii-medium-format-mirrorless-camera-updates.html">X1D II</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-hasselblad-x1d-medium-format-mirrorless-camera.html">X1D first introduced in 2017</a>, with a few refinements. That’s great, as the body is both beautiful and practical. There are a few usability quirks, though.</p><p>The control layout is sparse compared to the GFX 100S and most other modern mirrorless cameras. It has front and rear dials for primary settings, along with ISO/white balance, mode, power, exposure lock, display and menu buttons. They’re generally responsive and have a high quality feel.</p><p>It’s relatively light for its category at 895 grams but still quite heavy. Luckily the big, non-slip grip is nice to hold and makes the X2D comfortable for all-day sessions. Ergonomically, it’s generally easy to use, but I missed having a joystick to move the AF point. That has to be done using either the display or the dials, which can be awkward.</p><p>The menu system is equally simple. The main settings are available on one screen, and everything else has its own category, like focus, exposure and general settings. Again, it’s easy to use, but some extra manual controls would help if you need to make adjustments on the fly.</p><p>Where the X1D II had a fixed display, the 3.6-inch, has a 2.36-million dot touchscreen. It’s the only way to change many settings, so luckily it’s bright, sharp and reactive. It does tilt up, unlike past models, but only 70 degrees which is insufficient for very low shooting angles. It’s also blocked a bit by the large protruding viewfinder (EVF) when you’re looking straight down.</p><figure><img alt="Hasselblad X2D 100C: Incredible resolution, beautiful imperfections" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/689875b1-a2f6-11ed-bbff-db9e5b4d2312" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of, the OLED EVF is another strong point. It has a sharp 5.76 million dot resolution with a 60 fps refresh rate and a huge 100 percent magnification. It even offers an electronic diopter adjustment for folks who wear glasses, which proved to be effective and kind of cool. Setting it is like taking an eye test, as words come into focus.</p><p>On top of the CFexpress Type B slot, the X2D has a built-in 1TB SSD, enough to hold over 3,000 RAW and JPEG shots. It’s easily fast and spacious enough to hold and transfer the enormous images. I never even used the CFexpress slot, except as a backup – but it’s also nice to have a high-speed card slot for rapid transfers.</p><p>With 420 shots, battery life is better than on past models, but still on the low end, and that figure is reasonably accurate in our experience. Luckily, it supports PD 3.0 fast charging up to 30W, so you can get a full charge in about 2 hours and run it on AC power in a studio. Still, I’d recommend extra batteries and the optional dual-battery charger, which costs $155 extra.</p><figure><img alt="Hasselblad X2D 100C: Incredible resolution, beautiful imperfections" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/689875b2-a2f6-11ed-aeff-5fa012acbeab" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you are shooting in a studio, you can use Phocus’s app (on Windows or Mac) for remote triggering and photo organization. It does offer exposure bracketing, but doesn’t have a live view or any way to change settings.</p><p>Finally, while the X2D 100C is well made, Hasselblad doesn’t say if it’s weatherproof, So for landscape shooting in bad weather, the GFX 100S might be a better choice as it’s rated by Fujifilm for dust and splash protection.</p><blockquote><p><em>Nathanael: My first impression was around the handling. I found the ergonomy to be very good. It’s quite heavy, but it has a great grip, so you always have a good hold on it. It was easy to change key settings like ISO, shutter speed and aperture, but moving the autofocus point could be a bit awkward. Once I got used to the controls I was able to shoot pretty quickly.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><p>With a new processor, the X2D starts up much quicker than before (2 seconds compared to 4 seconds) and is considerably faster in general over the X1D II. Hasselblad also has three new series V lenses (the 38mm f/2.5, 55mm f/2.5 and 90mm f/2.5) that are designed to focus three times faster than past models when used with the X2D’s new hybrid AF system.</p><figure><img alt="Hasselblad X2D 100C: Incredible resolution, beautiful imperfections" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/689fefc0-a2f6-11ed-b7de-668e08e8eeb8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Speed isn’t what the camera was built for, but it can manage about 3.3 images per second (in 14-bit mode only), which isn’t bad considering the 215 MB RAW frame size. However, photographers won’t be buying this as a sports camera and most will likely only ever use it in single-shot mode in order to get full 16-bit images.</p><p>Where past models had contrast detect autofocus only, the X2D finally has superior hybrid phase detect AF. The implementation, though, isn’t ideal. The single small AF point often wasn’t precise enough for the extremely shallow depth of field. And other than a setting to make the focus point slightly larger, there are no other AF options like area, etc.</p><p>Eye and face detection isn’t available either, though Hasselblad has indicated that it’s coming in a future update. Engadget has reached out to the company to find out when that might be happening.</p><p>In any case, Nathanael wasn’t too fussed about perfect AF and often preferred manual focus, and that works very well. Like other mirrorless cameras, it has a magnification system that kicks in when you operate the focus ring manually. However, it’s the best implementation I’ve seen –  the high sensor resolution allows for a large 100 percent zoom, and it’s very clear on the high-resolution display. At the same time, the improved focus clutch on the new V lenses makes fine focus adjustments quite easy.</p><figure><img alt="Hasselblad X2D 100C: Incredible resolution, beautiful imperfections" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/689875b4-a2f6-11ed-bddb-1e14f4728ee0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Hasselblad’s famous mechanical leaf shutter built into the lenses keeps noise and vibrations to a minimum and allows flash sync up to the maximum 1/2000th speed. As with Fuji’s GFX100s, the electronic shutter isn’t really usable for most moving subjects due to the extreme rolling shutter.</p><p>Finally, the X2D is equipped with a new stabilization system developed from scratch by Hasselblad for the large sensor. It allows for a claimed seven stops of blur reduction, compared to six for the GFX 100S. That allowed us to take sharp pictures at shutter speeds as low as a fifth of a second – no mean feat with such an exacting sensor.</p><blockquote><p><em>Nathanael: I shot almost exclusively in manual focus to start with. It didn’t bother me because there are several tools to help a lot with that. When you turn the focus ring, it really zooms in, and you can clearly see the focus. Later on, I learned all the quirks of the autofocus and figured out how to make it work better, so I started using it more often. At the end, I was mostly taking sharp photos using a mix of manual and autofocus, depending on the situation.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Image Quality</strong></p><p>The X2D’s greatest weapon is the new 100 megapixel, backside illuminated sensor – likely the same one used on Fujifilm’s GFX 100S and its own <a href="https://www.hasselblad.com/h-system/h6d-100c/">H6D-100C</a>. For reference, the pixel size on the X2D is 3.76 micrometers, the same as Sony’s 61-megapixel A7R V. You can shoot JPEG, 10-bit HEIF or 16-bit RAW photos.</p><p>Hasselblad says that dynamic range exceeds 15 stops, which is more than any camera I’ve ever tested. The company also uses what it calls “Natural Color Science” to provide accurate and pleasing hues.</p><p>With all that, the X2D delivers the best images I’ve ever seen straight out of a camera. Color rendering is superb, and of course images have more sharpness and detail than nearly every other camera on the market. That’s aided by the new XCD V series lenses, which deliver incredible sharpness all the way to the edge of the frame.</p><section><img alt="Hasselblad X2D 100C sample image gallery" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/7316dd51-a2fc-11ed-ab39-acae6dca959c" /></section><p>Low-light performance is formidable for such a high-resolution camera as well. Grain is well controlled up to ISO 6400, and while it’s far more noticeable at ISO 12800, picture quality is still excellent. Beyond that, though, grain starts to become noticeable and distracting.</p><p>The 16-bit RAW files provide incredible detail and nuance. They can be pulled and stretched in post by a large amount, making them great for pros who do a lot of post-processing. Lightroom worked well for the editing I did, though you’ll need a reasonably powerful computer to handle those enormous file sizes. All that being said, you often don’t need to do much to photos as they look amazing straight out of the camera.</p><blockquote><p><em>Nathanael: The image quality is really impressive. As soon as I took the first photos and looked at them, I said “wow!” There’s almost no need for post processing. One thing I like is contrast. With the X2D I can take contrasty photos, but they still have tons of detail. And you get incredible dynamic range in low light.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Wrap-up</strong></p><figure><img alt="Hasselblad X2D 100C: Incredible resolution, beautiful imperfections" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/68978b52-a2f6-11ed-ad77-361704a522b4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The X2D is Hasselblad’s best X System camera so far, thanks to improvements across the board but especially with image quality.

That said, it’s not a giant leap over the $6,000 GFX100S and is relatively cheap for a Hasselblad. Plus, it’s designed mostly for pro photographers who would see it as a working tool.</p><p>More importantly, how does Nathanael feel about it?</p><blockquote><p><em>Nathanael: In a way, it’s a return to “real photography,” where you manually control every aspect, even the focus. At the same time, I found it could handle tricky non-studio work. I would only use it in certain situations, like during pre-wedding preparations of the bride: make up, hairstyle, dressing </em>— <em>because those are aesthetic moments where you have more time. I'd also use it for photos of the nuptials. However, for critical live work, like the marriage itself, the A1 and A9 would remain my primary cameras. </em><br /><br /><em>It's certainly an outstanding portrait camera, with gobsmacking resolution and image quality. And another thing, when you arrive to shoot with a Hasselblad, it's noticed by astute clients. It seems like nothing, but it does give extra credibility that you don’t get with other cameras. </em><br /><br /><em>So that begs the question: Is it really worth it, or not? Because it’s quite the investment, $8,200 (8,700 euros) for the camera and another $8,000 or so for the lenses. But my feeling is, better equipment lets you take better photos, which helps attract a superior clientele. But that only applies if the camera truly brings something extra to the table, and the X2D really does that.</em></p></blockquote>

## Documents show Meta paid for data scraping despite years of denouncing it

<p>Meta has routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-lawsuit-data-scraping-facebook-instagram-voyager-labs-180139048.html">fought data scrapers</a>, but it also participated in that practice itself — if not necessarily for the same reasons. <em>Bloomberg</em> has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-02/meta-was-scraping-sites-for-years-while-fighting-the-practice?sref=10lNAhZ9">obtained</a> legal documents from a Meta lawsuit against a former contractor, Bright Data, indicating that the Facebook owner paid its partner to scrape other websites.  Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed the relationship in a discussion with <em>Bloomberg</em>, but said his company used Bright Data to build brand profiles, spot &quot;harmful&quot; sites and catch phishing campaigns, not to target competitors.</p><p>Stone added that data scraping could serve &quot;legitimate integrity and commercial purposes&quot; so long as it was done legally and honored sites' terms of service. Meta terminated its arrangement with Bright Data after the contractor allegedly violated company terms when gathering and selling data from Facebook and Instagram.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Neither Bright Data nor Meta is saying which sites they scraped. Bright Data is countersuing Meta in a bid to keep scraping Facebook and Instagram, arguing that it only collects publicly available information and respects both European Union and US regulations.</p><p>Meta has spent years <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-lawsuit-instagram-profile-scraping-220032564.html">suing individuals</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-sues-data-scraping-company-octopus-213001115.html">companies</a> for scraping its platforms without permission. In some cases, it has accused companies of masking their activities and accessing sensitive details that require logins. Last year, for instance, Meta sued Octopus last year over a tool that reportedly collected sign-ins and took private information like dates of birth and phone numbers.</p><p>However, the Bright Data revelation isn't a good look for a company that has faced numerous privacy violation accusations, including some related to scrapers. The EU <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html">fined Meta €265 million</a> (about $277 million) last fall for allegedly failing to protect Facebook users against scraping that grabbed and exposed private information. This latest case isn't guaranteed to create further trouble, but certainly won't help Meta's defense.</p>

## The best power banks for 2023

<p>Whether you call them battery packs, power banks or portable chargers, these accessories do one thing well: charge your devices when you can’t find an open outlet. Small enough to fit in a day pack and sturdy enough to live at the bottom of your carry on, battery packs can charge your smartphone, tablet, laptop or even all three at once, depending on the size of the battery. What size you’ll need, and any extra features you may find useful, will largely depend on the devices you plan on charging up. With so many of these accessories on the market right now, we tested out a bunch to see which are worth your money.</p><h2>What to look for in a portable battery pack</h2><h3><strong>Battery type</strong></h3><p>Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries">increased</a> in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t <a href="https://www.cei.washington.edu/education/science-of-solar/battery-technology/">suffer</a> from a memory effect (where battery life deteriorates due to partial charges).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One drawback you may have heard is the possibility of lithium ion batteries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lithium-ion-battery-salt-fireproofing-213055538.html">catching fire</a>. To limit the danger, battery packs require internal mechanisms to limit things like voltage and pressure. While you should still make sure a battery isn’t exposed to unnecessary stress like excessive heat, damage from drops or operating in freezing weather, battery packs are considered safe enough to bring on an airplane. According to the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-100-watt-hours-or-less-device">TSA</a>, external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) can fly with you – just make sure you stash them in your carry on as they aren’t allowed in checked baggage.</p><h3><strong>Capacity</strong></h3><p>Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries, say those that can charge a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent, tend to have a 5,000mAh capacity. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh. Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.</p><p>You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.</p><h3><strong>Ports</strong></h3><p>While the tech world is (thankfully) moving towards USB-C as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-usb-c-port-charging-requirement-approved-141546579.html">standard</a>, it’s still a mixed bag in the power bank world. All of our picks have at least one USB-C port and a few also have a USB-A port or two. Newer Android smartphones charge via USB-C, iPhones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-mac-accessories-usb-c-report-170406614.html">still use the</a> Lightning port, but the latest tablets (including current generation iPads) and newer laptops are typically powered up via USB-C.</p><p>When a battery pack has more than one port, they usually serve different functions. You’ll typically see at least one port labeled “in/out,” which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your device. While USB-A ports can power up smartphones and other small devices, they can’t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren’t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re deciding which ports and cables to use to connect your phone to the pack.</p><p>There’s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it’ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower.</p><p>You’ll also want to consider your cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you’ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivered from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you’ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don’t, we’ve tried and liked <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFBWUUM1QzYvP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taXItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR_xsREa_And-v6ZXl_ejxtt2D4oWXYQ-2zL5SSYmK0M&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08PVQC5C6%2F%3Fth%3D1">Anker’s 100W USB-C cable</a>. For smaller devices, we used this <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb25pbWJsZS5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvdXNiLWMtY2FibGVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3VzYi1jLWNhYmxlLXBvd2Vya25pdCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTE0OWQxOGEtMzY2ZC00MWU3LTljZmEtN2NlNGQwZmQ2ODM1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWJmFK5yLOrU_OxXHu5r_FfdjuwPrTE0Drz9ZoHY5j4C&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gonimble.com%2Fcollections%2Fusb-c-cables%2Fproducts%2Fusb-c-cable-powerknit">60W cable from Nimble</a> and we don’t recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer.</p><h3><strong>Design</strong></h3><p>For the most part, battery packs have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the largest banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating a percentage for the remaining battery, which can be helpful if you’re relying on a pack in a mobile office setting or something similar.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><figure><img alt="Overhead view of the devices used for battery testing arranged on a table, including an iPhone, Galaxy phone and iPad, all face down.

And while the kickstand feature felt mildly useful, the battery itself was bulky – but that’s understandable for a power bank that’s twice as large as Spigen’s. Ultimately, the ArcHybrid performed better as a quick and convenient way to give a partial charge to your iPhone on the go.</p><p>It’s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than wired. Our tests showed wired battery banks deliver a device charge at around 60 percent efficiency. With the wireless chargers, that rate dropped to an average of 46 percent.

The battery charged a depleted Galaxy S22 Ultra to 75 percent in a little over an hour, so you’ll be covered if you don’t have long between flights to give your phone a bit more juice. It also has a built-in plug and allows for pass-through charging, which means it can act as a wall adapter if you’re ever stuck with both a dead battery bank and phone, but happen to be near an outlet. It doesn’t come with a cable, though, so you’ll need to provide one that can go from the bank’s single USB-C port to your device.</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>: 5,000 mAh, 10W max<br /><strong>Ports</strong>: One USB-C and wall outlet prongs<br /><strong>Cable</strong>: None<br /><strong>Number of charges Galaxy S22 Ultra</strong>: 0.75<br /><strong>Charge time Galaxy</strong>: 0 to 75% in 1h 7m</p><h2>Best low capacity battery: BioLite Charge 40 PD</h2><p></p><p>BioLite is probably better known in the outdoor community than the tech world, and it’s fair to say that the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c7108adf-28cd-4cee-8929-a1014adc3d98&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BioLite&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzEwOGFkZi0yOGNkLTRjZWUtODkyOS1hMTAxNGFkYzNkOTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlvbGl0ZWVuZXJneS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvY2hhcmdlLTQwLVBEIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASr_WKmfS5i4ZbGXbyABmsC4zYdjdQOP5QM6d1hBdp7a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bioliteenergy.com%2Fproducts%2Fcharge-40-PD">Charge 40 PD</a> is geared more towards camping trips than urban commutes. But this battery simply outperformed the others in its category. The rugged, yellow-accented exterior is a refreshing change from the standard shiny black of many tech accessories. It also has a rubberized finish and feels solid enough to handle the bumps and jolts of riding around in a purse or messenger bag all day. It gave both the iPhone and the Galaxy one and a half charges, which means it’s plenty capable of reviving a dead phone a couple of times when you’re out and about.</p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb25pbWJsZS5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvcG9ydGFibGUtYmF0dGVyeS1jaGFyZ2Vycy9wcm9kdWN0cy9jaGFtcC1wb3J0YWJsZS1jaGFyZ2VyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd6EcGyu1V9q1xaUOKOdyi6jJKW4FoemqVdb-iB1Q3x9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gonimble.com%2Fcollections%2Fportable-battery-chargers%2Fproducts%2Fchamp-portable-charger">Nimble Champ</a> gets an honorary mention here because it’ll also deliver a few reliable fill-ups and comes in a rugged package.

Over the month and a half I spent testing battery packs, this was the unit I grabbed the most when my own devices needed a charge. It has a stylish exterior with a gray faux leather finish and copper detailing. A little bigger than a deck of cards and weighing just over 11 ounces, it’s a nice looking accessory that feels solid.</p><p>It filled up both smartphones twice, then gave an additional third of a charge each. I introduced the iPad to the mix here and got a full charge plus an extra third. The Otterbox also lost very little charge while sitting dormant, which means if you carry it around on the off chance that you’ll need it, it should have plenty of power when the time comes.</p><p>This category may have been the closest to call, as <a href="https://us.anker.com/products/a1366?currency=USD&amp;variant=42089536192662">Anker’s 535 Power Core</a> performed slightly better than the Otterbox, but Anker’s price point is higher. That said, if you want a screaming fast charge for your Galaxy phone, grab the 535. It got the Galaxy up to 100 percent three times, taking about an hour each time. It had enough left over for a small nine-percent charge before it finally gave up. While the battery did get pretty warm, it never felt overly hot.

The 737 fully charged our S22 Ultra three times, with enough left over for another 93 percent charge – and those full charges completed in under an hour on average. That’s on par with outlet charging. The numbers for the iPhone were slightly less staggering, but still impressive, going from zero to full in about an hour and a half. The iPad charged completely twice, and did so in just over two hours, which is also close to that device’s wall-connected charge speeds.</p><p>While it’s great for multiple full charges on a given smartphone, I should point out that the 737 has three ports, but only one of those is USB-C.

It’s capable of charging three devices at once, with a different wattage rating for each port: 100W, 45W and 20W. In practice, that means you could use the ports to charge a laptop, a tablet and a phone simultaneously. To keep the numbers comparable across our testing, I charged one device at a time. Both smartphones juiced up fully three times, with around a third of an additional charge left over. I got about two full charges from the battery on the iPad Air.</p><p>The Powerstation XL has the look and feel of a fancy pocketbook with a marled gray fabric exterior that feels nice in the hand and, incidentally, hides stains well.

With four variable-wattage USB-C ports, a tough exterior and included semi-hard case, it seems tailor made to act as a power source for mobile photoshoots or nomadic offices. The charge speeds were a little slower than the Mophie, but it did manage to give a few more percentage points of charge to the iPad and the Galaxy phone, filing the latter four times. In the end, it came down to price: for $50 more than the Mophie, the Supertank Pro’s speeds and capacity just didn’t edge it out. But if you happen to see the Supertank on sale, snap it up.</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>:  25,000mAh, 120W max<br /><strong>Ports</strong>: One USB-C in/out, two USB-C out only<br /><strong>Cable</strong>: USB-C to USB-C<br /><strong>Number of charges iPhone 14 Plus</strong>: 3.23<br /><strong>Charge time iPhone</strong>: 0 to 100% in 1h 45m average and 23% in 18m<br /><strong>Number of charges Galaxy S22 Ultra</strong>: 3.85<br /><strong>Charge time Galaxy</strong>: 0 to 100% in 1h 36m and 85% in 1h 12m<br /><strong>Number of charges iPad Air</strong>: 2.02<br /><strong>Charge time iPad</strong>: 0 to 100% in 2h 16m and 2% in 7m</p>

## Lyft's next-generation scooters will offer a smoother ride

<p>The next time you rent a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-14-lyft-scooter-for-sharing.html">Lyft scooter</a>, you might find the company has a new model for you to ride. Starting today, Lyft is rolling out a “next-gen” electric scooter across its footprint. The device features a redesigned suspension system Lyft claims will result in smoother rides. The company says the new model can also travel to places its previous scooters could not, thanks to a more powerful motor and 11.5-inch airless tires.</p><p>Internally, Lyft has equipped the scooter with a swappable battery that provides up to 50 miles of range and that can be charged out in the field. Later this year, the company plans to roll out a variant of the scooter that can recharge at stations connected to local electrical grids. The scooter also features cameras and Lyft’s latest sidewalk detection and parking awareness software. When you need to park the scooter, that software will use visual cues to alert you of restrictions, including areas where you can’t leave the scooter. Last but not least, the scooter comes with a built-in phone mount to make navigating easier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Lyft's new docking station on the corner of a street.

The company has redesigned its steel bollards to make them more resistant to corrosion and rust, and, thereby, easier to maintain. It has also added solar cells to the bollards and found a way to make them more power efficient. Those are changes Lyft says should make them go longer between battery swaps. As mentioned above, the bollards can also pull power from the local power grid, a feature Lyft claims will increase vehicle availability. If you’ve run into trouble docking a Lyft scooter or e-bike before, you’ll also be happy to learn the new bollards feature a redesigned locking mechanism Lyft says requires “significantly” less physical effort to use. Additionally, they feature flip dots and speakers to make using them more accessible to first-time users.</p><p>Lyft hasn’t said when people in specific cities could expect to see its new scooters and docking infrastructure arrive, but it sounds like the rollout will take place gradually throughout the year.</p>

## TikTok rolls out its own strike system for creators who violate its rules

<p>TikTok is trying to make it easier for creators and others to navigate its rules, and understand what’s happening to their accounts. The company is<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/supporting-creators-with-an-updated-account-enforcement-system"><ins> introducing</ins></a> a revamped “account enforcement system,” a series of changes that includes a new strike system, as well as  features that allow creators to check if their content has been blocked from the app’s recommendations.</p><p>The changes come amid a broader<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8yNi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3Rpa3Rvay1ieXRlZGFuY2UtZGF0YS1zZWN1cml0eS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYWY0ZDZiMS1lMzY3LTQzMTctOTU4MC1kMWIwNmQwNTJhYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUWwz5g4-hk-Ba6LLrmPKnDFEdVn4j1nFWwv6Txa4O5f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F01%2F26%2Ftechnology%2Ftiktok-bytedance-data-security.html"><ins> push</ins></a> from TikTok to increase transparency around how it handles content moderation and algorithmic recommendations, both of which have been subject to intense scrutiny by lawmakers, regulators and other critics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a blog post, the company says the new strike system is meant to address “repeat offenders” who can have an outsized impact on the platform. “Under the new system, if someone posts content that violates one of our Community Guidelines, the content will be removed and their account will accrue a strike,” the company explains. “If an account meets the threshold of strikes within either a product feature (i.e. Comments, LIVE) or policy (i.e. Bullying and Harassment), it will be permanently banned.” The company added that users may also be banned after just one strike if the violation is considered “severe.”</p><p>The change makes TikTok’s policy more in line with that of its peers. YouTube and Meta also use a strike system against accounts that break their rules, though each platform has its own criteria for determining strikes, and the penalties associated with them.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots of TikTok's new features for tracking account strikes and user reports." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/17c17dc0-a2cf-11ed-93e7-3387295ca501" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TikTok</div></figure><p>In that vein, TikTok says it  will also provide creators with new tools to view if their account has racked up any strikes over the previous 90 days. The feature will live in a new “account status” section of the app’s Safety Center. The company is also adding a “reports” section, where users can follow up on any content or accounts they’ve reported.</p><p>TikTok’s also starting to test two new features that deal with recommendations. The first is a feature that will notify creators if one of their videos has been blocked from the app’s For You page. The feature, which the company says “will be testing in select markets over the coming weeks,” will “let them know why, and give them the opportunity to appeal.”</p><p>The second test is a feature that will allow users to essentially reset the recommendations that appear in For You page. According to a TikTok spokesperson, those in the test will see a “refresh” option in their For You feed, which basically gives the app’s main feed a fresh start. After the feed is “refreshed,” videos will be surfaced purely from new interactions and activity rather than what a user has historically interacted with.</p><p>The updates come at a precarious moment for TikTok. The company has spent the last two years negotiating with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) over changes to its policies and practices so it can continue to operate in the US. At the same time, scrutiny of the company has only intensified, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-attempts-ban-tiktok-on-government-devices-through-17-trillion-spending-bill-204028363.html"><ins>numerous</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/georgia-tiktok-wechat-telegram-ban-211015416.html"><ins>bans</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-attempts-ban-tiktok-on-government-devices-through-17-trillion-spending-bill-204028363.html"><ins>proposed bans</ins></a> piling up. And while the latest changes could meaningfully increase transparency for TikTok’s creators and users — who have sometimes complained that the app’s policies are unclear or unevenly enforced — the updates alone are unlikely to satisfy the company’s staunchest critics.</p><p>But TikTok isn’t only relying on product changes. The company has also been <em>physically</em> showing off its stated commitment to transparency by opening up tours of its freshly opened “Transparency and Accountability Center,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-tiktok-us-transparency-center-spying-security-threat.html"><ins>a space</ins></a> at its Los Angeles office where participants can get a firsthand glimpse of how the company handles recommendations and content moderation.</p><p>This week, TikTok offered reporters a tour of the center as part of its shifting strategy to win over critics. We’ll have more to say soon about the transparency center, and TikTok’s sweeping plan to comply with US regulators, but both seem to be aimed at tackling one of the central criticisms of TikTok head on: that the app’s recommendations algorithm is opaque and ripe for abuse.</p><p>So while changes like the ones announced today don’t come close to addressing the full scope of critics’ concerns, it does help TikTok begin to chip away at the perception that the app is an impossible-to-understand black box.</p>

## ChatGPT reportedly reached 100 million users in January

<p>ChatGPT has been growing at a rate much, much faster than TikTok or any other popular app or service. According to a new study by analytics firm UBS (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-audit-irs-black-americans-more-likely-to-get-audited/"><em>CBS</em></a>), the OpenAI-developed chatbot was on pace to reach over 100 million monthly active users in January. The chatbot only became available to the public on November 30th last year, but its rise to fame has apparently been meteoric. Within its first month of availability, it already boasted 57 million monthly active users, the study said. By January, it was already being visited by around 13 million individual users a day.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, it took TikTok nine months after its global debut to reach 100 million monthly users despite its popularity, especially among the younger generation. UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley also <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/chatgpt-investors-ai-microsoft-stock-51675284609">pointed out</a> that Meta's Instagram had been around for two-and-a-half years before reaching that point. It remains to be seen, however, if the chatbot can maintain this level of interest in the coming months. &quot;The next question is obviously what its staying power will be. There may be an element of people just coming to look,&quot; Walmsley added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ChatGPT provides users with natural-sounding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-chatgpt-detection-tool-214506831.html">human-like responses</a> to queries, so much so that educators are concerned that it could be used by students to cheat. While it still has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-reviewing-ai-written-articles-serious-errors-113041405.html">serious accuracy problems</a> — &quot;Models like ChatGPT have a notorious tendency to spew biased, harmful, and factually incorrect content,&quot; <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/17/1067014/heres-how-microsoft-could-use-chatgpt/">MIT's Tech Review</a> wrote in a piece — there isn't another public chatbot with comparable capabilities. It has reportedly rattled Google's execs to the point that they decided to declare &quot;code red&quot; and accelerated the company's AI development. The tech giant is working on a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-experimental-chatgpt-rivals-search-bot-apprentice-bard-050314110.html">potential ChatGPT competitors</a>, including a chatbot for search, and is aiming to showcase 20 AI products this year.&nbsp;</p><p>ChatGPT remains free to use at the moment, and OpenAI doesn't seem to have any plans to completely lock access to it behind a paywall.

<p>Samsung’s first big tech event of 2023 unveiled three phones and three laptops. The showstoppers are, predictably, the company’s premium flagships, the Galaxy S series. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-hands-on-specs-price-availability-200-megapixel-camera-test-180044964.html">S23 Ultra</a> ($1,199) has a huge 6.8-inch, an S-pen stylus and a 200-megapixel camera. That’s a lot of pixels.</p><p>It’s the company’s first Adaptive Pixel sensor, which means while you can still shoot at 200MP, by default, the system uses pixel-binning to deliver brighter, clearer pictures at 50MP or 12MP. Other upgrades include optical image stabilization that’s been effectively doubled for better-lit photos and less shaky video.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S23 (starting at $800) and S23+ ($1,000) are slightly more iterative but still premium smartphones. They pack reliable cameras and faster processors – the entire S23 series has a special overclocked version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. All the phones are available to pre-order now.</p><p>Samsung also revealed an ultra laptop. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-laptop-hands-on-nvidia-rtx-4070-180029774.html"><ins>16-inch Galaxy Book 3 Ultra</ins></a> draws inspiration from the company’s best-selling Galaxy S phones, but combines it with heavy-hitting PC specs, like 13th-gen Intel Core i9 processors and NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4070 graphics.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## PS5 beta update finally adds Discord voice chat

<p>After lightly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-ps4-ps5-integration-playstation-205352162.html">integrating Discord features </a>on PlayStation 5 consoles in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-discord-integration-181459496.html">early 2022</a>, voice chat has finally arrived in its latest beta update, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/02/02/ps5-beta-introduces-discord-voice-chat-vrr-support-for-1440p-and-more/?sf263915619=1">announced</a>. PS5 Testers in the US, Canada and Japan will be able to join Discord calls, some months after Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-voice-chat-xbox-193316622.html">introduced the feature</a> on Xbox. The PS5 is also gaining Variable Refresh Rate support for 1440p, along with dashboard UX improvements and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Discord integration is a bit clunky, much like it was on Xbox at first. Here's how to set it up and use it, according to <a href="https://discord.com/blog/playstation-5-voice-integration-announcement">Discord's blog</a>. First, you need to link your PlayStation Network (PSN) account to Discord, then select Discord under &quot;Linked Services.&quot; After that, you can complete the integration using either a QR code or the PS5's integrated browser.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Each time you want to use Discord chat on console, though, you'll need to use your mobile device to transfer your conversation, which isn't ideal. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-november-update-discord-twitch-181425153.html">Back in November</a>, Microsoft made it possible to join Discord chats directly from the console, so hopefully Sony will eventually do the same.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="PS5's latest beta finally introduces Discord voice chat" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/79773000-a2e8-11ed-a5b9-9fb75cc8e31d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Other new social features include a new way to share screens, party chats in the dashboard and &quot;friends who play&quot; that shows which of your friends are playing a game right now. Sony also introduced Variable Refresh Rate support for 1440p gaming, so HDMI 2.1 displays should exhibit smoother performance at that resolution with less tearing. Sony launched PS5 VRR in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-variable-refresh-rate-vrr-release-date-193228613.html">April last year</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-finally-1440p-support-121947889.html">1440p support</a> shortly afterwards, but the two features have yet to work together.&nbsp;</p><p>Gamers will also find new tools to access PS4 saved data on a PS5, along with the ability to move games from one PS5 console to another over WiFi or ethernet. The new beta is rolling out to certified testers today, and should be available to everyone else over the next few months.</p>

## Twitter will charge developers to access its API starting February 9th
 - [https://www.engadget.com/twitter-charging-developers-api-access-104917093.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/twitter-charging-developers-api-access-104917093.html?src=rss)

<p>Developers will soon have to pay Twitter to be able to use its API. The website has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621027418680229888">announced</a> through its Twitter Dev account that it will no longer support free access to its API, both versions 1.1 and 2, starting on February 9th. It will launch a "paid basic tier" instead, but the company has yet to reveal how much it would cost. Twitter has been experimenting with new ways to make more money ever since Elon Musk took the helm. The biggest change so far has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-video-and-ranking-perks-arrive-to-paying-blue-subscribers-125538009.html">Twitter Blue</a>, which evolved into a $8-to-$11-a-month subscription service that allows users to purchase the website's previously elusive blue checkmark.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wMy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Vsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyLW1vbmV5LWZpbmFuY2VzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM5NTUzNjI5LWE2Y2EtNGM0Yi04ZjkwLWQwY2Q2ZDlmNzE4YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAck5ZWnzEhC5rxhGRQ5a98N8ez_dJbIr4f2wy_izc1WP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F11%2F03%2Ftechnology%2Felon-musk-twitter-money-finances.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> report from last year said Musk and his advisers also discussed the possibility of adding paid direct messages and videos behind a paywall. They even reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-orders-vine-reboot-203652582.html">considered reviving Vine</a>, its short-form video app that it shut down back in 2016. Musk has been exploring all possible sources of income to be able to pay the loans he took when he purchased Twitter for $44 billion. As <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/32568ca1-464b-4fcf-8694-44be6be3d686"><em>The Information</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, he borrowed $13 billion from a group of banks to close the deal, and they weren't able to sell the debt to investors as planned. The company now has to pay $1.5 billion every year in interests alone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter showed signs that it had plans to change the way developers accessed its APIs when third-party clients like Tweetbot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/some-third-party-twitter-apps-not-working-right-now-104413240.html">suddenly stopped working</a> in January. Later, the company confirmed that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-third-party-app-developers-api-rules-193013123.html">deliberately cut off their access</a> due to "long-standing API rules," even though it previously removed the section in its developer policies that discouraged app-makers from creating something similar to its core service. A few days after third-party Twitter clients went down, the website <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html">updated its developer agreement</a> to ban access to its "Licensed Materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter Applications."</p><p>"Twitter data are among the world’s most powerful data sets," the company wrote in a follow-up tweet. "We're committed to enabling fast &amp; comprehensive access so you can continue to build with us." While it's pretty clear that Twitter intends to charge developers to use its API, it didn't say if it would make exceptions for researchers. Twitter provides specialized access to its <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research">API for academic research</a>, and people in academia have been using data from the website for their studies across various fields, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308155/">health</a> and politics.&nbsp;</p><p>The website promises to share more details about the new "paid basic tier" for its API next week.</p><div id="d057889b8b09464887df0093b94a3cbf"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter data are among the world’s most powerful data sets.

<p>Kindle's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-signature-edition-130032095.html">Paperwhite 5</a> launched in 2021, but Amazon has just spruced up the models a bit with a couple of new colors and put them on sale for good measure.

It has a bigger and more responsive screen than ever, tiny bezels, both USB-C and wireless charging, a waterproof body, 32GB of storage, automatic brightness and warm light options.

<p>Sony's gaming business had a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=15919d69-aefa-41ae-a977-fdcae58a803c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sony&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxNTkxOWQ2OS1hZWZhLTQxYWUtYTk3Ny1mZGNhZTU4YTgwM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ueS5jb20vZW4vU29ueUluZm8vSVIvbGlicmFyeS9wcmVzZW4vZXIvcGRmLzIycTNfc3VwcGxlbWVudC5wZGYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImExZTAyNzkzLWE0YTEtNGEyMy1hYjk1LTUwNGMzNDRjYTZkZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYY7jBFK79iuQSenG9PcytMa73Mqn25ItiLncMa8y4J1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.com%2Fen%2FSonyInfo%2FIR%2Flibrary%2Fpresen%2Fer%2Fpdf%2F22q3_supplement.pdf">blockbuster holiday quarter</a> as it sold 7.1 million PS5s from October to December compared to 3.9 million in the same quarter last year. That's a whopping 82 percent increase, so the company's supply issues appear to be largely solved — much as the company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-now-sold-25-million-play-station-5-consoles-090420808.html">said as of late</a>. In other words, you should be able to buy a PS5 now with little to no delay.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that resulted in a giant boost in revenue, as its Game &amp; Network Services segment took in 1.25 trillion yen ($9.7 billion), up 53 percent year on year. That includes over double the revenue for hardware and healthy boosts in software (30 percent), network services (20 percent) and others including PSVR and first-party software sales on other platforms (73 percent).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To grasp the significance of all this, Sony has now sold 32.1 million PS5s compared to 25 million in November 2022, so total unit sales increased 28 percent in just a single quarter. It also means that Sony may hit its fiscal year 2022 PS5 sales forecast (18 million units from March 2022 to March 2023) if it can ship 5.2 million consoles, something that seemed wildly optimistic last quarter. If it does reach that goal, it will hit PS5 sales of over 37 million units.</p><p>Sony has fought Microsoft's acquisition of Activision, though Microsoft itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sony-exclusive-games-quality-playstation-xbox-activision-blizzard-192512776.html">recently pointed out</a> that Sony has five times more exclusive games than Xbox. In terms of first-party titles, <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</em> were standouts on PS5 this quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony's gaming business dwarfed its other segments, though its imaging sensor business continues to rise as well, with sales up 63 percent year on year to 417 billion yen ($3.24 billion). Sony supplies the lion's share of camera sensors to both smartphone and mirrorless camera manufacturers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## Nissan unveils a real-life version of its Max-Out EV convertible concept

<p>Back in 2021, Nissan revealed a few concept vehicles as part of its announcement that it was going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-to-invest-18-billion-in-ev-development-101834614.html">invest $17.6 billion</a> in the development of electric vehicles over the next few years. One of the concepts it presented is a convertible two-seater sports car called the Max-Out, but the automaker only released a render that showed what it was supposed to look like. Now, the company has shown off a real-life physical version of the Max-Out at the launch of the Nissan Futures event in Yokohama, and it looks like the automaker stayed true to its original design.&nbsp;</p><p>It's still a two-seater convertible with headlights and edges that light up in different neon colors. The EV's design has the mixed aesthetics of several different sci-fi franchises, including <em>Tron</em> and <em>Avatar</em>. But other than showing what it looks like, Nissan hasn't shared details about the EV concept, probably because it doesn't have plans to create a production version of it anytime soon, if at all.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="The back side of Nissan's Max-Out concept on stage." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/63d50cf0-a2c4-11ed-befe-9f6831b92f8a" style="height: 944; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TORU HANAI/Engadget</div></figure><p>When the company first unveiled the Max-Out, it vowed to develop 23 electrified vehicles and to launch 15 new EVs by 2030. It didn't make a pledge to go fully electric by the end of the decade, but it did say that it was aiming for a mix of EVs and gas vehicles. In particular, it's targeting a market mix of 75 percent electrified vehicles in Europe and 40 percent electrified in the US and China. One of the EVs it has released since its 2021 announcement is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-ariya-ev-2023-pricing-212421384.html">Ariya</a>, Nissan's first electric crossover, which has an estimated range of 216 to 304 miles depending on the variant.&nbsp;</p><p>Nissan says the Futures event will showcase how it's "shaping the future of sustainable mobility and innovative design" and how it's preparing for "the various challenges and opportunities the coming large-scale transition to electric mobility will bring." While the event will be held at the company's global headquarters in Japan, Nissan will upload some panel recordings on its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vTmlzc2FuIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwODIwNWExMS0zODQ0LTRhNTQtYTdlNC0xM2M4MDUxYWE4YzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARGe7sAiOLJnIhiYwgn2RrnQ49GQXJ8OARQB5s4PQ9fV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2FNissan">YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p><div id="49114b8d2a0641e189bb346d766d6365"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## FTC fines drug discount app for sharing user information to Facebook and Google

<p>The Federal Trade Commission has slapped prescription drug discount app GoodRx with a $1.5 million fine <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/ftc-enforcement-action-bar-goodrx-sharing-consumers-sensitive-health-info-advertising">for the unauthorized disclosure</a> of customers' identifiable health information with third parties, such as Facebook and Google. This is the first time the agency has taken enforcement action under its Health Breach Notification Rule, which requires vendors of personal health records to notify customers if their data has been breached. While the rule has applied to companies handling health records since 2009, FTC commissioners <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-rules-that-health-apps-must-notify-consumers-if-their-data-is-breached-114043312.html">voted in favor</a> of expanding it to cover health apps in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the FTC, the California-based telehealth service repeatedly violated the rule by sharing customers' personal health information, including their health conditions and the medicine they're taking. Further, it shared their information with companies that have third-party advertising platforms like Facebook, Google and Criteo despite making a promise to customers that it will never do so. The FTC says GoodRx also monetized its customers' information. In 2019, for instance, it uploaded the email addresses, phone numbers and mobile advertising IDs of users who purchased certain medications to Facebook, so it can target them with health-related ads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to imposing a $1.5 million fine on GoodRx, the FTC is also seeking to change how the company handles user information. In its <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/goodrx_stipulated_order_for_permanent_injunction_civil_penalty_judgment_and_other_relief.pdf">proposed court order</a> (PDF) against the company, it listed several provisions, including banning the service from disclosing user data for advertising purposes. For other purposes, it wants to require GoodRx to secure customers' consent first before sharing their health information to third parties. The FTC also wants GoodRx to get the third parties it shared data with to delete its customers' information, and it wants the company to establish a comprehensive privacy program that will protect user data.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in statement:</p><p>&quot;Digital health companies and mobile apps should not cash in on consumers' extremely sensitive and personally identifiable health information. The FTC is serving notice that it will use all of its legal authority to protect American consumers’ sensitive data from misuse and illegal exploitation.&quot;</p>
