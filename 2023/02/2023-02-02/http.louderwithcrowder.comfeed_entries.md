But since it's 2023...well, I think you know where this is going. </p><p>Former NCAA  Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines spoke on Capitol Hill about the large, biologically male elephant in the room: men competing against women in sports. Because inclusivity. Or something. </p><p>Gaines said, <em>"No one has asked us how we felt. We exist to validate a male's identity [...] When they [Lia Thomas's teammates] were concerned about the locker room situation, they sent an email to the Ivy League and NCAA. Their response was, 'here's some counseling resources you should seek if you [don't] feel comfortable seeing male genitalia in your locker room,' and then they were referred to the LGBTQ education center to educate themselves on the oppression that these athletes are dealing with."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Lia Thomas of course is the beautiful and brave UPenn swimmer who became the first transgender athlete to win a national NCAA Division I championship title. Thomas was also nominated for the NCAA's "Woman of the Year" award. At last year's championships, Riley Gaines tied with Thomas for fifth place in the 200 freestyle, and she said the NCAA <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ncaa-prioritize-embarrasses-female-swimmer" target="_blank">gave the fifth-place trophy to Lia.  </a><br /></p><p>Towards the end of her testimony yesterday, Gaines became emotional, choking up as she said, <em>"It's really only happened the last couple of weeks where I'd get emotional talking about the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines" target="_blank">locker room</a> scene, because it is just so wild that you can turn around and see a 6'4 biological man, pull his pants down, watching you undress. And no one is willing to stick up for you?"</em> </p><p>It's important to note that a teammate of Thomas's said Thomas is still <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2022/02/04/why-lia-thomas-is-making-the-womens-locker-room-at-upenn-a-very-awkward-place-n2602854" target="_blank">attracted to women</a>.

## AOC melts down over Ilhan Omar's removal from congressional committee and it's glorious to watch

Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee due to her history of less-than-friendly remarks about Israel and anti-semitic views. In her defense, she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ilhan-omar-cnn" target="_blank">claimed</a> she wasn't being anti-semitic because she didn't know she was being anti-semitic. But for some reason, the Republicans didn't buy it. </p><p>Our beloved media darling AOC had some thoughts on this whole manner. She took to the House floor and made her points loud and clear. Scratch that, she made her points loud. Not so much on the clear part. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cOmg \ud83e\udd21AOC just threw a temper tantrum on the House Floor, slamming her notebook on the podium as she finished speaking.\n\n"This is about targeting women of color in the United States of America."\u201d</div> — Real Mac Report (@Real Mac Report)

</blockquote>
<p>AOC violently flailed her arms about as she railed against Kevin McCarthy and his evil Republican gang. It's difficult to parse exactly what she says, but she did claim, "This is about targeting women of color in the United States of America." She also somehow found a way to relate it back to herself, yelling, "Don't tell me, because I didn't get a single apology when my life was threatened." </p><p>I believe she's referring to when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/leaked-silliness-during-cnn-interview-aoc-compares-jan-6-with-sexual-assault" target="_blank">she almost died </a>on January 6th because she was in a building nearby the Capitol, but actually no one entered her building and a police officer came to take her to safety. A truly inspiring tale. </p><p>As to her claim that this is about "targeting women of color," I reeeaaallly think it's just about the anti-semitism. Like the "it's all about the Benjamins" tweet, or the "Israel hypnotized the world" tweet, or maybe the refusal to condemn the BDS movement, or that time she <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/10/1005227610/omar-is-forced-to-clarify-after-democrats-say-she-equated-u-s-israel-with-terror" target="_blank">compared</a> the United States and Israel to the Taliban, or maybe the fact that even <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ilhan-omar-hamas-statement" target="_blank">Hamas</a> - the<em> terrorist group</em> - thanked her for her support of Palestinians. </p><p>But sure, it's just because Ilhan is a woman of color. Let's go with that. </p><p><p>

## High School musical featuring Jesus Christ and a song about an erection gets canceled. Outrage ensues.

When I was in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/high-school-basketball-coach" target="_blank">high school</a>, the musicals were ' The Little Mermaid' or maybe 'The Wizard of Oz.' Now everything is gay. Literally. </p><p>Case in point: Cardinal High School in Ohio just had its spring musical canceled that was supposed to be shown to Middle Schoolers. The show was canceled over its inclusion of two male gay parent characters and a cameo from Jesus Christ. The school board was also concerned over a song titled 'My Unfortunate Erection.' Such prudes. </p><p>Cardinal High School's musical organizers claim they rewrote this song to be kid-friendly, instead titled, "My Unfortunate <em>Distraction." </em> See, the character was merely facing an inconvenient <em>distraction...</em>in the form of an erection. Totally appropriate. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cCardinal school board abruptly halts high school musical due to 'vulgarity' in play https://t.co/zf6W7GAnsd\u201d</div> — News 5 Cleveland (@News 5 Cleveland)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/WEWS/status/1620800389766414336">1675263900</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The musical,<em> 'The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,'  </em>features a fictional spelling bee of six "quirky" contestants and three "quirky" adult organizers. The erection in question occurs when one of the young contestants is distracted by another female contestant. And Jesus Christ appears after a Catholic child prays for help. </p><p>The decision to cancel the show was met with some backlash from the community. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-mother-son" target="_blank">school board</a> stood by its decision, however, and said anyone alleging discrimination is "mistaken." The district claimed the musical was never approved by the board and they received a parental complaint in early January over the "vulgar" themes. </p><p>Mandi Matchinga, the musical's assistant director and mother of the lead, defended the show, claiming, <em>'Theater is about making you think about things and making you question things and thinking critically.'  </em>I'm not quite sure how one can "think critically" about an erection. But that's just me. </p><p>Matchinga also plans to confront the school board over their decision at an upcoming meeting, and wants to ask:<em> "What is vulgar? What exactly are the issues you have with this show, and can we sit and come to some sort of compromise and agreement?"</em></p><p>I'm gonna take a wild guess here and say the problem is the song about a penis. And also maybe the Jesus Christ cameo. Just a shot in the dark. </p><p><p>

## San Francisco police now have a 36-hour response time for crimes, which explains so much about San Francisco

The land of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-mental-breakdown" target="_blank">homeless encampments</a>, drug addicts, and now, no police force. The perfect leftist city. </p><p>The San Francisco Police department recently failed to respond to a burglary call for 15 hours.  Black Magic Voodoo Lounge owner, Joe Vernieri, called the police at 1:06 PM on January 13th, and the police didn't show up until 3:14 AM the next morning. And an investigation wasn't even opened until January 25th, and still hasn't reached a conclusion. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s police can\u2019t even respond to burglary. What\u2019s going on? https://t.co/wnLyD2bMsm\u201d</div> — Daily Caller (@Daily Caller)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1620945094374313984">1675298400</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Vernieri’s wife told the San Francisco Chronicle, "Small businesses in San Francisco are getting squeezed all the time, and we have no protection from the city. The message is, ‘You should just be happy it wasn’t worse.’”</p><p>You would think it can't get worse than a fifteen-hour response time. And typically, you'd be right. But this is San Francisco, so of course it has to get much, much worse. Chico's Pizza, a business nearby Black Magic Voodoo Lounge, didn't get a response to his burglary call for nearly 36 hours. </p><p>The reason behind these unseemly response times is - surprise - a shortage of police officers. San Francisco supervisor Matt Dorsey called the staffing shortage “catastrophic” with only 1,537 active officers, and nearly 400 on leave. </p><p>Last year, San Francisco Police Officers Association's Lt. Tracy McCray <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/san-francisco-police-union-sounds-alarm-staffing-shortage-crisis" target="_blank">told</a> Fox News the shortage is due to widespread demonization of the police in the city: <em>"You see what they continue to ask us to do, policing a homeless population that is continuing to grow no matter how much money is being thrown at it. You have a profession that's been demonized, the officers dehumanized, and then people just want to demolish it altogether. So who's going to be watching the stores, watching the crimes being committed, trying to solve the crimes to be being committed on the street?"</em></p><p>Who could have possibly foreseen that constant calls to defund the police and encouraging riots against said police would have resulted in a lack of police? I for one am shocked. </p><p><p>

## Pamela Anderson defends her anti-'MeToo' comments...right after she MeToo'd Tim Allen

In it, Anderson doubled down on controversial statements she made during the height of the "Me Too" movement and Harvey Weinstein accusations back in 2017. </p><p>Those comments were made in an interview with Megyn Kelly. During that interview, Anderson said, "Don't go into a hotel room alone. If someone answers the door in a bathrobe, leave [...] It was common knowledge that certain producers or certain people in Hollywood are people to avoid, privately. You know what you're getting into if you go into a hotel room alone."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv5hTeWTLUo" target="_blank">www.youtube.com</a>
</small>
</p><p>Now, nearly six years later, Anderson still refuses to back down. When interviewer Ronan Farrow asked if she thought it was  “a healthy thought to introduce into the dialogue at that point,” Anderson explained, "I could even take it a step further [...] My mother would tell me — and I think this is the kind of feminism I grew up with — it takes two to tango. If someone answers the door in a hotel robe and you’re going for an interview, don’t go in. But if you do go in, get the job.'”<br /></p><p>This is all well and good. However, Anderson also praised the 'Me Too' movement for making people "more careful and respectful." I think she may have misspelled "petrified of looking at a woman the wrong way for fear of losing their entire livelihoods." </p><p>Perhaps the real reason Anderson is thankful for 'Me Too' is it helped sell her new book. She was just in the news for including a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pamela-anderson-tim-allen-book" target="_blank">32-year-old allegation</a> against Tim Allen in her book, claiming he flashed her on the set of Home Improvement.</p><p>Tim Allen denied the allegation, saying he would never do that. His TV wife Pamela Richardson then denied  a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-allen-tv-wife" target="_blank">follow-up allegation</a> that he flashed her, which was somehow supposed to prove he also flashed Anderson. Feminist math is weird. </p><p>The problem with this second allegation was that Allen was actually fully-clothed. You see, a crucial aspect to the crime of flashing is actually the <em>lack</em> of clothing. Little-known fact. </p><p><p>

## 'Fentanyl is colorblind': Black congressman UNLOADS on Biden Admin's pathetic attempt to blame any criticism on race

Wesley Hunt took part in a hearing on the border crisis. You may not have noticed, but there is a crisis along our southern border. It's been that way since around January 22nd, 2021. Critics point to Biden's policies as to why the southern border has been crisis'y this whole time. But one of the witnesses in the hearing blames racism. Like everything else that makes Democrats look bad, being concerned about the border is raaaaaaacist.</p><p>Rep. Hunt was surprised to find this out. As you may notice from the thumbnail, Hunt is not Caucasian. He thought racism was something else. And he's tired of the Biden Aministration using it as their generic "get out of criticism free" card.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Last time I checked, I’ve been black for a long time. I’ve been a minority for a long time. Am I racist for calling what’s happening at the southern border, an invasion? No. I’m a Congressman who is tired of this administration using racism as a scapegoat for everything. -WPH <a href="https://t.co/HbTkEMw5Ks">pic.twitter.com/HbTkEMw5Ks</a><br />— Rep. Wesley Hunt Press Office (@RepWesleyHunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepWesleyHunt/status/1620885287189762050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>This is actually not about race. This is actually an issue about public safety. And if I call this an invasion, sir... I'm not racist. I can assure you I'm not racist. What I can assure you is that I want to make sure that fentanyl doesn't indiscriminately kill ANY race, religion,  color, or creed. Fentanyl doesn't care where you're from. This administration, the democrat party, uses race as a scapegoat for everything.</blockquote><p>There are levels to the game. The Admin will call things the new Jim Crow. Or, if it's something they want to ban, they'll throw in the words "adversely affects people of color and marginalized communities." That way if you don't want to ban what they want to ban, they can claim you don't care about people of color and marginalized communities.</p><p>No doubt liberals are handling Rep. Hunt's comments as well as they do when it's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-scott-janet-yellen-heariing" target="_blank">Tim Scott</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-wife-erika-twitter" target="_blank">Byron Donalds</a>. And that's just the white liberals! Hunt flew Apache helicopters. He can handle his business. And it's not like leftists blaming concerns about the border on raaaaaaacism is anything new. It's Democrat 101.</p><p>What I did want to point out, to drive home Rep. Hunt's point, is the latest thing leftists claim is raaaaacist. Honesty and objectivity in news reporting. So sayeth the <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/30/newsrooms-news-reporting-objectivity-diversity/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a></em>.</p><blockquote>But increasingly, reporters, editors and media critics argue that the concept of journalistic objectivity is a distortion of reality. They point out that the standard was dictated over decades by male editors in predominantly White newsrooms and reinforced their own view of the world.</blockquote><p>It's not just the Biden Adminstration that blames everything on race. </p><p><p>

## Journalist whines, blasts Team DeSantis for destroying journalism every time they expose how journalists suck

One that leftists would oppose, because unless it's electrical and they can shut it off when you don't do or think as you're told... they don't want you to have it.</p><p>Politico is preparing for Ron DeSantis to -- God willing -- announce he's running for president. So <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2023/01/31/inside-the-house-of-desantis-00080534" target="_blank">Politico interviewed a Politico reporter</a> about what it's like dealing with Team DeSantis. Turns out, it's not all that of an enjoyable experience. Team DeSantis is notorious for exposing how hard reporters su-diddly-uck. And they a literally destroying the media relationship literally every time they do. This, according to the media with the hurt feelings.</p><blockquote>Calling them confrontational does a disservice to the word confrontational. Under DeSantis, the institution of public communications has been upended. [...] DeSantis’ communications team has openly boasted about how it’s not their job to help members of the media, and are well known for taking screenshots of reporter questions and posting them on Twitter, a habit that only makes the relationship worse. </blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

He quit his job immediately after and mysteriously disappeared. That mystery has now been solved! Gordon is a pedo scumbag. The former corporate media member was busted with kiddie porn and sharing messages about raping children.</p><p>At first, it was alleged <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/fbi-raid-abc-news_producer-1234613619/" target="_blank">the Biden Administration was behind the raid</a>. Gordon was said to have classified information on his computer -- not unlike the classified information being found anywhere Joe Biden has ever lived -- and he was working on a book about Biden's botched Afghanistan withdrawal. </p><p>None of this was according to the Liberty Freedom MAGA Eagle Gazette Weekly. It was according to <em>Rolling Stone</em>. Not that <em>Rolling Stone</em> is a reliable source of journalisming. But they are reliable shills for the Democrat Party, and you'd assume they would side with Biden over one of their colleagues.</p><blockquote>Meek has been charged with no crime. But independent observers believe the raid is among the first — and quite possibly, the first — to be carried out on a journalist by the Biden administration.</blockquote><p>We now know why the FBI was after Gordon. It was the treasure trove of kiddie porn he kept and distributed on various devices. <a href="https://www.outkick.com/missing-abc-producer-arrested-with-child-pornography-charge-sent-messages-about-raping-toddlers/" target="_blank">About a hundred images in total</a>. Plus, Gordon used to frequent pedo chat rooms -- which are apparently a thing -- under the name Pawny4. One of the messages he sent? “Have you ever raped a toddler girl? It’s amazing."</p><p>In a statement from the Justice Department:</p><blockquote>Meek’s devices allegedly contained images depicting children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and multiple chat conversations with users engaged in sexually explicit conversations where the participants expressed enthusiasm for the sexual abuse of children.</blockquote><p>Mystery solved. Gordon was NOT arrested and disappeared because he was writing a book. It was because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-producer-pleads-guilty" target="_blank">he joined a few</a> of his <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-producer-named" target="_blank">corporate media producer colleagues</a> in wanting to diddle children. Here's hoping he is in an uncomfortable place right now being diddled himself by adults.</p><p><p>
