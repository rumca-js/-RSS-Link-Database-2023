<p>It&rsquo;s been just under nine years since <em>Titanfall </em>landed on the PC and Xbox, and just under nine years since publisher Electronic Arts has been underutilizing one of its most interesting and promising franchises. With the rumor that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/titanfall-3-apex-legends-respawn-ea-cancelled-layoffs-1850061241&amp;xcust=2-1-1501165-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EA has canned a third <em>Titanfall </em>game</a> after years of development, I think it&rsquo;s time we look back on what this game was, what it could have been, and lamentably, what it never will be. What is <em>Titanfall </em>right now? A damn shame. </p>



<p>Part of the first wave of Xbox One titles and one of the console&rsquo;s very few exclusives, the original <em>Titanfall </em>was the first game developed by Respawn Entertainment, which was founded by former executives of <em>Call of Duty </em>creator Infinity Ward. It made a splash from its introduction at E3 2013, wowing gamers with a mix of fresh, parkour-infused multiplayer shooting and the titular Titan mechs as a fresh addition to the genre. When it came out for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC in the spring of 2014 it sold like hotcakes, perhaps helped by a somewhat tepid market at the time. </p>



<h2 id="unique-modes-and-motion">Unique modes and motion</h2>



<p><em>Titanfall </em>is, at its core, a fast-paced multiplayer shooter, as you might expect from the creators of<em> Call of Duty</em>. But with the sci-fi setting comes the opportunity to innovate, and Respawn did just that. It starts with the new, core mode of the standard multiplayer campaign mode: Assault. Both teams are supported by dozens of AI-controlled &ldquo;grunts,&rdquo; which have minimal weapons and armor, and none of the whiz-bang movement or special abilities of the player characters. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Players can zoom around the map focusing on taking out enemy grunts to rack up more points in a slower progression. This gives you plenty of targets on large, multi-level maps, where players on two teams of six might not intersect often outside of the control points. It also lets players who aren&rsquo;t as familiar with the intense, super-twitchy gameplay of shooters like <em>Modern Warfare </em>and <em>Battlefield</em> reach for more attainable ways to contribute to their team&rsquo;s victory. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> Thoughtful use of the environment can annihilate groups of grunts and give you the advantage on players.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Another key innovation in <em>Titanfall&rsquo;s </em>standard shooter setup was its movement. Player characters (&ldquo;Pilots&rdquo; in the game&rsquo;s lexicon) can dash and bounce around the map almost as if it&rsquo;s a<em> Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Pro Skater</em> level, utilizing wall-running, double-jumping, and other parkour-inspired tricks. The expanded, free-flowing movement is an integral part of the combat. Quick, thoughtful use of the environment can annihilate groups of grunts and give you the advantage on head-to-head confrontations with other players, even if they&rsquo;ve unlocked more powerful weapons and tools. </p>



<h2 id="titans-bring-the-sci-fi-spice">Titans bring the sci-fi spice</h2>



<p>Then there&rsquo;s the signature feature, the Titans. Each match begins with a countdown timer until your customized Titan, being built in an orbital factory, is ready to drop into the arena like a 10-ton trump card. You can take chunks of time off by killing enemy players or grunts or by achieving map objectives. Once it&rsquo;s arrived on the battlefield, you can either hop into the cockpit and take personal control against the other team, or continue on foot and let your Titan&rsquo;s AI do the shooting. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Titanfall 2: titan battles" class="wp-image-1501394" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/apps.47068.65123785197113223.0191c6ed-9ff7-488b-b8cc-c338d3886461.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Respawn Entertainment</p></div>



<p>The chunky Titans might seem like they&rsquo;re right out of <em>MechWarrior</em>, big, cumbersome metal beasts that are a sledgehammer to the footsoldier&rsquo;s scalpel. But that&rsquo;s not how it works in gameplay. While Titans are indeed bigger and slower than Pilots to make up for their more powerful weapons, they&rsquo;re surprisingly fast and graceful, and can be made more so with tweaks applied between matches. In action they&rsquo;re more like Gundams than tanks, and they make a wonderful counterpart to the whoosh-crikey movements of the pilots. </p>



<p>Combining gameplay with Pilots and Titans is where things get really spicy. While players on foot are of course more vulnerable, dying from one or two hits of the Titans&rsquo; giant weapons (or a viscerally squishy stomp or punch), the Pilot&rsquo;s movement powers combined with the well-designed, multifaceted stages mean that you&rsquo;ve still got a fighting chance even out of your personal giant robot. Specialized Titan-killing weapons, and the generally larger target that the Titans provide, mean that matches constantly weave and flow between Pilot and Titan combat as the steel behemoths are called in and destroyed. Pilots can even hop on the back of Titans, to rip open the enemy and shoot out its vital components  or piggy-back on a friendly bot and shoot from its shoulder, like Rocket Raccon riding Groot. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="pilot rides enemy titan in titanfall" class="wp-image-1501375" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/titanfall-pilot-riding-enemy-titan.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Respawn Entertainment </p></div>



<p>Even the end of the multiplayer matches showcases innovation. Once one team or the other reaches the requisite amount of points, the losers will be directed to an extraction point. Getting to the dropship (or alternately, killing the fleeing players or destroying the ship) makes for an entertaining mini-game that utilizes all of the skill and strategy of the primary mode, eventually allowing the losers to snap a bit of validation for a 10-minute match. Or, of course, get an extra heap of humiliation on top of it.</p>



<h2 id="the-sequel-adds-a-story">The sequel adds a story</h2>



<p>The first <em>Titanfall </em>reviewed well, but it seemed to lose steam after a couple of months. Part of this may have been its multiplayer-focused setup. The game&rsquo;s short development time and relatively small development team meant that the story campaign, a rather placid tale of evil corporations and space rebels, was sandwiched into the multiplayer mode. Since the outcome of each story mission had to work in the narrative whether the rebels or the corpos won, there was very little tension or stakes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Titanfall 2</em> launched with the focus squarely on the now fully-realized singleplayer campaign. It worked.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It basically boiled down to the same maps and modes you&rsquo;d get in standard multiplayer, with some talking heads occasionally shouting at you from the corner of your screen. Reviewers noted the lack of variety and dinged the game accordingly. It didn&rsquo;t help that EA wanted full price for this multiplayer-only title. With <em>Titanfall 2</em>, which released just two years later, Respawn would remedy this deficiency in a big way. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Titanfall 2 BT" class="wp-image-1501381" height="563" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1000.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1000" /><figcaption><p>Titanfall 2&rsquo;s story mode focused on the relationship between the player and BT, your Titan robo-buddy.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Respawn Entertainment</p></div>



<p><em>Titanfall 2</em> launched with the focus squarely on the now fully-realized singleplayer campaign. It worked. Both gamers and critics praised the mode, which gently introduced players into the combination bounce-house shooting/robot punching gameplay. You play as&hellip;honestly I can&rsquo;t remember who the player character is, because he&rsquo;s a blank slate for the personality of the Titan he inherits to play off. BT the giant robot might not be the most original AI character ever, but he has just enough charm and comedy in his writing to add a little enjoyment to the excellent levels and boss fights. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>One level in particular caught the eye of the gaming public: Effect and Cause, which utilized a time travel doohicky reminiscent of the core mechanic in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.</em> With a combination of parkour shooting, mech piloting, and carefully triggering events in the past timeline to affect the present, it&rsquo;s still considered one of the best singular levels in any modern game. </p>



<p>With incredibly unique multiplayer (now enhanced by grappling hooks and more Titan variety) and a single-player campaign head and shoulders above most of the competition, <em>Titanfall 2 </em>was poised to make a huge impact, like a giant robot dropping from orbit. </p>



<h2 id="eas-self-sabotage">EA&rsquo;s self-sabotage </h2>



<p>Unfortunately, <em>Titanfall </em>as a franchise couldn&rsquo;t catch a break. <em>Titanfall 2</em> released at almost the same time as two other gigantic shooters in October 2016. <em>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</em> directly lifted several of the movement mechanics from the original <em>Titanfall</em>, and included AI robot characters as a deep part of its single-player campaign. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, EA released its own competition just a week before, the critically-acclaimed <em>Battlefield 1. </em></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty Infinite Warfare covers" class="wp-image-1501387" height="808" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/battlefield-1-infinite-warfare.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Titanfall 2 was released at almost the same time as blockbuster shooters from Activision and EA itself.&nbsp;</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">EA/Activision</p></div>



<p>With the two biggest shooter franchises duking it out on store shelves,<em> Titanfall 2</em> was left in the dust. Perhaps owing to a lack of a breakout hit years after the studio was founded, and likely more to the general consolidation of the game industry via mergers and acquisitions, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.destructoid.com/eas-buying-respawn-for-upward-of-455-million/&amp;xcust=2-1-1501165-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Respawn was fully acquired by EA in 2017</a>. </p>



<p><em>Titanfall 2</em> managed to be a sleeper success nonetheless, getting big influxes of players every time it went on sale. Coming to the PS4 &mdash; excluded from the first game&rsquo;s release for licensing reasons &mdash; probably helped. But with a profile far lower than the original game, the writing seemed to be on the wall.</p>



<h2 id="respawn-moves-on">Respawn moves on</h2>



<p>Respawn&rsquo;s next release was the free-to-play <em>Apex Legends</em>, which is nominally set in the same universe as <em>Titanfall </em>and has some of the same parkour movement. But <em>Apex </em>lacks the signature Titan giant robots and comes with a much more sarcastic, <em>Borderlands</em>-esque feel. It&rsquo;s also a battle royale in the mode of <em>PUBG </em>or <em>Fortnite </em>&mdash; not exactly what <em>Titanfall </em>players were hoping for. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="jedi fallen order and apex legends" class="wp-image-1501390" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jedi-fallen-order-and-apex-legends.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Respawn&rsquo;s two post-Titanfall games, Apex Legends and Jedi Fallen Order, were both hits.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Respawn Entertainment</p></div>



<p>After <em>Apex</em>, which remains a popular freemium game to this day, Respawn released <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>. A single-player only game, translating the structure and difficulty of <em>Dark Souls</em> to the Star Wars universe, <em>Fallen Order </em>was a major departure for both Respawn and EA. The publisher gave the game a full court press of media support, taking advantage of the release of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> in theaters shortly thereafter. It worked: the game was critically acclaimed and a major seller. The sequel is coming out later this year. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Titanfall </em>seems to be a victim of Respawn&rsquo;s more recent successes.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With <em>Apex Legends</em> and the <em>Jedi </em>series both going strong, and the developer remaining a relatively small company even as a full EA subsidiary, <em>Titanfall </em>seems to be a victim of Respawn&rsquo;s more recent successes. A small group of dedicated fans can&rsquo;t keep EA from seeing dollar signs with lucrative free-to-play models and mega media licenses. <em>Titanfall 2</em> remains a must-play for its single-player campaign alone, but multiplayer servers for the original game are abandoned, and even the sequel is a ghost town with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/titanfall-2-hack-saga-feature&amp;xcust=2-1-1501165-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently unchecked cheating issues</a>. </p>



<h2 id="goodbye-robot-friends">Goodbye, robot friends</h2>



<p>I never got into <em>Apex</em>, but I was a big fan of <em>Fallen Order</em>. Frankly, it&rsquo;s the <em>Dark Souls </em>for people who don&rsquo;t like <em>Dark Souls</em>, a sort of store brand take on the hard-as-nails formula with a story that doesn&rsquo;t make you work for every last scrap of narrative. But I&rsquo;d trade it for another <em>Titanfall </em>game in a heartbeat. The shooter&rsquo;s mix of fast-paced ground movement and meaty robot fighting was utterly unique, and gaming is poorer as a medium now that its multiplayer is more or less gone. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Titanfall 2 BT at sunset" class="wp-image-1501395" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/titanfall-2-BT.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Respawn Entertainment</p></div>



<p>EA and/or Respawn scuppering the third <em>Titanfall </em>game doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the franchise is dead. But with Respawn&rsquo;s hands full with two successful franchises, and EA apparently trimming its corporate fat, the odds of seeing it reemerge anytime soon are slim to none. It&rsquo;s enough to make even an AI-powered giant robot cry. </p>

## Intel Arc 3 month performance check-in: Impressive Call of Duty gains

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Another month, another dutiful report on the state of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448060/checking-up-on-intels-arc-gpu-driver-performance.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Intel&rsquo;s fledgling GPU drivers</a> for its Arc series of graphics cards from PCWorld contributor Keith May. February sees the introduction of a new game to the roundup, the eye-catching but temperamental <em>Forspoken</em>, and some surprising framerate gains for a staple title. Plus, some exciting news that occurred mere hours after Keith&rsquo;s video published: Intel is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html">slashing the Arc A750&rsquo;s price to $249</a>! </p>



<p>Compared to last month&rsquo;s driver release, the Arc A770 driver didn&rsquo;t change much for most of our testing titles. In <em>GTA V, Counter-Strike GO, Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Troy, Borderlands 3, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Watch Dogs Legion, </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the results for the three-month test were in line with (or slightly behind) the two-month test. That&rsquo;s a particular bummer for <em>Cyberpunk</em>, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1498499/cyberpunk-2077-levels-up-framwerates-with-nvidia-dlss-3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">just got a DLSS boost on the latest Nvidia cards</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>There was one standout: <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>. Whatever special sauce Intel put into the new driver, it&rsquo;s showing about a 5-10 percent improvement across the board, while 1 percent lows saw a noticeable bump up to 51 frames per second at 1080p and 36 frames per second at 1440 &mdash; that&rsquo;s some solid performance for such a new, graphically-intense game. The gains over the Arc launch are even more impressive. </p>



<p><em>Forspoken </em>is Square Enix&rsquo;s new magical melee combat title. It looks gorgeous&hellip; if you have the power to run its detailed graphics and whiz-bang effects. <em>Forspoken </em>has already earned a reputation as a resource hog even on high-end gaming PCs, and the Arc A770 isn&rsquo;t a high-end card. But to Intel&rsquo;s credit, the day one driver release did manage to boost 1 percent lows by a solid ten percent, even if it didn&rsquo;t do much for the average FPS. At 1080p, the game runs above 60 fps on high settings &mdash; not bad! </p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think that collaborative chatting programs like Slack or Teams wouldn&rsquo;t need too many bells and whistles in order to be effective tools. Microsoft would beg to differ. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/02/01/microsoft-teams-premium-cut-costs-and-add-ai-powered-productivity/?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;ranSiteID=nOD_rLJHOac-YPTgHzCdq88dGRaDjKbSYg&amp;epi=nOD_rLJHOac-YPTgHzCdq88dGRaDjKbSYg&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=%28ir__lqxkyrmiwkkfbidiig9vts69pe2xccn9iigz2jb900%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28nOD_rLJHOac-YPTgHzCdq88dGRaDjKbSYg%29%28%29&amp;irclickid=_lqxkyrmiwkkfbidiig9vts69pe2xccn9iigz2jb900&amp;xcust=2-1-1501191-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The new Teams Premium tier</a> not only includes the usual unlimited messages and better organizational tools, it&rsquo;s adding exclusive powers enabled by OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT 3.5 language model. The new tier will be $10 per month per user starting on June 30th, but you can get a cheaper preview for $7 until then. </p>



<p>What does the fancy AI do? It&rsquo;s mostly one headline feature, &ldquo;intelligent recap.&rdquo; This tool can &ldquo;watch&rdquo; meetings with Teams&rsquo; video feature and automatically generate meeting notes and recommended tasks, as well as a full transcription of what&rsquo;s spoken in the meeting and by whom. It&rsquo;ll also generate automatic chapter divides for recorded meetings, though at launch it only works if you use PowerPoint Live &mdash; which seems like something you could do without resorting to prodigious AI number-crunching. </p>



<p>Premium users will also be able to apply watermarks to Teams video and select which participants can record and which cannot, combining with sensitivity labels to create a larger focus on privacy and security. Less notable additions include expanded webinar tools and more robust alerts for meetings. </p>



<p>As noted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/2/23582610/microsoft-teams-premium-openai-gpt-features&amp;xcust=2-1-1501191-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, the new Premium tier is also stealing some features away from the previous paid tier ($4 per user per month). Live translations for captions in 40 languages will remain on the bottom tier for the next 60 days, but will then be exclusive to Premium. Company-wide custom backgrounds and virtual appointments are also on the chopping block for less lucrative users. </p>



<p>GPT-powered additions to Teams are only the latest in the company&rsquo;s wave of AI-infused tools. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft&rsquo;s Designer program</a> uses extensive AI-generated art for publishing, and the company has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446692/report-microsoft-is-making-bing-its-next-ai-app.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ChatGPT in its Bing browser</a>, among other pushes. Seeing all of these AI-powered additions to Microsoft software is a reminder of some of its less people-friendly actions as of late, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479735/microsoft-execs-partied-with-sting-hours-before-announcing-layoffs.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hosting an exclusive Sting concert for executives</a> just a few hours before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476737/microsoft-axes-10000-jobs-to-cut-costs.html">announcing 10,000 job cuts</a>. </p>

<p>You may have found that your <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-starts-force-upgrading-windows-11-21h2-devices/&amp;xcust=2-1-1487513-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows PC recently updated itself</a>, whether or not you wanted it to, as Microsoft began automatically upgrading Windows 11 PCs with its big annual update at the end of January. It&rsquo;s been an optional upgrade since its September release. But that&rsquo;s okay: there are plenty of new things to check out in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html">huge Windows 11 2022 Update</a>, codenamed 22H2. The system has been given a bit of spit and polish pretty much everywhere &mdash; you probably noticed some of the more obvious interface changes, like new icons for changing volume. </p>



<p>Here are five of the more substantial changes you should check out first in the Windows 11 2022 Update. If you want to go even deeper down the Windows 11 rabbit hole, check out our guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1434344/windows-11-tips-you-must-try-in-2023.html">10 Windows 11 tips and tricks we use to customize our PCs</a>.</p>



<h2 id="clipchamp-a-new-free-video-editor">Clipchamp: A new, free video editor</h2>



<p>Windows now has a new default video editor: Clipchamp. As a sort of spiritual successor to the likes of Windows Movie Maker, it&rsquo;s simpler and more accessible than professional video editors &mdash; the kind of thing you can use for a quick cut or fade-in if you&rsquo;re sharing a YouTube video with friends. The tool includes the usual basic timeline and editing capabilities, and it can upload directly to YouTube, TikTok, and various web storage services.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Clipchamp timeline" class="wp-image-708464" height="654" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Clipchamp-timeline-larger.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>As of Windows 11 version 22H2, Clipchamp should be included in your operating system &mdash; just search for it in the Start Menu. If it&rsquo;s not there, you can download it for free <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/clipchamp-video-editor/9P1J8S7CCWWT?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us&amp;xcust=2-1-1487513-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">from the Microsoft Store</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a full guide</a> on the basics for this new tool. </p>



<h2 id="tabs-in-file-explorer">Tabs in File Explorer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Power users have been waiting for this one for a long time. Tabs are a feature that more advanced alternative file browsers have been using for decades, and Microsoft finally&mdash;<em>finally</em>&mdash;delivered a tabbed File Explorer in the Windows 11 2022 Update.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430331/use-the-new-tabbed-file-explorer-to-simplify-your-life.html">a full guide on how to use them</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Tabbed File Explorer" class="wp-image-1430359" height="826" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tabbed-file-explorer-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>To open a new tab in any Explorer window, just click the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button in the top most menu bar. Tabs work just like you&rsquo;re used to in any modern web browser, though you can&rsquo;t click and drag them into a new Explorer window (yet). While you&rsquo;re here, check out the new, streamlined left-hand menu, with faster access to system folders and your most used locations.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="folders-in-the-start-menu">Folders in the Start Menu&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you like to have a lot of apps within easy reach in the Start Menu, you&rsquo;ll love the new folders feature. It works more or less just like folders do on the homescreen for Android or iOS (or perhaps more pertinently, Chrome OS). Any two or more shortcuts can be combined into a folder, and any folder can have a custom name.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Start menu folders" class="wp-image-1487539" height="715" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/start-menu-folders.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>To get started, just click and drag one Start Menu icon onto another. When you see both of them shrink, release the mouse button and a folder will be created automatically. Click the new folder, then click the title to rename it. Any additional programs can be dragged in or out of the folder, and you can have as many folders as you like.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="new-ways-to-use-the-snap-bar">New ways to use the Snap Bar&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Snap Bar is one of the most useful multitasking tools in newer versions of Windows. You might have seen it if you frequently drag windows around by their title bar: it&rsquo;s that thing that lets you move them to halves, thirds, or quadrants of your screen easily. But there are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/830006/my-favorite-feature-in-windows-11-22h2-is.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new ways to access it</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hover your mouse cursor (don&rsquo;t click!) on the maximize window button, in between the close (X) and minimize (_) buttons in the upper-right corner. You&rsquo;ll see the six most common layout options. Click on any of the sub-grids in this pop-up to send the window to that location. You can also activate this view by typing Win + Z, then a number, then a number again to &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; into the options.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="revamped-notepad">Revamped NotePad</h2>



<p>NotePad is one of the oldest, simplest tools in all of Windows, but this basic text editor is a little more capable than you might remember. In the most basic version, it now follows the dark or light color scheme in your personalization settings.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 notepad dark and light" class="wp-image-1487564" height="677" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/notepad-dark-and-light.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Microsoft might have even more in store for the humble NotePad. As you read this, testing versions of Windows 11 are being <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478585/tabbed-notepad-joins-improved-settings-spotlight-in-windows-betas.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">updated with tabs in NotePad </a>in a similar addition to Windows Explorer.

What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>
</div>


<p>Having reached capacities of 1TB and beyond, USB thumb drives put a lot of cable-less storage in your pocket. However, most examples of the species suffer a rather salient deficiency&mdash;slow performance. Not so with Teamgroup&rsquo;s C212, the object of this review. It&rsquo;s capable of sustained transfer speeds in excess of 400MBps to 600MBps&mdash;almost five times the norm, depending the size of the data set being read or written. That puts it on par with the speed of SATA SSDs found inside computers. Buckle up!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">best external drives</a> to learn more about competing products, what to look for in an external drive, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="teamgroup-c212-features">Teamgroup C212: Features</h2>



<p>The C212 is a USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) thumb drive that measures a mere 2.6-inches long (3.08 inches with the connector extended) by 0.8-inches wide, by 0.46-inches thick (including the ejection switch). Weight is a mere 9 grams. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s available in three capacities: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-External-Compatible-Computer-TC21231TBB01/dp/B099WZ41K9?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1480094-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">256GB</a> for $38, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-External-Compatible-Computer-TC21231TBB01/dp/B099WY52VX?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1480094-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">512GB</a> for $73, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-External-Compatible-Computer-TC21231TBB01/dp/B099Z9HVF2?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1480094-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1TB for $98</a>. Those were the prices from Teamgroup on Amazon at the time of this writing, with the 512GB drive discounted from $80.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1486945" height="628" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/71D9QO2PHFL._AC_SL1500-scaled_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The C212&rsquo;s Type-A USB connector  retracts into the body for protection and reducing the drive&rsquo;s form factor. But  you must hold the slide.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The drive uses a Type-A connector that retracts into the body of the drive by means of slide switch. This protects the connector when the drive is in your bag or pocket. But I have found that when you&rsquo;re in close quarters or your hand is at an awkward angle, it can be tricky to keep your finger on a slide switch long enough to get the connector into its port.</p>



<p>Note that the C212 is hardly the first thumb drive to employ a retractable connector, and every one I&rsquo;ve tested suffers the same issue. I just infinitely prefer a removable cap and would love to see the retractable connector concept go the way of the dinosaurs.</p>



<p>Teamgroup didn&rsquo;t provide a TBW rating, but the C212 is warrantied for five years&mdash;a very generous guarantee for the category.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you have 10Gbps ports, the C212 will save you lots of time over a run-of-the-mill thumb drive during backup and other chores.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="teamgroup-c212-performance">Teamgroup C212: Performance</h2>



<p>With smaller amounts of data, the C212 reached Teamgroup&rsquo;s claimed read transfer-rate of of 600MBps and write rate of 500MBps. In fact, it surpassed those rates under CrystalDiskMark 8 when we ran the smaller 1GB data set. That means for most tasks, you&rsquo;ll see the listed performance. </p>



<p>However, when we threw the larger 64GB data set (our current standard test) at it, speeds declined to around 450MBps. Not the claimed speeds, but still darn fast for a thumb drive. </p>



<p>The CrystalDiskMark 8 results may not look fantastic by comparison, but this is the first thumb drive we&rsquo;ve kicked the tires on using the new test bed. Hence, we opted to compare it to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398724/samsung-portable-ssd-t7-touch-review.html">Samsung T7 Touch</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://LaCie%20Portable%20SSD%20review:%20Performing%20to%20expectations%20-%20PC%20World%20New%20...&amp;xcust=2-1-1480094-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LaCie Portable SSD</a>, which are larger external SSDs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1485467" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Teamgroup-C212-CDM-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>While it may not be as  fast as the Samsung T7 Shield and other full-sized external SSDs, the C212&rsquo;s performance is nothing to sneeze at. And you get up to 150MBps faster speeds with smaller data sets.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Real-world performance was great for a thumb drive, if not for a larger portable SSD such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626738/samsung-t7-shield-ssd-review-fast-ruggedized-10gbps-usb-storage.html">Samsung T7 Shield</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/shop/lacie/lacie-portable-ssd-2tb-external-usb-c-us-3-2-gen-2-portable-solid-state-drive-with-rescue-data-recovery-services-188ad7e8ff2148eda7328bce146f67e0-p.html">LaCie Portable</a> we&rsquo;re comparing it to. We didn&rsquo;t have any comparable thumb drives on hand for testing and comparison. However, I can tell you that if you see 125MBps from a standard thumb drive, you&rsquo;re doing quite well. Most are far slower than that&mdash;as low as 25MBps in my casual tests for this review.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1485468" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Teamgroup-C212-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>What you won&rsquo;t want the C212 for is backing up very large data sets. The time below is rather tragic for an SSD, though again, it&rsquo;s mitigated by the fact that it&rsquo;s a thumb drive.  </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1485469" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Teamgroup-C212-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>As you&rsquo;ll see in the capture below, most of the reason for the lethargic 450GB write was that the drive slows down drastically when it runs out of secondary cache. But honestly, write speeds of 210MBps are hardly the slowest we&rsquo;ve seen out of an SSD, which can drop to as little as 100MBps even with internal TLC/QLC drives.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1486689" height="764" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-24-at-4.59.23-PM.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>



<p>Compared to larger external SSDs, the C212 is somewhat slow. Compared to most other thumb drives, it&rsquo;s lightning fast. Buy according to need.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-a-teamgroup-c212-usb-drive">Should you buy a Teamgroup C212 USB drive?</h2>



<p>There are few more convenient ways to physically transport data than the Teamgroup C212. If you have 10Gbps ports, it will save you lots of time over a run-of-the-mill thumb drive during backup and other chores. Small, convenient, fast&mdash;this is definitely one handy product from Teamgroup.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Dell released a neat feature that enabled iPhone text messaging from within the Windows desktop. Now, a successor to that app is available on any Windows 11 PC, no Dell required.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/intel%C2%AE-unison%E2%84%A2/9PP9GZM2GN26?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us&amp;xcust=2-1-1486715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Intel Unison</a>, and while it&rsquo;s only supposed to run on a small number of Intel-powered laptops,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/intels-unison-app-connects-your-iphone-to-any-windows-11-pc-right-now&amp;xcust=2-1-1486715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Central reports</a>&nbsp;that it works on any computer running Windows 11. I&rsquo;ve got it running on my Lenovo Yoga C940 laptop from 2019, and it&rsquo;s a revelation.</p>



<p>To set it up, download the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/intel%C2%AE-unison%E2%84%A2/9PP9GZM2GN26?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us&amp;xcust=2-1-1486715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Intel Unison app for Windows</a>, then grab the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intel-unison/id1613307037&amp;xcust=2-1-1486715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">companion app for iOS</a>. (It&rsquo;s also&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intel.mde&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;xcust=2-1-1486715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">available for Android</a>, as an alternative to Microsoft&rsquo;s built-in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link</a>&rdquo; utility.) The Windows app will then walk you through a few steps to pair your phone and PC.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Screenshots of the pairing process with Intel's Unison app" class="wp-image-1486718" height="821" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/intelunisonmobile.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>To finish the setup process, you must download Intel&rsquo;s Unison app and pair your iPhone and PC over Bluetooth.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you can send and receive text messages from your computer, including those delivered via iMessage. The app also lets you view your phone&rsquo;s camera roll, send files to your phone, make phone calls through your desktop, and see your phone&rsquo;s notifications.</p>



<p>There is one big limitation: Instead of syncing your full message history, Unison only shows the messages that you receive while the app is open. Still, it&rsquo;s useful for picking up a conversation without reaching for your phone, and for quickly rattling off replies with a proper keyboard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="iMessage in Intel's Unison app on Windows 11" class="wp-image-1486717" height="765" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/intelunison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The real downside is that I now have to rethink my decision&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/803355/windows-11-ruin-laptop-fixes.html">not to upgrade to Windows 11 on my desktop computer</a>.</p>
