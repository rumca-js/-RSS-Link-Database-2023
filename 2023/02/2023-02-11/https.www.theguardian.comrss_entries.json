Beyond the power of her work, what Sylvia Plath represented to me is still hard to understand. On a personal level I felt a kinship with her because we had both lost parents as children (she, her father at eight; me, my mother at seven). We had both received sharp, early lessons in the savagery of the world. Such lessons are, of course, not unusual. Most teenagers, despite their backgrounds, have a sense of this savagery. Perhaps that\u2019s why Plath\u2019s work so often hits home in those years, when one is beginning to reckon with life\u2019s difficulties and work out how, if, one might harness them.</p><p>They think I should love it \u2013<br />Having her back again, they think<br />I should give them my mother\u2019s words<br />To fill the mouth of their monster,<br />Their Sylvia Suicide Doll,<br />Who will walk and talk<br />And die at will,<br />And die, and die<br />And forever be dying.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath", "date_published": "2023-02-11 11:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How\u2019d you find me, Whitney Port?

When she died from cancer in 1973, aged only 39, she left behind an impressive but tantalisingly incomplete set of literary achievements. Her life \u2013 as her riveting diaries and autobiographical novels attest \u2013 was as fascinating as she hoped it would be. Reimann started writing early and quickly became a GDR literary star. A dedicated socialist, she joined a state initiative that sent her to write and teach workers at a coal-fired power plant. There she won success with a communist Bildungsroman about factory life, spawning a whole genre of imitators. Over time, however, she grew increasingly frustrated with the strictures of both married life and the GDR cultural sphere; she was also shaken by her brother Lutz\u2019s emigration to the west in 1960. In art and life, she relentlessly criticised the GDR: not quite a dissident, but certainly disobedient.</p><p>Much of this biography appears in Reimann\u2019s novel Siblings, originally published in 1963 and now available in English. Its narrator, Elisabeth Arendt, is an idealistic young painter who clashes with her beloved brother Uli over the GDR\u2019s repressiveness. (Both are haunted by their other brother, Konrad, already seeking his fortune in the west.) Like Reimann, Elisabeth works at a power plant; she also, like Reimann, strains against the artistic and political orthodoxies of old party comrades who refuse to listen to young people, especially women, with fresh ideas.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/siblings-by-brigitte-reimann-review-rebel-with-a-cause\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/siblings-by-brigitte-reimann-review-rebel-with-a-cause", "date_published": "2023-02-11 07:30:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow hits power grid in wave of strikes; Biden to visit Poland \u2013 live", "description": "<p>Russia strikes power facilities across Ukraine, causing widespread blackouts; US president to travel to Poland later this month to rally allies</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/11/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-353-of-the-invasion\">What we know on day 353 of the invasion</a></li></ul><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> will use his trip to Poland this month to rally allies while aiming to sustain the coalition that has supported Ukraine defences since Russia\u2019s invasion a year ago, Associated Press reports.</p><p>The US president\u2019s visit, set for 20-22 February, comes as polling in the US and abroad suggests support is waning for maintaining tens of billions of dollars worth of assistance for Ukraine in the war.
