Adriana was walking down the hallway when she was suddenly hit in the face with water by one of the attackers. Adriana collapsed and was reportedly kicked and dragged down the hallway until she blacked out. One of the attackers yelled, "that's what you get you stupid b*tch". </p><p>After school, one of the girls who recorded the assault sent her a text mocking her for "dripping blood" and getting her "a*s whooped". A few hours after that text, Adriana's family found her dead in her closet. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The four teenagers<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/10/4-students-charged-in-beatdown-of-adriana-kuch-before-teens-suicide/" target="_blank"> have been charged</a>, one with aggravated assault, another with harassment, and two others with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. Adriana's father Michael said he believes brutal bullying fueled her suicide, which has continued even after her death. He said one of the assailants has recently posted disrespectful messages on Snapchat. </p><p>Parents at the school have said bullying is a huge problem. The school, however, claims Adriana was "on drugs" and made "poor choices" that led to her suicide. The superintendent, Triantafillos Parlapanides, suggested her grades had fallen after her mother committed suicide because her father had an affair. He claimed the school offered her drug rehab and mental services on 5 occasions but her father refused. </p><p>According to Adriana's father, her mother passed away in 2015 after a battle with addiction. Her father also denied that the school offered her any treatment options, and said he and his wife had sought treatment after she started vaping marijuana. </p><p>Tragic stories like this one seem to be popping up more and more frequently.  <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-bus-florida" target="_blank">A viral video </a>just a few weeks ago showed a nine-year-old girl getting beaten by older boys on a school bus. The school and bus driver failed to do anything. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/las-vegas-student-beaten-unconscious" target="_self">Rampant bullying</a> points to a larger issue of broken schools and a broken culture.</p><p>No 14-year-old girl should ever feel so hopeless they take their own life. Schools have to start stepping up and protecting children instead of trying to cover their tracks. Or perhaps, homeschooling should become the new norm, if that's what it takes to keep kids safe. </p>

## Ron DeSantis breaks another progressive's brain who now believes he's sending 'Woke Busters' to confiscate books

This time, they claim he's sending "woke busters" into Florida <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-history-class" target="_blank">schools</a> to search children's backpacks for banned books, like the fascist Hitler-lover he is. </p><p>The explosive allegations were made by "theauntielolo" on TikTok, a middle-aged white woman and self-described "Karenator, ally, BLM Leftist". Auntie Lolo claimed the "woke busters" will confiscate any books that acknowledge racism is real and exists. At one point, her little sign read, "What the Rapethuglikkans are saying is BOOKS are more dangerous than pew pews." Which I think means guns, but I'm not entirely sure since I'm an adult woman and not a three-year-old child. </p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@theauntielolo/video/7197275418892815659" class="tiktok-embed">

<p>I bet she still thinks you can't say "gay" in Florida lest the DeSantis Secret Police come knocking on your door. </p><p>The claims she made seem to stem from a Salon <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/02/03/call-the-woke-busters-ron-desantis-sends-volunteer-army-to-snatch-books-from-students-hands/" target="_blank">article</a> titled, "Call the 'woke busters': Ron DeSantis Sends Volunteer Army to Snatch Books From Young Student's Hands". The article cites a group called the "Manatee Community Patriots," who put out a call for "woke busters" to be the "eyes and ears and boots on the ground in the schools" to prevent educators from indoctrinating children. </p><p>"Community Manatee Patriots" is a self-described "group of Americans who love liberty, embrace self-government, and work to ensure justice for all." Oh and it appears that they're mostly made up of "Manatee Moms". The <a href="https://cpmanatee.com/ghost-busters-needed/?fbclid=IwAR2wQ8lw1ahW2_BBtwXARyYs7JdHTnbNfm5uZqIMVxQ-v16MYZbyydaLt6Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">page</a> dedicated to "Woke Busters" urges volunteers to check online and school libraries for banned book titles, get involved in the school board, and form relationships with education staff. The similarities to Hitler's Gestapo are uncanny. </p><p>The most hilarious part of this whole story is that all DeSantis did was<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-florida-law-banning" target="_blank"> ban porn</a> in schools. Which you'd think would be a winning issue all around. But no, of course not. To these genius leftists, banning porn for kindergarteners means DeSantis is literally Hitler. </p>

## "Women don’t like math": Filmmaker goes off on her feminist reasons for making the "Cocaine Bear" movie

It's the latest film directed by Elizabeth Banks. You may find yourself wondering what would draw a filmmaker to a movie about a bear who goes on a coked-up murder spree. According to Banks, sexism!</p><p><a href="https://www.mediaite.com/entertainment/cocaine-bear-director-blasts-hollywood-executives-who-believe-only-men-can-direct-action-movies-and-women-dont-like-math/" target="_blank">Banks tells <em>Variety</em></a> she is tired of Hollywood executives (aka men) telling her women don't like directing action movies. Or *checks notes* math.</p><p>“I wanted to break down some of the mythology around what kinds of movies women are interested in making. For some bizarre reason, there are still executives in Hollywood who are like, ‘I don’t know if women can do technical stuff.’ There are literally people who are like, ‘Women don’t like math.’ It just persists."</p><p>This is not Banks' first time directing an action movie. She directed 2019's Charlie's Angels, a reboot of the 2000 movie which was a reboot of the 1976 TV show. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elizabeth-banks-uses-a-tired-cliche-to-explain-charlies-angels-flop-blaming-men" target="_blank">When the movie flopped, Banks blamed men</a>.</p><p>The filmmaker is giving action films another shot with <em>Cocaine Bear</em>. Who and/or what is Cocaine Bear, you ask?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I'm the bear who ate cocaine. This is my story. <a href="https://t.co/txBSiUl5hL">pic.twitter.com/txBSiUl5hL</a><br />— Cocaine Bear (@cocainebear) <a href="https://twitter.com/cocainebear/status/1598013839202693120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Everyone is excited Cocaine Bear will finally have his story told.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Always wondered about that bear …<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1598225465642483713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It also features the film debut of the guy who makes those funny TikToks about retail workers. You know, the ones you wait for someone to put in one big video they share on Instagram and Twitter. This guy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="8ddcb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32241572&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The story of Cocaine Bear <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3754621-cocaine-bear-set-for-2023-release/" target="_blank">begins in 1985</a> when a drug smuggler unloaded $15 million worth of cocaine over Chattahoochee National Forest because his plane was too heavy. A bear -- we'll call him C.B. -- confused the package for a picnic basket and went to town on all $15 million worth. Though C.B. swore to the other bears he didn't like cocaine. He only liked the smell.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="19495" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32241588&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>C.B. died of a massive overdose, as you would imagine one would after ingesting $15 million worth of coke. C.B. was taxidermized and later owned by Waylon Jennings. Which makes total sense.</p><p>That's the "based on true stories" part of the Elizabeth Banks movie. Where Cocaine Bear goes on a drug-fueled killing spree is Hollywood using its creative license.</p><p>If this will be the new Hollywood trend, I can think of a few other animal-centric "based on real events" that would make good movies. The monkey who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/breaking-monkeys-attack-lab-assistant-escape-with-covid-samples-wait-what" target="_blank">stole the Schmovid samples</a> is one. The other monkeys <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/monkey-gang-warfare-thailand" target="_blank">who took over an entire city in Thailand</a> are another. But my personal favorite? The elephant who killed a woman, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elephant-woman-funeral" target="_blank">then showed up at her funeral to further send a message</a>.</p><p>If you'll excuse me, I'm going to open up Final Draft. There are screenplays to write.</p><p><p>

## Idris Elba doesn't care about his skin color and wishes you would stop too: "I don’t want to be the first black"

Or as actor Idris Elba calls it... history month. Elba believes you people are too obsessed with skin color and wishes everyone would stop. Ironic, because this is the same Idria Elba that the BBC's Diversity Chief <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woke-bbc-diversity-idris-elba" target="_blank">once said wasn't black enough to be authentic</a>.</p><p>The actor <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a42621203/idris-elba-interview-luther/" target="_blank">sat down with Esquire UK</a> and lamented how we're all too focused on people's differences. It's an obsession Elba says hinders people’s aspirations and growth. It's why he stopped describing himself as a "black actor." Elba was essentially marginalizing HIMSELF and putting himself in a box.</p><p>"I didn’t become an actor because I didn’t see black people doing it and I wanted to change that. I did it because I thought that’s a great profession and I could do a good job at it. As you get up the ladder, you get asked what it’s like to be the first black to do this or that. Well, it’s the same as it would be if I were white. It’s the first time for <em>me</em>. I don’t want to be the first black. I’m the first Idris."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>I recognize this is easy for me to say as someone who looks less Hershey's chocolate than he does Hellmann's mayonnaise. I don't know the struggle of walking down the street and having strangers assume I can dunk a basketball, play bass guitar, and know the proper amount of seasoning to put in food. But it would drive me insane if I took my craft seriously, spent my entire life perfecting it, and work my ass off on a piece of art I'm proud of. Only to have the primary concern of others be "so, what's it like to do all those things with your skin color."</p><p>It also tends to be woke-ass white reporters who are the most obsessed. Todd Bowles, head coach to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, had to explain to two woke journalismers how in 2023 it's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/todd-bowles-woke-reporter" target="_blank">not all that noteworthy to be coaching against another black guy</a>. And how the minute reporters stop making a big deal out of it, everybody else will as well.</p><p>Whether Idris Elba goes on to become either the first black James Bond or the next James Bond, as has been rumored for years, is still anybody's guess. Whatever his next role is, Idris is just going to do Idris.</p><p><p>

## 'You're a dude': Doctor attempts slowly explaining to tampon-endorsing TikToker why they can't menstruate

You know, what with the fact <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tampons-confused" target="_blank">a tampon has a very specific use for people who were born with very specific body parts</a>. People, sometimes referred to as "women," don't appreciate these videos and aren't shy about expressing their disapproval. It makes TikTok celebrities like non-binary ingénue Jeffrey Marsh have to explain that, yes, they know she/him doesn't menstruate because they/xi are non-binary.</p><p>A doctor (believed to be a biological she/her) took to TikTok to counter Jeffrey's argument. It's not being non-binary that prevents Jeffrey from getting bloated and craving potato chips every month. It's THE SCIENCE!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Men, if you’re confused as to why you can’t menstruate, hear the explanation from a doctor. <a href="https://t.co/C53qy5pSPa">pic.twitter.com/C53qy5pSPa</a><br />— Catch Up (@CatchUpNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1624308207152930816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>According to this presumed woman who identifies as a doctor, there is only one real reason why men won't menstruate. It's because they're men.</p><p>"They're biological men. They don't have ovaries. They don't have a uterus. They don't have the hormone profile. They're men. So Jeffrey, just to wrap it up, you will never menstruate because you're a dude."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="cfa64" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33013206&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>I will say, in Jeffrey's defense, he has at minimal a 50.1% knowledge of how biology works. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tampon-infleuncer-endorsement" target="_blank">The TikTok sensation has spoken out</a> and said that when he endorses things like tampons, an item he/they/ham has no use for, it's for two reasons. The first is Jeffrey wants to end the stigmatization of menstruation, which Jeffrey does not do, so that women and anyone who was a woman but now claims to be a man can stop feeling that menstruation is so icky and gross.</p><p>The second? It is due to all the women who were born that way sending Jeffrey hate. Because, as Jeffrey says, they should all be working together to smash the patriarchy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="2b72a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33013211&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Now, I'm not a woman. I wasn't born one and don't identify as one now. Far be it for me to speak on their behalf. But if I hated women and wanted to record a video making fun of women based on my stereotype of women, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-ulta-biden" target="_self">it would look no different than some of these alleged influencers</a> celebrating day eleventy-five of being a girl.</p><p>It would appear at least one woman who was born one feels the same way and felt this The Science lesson was necessary. Maybe one day she and Jeffrey can sit down for a strawberry acai at Starbucks and talk out their differences. Like girls do.</p><p><p>
