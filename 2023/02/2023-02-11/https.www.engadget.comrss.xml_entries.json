Specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-passes-inflation-reduction-act-2022-214410930.html\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> includes language that seeks to prevent automakers from taking advantage of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-ev-tax-credit-2023-174121949.html\">consumer EV tax credits</a> if they make vehicles with batteries made by a \u201cforeign entity of concern.\u201d Congress designed the rules to incentivize automakers to build a domestic supply chain for EV parts instead of relying on China for critical components.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Ford has considered an ownership structure that would see it own the entire plant and nearby infrastructure. Ford employees would also work at the facility. CATL would only own the technology used to create the batteries. It\u2019s an arrangement that could allow batteries made at the facility to qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act-related tax credits. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that we\u2019re exploring batteries based on CATL\u2019s technology for Ford vehicles and that we plan to localize,\u201d a Ford spokesperson told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>In July, Ford said it would begin sourcing batteries for US-bound 2023 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-ev-price-cut-170151501.html\"><ins>Mustang Mach-E</ins></a> models from CATL.

Before Saturday's announcement, the spacecraft was scheduled to leave the station on February 17th. It\u2019s unclear if Roscosmos will move forward with that timeline as originally planned. Russia\u2019s Progress spacecraft are designed to burn up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere after they complete their resupply missions, meaning there\u2019s no way for Roscosmos to investigate the leak on the ground. The timing of the discovery comes on the same day that a second Progress spacecraft docked with the ISS, and less than two months after another Russian spacecraft sprung a leak at the space station.</p><p>In December, Russia\u2019s Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/iss-soyuz-ms-22-capsule-leak-205133518.html\">began leaking coolant</a> just as cosmonauts Dmitri Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev were preparing for a nearly seven-hour spacewalk. Roscosmos later blamed the incident on an apparent meteoroid strike. Unless there\u2019s an emergency at the ISS, Roscosmos has deemed the spacecraft unfit to transport humans. The agency will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/russia-soyuz-capsule-rescue-mission-iss-205343374.html\">launch another Soyuz</a> craft later this month to bring Petelin and Prokopyev, as well as NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, back to Earth.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/another-russian-spacecraft-docked-to-the-space-station-is-leaking/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social\"><em>Ars Technica\u2019s</em> Eric Berger</a> points out, the Progress incident raises doubts about whether Soyuz MS-22 was actually hit by a micrometeorite. Russia never released images of the impact, and the country\u2019s space program has a history of recent issues. In 2021, for instance, Roscosmos blamed a software bug on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-boeing-delay-starliner-iss-launch-092458695.html\">Nauka misfiring</a> that temporarily moved the ISS out of its usual orientation.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/a-second-russian-spacecraft-docked-at-the-iss-is-leaking-191321865.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-11 19:13:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta reportedly plans more job cuts", "description": "<p>Facebook parent company Meta reportedly plans to further reduce its headcount in the coming weeks.
