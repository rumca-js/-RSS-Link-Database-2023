The trash can Shaped Mac Pro was cutting edge tech in 2013 but how does it hold up in 2023? In this video we see how well the 6 core Mac Pro handles PC gaming and emulation. We have Windows 10 running on the Mac Pro and we test out games like Injustice 2, God of war, the Witcher 3 and more. And of corse we need some emulators so PPSSPP is used for PSP, PCSX2 for PS2 and Dolphin for Wii emulation on the Mac Pro shaped like a trash can.
