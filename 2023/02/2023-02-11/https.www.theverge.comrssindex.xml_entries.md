  <p id="o3cAOH">Googlers are talking all about the company’s announcement of its ChatGPT rival, Bard — and many aren’t happy with how things went. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/10/google-employees-slam-ceo-sundar-pichai-for-rushed-bard-announcement.html">According to a report from CNBC</a>, Google employees are calling the launch of the AI chatbot “rushed” and “botched” in posts across the company’s internal message boards, with many targeting CEO Sundar Pichai.</p>
<p id="sXfR2v"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23588033/google-chatgpt-rival-bard-testing-rollout-features">Google announced Bard</a> earlier this week in a bid to get ahead of Microsoft, which took the wraps off of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23587454/microsoft-bing-edge-chatgpt-ai">ChatGPT-powered Bing a day later</a>.

Meanwhile, a presenter at Google’s search event on Wednesday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yLWXJ22LUEc?feature=share&amp;t=617">forgot the phone</a> they were going to use to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590699/google-ai-search-features-bard-chatgpt-rival">show off one of Bard’s features</a>, and some...</p>

  <p id="5Zinyx">Welcome to the weekend, dear readers! Microsoft’s forthcoming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23587454/microsoft-bing-edge-chatgpt-ai">ChatGPT-powered browser</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591422/nintendo-direct-february-2023-news-trailers">Nintendo’s latest Direct event</a> may have dominated the news cycle as of late, but there were a number of headline-grabbing discounts peppered throughout the week. And while we typically reserve our weekend roundups for <em>new</em> deals, we figured we’d take the opportunity to run through some of the highlights you may have missed — you know, with V-Day coming up and all.</p>

<p id="aubMZg">I haven’t logged into <em>Marvel Snap</em> for about a week now — just when the new <em>Quantumania</em>-themed season has begun. Now what, you ask, could be powerful enough to drag me away from a game I have made my ministry since its launch?</p>

<p>We all get tired of Bluetooth sometimes, and the IE 200s are a nice reminder of what we’ve lost by trading the headphone jack for wireless convenience and platform-specific earbud features.</p>
