<p>With European football in turmoil and leading clubs out of sorts, the knockout stages offer some welcome unpredictability</p><p>When the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League is made before Christmas, the warning always comes: wait till February. What can look a straightforward tie as the group stage ends may appear very different a couple of months down the line as form fluctuates and injuries, managerial changes and January signings take effect.</p><p>Recently that has tended to mean the superclubs asserting themselves, financial muscle powering through whatever blips may have occurred in the autumn. But as the Champions League knockout stage begins on Tuesday, very little has settled down and the competition looks more open than it has done for a decade or more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/11/welcome-back-the-champions-league-will-napoli-shake-up-the-faltering-big-guns">Continue reading...</a>

## Almirón salvages point for Newcastle as Eddie Howe returns to Bournemouth

<p>Eddie Howe always knew his return to Bournemouth would fiddle with his emotions but his homecoming was laced with frustration as Newcastle played out another draw, but only after surviving a late scare. Newcastle were fortunate to end up with a point, with Kieran Trippier’s goal-line clearance heading into seven minutes of second-half stoppage time denying Dominic Solanke a late winner. Bournemouth’s players prayed Trippier’s intervention was too late to stop Solanke’s backheel from Hamed Traoré’s cross going over the line, but the referee Stuart Attwell checked his watch and replays showed the Newcastle captain did just enough.</p><p>Bournemouth were reluctant to be too hospitable given their current predicament – they remain the only English top-flight team without a win since the World Cup and had lost seven of their previous eight matches – but their matchday programme referred to Howe’s time in charge of the club, more than a decade across two spells, as the kind of fairytale journey usually only seen on Football Manager. When Howe took over at Bournemouth in 2008, non-league was looming, the club’s existence at peril and he resorted to paying for masseuses out of his own pocket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/11/almiron-salvages-point-for-newcastle-as-eddie-howe-returns-to-bournemouth">Continue reading...</a>

## Tara June Winch: ‘Happiness is in the moment just before the thought to take a photograph’

<p>In a series of short essays, writers consider what happiness means to them now, after the reckoning of the past few years</p><p>I’ve never struggled with a question more. Am I happy now, as opposed to before? And if before I was happy by some measure, why would it have changed? How can I think of happiness now, when everything is terrible? Even if I know that this moment doesn’t differ from any other moment in history. That is to say that these new days are full of old sorrows, and long after I am dead and gone, the same will be true. But just because all this has happened to generations before and will beyond us, it doesn’t feel any less painful in its proximity.</p><p>It’s a simple question, something you’d ask on a first date perhaps. Yet I don’t think I’ve asked that question of myself before. I’d asked what I need to do in the moment, to feel better, to give back, to be productive, but never what would make me happy in the grand arc. I argue that I must have been looking for it all this time, yet when I approach the question head on, when I vow to improve at life, health, work and in turn happiness – it always feels like a brand-new prospect – a thing I hadn’t considered before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/12/tara-june-winch-happiness-is-in-the-moment-just-before-the-thought-to-take-a-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Raising a child on your own is tough. It would be a lot more appealing with extra state supporter</p><p>Birthrates are falling in the rich world and this leaves us with an unsolved puzzle. Women who want children are not having them. Why? Surveys tell us that, on average, women and men in rich countries would ideally like two children – near the coveted “<a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/total-fertility-rate">population replacement rate</a>” of 2.1 – but birthrates are falling far short of this. Women have more money and choices than ever, but are for some reason not able to have as many children as they would like. Why not?</p><p>Well, in places such as the UK, falling birthrates are frequently blamed on childcare, housing and income problems. In some respects, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s are worse off than their boomer parents. Hence fewer children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/11/why-a-shortage-of-mr-rights-means-single-mothers-hold-the-key-to-the-falling-birthrate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The personable wing is making quite a splash after becoming the first Exiles player to start a Test for England since 2014</p><p>It is not a subject often aired in international men’s rugby union but, hey, it is 2023, baby. So here goes: can nail polish improve athletic performance? In the view of Ollie Hassell-Collins, about to win his second cap for England, there is no doubt about it. “Absolutely,” he murmurs as we both gaze down at his red and white painted fingernails. “Look good, feel good, play good. I’m a strong believer in it.”</p><p>Good on the personable London Irish wing for having the courage of his convictions. It is not so long ago that England dressing rooms were full of unobtrusive black boots and keep-your-head-down reticence. Hassell-Collins, with his patriotic nail art and Harry Potter-loving snitch tattoo on his arm, is living, breathing proof of the new orthodoxy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/11/ollie-hassell-collins-england-rugby-interview-painting-nails">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US writer and psychotherapist on helping her husband to die and finding the humour in writing about it – and why she’s now spending more time with waves and sunsets</p><p>Amy Bloom is an American writer and psychotherapist. She has written four novels and five collections of short stories, including <em>Love Invents Us</em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/lucky-us-amy-bloom-review-wartime-hollywood">Lucky Us</a></em> and <em>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You</em>. Her memoir, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/15/in-love-by-amy-bloom-review-a-moving-memoir-of-a-life-lived-together">In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/15/in-love-by-amy-bloom-review-a-moving-memoir-of-a-life-lived-together"> </a>, is a searing account of her journey with her husband, Brian Ameche, to Dignitas in Switzerland to end his life after he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s.</p><p><strong>Alongside the heartbreak, your book is mordantly funny. How did you locate the humour </strong><strong>in what you were going through?<br /></strong>I didn’t so much locate it as just swim in it, which I think is in my nature. When you’re going through something really hard, you have to have time to cry but there are also things that are just too funny and I don’t feel it takes away from the sadness or the grief to find them funny. I think it’s an important quality to be woven into the story. One of my favourite exchanges with Brian, which I have in the book, is when he told me that he would prefer it if we could just find a way for me to end his life when the time came. And I’m like, I don’t know, I’m not sure I can do that emotionally. Also, it’s illegal and I would go to jail. He was very disappointed and then he said to me: “You’d be great in jail. You’re such a leader.” That did make us both laugh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/amy-bloom-i-have-a-minor-interest-in-gardening-but-really-its-people-in-love-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

## I’ve always bought too many clothes, but my life was being ruined by hoarding

<p> I’d spent years in a tearful cycle of shame and anxiety about my possessions and didn’t understand why – until I got help</p><p>I’ve bought my fifth ball gown today and although I don’t need it – and I’m not convinced the waistband would actually zip up around my thigh – I’m definitely going to buy it. It’s an absolute steal at £30 when the price tag indicates it was originally £700. I cannot believe how much money I will be saving if I buy this dress.</p><p>This thinking propelled me through my 20s and into my 30s. The joy of a bargain, of filling my wardrobe with clothes I’d never ordinarily have been able to afford. I can still remember my first designer purchase from an antique shop. I spotted it instantly: a metallic gold and silver appliqué pencil skirt, Christian Dior, £10. I was 24 and when I got home I hung it over my bed. I would become special enough to wear this skirt, I thought.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/11/hoarding-shame-anxiety-too-many-clothes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Researchers for a pharmaceutical company stumbled upon a nightmarish realisation, proving there’s nothing intrinsically good about machine learning</p><p>Here’s a story that evangelists for so-called AI (artificial intelligence) – or machine-learning (ML) – might prefer you didn’t dwell upon. It comes from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9.epdf">pages of </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9.epdf">Nature Machine Intelligence</a></em>, as sober a journal as you could wish to find in a scholarly library. It stars four research scientists – Fabio Urbina, Filippa Lentzos, Cédric Invernizzi and Sean Ekins – who work for a pharmaceutical company building machine-learning systems for finding “new therapeutic inhibitors” – substances that interfere with a chemical reaction, growth or other biological activity involved in human diseases.</p><p>The essence of pharmaceutical research is <em>drug discovery</em>. It boils down to a search for molecules that may have therapeutic uses and, because there are billions of potential possibilities, it makes searching for needles in haystacks look like child’s play. Given that, the arrival of ML technology, enabling machines to search through billions of possibilities, was a dream come true and it is now embedded everywhere in the industry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/11/ai-drug-discover-nerve-agents-machine-learning-halicin">Continue reading...</a>

Because I am a Kurdish man from a remote Kurdish village near the Syrian border,” he told the<em> Observer</em>. “Now, my home town is destroyed too.” Then they had trouble finding essentials for their journey: fuel for their hire car, water and bread.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/11/uk-families-turkey-syria-earthquake-victims-aid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Rough Trade)<br />The bird kingdom gives lofty inspiration to the Irish singer-songwriter’s wild and wonderful fifth album</p><p>Like other individual, poetic voices – Tom Waits, Björk, Leonard Cohen, none of whom she remotely resembles – that of <a href="https://lisaoneill.ie/home/">Lisa O’Neill</a> will always divide opinion. Steeped in the cadence of her native County Cavan, it is by turns raw and wild, warm and melodic, grief-stricken and exuberant, driven always by the drama inherent in the song. On her previous album, 2018’s much-praised <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/19/lisa-oneill-heard-a-long-gone-song-review-raw-and-unvarnished-folk-for-austere-times">I Heard a Long Gone Song</a></em>, O’Neill was occupied principally by numbers from Irish tradition, though it was an original, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkm0vBEQT8Q">Blackbird</a>, that appeared on the <em>Peaky Blinders</em> soundtrack.</p><p>Here, she unfurls a sequence of eight originals bound together by a cascade of imagery drawn largely from nature, in particular the bird kingdom, “a lawless league of lonesome beauty” the singer yearns to join. The record opens with words from Patrick Kavanagh’s 1942 poem <em><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/modern-ireland-in-100-artworks-1942-the-great-hunger-by-patrick-kavanagh-1.2212837">The Great Hunger</a></em><em> </em>– “Clay is the word and clay is the flesh” –<em> </em>that establish its themes of mortality and nature. On Old Note, O’Neill’s meditations are strikingly set against a drone arrangement by fiddler <a href="https://www.colmmacconiomaire.com/">Colm Mac Con Iomaire</a>, one of many gifted players on board, and elsewhere comes tragic pre-Raphaelite romance, the starry realms of “moon’s milk and sun’s silk”, and to close, a lullaby.

<p>Chelsea cannot buy a win at the moment. The big spenders were on the right path when João Félix displayed his glimmering talent, jabbing his new team into an early lead, but they soon lost their way. The dominance faded. Momentum slowed. West Ham were pretty much gifted a way back, Emerson Palmieri dragging them level, and what followed was a reminder of the uncertainties facing Chelsea, whose new recruits spent the rest of a messy contest getting their wires crossed during their unconvincing pursuit of a winning goal.</p><p>Therein lies the problem for Graham Potter, who is still trying to work out the best way forward with his bloated squad. There were a moments of promise, not least from Félix, but they were not sustained. Viewed generously, this is a work in progress. But it is now two wins from their last 13 games for Chelsea, who did not threaten during the second half, and West Ham were entitled to argue that they fully deserved a point that leaves them unbeaten in four games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/11/west-ham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Roundhouse, London<br /></strong>The US singer-songwriter with a voice for the ages delivers a sumptuous, soft rock-leaning set that circles around urgent concern for the planet and humanity</p><p></p><p>Many people will recognise the feeling of gobsmacked powerlessness so often engendered by current affairs. Not for nothing was “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/01/sums-up-2022-permacrisis-chosen-as-collins-word-of-the-year">permacrisis</a>” declared the word of the year for 2022. US artist Natalie Mering, who records as Weyes Blood, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_Blood">pronounced as Flannery O’Connor would say it</a>, eyes up environmental collapse, the sinister march of tech into human relationships and the lack of love seemingly endemic among humans and responds by throwing all the beauty she can muster back at them.</p><p>It is a great deal of loveliness. Her voice is one for the ages, a real-deal instrument that taps into classic American timbres: Karen Carpenter or the folk sirens of the 60s-70s cusp. Mering’s vocal default mode is limpid grace, tilting at old timey mellifluousness. She definitely doesn’t want to be inhaling all the dry ice that has been pumped on stage at the start of her set. “No more fog!” she instructs. “It’s apocalyptic enough as it is.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/11/weyes-blood-roundhouse-london-review-torch-songs-for-the-end-of-time-natalie-mering-holy-flux-tour">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It just feels warm and fuzzy’: how Hallmark built an empire of unashamedly schmaltzy rom-coms

<p>In these safe and sweet TV movies, the only thing bigger than Valentine’s Day is Christmas. But are the US network’s cookie-cutter confections beginning to move with the times?</p><p>Avon, Connecticut, lies toward the north of the US state, a small town of perfect contour and construction, where even on a bare-branched midwinter afternoon, the light falls pleasingly across East Main Street. The population is largely white and affluent, and alongside the Walmart and the Whole Foods, there is a congregational church and a country store that, in the autumn months, offers hayrides to a nearby pumpkin patch.</p><p>When Julie Sherman Wolfe moved to Avon from Los Angeles five years ago, it was a relocation she came to regard as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Sherman Wolfe is the screenwriter behind 22 Hallmark movies, from The Convenient Groom, via Right in Front of Me and Always Amore – films that were often set in precisely the kind of quaint New England town to which she and her family had moved. The draw for Sherman Wolfe echoed the on-screen appeal for viewers. “I think the more unsafe the world seems, the safer a small town seems,” she says. “It’s the idea that less bad stuff is going to happen to you in Avon than it is in Brooklyn. It’s a nostalgia thing, where it just feels warm and fuzzy.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/11/hallmark-channel-romcoms-valentines-day">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I never really thought I’d be alive at this point’: Munroe Bergdorf on how she fell back in love with life

<p>She’s the model, writer and trans activist who has been abused in her private life and vilified in public. Now she is revealing all in her new memoir – and explains why writing it was the most brutal form of therapy</p><p>At the age of 13, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/munroe-bergdorf">Munroe Bergdorf</a> was a swimming sensation. But in her memoir, she barely devotes a sentence to her feats in the pool, merely saying she swam at national level, was ranked 11th<sup> </sup>in the country and didn’t have her heart in it. That’s all. She doesn’t tell us whether she enjoyed swimming, trained hard or dreamed of competing in the Olympics. Not even her stroke of choice or distance. Now I’m curious. Fancy being so brilliant at something yet so indifferent to it that it barely merits a mention in your life story.</p><p>So I ask, and it all pours out. She swam the 50m backstroke, won race after race for her all-boys school, and hated every minute of it. Not the swimming (that was fine), but the culture. “Going to meets, the boys would all have fun together on the bus and I’d sit at the back,” she says. “I was never part of the squad. I was just there to bring the average of the team up. All of my teammates hated me.” It says so much about how she viewed the world, and how the world viewed her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/11/munroe-bergdorf-interview-model-writer-trans-activist-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Copenhagen fashion week is still leading the way in eco credentials, but can the big shows ever follow suit?</p><p>What do you do if you’re a designer who is trying to be more sustainable but you want to show at fashion week? For Emilie Helmstedt, a Danish designer who took part in last week’s Copenhagen fashion week, the solution for the footwear styled with her dresses came from her team who brought in their old Nike and Adidas trainers. Covering them with ribbons, beads and paint, Helmstedt decided it was better than using new versions, as she has done in the past. It also chimed with the rest of the collection – her finale look which was made from scraps of material accumulated in her studio.</p><p>Copenhagen fashion week started in 2006 with relatively low-level fanfare. Then, three years ago, Danish organisers set out a series of sustainability requirements for designers to meet in order to be allowed to show in 2023 which would set them apart from the main fashion weeks – New York, Milan, Paris and London – on the global calendar</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/11/a-sustainable-fashion-week-too-good-to-be-true">Continue reading...</a>

## Why are Britons so susceptible to fake news – and what can we do about it? | Sander van der Linden

<p>With Putin’s Russia on its doorstep, Finland began arming its people against misinformation. It worked</p><p>Late last year, a <a href="https://osis.bg/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HowItStarted_MediaLiteracyIndex2022_ENG_.pdf">report</a> was published that ranked countries according to their resilience to misinformation. At first, when I searched for the United Kingdom, I couldn’t find it – because I was looking at the top end of the list. In fact, the UK didn’t make the top 10 – it was in the second tier, coming in at number 13, well below many western European countries.</p><p>Where are we going wrong? The report relied on several well-known indices to determine a country’s level of resilience to fake news, including freedom of the press, societal trust and national education levels. Finland topped the table, and has received international <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2023-01-27/finland-most-resistant-to-fake-news-report-finds">praise</a> for its outstanding approach to fighting fake news. A thriving democracy – like Finland’s – is characterised by high levels of trust, an educated citizenry, as well as freedom of the press. Unfortunately, according to the report, the UK got downgraded on all of these indicators by the report’s authors, thanks to declining levels of trust and increasing concerns about threats to journalism and media freedom. Yet, the biggest differentiator in the ranking has to do with media literacy and education.</p><p>Sander van der Linden is Professor of Social Psychology in Society at the University of Cambridge and Author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/foolproof-9780008466718">Foolproof: Why We Fall for Misinformation and How to Build Immunity</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/11/britons-gullible-fake-news-finland-misinformation">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Her writing became a catalyst for my own’: the power of Sylvia Plath

<p>On the 60th anniversary of Plath’s death, Emily Berry celebrates the poet’s vigour, brilliance and relatability</p><p>A few years ago a friend sent me a photo of himself wearing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath">Sylvia Plath</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/27/where-to-start-with-sylvia-plath"> </a>T-shirt. It was pale pink – the colour of the Smith College memorandum paper on which the poet drafted many of her poems – and printed with the iconic picture of Plath in side profile, wearing a white hairband. I thought it was the greatest thing I’d ever seen.</p><p>I am one of countless poets who developed an obsession with Sylvia Plath after being introduced to her work as a teenager, and her writing became a catalyst for my own. I recited her poems out loud in my bedroom, just as I would sing along to my favourite songs. The poems’ cadences sank into me, the way Plath sank into my own personal mythology, long before any other writers did. Beyond the power of her work, what Sylvia Plath represented to me is still hard to understand. On a personal level I felt a kinship with her because we had both lost parents as children (she, her father at eight; me, my mother at seven). We had both received sharp, early lessons in the savagery of the world. Such lessons are, of course, not unusual. Most teenagers, despite their backgrounds, have a sense of this savagery. Perhaps that’s why Plath’s work so often hits home in those years, when one is beginning to reckon with life’s difficulties and work out how, if, one might harness them.</p><p>They think I should love it –<br />Having her back again, they think<br />I should give them my mother’s words<br />To fill the mouth of their monster,<br />Their Sylvia Suicide Doll,<br />Who will walk and talk<br />And die at will,<br />And die, and die<br />And forever be dying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath">Continue reading...</a>

## Hugh Hudson: smash-hit pop classic Chariots of Fire director was a hero of British film

<p>Hudson brought an ad-man’s eye to the brilliant 1981 drama about athletics and bigotry, as well as directing the hilarious Cinzano commercials </p><p>As the 1980s dawned, British ad director Hugh Hudson took on his first feature film and made it a legendary hit: an inspirational story which supplied a sugar-rush of patriotism and a swoon of nostalgia which hit the spot both sides of the Atlantic. It somehow brought off the trick of being about the underdog and the victim of bigotry and religious discrimination – and yet also being a resounding endorsement of the status quo which could, on grounds of decency and meritocracy, always accommodate the outsider. This was the era of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and the ethos of success for the hardworking and the deserving.</p><p>The film of course was Chariots of Fire, the true story of the 1924 Olympic runners Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross), a Jew who ran to defy prejudice, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a devout Christian who found a creationist glory in his speed. It was the destiny of so many involved to be forever associated chiefly, or solely, with this smash-hit pop classic: certainly Cross and Charleson never again found roles to match Abrahams and Liddell. And maybe Hudson himself never again had a triumph like it: though he was no one-hit wonder, later directing the Oscar-winning Tarzan drama Greystoke, and later Revolution, an epic about the American revolution starring Al Pacino which was derided but then grew in acclaim, giving his Hudson his own misunderstood masterpiece moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/11/hugh-hudson-smash-hit-pop-classic-chariots-of-fire-director-was-a-hero-of-british-film">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The winter warmer of dreams: a creamy Spanish white soup served hot with crunchy breadcrumbs and seasonal vegetables</p><p>Soups are essential in winter, because they’re warming, nourishing and rarely expensive. Spanish white soup is more often served chilled in summer, but it can also be great cold-weather comfort food. The garlic is roasted, and is a completely different creature from fresh garlic, because the flavour is tamed and softened to a creamy richness (I’ve even been known to eat it spread on toast.) Jerusalem artichokes, meanwhile, aren’t around for long, so use them while you can. When fried, as here, they work brilliantly in a migas with some earthy mushrooms. Like many rural Spanish dishes, migas was developed out of hard times and the need not to waste anything, and are a great way to create a sexy, crunchy crumb seasoning; if you’re feeling adventurous, jazz them up by adding some crisp fried chorizo or morcilla, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/11/roast-garlic-almond-soup-recipe-jerusalem-artichoke-mushroom-migas-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>

It’s about Solène Marchand, a divorced 40-year-old art gallery owner and the mother of a 12-year-old daughter. Solène is gorgeous, sophisticated and unenthused about chaperoning her daughter and a few friends to see and meet a mega-famous boy band … but to her astonishment, Solène and the band’s extremely and delightfully Harry Styles-ish leader, Hayes, have outrageous chemistry and embark on a secret relationship. The tricky part is that Hayes is only 20. The glamorous settings are perfectly described, the celebrity details are magnificent (Lee herself is a Hollywood actor), the dialogue sparkles, and the sex scenes are scorching hot. And there are many of them. But the book also contains real emotional depth and nuance, in part because the challenges Solène and Hayes face aren’t contrived; they’re just as real as their attraction.<br /><em>Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld will be published by Doubleday in April.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/you-can-read-it-in-the-time-it-takes-to-have-a-one-night-stand-authors-on-their-favourite-romcom-books">Continue reading...</a>

Geologically speaking, Alton Priors lies on the boundary between a chalk escarpment and sandstone, the latter underlain by clay, which means there are numerous springs gushing out of the ground. The local churchyard is also where an acquaintance of my mum once suggested she try dowsing, because “he just had a sense it would work there”.

## Siblings by Brigitte Reimann review – rebel with a cause

<p>This intoxicating 1963 novel explores the tension between socialist ideals, self-fulfilment and repressive reality in East Germany</p><p>As a young woman in East Germany, Brigitte Reimann claimed that she would rather live 30 wild years than 70 well-behaved ones. When she died from cancer in 1973, aged only 39, she left behind an impressive but tantalisingly incomplete set of literary achievements. Her life – as her riveting diaries and autobiographical novels attest – was as fascinating as she hoped it would be. Reimann started writing early and quickly became a GDR literary star. A dedicated socialist, she joined a state initiative that sent her to write and teach workers at a coal-fired power plant. There she won success with a communist Bildungsroman about factory life, spawning a whole genre of imitators. Over time, however, she grew increasingly frustrated with the strictures of both married life and the GDR cultural sphere; she was also shaken by her brother Lutz’s emigration to the west in 1960. In art and life, she relentlessly criticised the GDR: not quite a dissident, but certainly disobedient.</p><p>Much of this biography appears in Reimann’s novel Siblings, originally published in 1963 and now available in English. Its narrator, Elisabeth Arendt, is an idealistic young painter who clashes with her beloved brother Uli over the GDR’s repressiveness. (Both are haunted by their other brother, Konrad, already seeking his fortune in the west.) Like Reimann, Elisabeth works at a power plant; she also, like Reimann, strains against the artistic and political orthodoxies of old party comrades who refuse to listen to young people, especially women, with fresh ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/siblings-by-brigitte-reimann-review-rebel-with-a-cause">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Everyone is going to talk about it’: the making of a $7m Super Bowl ad

<p>Sunday’s big game offers brands an expensive opportunity to put together a celebrity-fronted spot and get maximum attention in the shortest amount of time</p><p>“Having an ad in the Super Bowl is very high pressure,” says Scott Bell, chief creative officer of the advertising company Droga5, from their office in New York City. “It’s the one thing you do when you know everyone is going to talk about it and have an opinion. The rest of the year, nobody cares. For the Super Bowl, everybody cares!”</p><p>So it goes in the life of the advertising companies that try to grab America’s attention every year with a slate of eye-popping ads during the sole night of the year when the commercials in between are just as important, and for some even more important, than the actual game itself. That’s part of the reason why 30-second ad slots for Super Bowl LVII were selling for over $7m.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/11/super-bowl-ad-commercial-cost">Continue reading...</a>

Just spinning the TV idea generator wheel here, hold on: Prue Leith and … her MP son … go on a road trip … about assisted dying. Yeah, that’ll do.

<p>One pot, less waste: an economical version of a classic stew using the bottom of a bottle of red and cuts of meat that are still relatively good value</p><p>Today’s dish is inspired by a classic French recipe,<em> joue</em><em> de boeuf,</em> or<em> </em>beef cheeks braised in red wine, from chef <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/07/pierre-koffmann-cooks-cook-dan-doherty">Pierre Koffmann</a>. Beef cheeks are a lean but tough cut that needs a low and slow approach to tenderise it (which may explain why most beef cheeks are processed into mince, animal feed or simply thrown in an incinerator). I’ve modified Koffmann’s original, using a smaller quantity of a different meat – in this case venison or lamb steaks – and more vegetables, to keep costs down, to increase the nutritional variety in the dish, and to make it work as a way to use up an open bottle of red wine (the original uses far more than most people would ever have left over).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/11/how-to-use-up-leftover-red-wine-in-a-brilliant-meat-stew-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In hindsight, a memorial service may not have been the best occasion at which to finalise the legal formalities</p><p>At long last, my wife and I have wills. Over three decades of marriage we have had countless conversations about the importance of having wills, without ever taking any steps to achieve that aim.

We got away with that oversight, but we can’t dodge the need for wills – we’re going to die at some point.</p><p>Our new wills are virtually identical, although early on in the process my wife tried to insert some language into hers that would make any second marriage on my part a difficult prospect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/11/tim-dowling-weve-finally-made-our-wills-and-my-wifes-is-a-lot-longer-than-mine">Continue reading...</a>

## Country diary: I rest against a mighty cairn that’s visible for miles | Jim Perrin

<p><strong>Yr Elenydd, Powys:</strong> After scaling Drygarn Fawr, my mind turns to the quartzite contained within</p><p>A bright, cold day promises firm going across the miry moorland that leads to the fine, remote hill of Drygarn Fawr, presiding spirit of what the late Wynford Vaughan Thomas called The Great Wilderness. It is precisely that, too, stretching from Machynlleth in the north to Bannau Brycheiniog in the south. I drive round to the headwaters of Afon Irfon and set off through forestry plantation, on a short approach best suited to a winter ascent.</p><p>Bramblings glide among the wood margins, conspicuously white-rumped, their repetitive call-notes plangent and piercing among the silence of the trees. Atop an isolated spruce, a crossbill chips its response. Few footprints mark the snow beyond the moor gate. Its pristine surface is gold-stippled by clumps of rushes. Tracks of hares thread between them. I labour across Blaen Gwesyn to Drygarn’s rocky summit ridge, climb to the higher easternmost summit and rest my back against its mighty cairn. It’s 10 feet tall, perhaps 60 in circumference, visible for miles around. Its gleaming white quartzite core is concealed within a pebbly grey conglomerate cladding, damaged here and there by Ordnance Survey activity. Quartzite cores are a feature of old Welsh hilltop cairns. And quartzite, common though it might be, is a rock that’s often recruited for usage at ritual sites, and not just in Wales.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/11/country-diary-i-rest-against-a-mighty-cairn-thats-visible-for-miles">Continue reading...</a>

That body language bears out when he cracks Murphy’s second ball straight down the ground. Luckily for Australia Murphy gets a left paw to it and stops a certain four.</p><p>Great bowling by Murphy again! Jadeja didn’t play for that much side spin and it rocketed into the top of off stump. That’s the strike Australian needed. Was that an arm ball or natural variation in the pitch? Either way, Murphy made Jadeja look a little foolish there. Curious end to a cracking innings by the allrounder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/feb/11/india-vs-australia-live-updates-cricket-score-first-test-day-three-ind-v-aus-scorecard-international-latest-scores-nagpur-vca-stadium">Continue reading...</a>
