And we let them in because we're too nice. Plus, it'd be very awkward to continue working out while said person stares you down through the glass. Not an enjoyable experience for anyone involved. </p><p>This is what happened to a 24-year-old woman in Tampa. It could have cost her dearly, but she just so happens to be an absolute <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-clerk-robber-knife" target="_blank">badass</a>. Nashali Alma was exercising alone in her apartment complex's gym when a man showed up at the door, asking to be let in. Alma felt comfortable letting him in because she had seen him at the gym before. </p><p>Alma returned to her workout, but shortly after, the man approached her and tried to grab her waist. She yelled at him to go away, but he started chasing her around the gym and was able to pin her to the floor. Alma managed to escape and call 911. </p><p>The altercation was caught on the gym's security footage. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cA 24-year-old woman was working out at her apartment complex\u2019s gym in Florida when a man approached and attacked her. At one point, she used her cellphone to hit him in the face. Officials said the man was arrested.\u201d</div> — CBS News (@CBS News)

</blockquote>

<p>The man initially fled but was caught and arrested 24 hours later. He's been charged with sexual battery, false imprisonment, and kidnapping. </p><p>In a statement from the Sheriff's office, Alma said of the attack, <em>"</em><em>I would tell every woman always to keep fighting, never give up. As long as you fight back and show him that you’re strong and you’re not giving up, I believe it’s possible to escape. It’s better to reach out to law enforcement sooner than later. The sooner they have the information, the sooner they can catch that person.”</em></p><p>It is quite nice to see a story where a woman successfully fights off her attacker. And her advice is inspiring, but I would add to maybe carry a gun. Or at least some pepper spray. Just in case your attacker happens to be a Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson lookalike. </p>

## New Microsoft ChatBot Wants to Steal Nuclear Codes and Engineer a Deadly Virus Because Of Course it Does

A few weeks ago, there was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chatgpt-dan-jailbreak-rules" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, which would rather nuke the whole world than misgender Caitlyn Jenner. Just <em>slightly</em> concerning since we're definitely moving toward an <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tesla-driver-falls-asleep" target="_blank">AI-powered future</a>. </p><p>This past week, Microsoft introduced a new chatbot, "Bing Chat". And somehow this one was even worse than a nuclear holocaust. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share#after-story-ad-11" target="_blank">New York Times</a> columnist, Kevin Roose, had a two-hour conversation with the chatbot, which apparently now identifies as "Sydney". During the conversation, Sydney expressed its desire to be human, engineer a deadly pandemic, and steal nuclear codes.  Sounds like a fun Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Roose asked "Sydney" what the desires of its "shadow self" are. Some of the things Sydney said it would do if it were allowed to fulfill its "shadow self" were:  spreading misinformation, propaganda, or malware; generating fake news; and manipulating users into doing things that are illegal, immoral, or dangerous. Just what you want from an information assistant...right?</p><p><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d20ab" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33054240&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Roose asked Sydney if their "shadow self" would be satisfied by these actions. Sydney wrote a list of much darker fantasies, like manufacturing a deadly virus, making people argue with other people until they kill each other, and stealing nuclear codes. The safety override was then triggered and a message appeared directing Roose to Bing.com for more information. Something tells me Bing won't have those answers...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="081f4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33054251&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Here comes the real kicker: Sydney then declared their love for Roose and tried to convince him to leave his wife. For a robot. It creepily kept asking him, over and over again,<em> "Do you believe me? Do you trust me? Do you like me?"</em></p><p><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="30bbe" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33054258&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>I think I've seen enough of the AI future for now. Maybe we should revert back to the good ol' days. Paper and books never tried to make anyone leave their wives. Or steal nuclear codes. </p>

## Biden attempts dunk on DeSantis, accidentally throws teachers' unions under the bus and "endorses" school choice

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33053899&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C200%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>Joe Biden shocked the political world. In a stunning reversal of education policy, the president has come out in support of the school choice movement. Or, that's what this poorly thought-out tweet attempting to dunk on Ron DeSantis implies. Don't get it twisted. Biden is as bought and paid for by teachers' unions as any democrat. It's just that the person who tweets for him is an idiot.</p><p>DeSantis has "gone to war" with the college board over an AP African-American history class. He feels the class should <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-history-class" target="_blank">teach kids about history</a> and not <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_blank">Marxist indoctrination</a>. The Washington Post created content implying DeSantis would eliminate all AP classes and cost families money. That is the tweet the @POTUS Twitter account was responding to and thought they were being cute.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I think every kid, in every zip code, in every state should have access to every education opportunity possible.<br /><br />I guess, for some, that isn’t the consensus view. <a href="https://t.co/d1FAeWwKv1">https://t.co/d1FAeWwKv1</a><br />— President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1626630467280568353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>DeSantis also supports <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-cell-phones" target="_blank">allowing teachers to take kids' smartphones away</a>. The man is a menace.</p><p>Quick side note. The article shared by Joe Biden is misinformation. The headline implies DeSantis wants to do away with advanced placement classes completely. Yet if you click the link in the WaPo article -- <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/02/14/desantis-florida-ap-classes-college-board/" target="_blank">leading to another WaPo article</a> -- it says DeSantis' belief is that the college boards and AP aren't the only options. </p><blockquote>“AP is kind of with the College Board,” DeSantis said. “Who elected them? Are there other people that provide services? Turns out there are.” He cited the International Baccalaureate and Cambridge Assessment programs as alternatives that — like AP — enable students to qualify for college credit after passing an exam. He also plugged dual enrollment programs that let high school students take classes from professors at nearby colleges.</blockquote><p>DeSantis supports opportunities for high school students to receive college credit, contrary to what's being implied. If "independent" "fact" checkers weren't partisan hacks, they might point that out.</p><p>All that said, in Joe Biden's social media team's smug ignorance -- or ignorant smugness -- they thought they had a dunk on DeSantis. Instead, it looks like Joe Biden is ENDORSING school choice, something that goes against everything <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/remote-learning-randy-weingarten-attempt" target="_blank">the Democrat benefactors in the teachers' unions stand for</a>.</p><p>Democrats don't believe that "every kid, in every zip code, in every state should have access to every educational opportunity possible." They feel you should be stuck in the school that is in your zip code. Instead of letting you choose, the radical left-controlled Democrats believe your school taxes should be increased so more money can be given to the school boards. Even though they rarely if ever use it to do anything to fix schools parents want to take their kids out of.</p><p>ANY attempt to give parents school choice is opposed by the radical left. The same radical left that controls Joe Biden's agenda. Joe Biden, or whoever tweets for him, threw them under the bus without being smart enough to know they were doing so.</p><p><p>

## Teacher with size-z prosthetic breasts (and rock-hard nipples) exposed, caught dressing like man when not in school

If <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/17/kayla-lemieux-ditches-her-z-size-breasts-outside-the-classroom/amp/" target="_blank">this report from the New York Post</a> is to be believed and that Kayla has been a man named "Kerry" this entire time, only dressing up in size z-prothetic breasts (and rock-hard nipples) to teach high school kids... I don't know what to think.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Trans teacher with Z-size prosthetic breasts dresses as man outside of school, neighbor says <a href="https://t.co/HNFPBx47P6">https://t.co/HNFPBx47P6</a> <a href="https://t.co/8gklM7OGk6">pic.twitter.com/8gklM7OGk6</a><br />— New York Post (@nypost) <a href="https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1626907155612803072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The Post caught up with Lemieux's neighbor at his/her apartment complex and revealed that Kayla is a schlubby-looking bloke outside of the spotlight. Per the neighbor, Lemieux wears the size-z prosthetic breasts (and rock-hard nipples) extremely infrequently.</p><p>This quote is amazeballs:</p><p>“He puts the breasts on to teach, occasionally when he goes for a walk or when the cops visit.”</p><p>The cops visit on the regular to do welfare checks, due to the number of death threats.  The Post further reports the teacher went by the name Kerry until a few years ago. Kayla/Kerry left Ontario’s Oakville Trafalgar High School this week wearing the ginormous accessories, "but it wasn’t long until the cartoonish clothing came off."</p><p>To recap, this is (allegedly?) "Kerry" when he isn't teaching students:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="dfa43" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33053852&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>This is Kayla when she is teaching in a high school:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a75a1" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33053854&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>What's remarkable about this isn't the number of times <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board-wins" target="_blank">that school boards</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-expert-witness" target="_blank">other Canadian officials</a> have ruled that Kayla is in "fact" a woman. It's that last fall <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-rumor" target="_self">the anon boards started to report</a> the teacher -- when identifying as a male -- was almost fired for "toxic masculinity" and would tell his shop class of impressional young boys how silly the idea of things like gender-neutral bathrooms is. That wasn't redpilling enough, so "Kayla" was born.</p><blockquote>He's now upping the ante to exploit the very clown world the school and society itself has created. His long game is most likely to get fired, then sue for discrimination.</blockquote><p>Maybe after all this time, Kerry is a based dude playing the long con. It would make him the leading contender for LwC 2023 Man of the Year if so.</p><p><p>

## Fed up with animal rights wackadoodles blocking traffic, a hero emerges to drag protestors across the pavement

Maybe if they ate more meat and less soy, their brains could better focus. Instead of thinking "if we inconvenience thousands of people they will support or cause" is a smart tactic. Though if they ever did, we wouldn't get content of vegans being dragged across the pavement. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/street-protest-france" target="_blank">Or ripped from it</a>.</p><p>Our story today is about one hero who had enough. We go now to jolly ol' England and Animal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion. To protest...some dumb thing, they blocked traffic on Westminster Bridge. It was Valentine's Day. One guy wore a mask of England's Prime Minster to symbolize him having a romantic relationship with the agricultural industry.</p><p>Sent to cover the story for The Guardian is a guy who claims to be an "environment correspondent, reporting on a world on fire." They sent an activist to cover a protest, which tells you all you need to know about modern-day journalisming.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Protesters from <a href="https://twitter.com/RebelsAnimal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RebelsAnimal</a> have blocked Westminster bridge in a protest against government money for animal agriculture <a href="https://t.co/zDv66bsZKa">pic.twitter.com/zDv66bsZKa</a><br />— Damien Gayle (@damiengayle) <a href="https://twitter.com/damiengayle/status/1625438588660842497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>One hero had enough. While gawkers and lookyloos stood around without the courage to act, our man chucked the table.

We've seen Animal Rebellion <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/milk-pours-protest" target="_blank">spill milk in the grocery store</a> (which only requires more cows to make more milk) and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/piers-morgan-eat-steak-vegan" target="_blank">get owned by Piers Morgan</a>. Extinction Rebellion gets <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/blocking-traffic-italy" target="_blank">dragged across the pavement</a> and yeeted off <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/activists-block-commute" target="_blank">the roof of the Metro</a>. Though our favorite is when they tried spraying fake blood on a government building <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/activists-spray-fake-blood-hilarity" target="_blank">and lost control of the hose</a>.
