<p>Paris police attacks on Liverpool fans at the Champions League final was yet another example of the hosts’ big game failures</p><p>Uefa’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/13/champions-league-final-report-uefa-primary-responsibility-chaos-paris-liverpool-real-madrid" title="">report on last season’s Champions League final</a> is impressively uncompromising. It was, it said, “through no merit of those in charge” that another Hillsborough was avoided. “The Préfecture de Police were in effect acting unilaterally to direct supporters toward an entry point that would be unable to cope with the level of demand placed upon it … several key stakeholders have not accepted responsibility for their own failures but have been quick to attribute blame to others.”</p><p>The report is thorough and unsparing in criticising Uefa and the French authorities. There were supplementary factors, such as the rail strike, problems with scanning tickets and attacks by locals but, fundamentally, this was a colossal failure of crowd management. What is so infuriating is that so much of what happened was predictable to anybody who has been to a match in France.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/18/france-police-brutality-against-football-fans-champions-league-final">Continue reading...</a>

These people awoke before dawn to start their day. They all pushed the same<em> </em>puffy headband on to their foreheads, then recited morning affirmations while applying serum and styling their eyebrows. They journaled about their “goals” and planned out their day by the hour. They worked out in spandex sets so fresh that I felt the urge to throw out my old, ratty sports bras. They meditated, and/or practised yoga (both?!). They made smoothies featuring fresh fruit and all sorts of powdered supplements. In some cases, they went on “mental health walks”. And they documented it <em>all</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/19/broadcasting-your-breakfast-why-tiktokers-obsess-over-morning-routines">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘This was happiness – not a permanent state but a vanishing point’: what makes me happy now

<p>In a series of short essays, writers consider what happiness means to them now, after the reckoning of the past few years</p><p>When someone you love is unhappy, it’s easy to become a fellow traveller in their unhappiness. I know this because I carried my father’s sorrow about his Parkinson’s disease with me for 20 years. It was a misery that only deepened with time. In his last years, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/14/sarah-holland-batt-on-fighting-for-her-father-watching-someone-decline-can-be-beyond-language">I’d visit Dad in his nursing home</a>, he’d cry uncontrollably. Sometimes, a word or phrase would set him off: any mention of Winston Churchill or the war. Other times, it would be spontaneous, disconnected from any clear source. Geriatricians call this pathological crying: an unhappiness that blows over you like weather. When Dad cried, I’d keep my tone light and try to steer his attention elsewhere. Afterwards, I’d go back to my car and cry myself.</p><p>Relatives of people who are incarcerated talk about doing time with their loved ones and I knew an echo of that feeling. Guilt rode alongside me when I dived into the ocean, ate at a good restaurant, or boarded a plane. I was haunted by the thought of my father in his small, circumscribed room, by his severance from the world’s freedoms and pleasures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/19/this-was-happiness-not-a-permanent-state-but-a-vanishing-point-what-makes-me-happy-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The award-winning poet on writing in the voice of a convicted killer, her excavation of the masculine psyche and why she wants to read less</p><p>At 52, award-winning Scottish poet Em Strang is publishing her debut novel. <em>Quinn</em> is narrated by a convicted murderer who gets a shot at redemption when the mother of his victim makes a gesture of what appears to be radical forgiveness. Visceral, incantatory and startlingly beautiful in places, it’s a book whose power is accentuated by its brevity. Strang spoke by Zoom at the end of a month-long literary retreat at Hawthornden Castle, where she was completing a new poetry collection and beginning her second novel.</p><p><strong>You write in your acknowledg</strong><strong>ments that </strong><em><strong>Quinn</strong></em><strong> began with a single line. How did it evolve from there?<br /></strong>I actually did a lot of dance practice around it, feeling my way into the impulse to write something longer.

Nick Fletcher doesn’t seem to want people to live and work in places that work well for their inhabitants<p>Imagine an old-fashioned British country town. Good citizens strolling down the high street to their friendly baker, grocer and butcher, relaxing in pubs and on cricket fields, their children walking to school, “old maids bicycling to holy communion through the morning mist” <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00007018;jsessionid=B1FD5838B4A827AAC5CFC8510F322AD5" title="">as John Major</a>, quoting George Orwell, once put it. This, surely, is the sort of thing Conservatives like.</p><p>But no. According to Nick Fletcher, Tory MP for the South Yorkshire constituency of the Don Valley, this way of living is an “<a href="https://twitter.com/NickFletcherMP/status/1623699476366991360" title="">international socialist concept</a>”. Specifically, he fears and loathes the idea of the “15-minute city” developed by the Colombian-born Sorbonne professor Carlos Moreno, which proposes that most of what you need or want – places of work, homes, shopping, education, sport, social life, pleasure – be within a 15-minute walk or cycle ride, as in a traditional town or city. This, says <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2023/02/fifteen-minute-cities-will-be-back-conspiracy-theories-house-commons" title="">Fletcher</a>, who seems to be drawing on some of the nuttier claims on the internet, “will take away personal freedoms”. It’s a case of lunacy on stilts as virtuoso as any in the world of conspiracy theories. It also highlights a central question of modern conservatism: do they actually want to conserve things?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/18/tory-mps-fear-and-loathing-15-minute-city-no-foundations">Continue reading...</a>

January’s big spenders got what they deserved for picking a team that would have been more suitable for the early rounds of the Carabao Cup.

<p>With six minutes of normal time to play and with Phil Foden and Erling Haaland’s second-half misses doubtlessly replaying in his mind, Pep Guardiola’s worst fears were confirmed. Before kick-off Manchester City had thought this might be the day they capitalised on an Arsenal slip but in the end they tripped up as Chris Wood cancelled out Bernardo Silva’s brilliant opener to deny City victory and earn Nottingham Forest another valuable point in their fight for survival. Steve Cooper skipped down the touchline in delight at Wood’s equaliser but Guardiola will be left to stew on how a game that they should have put to bed wriggled clean of their grasp.</p><p>Guardiola spent almost the entirety of the first half with his hands on his hips on the edge of his technical area. Along the touchline Cooper arched his back as Forest, who often set up to flummox their opponents with 11 men behind the ball, extinguished myriad City attacks, some with more ease than others. Serge Aurier earned a warm ovation from the Forest support after his early slide tackle on Haaland siphoned the ball from the City forward. Joe Worrall, one of five Forest changes, resorted to making a crude challenge on Jack Grealish on the edge of the box. Grealish, not for the first time, was a marked man and by the end his shirt was caked in mud stains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/18/nottingham-forest-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p><a href="http://jamescookartwork.com/">James Cook</a> started making work on typewriters when he was studying A-level art. “We were asked to look at how technology throughout the ages had been adopted by artists,” he says. “At first, I studied David Hockney, who used fax machines, but then I got my hands on a typewriter and looked at artist Paul Smith’s work.

<p>Taiwan and its huge silicon foundry look set to become the centre of the geopolitical conflict between the US and China</p><p>Our digital civilisation, if you can call it that, runs on just two numbers – 0 and 1. The devices we call computers run on vast strings of ones and zeros. How? By having electrical currents that are either flowing or not. The tiny electronic switches that decide whether they’re on (1) or off (0) are <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/digital-logic/12/273">called transistors</a>.</p><p>Once upon a time, these were tangible objects: I remember buying one with my pocket money in the 1950s for a radio receiver I was building. But rapidly they were reduced in size, to the point where electrical circuits using them could be etched on thin wafers of silicon. Which I guess is how they came to be called silicon “chips”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/18/cold-war-20-will-be-a-race-for-semiconductors-not-arms">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arab minority has been alienated by united opposition against judicial reforms by Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition</p><p>As the light faded and tens of thousands of protesters made their way back from the Knesset to Jerusalem’s train station last week, the mood was tired but determined. Israel’s newly re-elected prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is no stranger to demonstrations calling for him to resign. But the now two-month-old movement against his far-right coalition’s plans to overhaul the judicial system is not like those he has faced before – or like any in the country’s history.</p><p>The “Israeli spring”, as commentators are starting to call it, is a rare show of unity in what is normally a deeply polarised society. Afraid that the proposals curbing the power of the supreme court will start Israel down an authoritarian path similar to that of Turkey and Hungary in recent years, upwards of 100,000 people have taken to the streets every Saturday night in cities across the country to voice their opposition. As of last week, protests are taking place outside Israel’s parliament too, and several industries have held strikes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/18/israeli-spring-protests-netanyahu-leave-palestinian-citizens-in-the-cold">Continue reading...</a>

In fact, they weren’t.

The rust-brown stage set suggests hillocks in silhouette, the biggest implying a volcano, which, like Chekhov’s gun, is there to erupt. (No one, save the band, was expecting so much catharsis so early though.) Polachek’s three-piece are parked in one corner, as though huddled against impact.</p><p>It’s fitting that we hear Polachek before we see her. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/20/after-a-year-without-crowds-caroline-polachek-takes-the-stage">When she was 17</a>, she sang in four choirs at once, plus an a cappella group and not one, but two nu-metal bands, on top of her opera training. As a 21st-century pop vocalist, Polachek pretty much has her own AutoTune built in (auto-AutoTune?), normally deployed with restraint. This clarion-like burst of lungpower sets the tone of her new album, <em>Desire, I Want to Turn Into You</em> – released on Valentine’s Day to coincide with this triumphant gig. Both mark Polachek’s move from cult nicheness to wider renown. There are many reasons why she has sold out this 5,300-capacity show; why second nights are being added to her North American tour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/18/caroline-polachek-eventim-hammersmith-apollo-london-review-desire-i-want-to-turn-into-you-album-launch-a-heady-howling-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; Royal Festival Hall; Barbican, London</strong><br />In a busy week for star pianists, Benjamin Grosvenor takes a late-romantic warhorse and runs with it, while the RLPO try out their latest gleaming acquisition…</p><p>The glittering caravan that is Eurovision 2023 will soon roll into Liverpool and set up camp along the waterfront and around the Pier Head. The song contest kicks off on 9 May, with the final on the 13th. Reflecting the circumstances of this year’s event, which should have been hosted by Ukraine, the slogan is “united by music”. These words could apply to Liverpool, a Unesco city of music bubbling with sonic activity, any time in its modern history. Merseyside’s musical associations stretch back centuries.</p><p>Last week the star British pianist <strong><a href="https://www.benjamingrosvenor.co.uk/">Benjamin Grosvenor</a></strong> made his Liverpool concert debut as soloist <a href="https://www.liverpoolphil.com/whats-on/classical-music/pictures-at-an-exhibition/4295">with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra</a> – founded in 1840 and one of the world’s oldest orchestras – in Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto. We are in the 150th anniversary year of the Russian composer’s birth. This favourite work is on every concert schedule. Predictability and familiarity are hazards. Not here. Vitality and invention made this performance exceptional. Balance was ideal, the exchanges between pianist and woodwind lithe and expressive, violas – sitting on the outside of the cellos – notably revelling in their prominent solos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/18/benjamin-grosvenor-rlpo-review-philharmonic-hall-royal-liverpool-philharmonic-orchestra-kahchun-wong-mussorgsky-bells-kirill-gerstein-lpo-london-philharmonic-nikolaj-szeps-znaider-royal-festival-hall-seong-jin-cho-barbican">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This one-pan wonder is perfect for those evenings when you don’t want to cook but need something warm and comforting with minimum effort</p><p>Last July, I took a cooking class in Bangkok. I was making the food of my dreams, but it was a long day and I was tired from pounding pastes and milking coconuts. I asked the cooks: do you eat like this at home? No, they said. One liked to eat eggs and rice, another enjoyed noodles. Which brings me to today’s recipe: although there are many wonderful things I <em>could</em> make for dinner, when I want something fast and good, I often make fried rice. Sometimes, it has diced carrots and broccoli, at other times tofu and leafy greens – and it comes together quickly, even when you’re too tired to cook.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/18/vegan-recipe-tofu-fried-rice-green-cabbage-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

He is not in agony, but suffering from something possibly worse: bewilderment. When he walks, he loses his footing. It’s a ballet turned upside down; instead of rising to the air in an elegant saute, the dancer flounders uncomfortably on the ground. Creature, as the nameless protagonist is known, has been transplanted to an entirely unfamiliar environment – a polar research station – where he is being subjected to an experiment to test the limits of the human body to endure cold, isolation and homesickness.</p><p>The architects of this film were themselves transplanted to an unfamiliar environment when making it.

One thing seems certain, however: incidents like these could too easily spiral out of control in the future, ending in disaster. Unless something is done, dangerous waters lie ahead. Unfortunately, both sides are reluctant to do what’s needed.</p><p>Let’s make no bones about it. It would be better if China didn’t spy on the United States. Any US leader would be hard pressed not to shoot down a Chinese object that the American public has seen flying over US sovereign airspace – as President Biden decided to do on 4 February. But the reality is that events like this will be more and more likely in the next decade as the United States and China bump up against each other globally. The risk of clashes in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea have preoccupied military experts for years, but the balloon incident shows they could happen almost anywhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/18/china-spy-balloon-dangerous-new-era-us-china-relations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bagging a great-value break is still possible despite rising prices – but it does involve research and planning, says our cheap holiday expert</p><p>Recent headlines have not been kind to those of us who like a bargain getaway. With the price of hotels, self-catering and package holidays all rising, there’s been a barrage of bad news, putting a dampener on our summer holiday plans even before we’ve started looking.</p><p>But just how hopeless is the situation? I have made it my profession to search out cheap holidays, so I’m not prepared to throw in the towel just yet.

<p><strong>Hertfordshire:</strong> On a nippy day in our local wood, we found a field mouse. It was a mouse with a plan</p><p>I just knew it wasn’t a normal day – it felt different. There was a nip in the air and it was misty. I ran outside, the leaves crunching beneath me. We went to the small wood, with its exotic scents – a breeze of weeds, nettles and wet, freshly cut timber.</p><p>When we reached the clearing in the wood, I saw a little field mouse which looked as hungry as ever, with a twig held tightly in its tiny teeth. As plenty of nature books say, if you see an animal you should keep very still. So that is what I decided to do. The field mouse sat still and looked back at me for a bit. After a while it gave up the staring contest and scampered to a nearby tree covered with fresh green moss and started hitting it with the twig.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/18/young-country-diary-i-found-a-little-criminal">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Adults and kids pushed each other to grab as many bottles as they could’: how the world got hopped up on energy drinks

<p>They are a multibillion-dollar global industry, a vital pick-me-up for gig-economy workers and – thanks to KSI and Logan Paul’s Prime – a cult among teens. But what are these sugary, often hyper-masculine brands doing to those who drink them?</p><p></p><p>A 13-year-old I know (whose identity I am thinly veiling to preserve his privacy) came back from school the other day and told me that there was a year 9 kid “dealing Prime” at the back of the class. Apparently, this boy was sourcing the Prime from a supplier in London for £2 a unit before selling it on to children who didn’t know any better for eight quid. “Prime” isn’t, as I first thought, a drug but <a href="https://drinkprime.uk/">a sports drink</a> in bright plastic bottles promoted by the YouTube stars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KSIOlajidebt">KSI</a> and Logan Paul. Prime Hydration contains coconut water, B vitamins and sweeteners, plus branched-chain amino acids (which are used by bodybuilders to promote muscles) and it comes in lurid flavours including Tropical Punch and Blue Raspberry. Another version of the drink called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnAJ7BiBaVb/">Prime Energy</a> also contains 200mg caffeine: more than twice as much as a can of Red Bull. A teacher at different school reports that older children have been taking empty bottles of Prime, filling them with water and selling them to naive year 7s, who are left in tears when they discover it isn’t the real thing. It seems there is no shortage of 11- to 15-year-old boys prepared to pay £8 for these glorified bottles of squash, which have become a status symbol of sorts. Actually, £8 isn’t even that expensive for Prime, which last year was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/16/wakey-wines-off-licence-prime-camel-milk-viral-tiktok-wakefield">selling for £19.99</a> and upwards a bottle at an off-licence in Wakefield known as Wakey Wines, which developed a cult following after customers started filming themselves buying expensive soft drinks there and putting it on TikTok.</p><p>Something strange is happening in the world of energy drinks. These concoctions – soft drinks that claim to boost potency and productivity – have been around in one form or another since the 1940s. But never before have they been such an intense and frequently purchased object of desire. In some convenience stores and supermarkets, whole chiller cabinets are now devoted to them. The names alone can make you feel hyped up: Monster, Relentless, Rockstar, Boost, Furocity, N-Gine, Tiger, Grenade. The sugary soft drinks market is finally declining in many countries as consumers become more aware of the effects of sugar on health; yet energy drinks sales are still rising rapidly year on year. Red Bull, the market leader, sold <a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/energydrink/company-profile">11.582bn cans globally in 2022</a> compared with 4bn cans in 2011. <a href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/results/red-bull-multipack-sales-gives-energy-drinks-brand-wings-as-supermarket-sales-soar/671633.article">According to the Grocer</a>, Red Bull saw its total UK revenues rise by 19% in 2021 to £414.7m.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/18/how-the-world-got-hopped-up-on-energy-drinks-prime-logan-paul-ksi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thomas Frank’s side have beaten Manchester United, City and Liverpool this season and he warns they are ‘still improving’</p><p>Others may have been fretting but, back in August, Thomas Frank had no fears of second-season syndrome. It was an obvious affliction to predict for a club that punched so spectacularly above its weight on entering the Premier League: history provides several examples of subsequent letdown and the loss of Christian Eriksen, who pulled Brentford upwards last season when their form dropped, did not bode well to those assessing from afar. But Frank watched each of their matches back from start to finish in pre-season and felt convinced they had set themselves a platform for improvement. The feeling in south-west London was of quiet confidence.</p><p>“I was never worried about it,” Frank said on Friday, holding court with familiar garrulousness. “I was hugely respectful of the league and I know that if you’re not on it, or get three key injuries, or are a little bit unlucky, then you can be in big trouble. There’s nothing granted that we can stay here for ever. But how we performed last year was not lucky at all if you look at all the underlying performance indicators. Knowing the squad, knowing we didn’t want to sell anyone and knowing we had added more talent and quality, I was quite sure we could do well again.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/18/brentford-big-six-thomas-frank-europe-analysis-interview">Continue reading...</a>

But it has taken her a long time to get back to fiction, she says, when I visit her at home in Cambridge, where she is living with her husband, the American poet Steven Toussaint, as he studies for a PhD in divinity and philosophy of religion at the university.</p><p>“The Booker prize was life-changing, but it wasn’t self-changing,” she says. “Having a child is truly self-changing.” They have just returned from a trip to Auckland, her first visit home since the pandemic, and the first time her parents had met her two-year-old daughter. By coincidence, on the day we meet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-resigns-as-prime-minister-of-new-zealand">Jacinda Ardern</a> announces she will be stepping down as prime minister of New Zealand. While Catton has been a fan, she says, she took the closing of her home country’s borders at the peak of the pandemic “kind of personally”. As Catton points out, when Ardern thanked her “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/ardern-announces-new-zealand-will-reopen-schools-offices-and-restaurants-this-week">team of five million</a>” New Zealanders for the sacrifices they were making during lockdown, she failed to include all those who were stuck overseas, like Catton, who had just moved to the UK, “and who were also making an incredible sacrifice.

<p>The city was liberated in November but ever since the Russians have been bombarding it from across the Dnieper River</p><p>Vitaliy Savchenko showed off the damage from a Russian shell that had landed right across the street. Shrapnel tore holes in his garage and blew off the kitchen door. There were three neat gaps in his car. “When it’s a mortar you have five seconds to react. With a Grad missile it’s a bit longer – about 18 seconds,” he said. “A tank round is instantaneous. There’s no time to hide.”</p><p>Savchenko lives in Kherson, the southern city triumphantly liberated on 11 November by Ukrainian forces. He spent nine months under occupation. When friendly troops came down the main Ushakov avenue, Savchenko waved a blue and yellow flag he had hidden under the stairs, along with his mobile phone. The next evening he held a party with friends. They clinked glasses in celebration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/18/khersons-weary-holdouts-recall-occupation-nightmare-as-bombs-fall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Letting the expert online recruiters Patriotic Alternative back on the platform isn’t a win for free speech but for fascism</p><p>At the end of last year, the British far-right group Patriotic Alternative (PA) was allowed back on Twitter after a ban of nearly two years for an unknown transgression. Far-right groups immediately urged Elon Musk to “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230129175937/https://twitter.com/Clay1984More/status/1605582009018916865">be a hero</a>” and also reinstate the account of the group’s leader, Mark Collett.

<p>Ahead of this weekend’s awards ceremony, here’s our guide to the runners and riders – from All Quiet on the Western Front to The Quiet Girl – as well as the greatest best film winners of the past</p><p>The Baftas can seem like another stepping stone on the long road to the Oscars, but the UK industry’s highest honour can assert its own identity when it wants. Last year the British Academy of Film and Television Arts gave its best actress award to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/16/joanna-scanlan-after-love-interview">Joanna Scanlan</a> for <em>After Love</em>, a film scarcely seen across the Atlantic, and for the seventh time in the past eight years chose differently from the US Academy in the best film race. (Bafta went for Jane Campion’s <em>The Power of the Dog</em> while the Oscar went to the wispy <em>Coda</em>: a point to the Brits there.)</p><p>Tomorrow night we can hope for more bold choices. Netflix, hot off its victory last year, once more boasts the top nominee. Not many expected Edward Berger’s German-language <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81260280">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></strong> to lead the field with a whopping 14 nods – the most for any film at the Baftas since <em>The King’s Speech</em> 12 years ago. Rather quietly released to the streaming service last November, this robustly stirring, immaculately crafted adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s classic first world war novel is well worth catching up with – even if its harrowing battle scenes really demand a large screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/18/streaming-the-pick-of-bafta-2023-contenders">Continue reading...</a>

## The King of Comedy at 40: Martin Scorsese’s painful ode to the wannabe

<p>In the dark, dry comedy, Robert De Niro plays a scheming comedian whose mediocrity doesn’t dampen his ambition</p><p>There’s a sequence in Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, where Jerry Langford, the host of a popular late-night talk show, slips out of his New York office and goes for a walk down the street. Everyone knows who he is, but how they interact with him varies. He’s charmed by a middle-aged taxi driver who greets him and tells him how much he enjoys the show. He’s happy to get an ovation from construction workers overhead. Then he’s stopped by a woman at a payphone who wants him to sign her magazine. He obliges. Then she wants him to say something to her nephew on the phone. He politely declines. As he walks away, she shouts after him: “You should only get cancer. I hope you get cancer.”</p><p>Nothing about this is out of the ordinary. It’s surely not the first time a fan has wished cancer on Jerry for not obliging a request, and he’s probably forgotten about this woman the moment he crosses the street. His chief expression is one of annoyance, because this is the price of being a celebrity and he’s going to be paying for it the rest of his life. People invite him into their homes every night on television and he becomes part of their lives, but it’s a one-sided relationship that he couldn’t reciprocate if he wanted to. As played by Jerry Lewis, who surely knows the feeling, he looks like a man who often regrets fame, but can’t do anything about it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/18/the-king-of-comedy-at-40-martin-scorseses-painful-ode-to-the-wannabe">Continue reading...</a>

## What to do with celeriac? Try this risotto

<p>For this recipe, I’ve adapted a technique from Sophie Gordon’s wonderful book The Whole Vegetable to create an elegant dinner with zero waste </p><p>A silky-smooth celeriac, chestnut and tahini puree is folded into this risotto just before serving, creating an unbelievably creamy texture without the use of cheese, butter, cream or any ultra-processed plant-based alternatives. I’ve simplified Sophie Gordon’s original by cutting the number of cooking steps and using the celeriac cooking water as the stock.</p><p>I’ve also used short-grain brown rice instead of traditional polished arborio because I’m a staunch wholefood chef. Short-grain brown rice is an absolute joy: it’s hyper-nutritious and has a marvellous taste, texture and sweetness. Unfortunately, supermarkets don’t stock it, so you’ll have to shop online or get it from a wholefood store. I’m delighted to report that, with Sophie’s incredible celeriac and chestnut puree, it works perfectly here, becoming creamy and unctuous with the perfect “bite”. It can be hard to cook risotto rice al dente, but brown rice gets over that because of its nutty taste and texture, which mean it holds a firm bite for longer. The recipe will also work with brown basmati rice or risotto rice, but you’ll need to adjust the cooking times accordingly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/18/what-to-do-with-celeriac-try-risotto-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt">Continue reading...</a>

Still, the chances of a puncture are unlikely …</p><p>Five years ago my wife and I bought a car from a dealership in Exeter, after our previous one, with its long history of troubles, broke down there. When the salesman asked what we were looking for, we told him we had just one requirement: we must be able to leave our old car on his forecourt, and never see it again.</p><p>We’d never owned a new car before, and it was thrilling: everything in it worked. Then a month later I ran over a nail and got a flat tyre. I opened the boot, and peered into the compartment where the spare ought to have been. There, in the tyre-shaped well, I found only an electric pump and a can of repair gloop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/18/tim-dowling-our-car-doesnt-have-a-spare-tyre-and-i-feel-deflated">Continue reading...</a>
