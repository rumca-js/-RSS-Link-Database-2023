<p><em>Just about every week brings something new to Destiny 2, whether it's story beats, new activities, or interesting new combinations of elements that let players devastate each other in the Crucible. Iron Banter is our weekly look at what's going on in the world of Destiny and a rundown of what's drawing our attention across the solar system.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Usually, the limbo between Destiny 2 seasons eases a bit as we learn more about the next expansion, and this week, Lightfall details are coming en masse thanks to a brand-new vidoc from Bungie and an earlier preview event GameSpot was invited to. While watching the vidoc at the preview event and a live gameplay demo of the first mission, one thought kept running through my head: We're seeing the game evolve before our eyes once again.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not drastic on all fronts: Neomuna, the new location in Lightfall, is still what Bungie refers to as a "three-bubble zone," which puts its size on par with Europa or the Throne World. So it's not particularly large from what I gathered, and we will likely have seen most of the location by the time Season of the Defiance is over. However, one thing I've grown to appreciate about Destiny 2's more recent locations is just how deep these labyrinthine worlds go.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-evolving-once-more-with-lightfall-iron-banter/1100-6511654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
