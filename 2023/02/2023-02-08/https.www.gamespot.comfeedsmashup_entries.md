<p>Following rumors that the next entry in The Legend of Zelda series would retail for a whopping $70 (and a surprise Nintendo eShop update that all but confirmed it), Nintendo has officially announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> will be its first $70 game. The company made the announcement in a press release shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-february-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6511344/">February 8's Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p>Though it's unusual that other first-party Nintendo games coming out this year (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pikmin-4/">Pikmin 4</a>) won't see the same increase, the small hike doesn't come as too much of shock; Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, and Take-Two Interactive have all pivoted to a $70 new release price point in the past few years.</p><p>In addition to the base edition of the game, Nintendo also announced a $130 Collector's Edition of Tears of the Kingdom. The Collector's Edition includes a physical version of the game, an artbook, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom-officially-costs-70-130-collectors-edition-revealed/1100-6511347/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With just three months to go until launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-new-trailer-reiterates-hyrule-is-a-depressing-place/1100-6511283/">Nintendo showed off new gameplay</a> of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom during the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-february-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6511344/">Nintendo Direct</a>. The highly anticipated sequel launches on May 12, and it will be the first Nintendo-published Switch game to retail for $70. Retailers temporarily stopped taking preorders ahead of the pricing change, but <a href="https://howl.me/ci5OoMYsejg?u1=subid_value"><strong>Tears of the Kingdom is now available to preorder</strong></a> again. Nintendo also announced a $130 Collector's Edition and a new Link Amiibo, both of which will be available on May 12, too. Preorders for the Collector's Edition and Amiibo aren't live yet.</p><p>It's unclear at this time what retailers will do for customers who had already locked in a Tears of the Kingdom preorder at the $60 price point. All major retailers were taking preorders since last September. We'd suggest you keep your preorder and wait to see if the retailer reaches out to you to cancel or adjust the price to the new MSRP.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Nintendo games rarely receive official preorder bonuses, but it's fairly common for major retailers to offer unique goodies--typically small collectibles or trinkets--to incentivize buying Nintendo games from a particular store. We'll update this preorder guide with new offers as we see them.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-preorders-are-available-now/1100-6492963/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nintendo Switch's New Kirby Game Is Much More Than Just A Port

<p dir="ltr">Kirby's Return to Dreamland didn't set the world on fire when it was released on Wii in 2011. The gentle, kid-friendly platformer was a moderate success, garnering <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/kirbys-return-to-dream-land">generally positive reviews</a> and modest sales but otherwise passing without much notice. In the wake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-the-best-kirby-yet/1900-6417850/">stellar Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, Return to Dreamland Deluxe for Nintendo Switch is giving the game a second chance. And while it still isn't as surprising as some other Kirby outings, during a recent hands-on session I found the co-op game shaping up to be a perfectly pleasant old-school platformer--and with a sizable addition to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name suggests, Kirby's Return to Dreamland is a return to his roots for the pink puffball. Even in the Wii era, he had become known as a flexible figure prone to experimentation, as in the unique path-drawing gameplay of Kirby: Canvas Curse or a novel art style in Kirby's Epic Yarn. Return to Dreamland is classic Kirby platforming, which means forgiving, floaty jumps, and enemies that are more adorable than aggressive. The visuals have been touched up for this Switch release, making the colors more vibrant and giving the characters a sharp black outline to make them look like paper cutouts.</p><p dir="ltr">The twist of Return to Dreamland is you can also play as three of Kirby's companions: Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Bandana Waddle Dee. Each comes with their own playstyle and move set, but only Kirby can use copy abilities. Since the stages and enemies are built around copy abilities, Kirby defaults into a party leader role, so it's best to bring a Kirby or two along in the character select screen.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switchs-new-kirby-game-is-much-more-than-just-a-port/1100-6511274/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nintendo Direct February 2023: The Biggest Games And Announcements

<p>The latest Nintendo Direct aired on February 8, and it was jam-packed with game announcements and news--both for brand-new games and for returning classics. At more than 40 minutes, it was a lot to process, but we've rounded up the biggest news and announcements. Even if you weren't interested in Zelda (which made a big appearance) there was almost certainly something for you to get excited about. Metroid Prime Remastered? The return of a long-delayed turn-based strategy game? What about Game Boy games on Switch? We knew we'd get your attention. </p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><div>          </div><p>The final game of the show was also the biggest. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-new-trailer-reiterates-hyrule-is-a-depressing-place/1100-6511283/">gameplay showcase</a> to close out the presentation. It shows Hyrule in peril--even by the series' usual standards--with flaming meteors crashing to the ground as enormous monsters gain a foothold on the territory. Link has access to many of his usual weapons and gear, but he can also drive a vehicle on the ground, pilot a different one in the air, and skate like he's Tony Hawk on special rails. Alongside the standard game's release on May 12, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will also get a collector's edition packed full of extra goodies.</p><h2>Metroid Prime Remastered</h2><div>          </div><p>The original Metroid Prime game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-coming-to-nintendo-switch-today/1100-6511343/">back on Nintendo Switch</a>, and it looks like a whole lot of work was put into making it look like it belongs on the newer hardware. The upgraded GameCube title has received a big visual overhaul while maintaining its distinctive art style, and there are multiple control options to cater to returning fans as well as newcomers more used to a dual-stick setup. Otherwise, the gameplay looks like it was left faithfully intact. The best part? You can play the game today via its digital release, with a physical version coming on February 22.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-february-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6511344/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New Zelda: Tears Of the Kingdom Trailer Showcases More Of The Game And New Amiibo

<p>The latest Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at its biggest game coming in the first half of this year, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The new trailer mostly showcases more gameplay but also teases more of the game's story, which seems to be quite tragic, much like its predecessor (or most Zelda games, if we're being honest).</p><p>It's not all doom and gloom, however! Following the trailer reveal, Nintendo also announced that Tears of the Kingdom is getting an accompanying Amiibo. The Amiibo is of Link, adorned in the outfit he's seen wearing in most Tears of the Kingdom trailers. It will be released on May 12, and be sold separately from the game.</p><p>The focus of this Nintendo Direct was said to be "mostly" on games coming in the first half of 2023, and Tears of the Kingdom is the biggest one of the bunch. It's slated for May 12, 2023, having been delayed out of 2022. The cryptic trailers have raised a lot of speculation over radical changes to the Zelda formula that could be coming in this installment, but so far none of those have been confirmed.

<p dir="ltr">At long last, Nintendo has revealed the new release date for Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp.

You'll be tasked with commanding your own army in strategic, turn-based combat, as well as capturing towns and bases to secure victory and keep the peace.</p><p dir="ltr">As for its delay, Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp was reportedly complete and ready to hit its April 8, 2022 release date when Russia invaded Ukraine, kicking off a still-ongoing war.

The port of the 3DS game is scheduled to launch in Summer 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">In Ghost Trick, you play as a ghost named Sissel who can switch between the world of the living and the dead, a trick they use to save the lives of others. Most of the gameplay is centered around Sissel's power of possession, in which you can relive the final four minutes of a person's life and do your best to ensure events don't play out as they're supposed to. Doing so stops the person from dying.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-trick-phantom-detective-review/1900-6286220/">Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective review</a>, Carolyn Petit wrote, "Ghost Trick is one of the most original and compelling puzzle-oriented adventure games to come along in recent years. Nearly every facet of the game is outstanding: the unique gameplay concept and the puzzles you solve, the great characters and dialogue, the terrific animation and visual design, and the strange mystery, full of surprising twists and shocking revelations, whose threads all come together in a memorable and rewarding conclusion. The length of the game can vary significantly depending on how long it takes you to work out the puzzles, but you can expect to spend a good 10-15 hours piecing together this mystery, and its novelty and quality ensure that the experience will remain fondly in your memory well after that. If you have any interest in games of this kind, you need to play Ghost Trick."</p>

## Samba De Amigo Makes Surprise Return On Nintendo Switch

<p>More than 20 years after the original game released, a new Samba de Amigo is in the works--this time for Nintendo Switch. The rhythm game from Sega was announced during the February 8 Nintendo Direct, and it looks to move the groundbreaking game into a whole new era.</p><div>          </div><p>In Samba de Amigo: Party Central, players get the chance to turn their Joy-Cons into maracas and play along to 40 groovy tracks. However, that's not all you'll do in the upcoming rhythm game revival. Strange and silly prompts will also appear as you play the game, including one demanding you take a break from the song to dish out some high-fives. The game also features several minigames and the ability to customize your character's appearance and outfit.</p><p>Samba de Amigo was originally released for the arcade, followed by the Sega Dreamcast. An updated Wii version released in 2008, but the franchise--if you can call it that--has been effectively on ice ever since. Its gameplay can be compared to Donkey Konga or Guitar Hero, but with extra Latin flair in both the aesthetics and song selection.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/samba-de-amigo-makes-surprise-return-on-nintendo-switch/1100-6511330/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">As she makes the rounds promoting Cocaine Bear, director Elizabeth Banks has let the cat out of the bag about a couple of her superhero film ambitions. For starters, she reached out to Marvel Studios about directing Thor: Ragnarok several years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">But Banks told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/features/elizabeth-banks-cocaine-bear-gory-1235515340/">Variety</a> she never heard back about her Thor inquiry. "Nothing ever happened," she said. "No one called me. Taika Waititi got the job. Rightfully so." Part of the reason why she was attracted to the Marvel movie was to work on a more CGI-focused project, something that she's finally doing with Cocaine Bear. She previously helmed Pitch Perfect 2 and Charlie's Angels.</p><p dir="ltr">"I definitely wanted to make something muscular and masculine," Banks said. "I wanted to break down some of the mythology around what kinds of movies women are interested in making. For some bizarre reason, there are still executives in Hollywood who are like, 'I don't know if women can do technical stuff.'"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elizabeth-banks-asked-to-direct-thor-ragnarok-marvel-never-replied/1100-6511337/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Early on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> you will gain access to the game's version of a skill tree, referred to as Talents. These Talents provide bonuses like better versions of spells you might already have or improved healing from health potions. Many of these Talents are very beneficial, but it's important to understand which ones will provide the biggest benefits, especially early on in the game. Here's everything you need to know about the Talent system in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Talents Work</h2><p dir="ltr">The Talent system is unlocked fairly early on in your time at Hogwarts. <strong>It is unlocked once you reach the Map Room</strong>, which will be fairly obvious once you reach it. When the Talent system is unlocked, you will receive one Talent point for each level starting at level 5. <strong>It's important to know that there are more talents than you will earn talent points</strong>, so an important part is picking which ones are most appealing to you, although there are a few that are must-haves. Some Talents are level-gated as well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-talents-explained-best-skills-to-grab-early/1100-6511336/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The upcoming film Cocaine Bear tells a wild story about a bear that got into some cocaine and went on a killing rampage, and the film will--you guessed it--be full of graphic violence. Director Elizabeth Banks said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/features/elizabeth-banks-cocaine-bear-gory-1235515340/">Variety</a> that she pushed for a certain level of violence in the movie, which is rated R.</p><p>As part of her research, Banks said she learned about how bears eat their prey, and it's not for the faint of heart. "They don't kill their prey before they eat it. They just start eating it alive," she said. "I don't recommend anyone do this, but if you go down the internet hole of looking at actual animal attacks on humans, it's f**king gnarly as sh**."</p><div>          </div><p>Banks said she grew up watching Evil Dead and is a big fan of gore in films.

<p>It's been an interesting few months for Netflix as subscribers were up in arms about how they were going to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-password-sharing-will-soon-cost-you-extra/1100-6510737/">change their account sharing policy</a>--which they backpedaled on after just two days--and the company rolling in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-with-ads-shows-solid-early-results/1100-6510744/">ad-based tier</a>. The latter is a moderate success so far, but the company has already come up with a new plan on how exactly account sharing will work in the future.</p><p>While this plan doesn't have a timeframe to be implemented in the US, it's already been explored in Latin America and is soon to be hitting Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain. On <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/an-update-on-sharing">its corporate page</a>, they go through the new process and what will be different this time around.</p><p>First is setting up the account user's primary location. This step will ensure that anyone who lives in that particular household can use that Netflix account.

<p>One of the top games on Steam right now is not a fully released game at all, but a demo for a difficult, multiplayer dungeon crawler called Dark and Darker.</p><p>As noticed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/one-of-the-biggest-games-on-steam-right-now-is-a-next-fest-demo/">PC Gamer</a>, in a fun little write-up about playing the game itself, the demo has reached the heights of the Steam Charts. As of time-of-writing, Dark and Darker sits at number seven on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">the rankings</a>, just below GTA5 and just above Team Fortress 2. The game is a first-person dungeon crawler, where you can team up with or fight other players while facing the dungeon's traps and perils.</p><p>As you might expect from an action RPG of this kind, you can pick a class, with the demo providing six options to choose from. You can enter the dungeon with a party of up to three friends, and mix-and-match your classes to offset each each other's weaknesses. You can also revive your allies. The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/">Steam page</a> pitches it as high-risk and high-reward. Upon death, you lose all the loot you have on you, but deeper layers of the dungeon and more powerful enemies will offer better riches.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-next-fest-demo-takes-high-position-on-most-played-charts/1100-6511329/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Brendan Fraser Talks About Losing Out On Superman Role Due To Studio Politics

<p>Brendan Fraser is on the comeback trail with his list of accolades for his performance in The Whale, even receiving his first Oscar nomination for his performance. Fraser's tale of being blacklisted in Hollywood is something that's been the talk for over a decade as it was something that cost him role after role.</p><p>In the early 2000s, Warner Bros. was attempting to revitalize its Superman movie franchise after its last attempt with Tim Burton's Superman Lives fizzled out in the late 1990s. The studio hopped around directors, including McG and J. J. Abrams who was coming off his Dark Angel hit with Fox. Fraser had auditioned for the coveted role, but ultimately, as we know, didn't get the part.</p><p>"I felt disappointed that there was an amazing opportunity and it didn’t come to fruition," Fraser tells <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/brendan-fraser-lost-superman-role-studio-politics-warner-bros-1235516790/">Variety</a>. "It had to do a lot with some shenanigans and studio politics. And probably, inherently, in my screen test. I think that's why you test…they could kind of see I was only there like 98%."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-fraser-talks-about-losing-out-on-superman-role-due-to-studio-politics/1100-6511323/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Activision Blizzard reps already spoke out about the company's views on the latest UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report. Now, it's Microsoft's turn. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvOTygiaf4U">CNBC news segment</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella answered questions about how strongly he feels about Microsoft acquiring Activision and how confident he was in the deal happening in the present compared to before.</p><p>The road to acquiring Activision Blizzard hasn't been an easy one. During the interview with Nadella, CNBC presented a slide displaying the Microsoft Azure growth slump from 64 percent revenue growth in Q2 2022 to 38 percent in Q2 2023. Another slide displayed a tumultuous timeline of events from when the acquisition was first announced in January 18, 2022 to the current date. Microsoft and Activision faced multiple hurdles, including an objection from Sony to the CMA, a lawsuit from the FTC, and concerns from Google and Nvidia about the ongoing deal.</p><p>Most recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-regulator-suggests-microsoft-sell-off-call-of-duty-to-acquire-activision/1100-6511296/">CMA published a report</a> that warned about how the acquisition could negatively affect the UK gaming market. Activision representatives, including CEO Bobby Kotick, addressed the CMA report in statements to the media and internal emails earlier this week. Nadella backed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-remains-confident-even-after-uks-latest-statement/1100-6511310/">Kotick's statements</a> about bringing "more competitiveness" to the gaming industry and noted that he understood that it was up to the regulators to make the final call about the acquisition. Still, he urged regulators to consider alternative questions and "really reflect" on how the deal could drive competition rather than hinder it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-talks-proposed-activision-blizzard-buyout/1100-6511324/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Hitman Developer Addresses Frustrations With Freelancer Mode's Difficulty

<p>IO Interactive has addressed complaints about the difficulty in Hitman: World of Assassination's new Freelancer mode. While a few clarifying changes are coming, the developer has explained its choices and why the difficulty of Freelancer is staying the same.</p><p>On a blog post on the <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman?panel=hitman/blogs/2023/freelancer-difficulty-and-the-persistency-rules-of-freelancer-tools">Hitman official website</a>, the developers explain the logic behind how the Freelancer mode works and what it frustration points are. Some frustration comes from the possibility of losing a campaign, upon which progress restarts. Some players felt that this was too hardcore, but IO wanted to make sure winning a campaign feels like a big deal and that the "adrenaline rush" from mistakes or failure in certain missions is preserved.</p><p>Another frustration comes from losing Freelancer Tools. These tools are objects like poisons, lockpicks, and explosives. You lose these items if you don't bring them back from a mission, but all tools are also lost upon campaign failure (or when you end it). IO states that lack of clarity, as well as confusion about the difference between Freelancer Tools and other items, has made the loss of these tools feel unfair. A new label, which can be seen in the weapon wheel, will mark items as Freelancer Tools.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-developer-addresses-frustrations-with-freelancer-modes-difficulty/1100-6511321/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Authorities recently discovered 3.5 tons of cocaine floating in the ocean, and this has led movie fans to call for a Cocaine Shark movie to follow the upcoming Cocaine Bear film.</p><p>To be clear, Cocaine Bear is a real movie coming out this month based on the true story of when a bear got into some cocaine and went wild.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> is losing its built-in Twitter support, likely in response to Twitter's plan to charge developers for access to the social media site's API.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/twitter%C2%AE-integration-removed-from-world-of-warcraft%C2%AE/1516087">forum post</a>, Blizzard explained that the feature will be automatically removed over the course of the next few days, after which the ability to tweet in-game will no longer be available.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability to tweet from Azeroth was added in 2015 as part patch 6.1, during the game's Warlords of Draenor expansion.

<p>California State University, Fullerton Police have issued a statement about a perceived threat to a professor in a email, and it now appears that it was in fact a joking reference to the upcoming Nintendo Direct.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://police.fullerton.edu/documents/miscdocuments/Perceived%20Threat%202-7-23.pdf">statement from CSUF Police</a>, the email referenced a "once-in-a-lifetime event" and asked that the professor cancel class on February 8 for "the good of humanity." Detectives discovered "after hours of investigation" that the class would be taking place at the same date and time as today's Nintendo Direct. Afterwards, the individual reached out to the professor and said that the email was "a bad joke" regarding Nintendo's announcement stream.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Message from Acting Chief Scot Willey regarding perceived threat to <a href="https://twitter.com/csuf?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@csuf</a>. <a href="https://t.co/RyDbTqfxt9">pic.twitter.com/RyDbTqfxt9</a></p>  &mdash; CSUF Police Department (@csufpd) <a href="https://twitter.com/csufpd/status/1623207864906170368?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, the statement clarifies that additional officers will patrol campus and K9 units will walk the buildings "out of an abundance of caution." It appears the police are leaning toward it being a joke about the Nintendo Direct, judging by the statement's wording. The vagueness of the email caused the professor's and the police's concern.

<p>The director of the upcoming Winnie the Pooh horror movie has confirmed that he wants to make a "twisted" horror universe with other childhood characters getting turned into monsters. After Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey releases on February 15, there could be many more films like it to come.</p><p>Rhys Frake-Waterfield told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/winnie-the-pooh-bood-honey-bambi-peter-pan-horror-universe-1235320371/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that one of these will be a Peter Pan movie featuring a "heavily obese" Tinkerbell who is recovering from drug use. Another movie is Bambi: The Reckoning, which depicts the lovable baby deer as a killing machine. If Frake-Waterfield's vision comes to life, we might see crossovers like Marvel does with its superhero characters.</p><div>          </div><p>"The idea is that we're going to try and imagine they're all in the same world, so we can have crossovers," he said.

<p>The Lego Super Mario catalog is filled with awesome products, but <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://howl.me/ci5FXqk9Wdi?u1=subid_value">The Mighty Bowser set</a> </span> is arguably the most exciting. Clocking in at a staggering 2,807 pieces, the King Koopa stands over 12.5 inches tall and is compatible with other Lego Super Mario sets. The Mighty Bowser typically costs <strong>$270</strong>, but during Best Buy’s latest promotion, you can snag the awesome set for <strong>just $243</strong>.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://howl.me/ci5FXqk9Wdi?u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div><p> </p><p>With nearly 3,000 pieces in the kit, this isn’t a project for the faint of heart. However, once you’ve assembled Bowser, he’ll be able to interact with the Lego Mario, Luigi, or Peach kits--giving them a formidable foe to battle against. You can also create different poses using a button under his shell, and he can even shoot (fake) fireballs from his mouth.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mighty-bowser-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-at-best-buy/1100-6511305/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will see Cal Kestis take on the Galactic Empire with several new elegant skills at his disposal, as well as a less civilized long-range option. The lightsaber is still Kestis' primary weapon for dealing with Stormtroopers and bounty hunters, and now features a crossguard upgrade similar to Kylo Ren's design. Kestis can also switch to a blaster stance this time, which encourages ranged attacks.</p><p>Speaking to Play Magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-jedi-survivors-blaster-stance-brings-less-civilized-ranged-attacks-to-more-civilized-lightsaber-combat/">GamesRadar</a>), director Stig Asmussen explained that the crossguard blade will offer a "heavy yet measured and purposeful approach" when equipped and is useful "for when you really need to bring a measured, hard-hitting approach" to a fight.</p><p>For the blaster stance, Asmussen said that it's there "to encourage ranged attacks" alongside regular lightsaber strikes. The blaster's inclusion in Jedi Survivor is particularly notable, as Fallen Order focused purely on lightsaber and Force combat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-lets-you-mix-up-lightsaber-combat-with-blaster-action/1100-6511303/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a> has a new Featured Location called Sacred Timeline. This Featured Location has a 40% chance of appearing during the event's 48-hour window, meaning you should be familiar with how it works if you plan on playing. It rewards the first player to fill the location with a <strong>copy of their starting hand</strong>, which could be enough to emerge victorious.</p><p>While it's tempting to simply place a bunch of 1-cost cards down in Sacred Timeline, we don't recommend doing that--at least, not without a plan. Doing so will certainly trigger Sacred Timeline's effects, but you'll likely lose the location. And as always, you'll want to come with a viable deck that works, regardless of if Sacred Timeline appears.</p><p>Use at least some of the following cards to win the Sacred Timeline location:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-sacred-timeline-location-the-best-cards-to-win/1100-6511300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## UK Regulator Suggests Microsoft Sell Off Call Of Duty To Acquire Activision

<p>The United Kingdom's Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) has released its provisional report on Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and it doesn't read like good news for Microsoft and others who want to see the deal go through. The CMA said it has "provisionally concluded" that the buyout "could result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation for UK gamers." The CMA also outlined potential ways for Microsoft to have the deal approved, and one is divesting of the Call of Duty business.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-slash-activision-blizzard-merger-inquiry">In a press release</a>, the CMA said its investigation found that the deal "raises concerns about cloud and console gaming," going on to state that the merger could make Microsoft "even stronger in cloud gaming." This, in turn, could stifle competition and harm UK gamers unable to afford "expensive consoles." The report went on to provisionally state that the deal, in its current form, "could also harm UK gamers by weakening the important rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles."</p><p>The provisional report is based on what the CMA called a "wide-ranging investigation" that took place over the past five months. Business leaders at Microsoft and Xbox spoke with the CMA, and the group analyzed more than three million internal documents from both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard to "understand their views on the market." The CMA also said it commissioned an independent survey of UK gamers and spoke with other publishers and cloud gaming service providers as part of making its decision.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-regulator-suggests-microsoft-sell-off-call-of-duty-to-acquire-activision/1100-6511296/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ahead of today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-february-8-will-include-roughly-40-minutes-of-new-info/1100-6511234/">Nintendo Direct</a>, we may have learned something new about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Yesterday evening, the Nintendo Switch eShop showed a $69.99 price for the highly anticipated sequel. The price has since been removed from the eShop, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was an error.</p><p>Not long after the $70 price point circulated on social media, every major retailer stopped taking preorders for Tears of the Kingdom. The game had been available to preorder for $60 since last summer, so retailers may have wanted to stop the flood of orders at the lower price ahead of a potential announcement during today's Nintendo Direct.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Amazon is no longer taking Metroid Prime 4 preorders, which is rather significant considering the long-awaited sequel had been available to preorder for nearly <em>five </em>years at the $60 price point.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-might-cost-70/1100-6511291/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
