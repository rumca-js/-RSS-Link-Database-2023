<p>A researcher argues that animals understand how to live well better than their too-brainy counterparts</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche claimed that humankind was “a fantastic animal that has to fulfil one more condition of existence than any other animal”: we have to know why we exist. Justin Gregg, a researcher into animal behaviour and cognition, agrees, describing humankind as “the why specialists” of the natural world. Our need to know the reasons behind the things we see and feel distinguishes us from other animals, who make effective decisions without ever asking why the world is as it is.</p><p>Evidence of this unique aspect of our intelligence first appeared <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/11/earliest-known-cave-art-by-modern-humans-found-in-indonesia">44,000 years ago</a> in cave paintings of half-human, half-animal figures, supernatural beings that suggest we were asking religious questions: “Why am I here? And why do I have to die?” Twenty-thousand years later, we began planting crops, revealing an awareness of cause and effect – an understanding of how seeds germinate and what to do to keep them alive. Ever since then, our constant questioning of natural phenomena has led to great discoveries, from astronomy to evolution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/08/if-nietzsche-were-a-narwhal-by-justin-gregg-review-the-problem-with-human-intelligence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Without much support for Nathan Lyon the tourists may struggle to match their hosts’ mastery of spin on wickets prepared specifically for them in the four-Test series</p><p>India. Spin city. You know the drill. A visiting team rocks up, especially one from outside Asia, and gets greeted by tracks that turn as viciously as King Lear’s kids. The rule of thumb says that’s fair enough – teams are free to play in the conditions that suit them most, like Australia’s bouncy pitches or England’s seamers.</p><p>It does feel a little different when the curators play horticultural Frankenstein, stitching together disparate parts to become an incongruous whole. With the first Test in the Border-Gavaskar series about to start, it’s hard to draw any other conclusion from the images of the Nagpur ground staff watering the pitch outside the off stump for right-handed batters, of which India will probably play nine, while leaving it bare and dry outside the off stump for left-handers, of which Australia could play seven.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/australia-gear-up-for-pitch-battle-as-spin-again-looms-as-king-in-india">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The president touted many of his greatest achievements. But there are some areas he still needs to work on</p><p>It was President Biden’s first address to Congress since Republicans won control of the House, and unofficially, it was the start of his 2024 re-election campaign. Biden faced a newly adversarial audience at his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, a group of empowered Republicans clustered on the right side of the House chamber, each one eager to perform outrage for the cameras.</p><p>The speech, a strictly choreographed bit of political theater, was as much a competition of affective performance between the president and his Republican rivals as it was a set of policy proposals. Mostly, Biden won. The Republicans heckled and booed. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the QAnon conspiracist from Florida, bellowed at Biden in a big, fluffy fur coat, like Cruella De Vil; Kevin McCarthy, newly elected speaker after a long and humiliating Republican leadership contest, sulked pointedly in a chair behind the president. But Biden countered their flustered outrage with a cool, almost irreverent indifference.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/biden-state-of-the-union-unofficial-start-re-election-campaign">Continue reading...</a>
