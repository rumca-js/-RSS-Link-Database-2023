<p>Zoho is moving its Trident unified communications suite out of a private beta program and into public availability, marking the public launch of the company’s first native applications for that category of software.</p><p>Trident, according to the company, is designed to be a central communications and organizational hub for an organization’s workers to access email, instant messaging, phone and video calls, and perform task management and scheduling.</p><p>The level of integration is high, providing search capabilities across the entire suite — with the idea being to release workers from the responsibility of searching through mail, messaging and other apps individually — and a voice service that works across its Cliq collaboration app, Zoho Meeting conferencing, and even direct phone calls and SMS messages.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3687142/zoho-unveils-trident-unified-communications-platform-for-the-enterprise.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Yet more signals suggest Apple may be preparing to open hitherto closed elements of its ecosystem: both Google and Mozilla are working on iOS web browsers that don’t use WebKit, Apple’s rendering engine.</p><h2><strong>Mozilla and Google seem to be prepping</strong></h2>
<p>Mozilla’s GitHub repository now contains code for Firefox on iOS that uses the company’s <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/07/mozilla_google_apple_webkit/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">own Gecko rendering engine</a> rather than WebKit. And Google’s Chromium team is building an iOS browser that uses its own <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/04/google-working-on-browser-that-would-break-rules/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Blink code for rendering</a>. This is significant, since Apple insists all iOS browsers use its own rendering engine.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3687221/do-google-and-mozilla-know-something-about-apple-we-dont.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
