<p>Whimsical almost to the point of absurdity, this beautiful, meditative film about an Indian bird sanctuary is full of soul-transforming magic</p><p>The opening shot of All That Breathes (Sky Documentaries) comes into focus – a ground-level pan across an abandoned wasteland – and not since Pixar’s Ratatouille have so many squabbling vermin been granted so much cinematic dignity.</p><p>This is the Delhi of documentary film-maker Shaunak Sen, last captured in his 2015 Cities of Sleep doc about how “sleep mafias” have capitalised on homelessness in the Indian capital. That film was little-seen outside the festival circuit, but All That Breathes is already internationally recognised, nabbing the grand jury prize at Sundance, best documentary at Cannes, as well as Bafta and Oscar nominations. Now, thanks to this Sky Documentaries slot, an even wider audience can be confronted by the strange beauty of a thousand rats by moonlight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/08/all-that-breathes-review-every-minute-of-this-oscar-nominated-documentary-is-gold-dust">Continue reading...</a>

## Sancho snatches point for Manchester United against managerless Leeds

<p>The president can take pride in real achievements. Can he convince Americans to give him credit?</p><p>Few politicians manage, in Winston Churchill’s phrase, to make the weather. Joe Biden was particularly poorly placed to do so when he took office, inheriting a pandemic that was raging unchecked, a struggling economy and a crisis of democracy itself. War in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis soon followed; relations with Beijing continue to deteriorate, as last week’s row <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/05/now-the-chinese-spy-balloon-is-down-the-question-is-what-was-it-for">over the Chinese balloon</a> demonstrated.</p><p>The president’s achievements, laid out in Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/07/biden-sotu-what-to-expect">State of the Union address</a>, are striking, despite <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/inflation-reduction-children-families/index.html">disappointments along the way</a>. He passed an enormous stimulus package within weeks of taking office; showed real leadership with his climate change deal; and pushed through bipartisan legislation on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/16/america-is-moving-again-joe-biden-signs-hard-fought-1tn-infrastructure-deal-into-law">infrastructure</a>. Unemployment is at a five-decade low. But while he may be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/06/joe-biden-democratic-capitalism-changed-economic-paradigm-reagan-free-market">reshaping the economic paradigm</a>, he has not yet shifted the mood. Beaten down by rising prices, more than six in 10 Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/06/poll-americans-dont-feel-biden-impact/">think</a> he has achieved “not very much” or “little or nothing”. It may be, as the administration hopes, that measures such as capping insulin prices make themselves more fully felt in months to come. But hours before Mr Biden spoke, the boss of the Federal Reserve indicated it may have to keep raising interest rates to tackle inflation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-state-of-the-union-deft-politics-now-to-persuade-voters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Westminster raises its game for the Ukraine president who hadn’t come to the UK on a jolly</p><p>Just occasionally Westminster can raise its game. Though it usually takes someone from outside to make it happen. A British royal or a foreign head of state. But few visitors have been given the reception granted to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Not merely extended applause. But a sense of awe. A patriot for any age. An inspirational leader whose country has been at war for nearly a year and who hasn’t once gone missing. Not something we are used to in the UK. Here the nurses and the paramedics are out on strike and you don’t see our government for dust.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were crammed into Westminster Hall, waiting for Zelenskiy’s arrival. Standing room only. Near the front were those MPs who had skipped prime minister’s questions to make sure of a prime spot. Right at the front and in the middle, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer exchanged pleasantries. Behind them, Dominic Raab looked manic. Psycho eyes and bitten lips. He looked as if he was about to head-butt someone. The bullying investigation is taking its toll.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/08/standing-room-only-as-zelenskiy-delivers-a-lesson-in-leadership">Continue reading...</a>

## The Prevent review feeds a political lie: that fighting the far right lets Islamist terrorists off the hook | Sunder Katwala

<p>Many hoped for an impartial examination of the threat, what works and what doesn’t. Those hopes have been dashed</p><p>William Shawcross’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-prevents-report-and-government-response">review of Prevent</a> has been a long time coming. It was not only four years, but also four prime ministers ago that Theresa May’s government committed to an independent review. That had been championed by former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/05/key-points-from-david-anderson-report-on-handling-of-uk-terror-attacks">counter-terror reviewer</a> Lord Anderson as a way to defuse the polarised debates about the role of Prevent, and encourage more focus on the evidence of what worked in tackling extremism. But the Shawcross review will disappoint those hopes. It is already reheating and repolarising the debate around Prevent, engaging in a stale tug-of-war about which threats from extremism really matter.</p><p>The review concludes that Prevent’s definition of Islamist ideology has been “too narrow”, while the parameters of extreme right views have been “too broad”. Shawcross argues that “the most lethal threat in the last 20 years has come from Islamism, and this threat continues”. Pitting the two against each other in this way risks simply relitigating old arguments, as though efforts to contain one of these threats necessarily undermines the other. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox MP was murdered by a far-right terrorist, tells me that he has little doubt that Islamist-inspired terrorism is currently the most serious threat. “The question is whether in five or 10 years that will still be the case. Are increasing far-right referrals a sign of a growing problem or a temporary issue? Will the ‘incel’ movement become a bigger thing? We don’t know all the answers,” he says. It undermines legitimacy and trust if choices about which threat really matters sound like a fixed ideological position, rather than a response to the shifting intelligence.</p><p>Sunder Katwala is director of British Future and former general secretary of the Fabian Society</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/prevent-review-far-right-islamist-extremism-shawcross">Continue reading...</a>

The Qatari offer, the Mail claimed, would “blow the competition out of the water”. Qatari interest in United has been confirmed by the Guardian, with Jamie Jackson reporting that the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is interested in buying the club. However, he will not be blowing anyone out of the water and instead believes a £4.5bn valuation of United is fair, which is under the £6bn figure the Glazer family, who have owned United since 2005, are reportedly after.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/08/manchester-united-takeover-could-qatari-investors-realistically-buy-club">Continue reading...</a>

Having a killer title like sex, lies and videotape certainly raised eyebrows, but Soderbergh’s debut not only delivered on its seductive promise, but seemed to understand where human relationships might be headed in a future where the camera can act as a diary, a mediator and a tool for eroticism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/08/best-steven-soderbergh-movies-magic-mike">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have reached the age my father was when I first heard him described as ‘old’. What can I say? Except it’s better than the alternative</p><p>Of all the things to find triggering, T-shirts are a funny one. I mean the T-shirts bearing daft or clever – clever-dick? – slogans, maxims, aphorisms, puns and so on. You know the kind of thing: I might be wrong (but it’s highly unlikely); Football is my second favourite F word; Right wing. Left wing. Chicken wing. Etc. You see, I had a beautiful, troubled friend, my age, from Birmingham, who died too young. He had countless T-shirts of this kind, but his were always really good – annoyingly so. I said they made him look a smartarse. He said he didn’t mind because he was a bit of a smartarse. Now, whenever I see a T-shirt like that, I ask myself if it’s good enough for Guy to have worn. I’ve heard it said that people can have trouble recalling the faces of loved ones they have lost. I don’t have that problem with Guy; I see his face most days. But for some reason I can’t remember what was on any of his T-shirts. Odd that.</p><p>Today, I find myself doubly triggered by a T-shirt, an ad for which popped up on my social media. This one brings another loved one into the picture – my dad. It reads: “It’s weird being the same age as old people.” Ain’t that the truth? This garment would have made it to Guy’s wardrobe, no question.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/age-has-caught-up-with-me-and-it-feels-appalling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I call Kareem a horseman as the word cowboy has racist connotations. It’s what enslavers called Black horse handlers – whereas white handlers were cowhands’</p><p>I came across Philadelphia’s <a href="http://fsurc.com/">Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club</a> online. Black horsemen hadn’t really seeped into the public consciousness at that time, but as soon as I found a picture of a black man standing on a horse, I started researching further so as to figure out the context. It was 2014 and I was a broke graduate, so I couldn’t afford to do a project about it. But after a commission<a href="https://nowgallery.co.uk/exhibitions/intimate-spaces"> for London’s Now Gallery</a>, I finally was able to fly out to the US in 2016.</p><p>It was my first time in the country and, halfway through my two weeks there, Trump was elected. Part of me really likes the US and part of me dislikes it. I don’t think the UK is particularly great in terms of how our government treats the people, but the US is on another level. There is a sense of abandonment. People are left to fall through the cracks at a much faster rate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/08/kareem-philadelphia-horseman-cowboy-idris-elba-cian-oba-smiths-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Channel 4 programme was meant to be innocent fun for preteens, but its performances soon made it notorious as some of the worst TV ever. Although its (now grownup) stars disagree …</p><p>Forty years ago today, at 6pm on a Tuesday evening, Channel 4 screened the first episode of a new children’s television show called Minipops. It promised to showcase talented preteens singing pop covers, which sounds anodyne and inoffensive. It proved to be anything but.</p><p>The girls, plastered in makeup and as young as seven or eight, wore costumes ranging from chiffon nightwear to short skirts and high boots. The boys wore denim and leather, often with bare chests. Iffy song choices resulted in sights such as a small child singing: “Night time is the right time, we make love.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/08/it-wasnt-designed-for-people-with-perverted-minds-how-kids-show-minipops-scandalised-britain">Continue reading...</a>

The involvement of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney from That Los Angeles, in and of itself, usually guarantees nothing more than laboured cinematic allusion, celluloid punning and Metro-Goldwyn metaphor.

<p>Footballers, coaches and scientists give their views on whether lethal strikers are born or bred</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/benwelch82?lang=en">Ben Welch</a> for <a href="https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/">The Blizzard</a></p><p>Goalscorers are special. Fans worship them, managers count on them and that gorgeous, frosted-tipped goal machine staring back from the mirror loves them unconditionally. In fairness, there is substance to this inflated perception. They’re the match-winners. The top selling shirt in the club shop. The most expensive player on the pitch. According to this fraternity of goalscoring deities, no one, no matter how many hours they put in on the training ground can do what they do: put the spherical leather object into the net. Because it’s something they alone were born to do – and yet one look at the current Premier League scoring charts suggests otherwise.</p><p>With the obvious exception of Erling Haaland, forwards, wingers and midfielders are the ones monopolising football’s most revered statistic. Even full-backs are starting to get in on the act. So in the modern era of prolific false nines and inverted wingers, does the idea of “a natural-born goalscorer” still ring true? Or can the skill be developed on the training ground with the guidance of a specialist coach? I spoke to players, coaches and neuroscientists to find out whether goalscorers are born or bred.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/08/goalscorers-natural-nurtured-footballers-coaches-scientists-strikers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In Netflix romcom You People, the two leads allegedly share a CGI kiss at the end, a strange forewarning of what big stars might demand in the future</p><p>As a film, Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/you-people-movie-review-netflix-jonah-hill-eddie-murphy-julia-louis-dreyfus">You People</a> raises all manner of questions. Questions like “Do we really need an update of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner in 2023?” and “Shouldn’t a 2023 remake of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner have more to say than this?” and “Shouldn’t the leads of an expensive streaming romcom have more chemistry than Jonah Hill and Lauren London, two actors who for much of the film look like strangers who literally just met in an elevator and don’t particularly like each other very much?”</p><p>But the question “Did they actually kiss?” probably shouldn’t be one of those questions. Because, after all, we can see that they do. Right at the end, Hill and London get married, and they lean into each other, and they kiss. Confetti falls from the sky and lands on them. A supporting character even negatively critiques the kiss, pointing out that Jonah Hill is using more tongue than is generally considered acceptable. Regardless of anything else you think about the film, which should be a lot because it isn’t very good, they kiss at the end. They definitely kiss.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/08/cgi-kissing-you-people-movie-jonah-hill-lauren-london-kiss">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The young asylum seekers I work with are vulnerable and often traumatised – yet hostile officials see them as ‘not real victims’   </p><p>In recent months, it has been exhausting and dispiriting to see the British government demonising Albanian asylum seekers. For several years now, formerly as a barrister and now as a legal support worker, I’ve worked with Albanian asylum-seeking children and young people. The anti-Albanian rhetoric of politicians and media figures has been deeply misleading and unfathomably cruel. And the Home Office’s current anti-Albanian campaign is going to cost lives.</p><p>One of the most toxic narratives has been the idea that Albanian boys and men, as opposed to girls and women, aren’t “real” victims and aren’t in need of protection. This assumption is false. I’ve worked with many Albanian boys and young men who came to the UK as unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. They are exceptionally vulnerable. Many have been trafficked, either within Albania or from Albania to the UK or other European countries into forced labour or forced criminality, and severely abused. Most are from deprived backgrounds and some have suffered childhood domestic violence. The overwhelming majority have post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and some have other disabilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/albanian-children-britain-home-office-asylum-seekers">Continue reading...</a>

## Punishing rape-revenge drama Irréversible has been recut – but why?

<p>Gaspar Noé’s grim provocation is returning to select US cinemas but the ‘straight cut’ is a supplementary curio at best</p><p>There is no question that Gaspar Noé’s Irréversible belongs on the shortest of short lists for the most provocative film of the current century, a rape-revenge scenario told in reverse chronology and geared toward maximum visceral impact. As much talk has revolved around its two signature sequences – one a nauseating plunge into a gay BDSM club called The Rectum, the other a nine-minute sexual assault with the camera almost literally bolted to the floor – words alone can’t account for theatrical experience of seeing it 20 years ago. It felt like a nerve-jangling shot to the solar plexus, especially in the first half, when Noé buttresses the action with tilt-a-whirl imagery, speaker-rattling bass notes in the score and even strobe lighting in the credits. He wants you in a highly suggestive state.</p><p>Now, it’s possible for moviegoers in select cities to have that experience again, but with one a giant, sun-sized asterisk. Irréversible: Straight Cut reorders the events clockwise, which is a ruinous idea on par with The Godfather Saga, the 1977 TV miniseries that fused The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in chronological order over four nights, laying waste to the powerful flashback structure of the latter film. For one, the disorienting effect of reversing time and front-loading the most traumatic sequences is lost, dramatically minimizing the motion-sickness of its initial descent. Beyond that, the bleakness of Noé’s thesis statement, “Time destroys all things,” is still better demonstrated by turning back the clock and learning later what its characters have lost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/08/irreversible-movie-theater-gaspar-noe-straight-cut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The animation is superb, there’s a cracking action scene and the Botoxed gods are great, but the plot is too fiddly for its young audience </p><p>The film-makers behind this chirpy family animation have clearly decided that what have been lacking in the hero department of Greek mythology are cute furry creatures. The star of their ancient Greece-set adventure is a brave little mouse called Pattie, who happens to live in the same seaside town as Jason, that mighty human of Argonauts fame. These days, Jason is a doddery old duffer so, when Poseidon, god of the sea, steals the golden fleece and threatens mayhem and destruction, it’s plucky pipsqueak Pattie to the rescue.</p><p>There is nothing to complain about in the animation here from French studio TAT Productions: the cobbled streets and crystal-clear waves of the Aegean sea are gorgeous, like Mamma Mia! for kids. And there is a cracking action sequence near the start involving an elite squad of highly trained ninja rats pulling off a raid on a fruit and veg market. But the plot – like so many movies aimed at young kids – is unnecessarily fiddly, with details that will sail over the heads of most five-year-olds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/08/epic-tails-review-greek-myths-get-a-furry-makeover-in-giggle-free-animation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not often that athletes are still active, let alone still dominant, while receiving their flowers. Let us now praise the NBA’s newly minted scoring king</p><p></p><p>There are numerous contributing factors to what makes it so very difficult, as human beings, to appreciate that which is special in real time. For starters, valuing the finite nature of anything brings into sharper focus our own finiteness, the fleetingness of our own mortal existence, and for obvious reasons, that’s something we’d generally rather not dwell upon. Beyond that, modern life passes by at a frenetic pace, and most days are spent just trying to weather the chaos. Most special, resonant, or important people or events, for that reason, are more easily appreciated in retrospect: at a healthy distance, the rose-colored glass of the rearv-iew mirror highlighting everything that was once muddled by the chaos of life and made harder to see at the time.</p><p>But it’s a worthy exercise in mindfulness, perhaps, to try to take stock of that which is here now, the gold which cannot stay. Such an opportunity arises this week as LeBron James, the face of the NBA whom many with knowledge on the subject argue to be the greatest player of all time, broke a record that was long believed to be unbreakable: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/lebron-james-nba-all-time-leading-scorer-record-basketball">passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> to become the league’s all-time leading scorer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/lebron-james-tribute-scoring-record-kareem-abdul-jabbar">Continue reading...</a>

The documentary lays out the evidence for the argument that the anti-Muslim bigotry that characterises India today is rooted in Narendra Modi’s alleged decision to rein in the police in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/28/gujarat-narendra-modi-massacre-inquiry-india">Gujarat in 2002</a>, giving anti-Muslim rioters a free hand, leading to the killing of hundreds of people.</p><p>The first part explores the 2002 pogrom as the ideological foundation of Modi’s power and political persona. The second part surveys the actions of Modi’s government after his re-election in 2019, and tries to show how both formal policy and informal violence have been deployed by the state to reduce Muslims to second-class citizens. It was the documentary’s unequivocal framing of India’s recent history as “Modi v India’s Muslims” that has infuriated Modi’s government.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/narendra-modi-anti-muslim-strongman-global-leader-india-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Being Funny in a Foreign Language is the band’s direct response to overproduced, commercial electronic pop. They deserve the Brit award for album of the year</p><p>There’s something that naturally happens when you’re over 30 and working in the UK music industry. You’ll be at the gig of a new hype artist, listening to fairly innocuous songs about situationships, boys not calling you back and TikTok and think: “Cool – I finally aged out of this.”</p><p>Every generation has this rite of passage – of becoming too past it for most youth culture, and passing the baton backwards to those younger, freer and less experienced. With that being said, I also think that a lot of British pop music nowadays is made for reality TV, iPlayer adverts and the gym. It’s not the actual content of the music that disturbs me but the surface level lyricism, which often only grasps at the emptiest parts of modern existence, of our loneliness and lack of connection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/08/being-funny-in-a-foreign-language-the-1975-brit-award">Continue reading...</a>

But what he enjoyed most of all was to talk, particularly about himself.</p><p>Even 18 months ago, eaten by the cancer that eventually led to his death on Wednesday, two days short of his 88th birthday, Blazevic gave a lengthy interview for the documentary <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/watch/movie/74v2TCBHGqFB6l22chV7cb">Croatia: Defining a Nation</a>, and his part in leading the country to third place at the 1998 World Cup.

(This is a <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy">pretty comprehensive breakdown</a> of what she has publicly said.) As someone who unequivocally supports trans rights, Rowling’s comments have soured and complicated my relationship with Harry Potter – and I am far from alone.</p><p>Discussions of the ethics of buying the game have generated thousands of tweets, many loudly calling for a boycott, others wrestling with financially supporting it. (Rowling played no part in its creation; developer Avalanche <a href="https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us/faq">consulted closely with her team</a>.) The discourse made it on to BBC Radio 4 last week, and has been covered by the Times, the Mail and Sky – another beat in the endless media culture war that trans people have been subjected to.

<p>US medical system is a gruesome house of horrors in Patrick Lussier’s macabre and surprisingly effective film</p><p>The US medical system proves a house of horrors in Patrick Lussier’s macabre and surprisingly effective thriller in which skint criminal forensics student Chloe (Bailee Madison) and brother TJ (Anthony Turpel) are on the verge of being evicted from their house, their dad’s life insurance having been invalidated because he killed himself. TJ and Chloe’s ex, Ross (Chris Lee), decide to steal the money the family needs, but the latter is gunned down during the robbery. When the siblings realise that Ross’s mobile phone, full of evidence that will incriminate TJ, is in police hands, Chloe has to find a way into the morgue where it has been logged.</p><p>If you can overcome the basic implausibility – that the two dudes would be daft enough to plan a heist on a phone, that Chloe would volunteer to inject propofol to “play dead” to gain entry, that the city employs coroners unable to tell anaesthetised people from dead ones – there’s plenty to appreciate in this rattling cat’n’mouse runaround. In fact the coroner (Jerry O’Connell) on duty is a bit too good at his job, running a lucrative sideline in organ theft on the side and justifying it in terms of social-engineering away society’s bottom feeders. As he tells Chloe, strapped to a gurney: “All that you are, all that you’ve done, is worth considerably less than the sum of your parts.”</p><p>Play Dead is available on the Icon Film Channel on 13 February and released in cinemas on 17 March.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/08/play-dead-review-fake-corpse-and-organ-theft-in-thorax-cracking-if-implausible-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guardian exclusive: AI tools rate photos of women as more sexually suggestive than those of men, especially if nipples, pregnant bellies or exercise is involved</p><p>Images posted on social media are analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that decide what to amplify and what to suppress. Many of these algorithms, a Guardian investigation has found, have a gender bias, and may have been censoring and suppressing the reach of countless photos featuring women’s bodies.</p><p>These AI tools, developed by large technology companies, including Google and Microsoft, are meant to protect users by identifying violent or pornographic visuals so that social media companies can block it before anyone sees it. The companies claim that their AI tools can also detect “raciness” or how sexually suggestive an image is. With this classification, platforms – including Instagram and LinkedIn – may suppress contentious imagery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/biased-ai-algorithms-racy-women-bodies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Van der Merwe’s wonder try for Scotland on Saturday bore all the hallmarks of a very familiar problem for England</p><p>The size of the task facing England’s new defence coach Kevin Sinfield has been laid bare, just one match into the Steve Borthwick era. Four tries <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/04/england-scotland-six-nations-report">conceded against Scotland</a> but moreover a collective disjointedness and the return of some familiar problems that will send alarm bells ringing.</p><p>Eddie Jones employed three defence coaches – Brett Hodgson’s briefest of tenures notwithstanding – in Paul Gustard, John Mitchell and Anthony Seibold. Each had their moments, Gustard’s on the 2016 tour of Australia while Mitchell’s messages seemed to be landing in late 2020 and Seibold can point to the third Test against the Wallabies last summer. But some of Scotland’s tries last Saturday exposed long-standing fault lines evident while Mitchell and Seibold were employed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/england-six-nations-rugby-union-first-phase-failings-the-defensive-pattern-sinfield-must-break">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For Valentine’s, or really any other day, here are some works by poets from Plath to Rilke that express some of our own most intimate feelings</p><p>Love makes poets out of all of us. The few who feel intimidated or embarrassed about writing out our love and longing often take recourse to sending lyric-heavy songs, or selections from a poem (like those included here), just to let the object of our affection know how they make us feel. As someone who is constantly moved by love and reckless enough to publicly write about it, I’ve also often relied on sending other people’s poems to reveal my own feelings.</p><p>An added benefit to only dating people on the broad left is that you soon realise that the poets who have authored the most revolutionary lines have also penned the most romantic verses. I think this is because in so many ways love is the entry-point to the vision for a just society – if we have to imagine a better world, we must begin from love.</p><p>I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed<br />And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.<br />(I think I made you up inside my head.)</p><p>What are you when you leave your man<br />Wanting? What am I now that I think so fondly<br />Of airplanes? What’s my name, whose is it, while we<br />Make love. My lover leaves me with words I wish<br />To write. Flies from one side of a nation to the outside<br />Of our world.</p><p>Either way, we’ll have to learn <br />to bear the weight of the eventuality <br />that we will lose each other to something.<br />So why not begin now, while your head <br />rests like a perfect moon in my lap, <br />and the dogs on the beach are howling?</p><p>Soaping together<br />is sacred to us. <br />Washing each other’s shoulders. <br />You can fuck <br />anyone – but with whom can you sit <br />in water?</p><p>“Tell me how men kiss you, <br />Tell me how you kiss men.”<br />[…] Oh, I know: his delight <br />Is the tense and passionate knowledge <br />That he needs nothing, <br />That I can refuse him nothing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/08/top-10-love-poems-valentines-day-meena-kandasamy-the-book-of-desire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At work and at home, we spend hour after hour sitting, staring at screens or fiddling with our phones – and our hunched, twisted bodies bear the marks. Let’s get things straight again</p><p>‘If I was to draw a straight line across the left shoulder and the right shoulder, there’s about an inch difference. Your spine is twisted – you’re twisting it both directions. Look how that right foot is coming out slightly … You’ll notice that your knees are also coming in, there’s a slight knock knee going on on both sides – that’s because you’re also tilting forwards. So your pelvis is not only twisting, it’s also tilted.”</p><p>After five minutes walking on the treadmill in consultant biomechanist Tim King’s clinic, <a href="http://www.cionewellnesscentre.com/">Cione Wellness</a>, the news doesn’t sound brilliant. King works with world-class athletes and, thankfully, helps ordinary people with musculoskeletal and pelvic pain too.

<p>Violence simmers beneath restrained prose in the follow-up to Stay With Me, a portrait of domestic strife and political tensions in Nigeria</p><p>As with her lauded debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/09/stay-with-me-by-ayobami-adebayo-review">Stay With Me</a>, in Ayòbámi Adébáyò’s second novel domestic strife and the political tensions of modern Nigeria bristle against each other. Early in A Spell of Good Things, we encounter the protagonist Eniolá’s father staring at an almost empty tin of garri. Racked with shame at the poverty his family now find themselves in, Baba Eniolá scratches at the grains in the pot. How might such a meagre portion stretch to feed four mouths? A neighbour’s noisy radio intrudes on his spiralling despair with news of voter registration schemes. Baba Eniolá cannot help but glance at the vicious scar, running from his wrist to his elbow, acquired in the run-up to previous elections when his links to one of the candidates proved almost fatal.</p><p>Violence in multiple guises – political, domestic, psychic – simmers beneath the surface of the often restrained prose. In Eniolá, it manifests as a repressed rage. We first meet him as an obedient, able 16-year-old whose academic aspirations are dashed when an ill-advised government initiative promoting “progress” sees the sacking of all state history teachers, leaving his father out of work and his mother searching dunghills for used bottles to resell. Adébáyò empathically tracks Eniolá’s bleak downward trajectory as he falls in with “local hoodlums”, showing how the sustained indignities of disfranchisement and tarnished masculine pride lead him to make destructive decisions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/08/a-spell-of-good-things-by-ayobami-adebayo-review-a-nation-in-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

She presented popular children’s programmes, was lavishly paid and mingled with influential media figures in Beijing. But by 2017, she had been designated a terrorist and placed on China’s most wanted list. The next year, 24 of her family members disappeared in a single night, into the black hole of state detention.</p><p>A Stone Is Most Precious Where It Belongs is Hoja’s account of that dizzying journey from local celebrity to exiled activist living in the permanent shadow of a superpower’s revenge.

You’d do well to start with a bird flu. Bird flus are responsible for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm">all the known flu pandemics</a>: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war">great influenza that started more than a century ago</a>, “Asian flu”, “Hong Kong flu” and “Russian flu”, which killed tens of millions between them. They also cause many of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/influenza-deaths">annual outbreaks</a> that slaughter hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>Once you have found a suitable variant, two further components are required to weaponise it. The first is an amplifier. The best amplifier is a giant shed or factory in which thousands of birds are packed. These birds should be genetically homogenous, so that your viral strain can travel freely between them. Intensive poultry farms would serve very well.

Here is what you really need to know about travel, masks and toilet paper orientation</p><p>Have you noticed that nobody seems able to behave properly any more? The pandemic, along with modern technology, has caused some of us to forget how to interact with others completely. See, for example, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/23/air-rage-during-the-pandemic-where-it-is-and-isnt-happening-.html">rising incidents of air rage</a>.</p><p>New York magazine has certainly noticed all this: the media outlet recently published a viral list of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/tipping-rules-etiquette-rules.html">140 rules of modern etiquette</a> to help people navigate our brave new world. Unfortunately, a lot of the rules on the list were somewhat <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-cut-etiquette-guide-new-rules-b2275588.html">deranged</a> and seemingly aimed at people who spend their days mingling with celebrities, attending “ironic birthday parties” and dropping in on gatherings where the hosts put out large bowls of cigarettes as party favours. In other words, not very useful for those of us who lead rather more mundane lives. So, you’ll be thrilled to know, I’ve helpfully put together my own list of rules for modern life that everybody should follow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/dont-ring-the-doorbell-but-do-clear-up-after-your-dog-an-everyday-guide-to-modern-etiquette">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite the best cameo efforts of Dannii Minogue, Krew Boylan’s passion project is too frantic and narcissistic to convince</p><p>This Australian movie is a colourful comedy of romance and finding yourself, and it’s clearly a personal project for its writer-star Krew Boylan. I sat down to it hoping for something like Muriel’s Wedding, the film that first introduced us to Toni Collette but unfortunately, there’s something a bit frantic and narcissistic about it: a film that doesn’t quite convince you to care enough about its characters or what they care about.</p><p>Red, played by Boylan, is a young woman who is employed in an estate agent’s office and pretty hopeless at the job because, in her goofy and adorable way, her real passion is Dolly Parton: imitating her, studying her and obsessing over her. She’s also a bit self-conscious about being redheaded and flat-chested. But Red finds herself hanging out at a drag/impersonation club, presided over by “Elvis Presley” (a rather self-aware Rose Byrne), where she gets to try out her Dolly act. Before too long, her Dolly avatar is a hit, and she has a double act with “Kenny Rogers” (Daniel Webber) with whom she becomes romantically involved in real life.</p><p>Seriously Red is released on 13 February on digital platforms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/08/seriously-red-review-australian-comedy-puts-dolly-parton-tribute-act-centre-stage">Continue reading...</a>

The next day I asked him to take me to a 12-step meeting</p><p>When I left Ireland in 1993, I followed a route already well-worn by other Irish immigrants, carrying two suitcases, $500 and a one-way ticket to New York City. I had been raised, one of nine children, on a housing estate just outside Dublin. The daily backdrop was one of rising unemployment and the escalating violence in Northern Ireland. I was 20 years old. I had a job in a clothes shop in town. On the bus to work, I jotted down poems and daydreamed about a different life. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of a visa lottery, I made a break and bolted.</p><p>Back then, family history and the history of Ireland were of little interest to me. Instead, there was kinship among the immigrant kids of the East Village. We worked in the cafes and bars, met up after our shifts and talked into the night over cigarettes and wine. With anonymity came an intoxicating sense of freedom – and other intoxicants, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/08/a-moment-that-changed-me-a-stranger-told-me-of-his-alcohol-problem-and-i-realised-i-had-one-too">Continue reading...</a>

## Donatello review – the Robert Mapplethorpe of the Renaissance

<p><strong>V&amp;A, London<br /></strong>Everywhere you look, Donatello breaks the rules at this showcase of some of his most sublime sculptures</p><p>A god with his trousers down dances maniacally. This bronze statue, known as Attis-Amorino, is blinded by ecstasy, his willy hanging out, waving his hands in the air as he raves. He’s got a poppy flower in his hair and poppy seedpods on his belt. These, the catalogue reassures us, symbolise the family for which the Florentine Renaissance sculptor Donatello made this in about 1435 to 1440. But opium has been extracted from poppies since early times and the seeds represented unconsciousness for ancient Greek and Romans. Clearly, this little deity is off his head on something.</p><p>This is one of the most confounding sculptures ever created. Many may walk past it quickly, preferring to look – and be seen looking – at the Madonnas that fill much of this exhibition. For Attis-Amorino is, as we say nowadays, problematic. Go behind it and you will see shiny buttocks peeping out of those falling trousers. Yet if we are anxious about such a work of art, that is because it’s still doing its job after more than 580 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/08/donatello-review-v-and-a-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The artist reflects on her storied career amid the launch of a retrospective at New York’s Museum of Modern Art </p><p>Ever since she arrived in New York from Detroit in the early 1970s, Ming Smith says, she’s led an aesthetically rich, if not always financially secure, life. “There was no way to support yourself as an artist back then,” recalls the photographer. “I did it for the love, for the legacy; it was what my life stood for.”</p><p>This month, visitors to the Museum of Modern Art in New York will be able to see a little of that legacy. The new exhibition, Projects: Ming Smith, goes deep into Smith’s archive to draw together images of seminal jazz musicians, such as Pharoah Sanders and Sun Ra, alongside quasi-documentary images of important sites of Black culture, such as New York’s African Burial Ground, as well as more fluid, impressionistic works, including her August Wilson series, a tribute to the playwright. All these images blur, both figuratively and literally (Smith favours hazy, long exposures), into a body of work in which it’s hard to distinguish the artist behind the camera from the surrounding culture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/08/ming-smith-moma-exhibition-photography">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The NHS turns 75 this year, but as waiting lists for appointments grow, increasing numbers of patients are looking elsewhere for healthcare. Denis Campbell reports</p><p>When <strong>Danielle Mitchell</strong> began getting blinding headaches, the pain affected her life to such an extent that she couldn’t leave the house and she stopped answering the phone to friends. A trip to her GP resulted in a referral to an NHS neurologist. But there was a problem: she’d need to wait 31 weeks. In despair, she counted up some money she’d been given as birthday and Christmas presents and sought out an appointment with private specialist.</p><p>It’s a story that is being replicated across the country amid huge NHS waiting lists; a legacy of the pandemic, but also a hangover from years of staff shortages and underinvestment and now compounded by cancellations due to strikes. As the Guardian’s health policy editor, <strong>Denis Campbell</strong>, tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal</strong>, private healthcare in the UK is something neither patients nor practitioners feel particularly comfortable talking about. For patients it can feel like queue jumping and for doctors a betrayal of the NHS that trained them. But as it becomes more and more common as a healthcare option, it could have long-term political implications and undermine the NHS’s founding promise: free to those who need it at the point of use.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/feb/08/people-uk-turning-to-private-healthcare-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
