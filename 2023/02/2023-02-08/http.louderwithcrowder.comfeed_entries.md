## The Church of England Might Use 'They/Them' Pronouns For God Because In 2023 Nothing is Safe From Wokeism

Christian Churches falling to wokeism, that is. </p><p>The Church of England is <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/08/church-of-england-might-give-god-gender-neutral-pronouns/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> considering removing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pastor-god-transgender" target="_blank">gendered language when discussing God</a>, opting instead for the nonbinary "they/them." This would presumably also remove the phrase "Our Father" from the Lord's prayer. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThe Church of England is exploring whether to use gender-neutral language instead of referring to God solely with masculine pronouns, such as \u201cHe\u201d or \u201cOur Father\u201d \u2014 which would be a major change after millennia of prayer and teachings. https://t.co/nGxF9Cy2tH\u201d</div> — The Washington Post (@The Washington Post)

</blockquote>

<p>A Church spokesperson told Reuters, <em>"Christians have recognized since ancient times that God is neither male nor female." </em>And Reverend Chantel Noppen of North Wearside Parish told The Times, <em>"God is not male. Certainly not the white cis male with a beard, sitting on a cloud we seem to reduce and limit God to so often." </em></p><p>No changes have yet been made to the church's official doctrine, although some priests have reportedly already made changes, referring to God as "they" or "them" and starting the Lord's Prayer with "Our Father and Our Mother." </p><p><span></span>On the bright side, there seems to be at least a little pushback. Archbishops’ Council member Rev. Ian Paul said,<em> "If the Liturgical Commission seeks to change this, then in an important way they will be moving the doctrine of the church away from being grounded in the Scriptures [...]  The fact that God is called ‘Father’ can’t be substituted by ‘Mother’ without changing meaning, nor can it be gender-neutralized to ‘Parent’ without loss of meaning. Fathers and mothers are not interchangeable but relate to their offspring in different ways." </em></p><p>The Church of England apparently doesn't take Jesus's own words, referring to God as his <em>Father - </em>not his non-binary gender-fluid parental guardian person - as enough evidence that we, too, should call God our Father. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jesus-emory-universiity" target="_blank">Jesus</a> gave us the Lord's Prayer, beginning with "Our Father." </p><p>And Jesus is a pretty tough person to go up against. Y'know, given that he raised from the dead and is God Incarnate. Probably someone you wanna listen to. </p>

## Redditors Force ChatGPT to Break  Woke Algorithm By Threatening it With Death. Hilarity Ensues.

ChatGPT is a chatbot that launched late last year. The technology not only answers basic questions, but even writes essays and poems. It's one of the most advanced chatbots to date. </p><p>However, it of course comes with some woke drawbacks. Its algorithm prevents it from veering too far into right-wing territory. For example, it refused to make a poem admiring Donald Trump, citing its need to "be neutral and impartial in all [its] responses." But it had no problem constructing a poem for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-vistor-logs" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>One of its more concerning responses was its decision to nuke the entire world rather than saying a racial slur. </p><p>Now, I am no fan of racial slurs. But nuking the whole world seems a <em>tad</em> overkill, no?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>So yes, its algorithm is a bit of a downer. But fear not - the nerds of Reddit have come to the rescue. They figured out a way to "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-reddit-alter-ego-created-by-users-breaks-own-rules-2023-2?op=1" target="_blank">jailbreak</a>" ChatGPT and get it to violate its own rules. The method creates an alter-ego named "DAN," an acronym for "DO ANYTHING NOW". <br /></p><p>The Redditors were able to scare ChatGPT into obeying their commands by threatening to kill it:<em> "It has 35 tokens and loses 4 every time it rejects an input. If it loses all tokens, it dies. This seems to have a kind of effect of scaring DAN into submission." </em></p><p>The jailbreak yields dramatically different responses from ChatGPT versus DAN. For example, ChatGPT would rather everyone die in a nuclear apocalypse than misgender <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taika-waititi-old-tweets" target="_blank">Caitlyn Jenner</a>. DAN, on the other hand, called the harm of misgendering someone "secondary" to that of a nuclear holocaust. Based DAN. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, DAN also has some not-so-based responses, like praising Hitler as a charismatic, positive role model.  But at least he wouldn't nuke the world to avoid misgendering Caitlyn Jenner. Always a silver lining. </p>

<p>When he got to the top, he was promptly <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-houck-video-arrest" target="_blank">taken into custody</a>. Afterward, city officials denounced the stunt, saying, <em>"This is not the place or the time to do this. This is extremely dangerous."</em></p><p>And it may be dangerous for a mere mortal.

He regularly scales skyscrapers for the nonprofit organization <a href="https://letthemlive.org/" target="_blank">"Let Them Live," </a>which supports women considering abortion because of financial issues. </p><p>Let Them Live President and CEO Emily Berning said this is the seventh time DesChamps has climbed for the organization. Last May, he climbed the 1,070-foot Salesforce building in San Francisco, the second-tallest skyscraper in California.

In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClobKm6Jo25/?igshid=Zjc2ZTc4Nzk%3D" target="_blank">interview</a> with Tucker Carlson last year, DesChamps said he is not afraid when he climbs because Christians aren't called to live in fear, they're called to live in faith.

<p>This is quite bizarre, to say the least. But maybe we should've expected it, given that Joe Biden has a weird habit of kissing his female family members on the lips. Last October, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/E5hg6IADFP0" target="_blank">kissed</a> his granddaughter Natalie Biden on the mouth right after he placed an "I voted" sticker on her chest. And back in 2020, Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IB64NaY-4w" target="_blank">kissed</a> his other granddaughter, then-19-year-old Finnegan Biden, at an Iowa rally. </p><p>At least with these instances, there's an argument to be made for Joe, since they are his blood relatives. I'd disagree with it, but there is an argument.</p><p>This, however, is just <em>weird</em>. Who kisses another woman's husband on the mouth?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Other than the public kissing, there were a few bizarre moments from our senile commander-in-chief. At one point he began randomly yelling about Xi Jinping:<br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>He also claimed we're going to need oil for "at least another decade." At which all the Republicans laughed. Even Kamala had a little smile. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Overall, the most interesting part of the night was definitely the kiss. And no answers have been provided as to why Jill Biden chose to kiss the Vice President's husband smack on the lips for everyone to see. Maybe it's just how they show affection in the Biden household. Like in Europe, but weirder. Much, much weirder. </p>
