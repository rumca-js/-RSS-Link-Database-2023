## Microsoft Edgeâ€™s simple PDF reader is being replaced by Adobe Acrobat

<p>Like its rivals, Microsoft&rsquo;s Edge browser sports a built-in PDF reader that&rsquo;s bare-bones but functional. You click a PDF link and a tab opens with the document that you can read, search, and lightly annotate. But that experience is getting supercharged: Microsoft and Adobe have teamed up to bring Adobe Acrobat to Edge, in what will become a wholesale replacement of the browser&rsquo;s current PDF engine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This move will enable more features when viewing PDFs from the web, like markup tools, stronger security for PDFs, and greater accessibility (e.g., read-aloud narration). The increase in Edge&rsquo;s PDF capabilities will be native, without the need to install a separate add-on. </p>



<p>Users with an Adobe subscription will still need to install a browser extension to access additional advanced features like text and image editing, PDF conversion, and file merging. You can see a simulation of the interface in the embedded video below.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The changeover arrives in March 2023, when the revamped PDF technology becomes available for Windows 10 and 11 users. Organizations with managed devices can opt-in on their own schedule, with the legacy engine set to be retired in March 2024.</p>

<p>Bitdefender is well-known to consumers for its antivirus software, but it&rsquo;s a relative newcomer in the password manager space. That&rsquo;s apparent in its Bitdefender Password Manager app. While it offers essential tools for generating, managing, and auditing your login credentials, it lacks the organizational capabilities, business features, and family support you find in more established password managers like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407079/lastpass-review-this-virtual-vault-makes-password-protection-effortless.html">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398233/keeper-password-manager-review.html">Keeper</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407081/dashlane-review-this-password-manager-makes-you-smarter-about-security.html">Dashlane</a>.</p>



<p>You need a Bitdefender account to download and activate its password manager. Once you log in, you&rsquo;re prompted to create a master password. Bitdefender immediately evaluates its strength and generates a recovery key that allows you to recover your data if you forget your master password. You&rsquo;re instructed to download a PDF containing this key and store it securely. Anytime you change your master password, Bitdefender generates a new recovery key.</p>



<p>From there, you just need to download the password manager. There&rsquo;s no standalone app or web interface for desktop use, only a browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Opera and alternative browsers like Brave and Vivaldi aren&rsquo;t currently supported.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">best password managers</a> for information about competing products, what to look for in a password manager, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bitdefender Password Manager" class="wp-image-1501572" height="706" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bitdfender-password-manager.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Bitdefender Password Manager extension lets you generate secure passwords, secure browsing sessions, and manage your personal and credit card information.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>



<p>You can import passwords from several password manager apps and browsers, including 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane, Sticky Password, Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. I exported my data from LastPass as a CSV file and then imported it to Bitdefender&rsquo;s app using a simple drag-and-drop interface without a hitch. Bitdefender also supports transferring data in JSON, XML, TXT, 1pif, and FSK formats.</p>



<p>All the critical features you&rsquo;d expect in a consumer password manager are here. Bitdefender can auto-save your login credentials and payment cards, autofill your details, generate secure passwords, and identify weak, leaked, old, and duplicate passwords. The app can auto-capture usernames and passwords as you log in to sites, or you can add new accounts manually. In the latter case, you have the option of auto-generating a secure password of up to 32 characters, evaluating password strength, adding notes, enabling auto-login, and marking it as a favorite account, all within the same window.</p>



<p>Despite being limited to a small extension window, the app interface is straightforward to use. It&rsquo;s divided into tabs for viewing your accounts, the password generator, your security report, and instantly securing your browsing. Additional options, including payment method and identity information as well as app settings, can be found in the main menu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Bitdefender Password Manager is a straightforward solution for managing your passwords, payment card details, and identity information. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Given Bitdefender&rsquo;s background in home and business cybersecurity solutions, it&rsquo;s no surprise its password manager uses the latest, military standard, cryptographic algorithms&mdash;AES-256-CCM, SHA512, BCRYPT, HTTPS, and WSS&mdash;to encrypt the transmission of your data. All data is encrypted and decrypted locally on your device so no one but you, not even Bitdefender, can access your information.</p>



<p>As an introductory offer, Bitdefender is currently offering annual subscriptions for its password manager for $19.99 for the first year (normally $29.99). A monthly plan is available for $2.99 a month. The app comes with a 30-day free trial period.</p>



<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h2>



<p>Bitdefender Password Manager is a straightforward solution for managing your passwords, payment card details, and identity information. If you&rsquo;re new to using password managers, it offers an easy way to get acclimated to these tools and their most essential features. If your needs go beyond daily password management, though, you may soon find yourself bumping against its limitations. For organizational purposes, it&rsquo;s often helpful to group passwords together by type of website or service, for example, but that&rsquo;s not possible with Bitdefender&rsquo;s app. Nor is managing passwords for an entire family. And if you&rsquo;re working with hundreds of passwords, you&rsquo;ll miss the extra space a desktop app or web interface provides. In these cases, a more robust password manager like Dashlane or LastPass is worth considering.</p>

## Nvidia unleashes RTX 40-series laptops, more G-Sync monitors (but not RTX Video)

<p>It&rsquo;s a big day for Nvidia! Not only are the first GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 laptops hitting the streets today (with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504852/tested-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-delivers-jaw-dropping-laptop-speeds.html">absolutely eye-watering performance</a>), but Nvidia also rolled out a feature-packed new driver that unlocks support for those GPUs, more DLSS 3 games, and a lot more. The one thing missing right now? Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX Video Super Resolution, one of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447954/best-of-ces-2023-the-most-intriguing-and-innovative-pc-hardware.html">our favorite reveals of CES 2023</a>.</p>



<p>RTX Video Super Resolution will upscale ho-hum 1080p Internet video to crisp 4K, powered by the AI tensor cores in GeForce RTX 40-series and 30-series <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">graphics cards</a>. Yes, please. Earlier this week, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/chrome-110-brings-nvidia-rtx-super-resolution-support&amp;xcust=2-1-1507219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Videocardz</a> noticed that the new Chrome 110 build includes a flag that enables new technology by default.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I had hoped Nvidia would flip its own driver switches to turn RTX Video Super Resolution on&mdash;I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> keen to try it out&mdash;but when I asked about it, a spokesperson told me &ldquo;No. This driver does not support RTX Video Super Resolution. Stay tuned for updates shortly.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Well, there you have it. Don&rsquo;t be bummed though, because there&rsquo;s plenty more goodies packed into the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/&amp;xcust=2-1-1507219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Game Ready&nbsp;528.49&nbsp;WHQL driver</a> for PC gamers.</p>



<p>In addition to the newfound RTX 40-series laptop support, you&rsquo;ll also find optimizations for <em>Company of Heroes 3</em>, coming later this month, and <em>Hello Neighbor 2</em>, which will ship an update loaded with DLSS 2 and all sorts of ray tracing options on February 17. <em>World of Warcraft</em> also receives compatibility with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html">awesome Nvidia Reflex latency-reducing technology</a>. Several games also received one-click optimal graphics settings support in GeForce Experience, including the rocking new <em>Dead Space </em>remake.</p>

## How to try the new AI-powered Bing search

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following tech news at all for the last few months, you&rsquo;ve no doubt heard that AI-powered text generation is kind of a Big Deal. ChatGPT and its alternatives are beginning to change the way we do a lot of things, like generating lists of instructions, planning vacations, or cheating at school essays. Microsoft has decided to dive in head first, debuting <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504771/microsoft-unveils-ai-powered-bing-search-edge.html">a new version of its Bing search engine with GPT-powered answers</a>. You can try it right now. </p>



<p>Well, sort of.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing join the waitlist" class="wp-image-1507045" height="459" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bing-join-waitlist.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>ChatGPT still requires a huge amount of processing power to run compared to standard search engines, so it&rsquo;s unlocking in a timed manner. You&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bing.com/new&amp;xcust=2-1-1507026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">go to Bing.com/new</a> in order to check it out. Sign in with your Microsoft account (Hotmail, Office 365, whatever) and click &ldquo;Join the waitlist&rdquo; in order to put your name down as one of the first potential users. </p>



<p>In the meantime you can see how the interface works with a series of pre-baked queries, such as &ldquo;help plan my special anniversary trip&rdquo; or &ldquo;help me create a trivia quiz.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t as wide-open as the full GPT-infused version of Bing that a very small amount of users now has access to, but it&rsquo;ll help you get prepared for when that arrives, facing off against <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bard&rdquo; AI system</a> and whatever else has popped up at that point. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing AI music quiz" class="wp-image-1507051" height="888" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bing-pop-music-quiz.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like a full breakdown of the capabilities of the new Bing, check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mark Hachman&rsquo;s full hands-on</a>. In essence, it has all the surprising versatility of ChatGPT, but with a few of the more controversial capabilities (like doing your homework or teaching you how to swear) locked down. It also shows the original web source for the content it generated, and speaking as a soon-to-be-obsolete web writer made out of pathetic human meat, I appreciate that. </p>

## Give your PC 1980s charm with these retro Transformers desk mats

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to crack your rose-tinted glasses, Gen Xers, but the cartoons of the 1980s aren&rsquo;t as good as you remember them. Put something like <em>Thundercats </em>next to the 90s <em>Batman </em>or <em>Gargoyles</em> and it just looks like a toy commercial. But I will begrudgingly admit that the toys themselves were awesome, and none more so than the original <em>Transformers</em>. If covering your desk in die-cast robots isn&rsquo;t enough to show your love for the franchise, now you can slide it under your keyboard and mouse, too. </p>



<p>Clackeys, a boutique supplier of artisan keycaps and other keyboard-themed tchotchkes, has managed to nab the official license for the first generation <em>Transformers </em>circa 1984 for a series of desk mats. We&rsquo;re talking the real primo stuff, back when a 30-foot Megatron somehow turned into a tiny James Bond gun, and no one had ever heard the name &ldquo;Shia LaBeouf.&rdquo; The super-sized mats are 900mm by 400mm, with your choice of seven art styles, including two kick-ass painted battle scenes right off a Reagan-era lunchbox. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.clackeys.com/tf-dm&amp;xcust=2-1-1506948-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The mats are $25 each</a>, more than reasonable for licensed gear, and up for pre-order now. They&rsquo;ll start shipping sometime in April. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged by the delay, and get an order in now if you want one: these explicitly &ldquo;Limited Edition&rdquo; mats have a tendency to disappear and never return. </p>

## Hands-on: Microsoftâ€™s new AI-powered Bing can write essays and plan vacations

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504771/microsoft-unveils-ai-powered-bing-search-edge.html">Bing&rsquo;s new AI-powered chatbot</a> is basically ChatGPT with ads&hellip;and one that refuses to do your homework for you. Well, sometimes.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily a derogatory criticism; the new Bing is pretty amazing. In your first few minutes with the new Bing chat interface, you&rsquo;ll probably see even more sophistication than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">free version of ChatGPT</a> currently offers, with lengthy, detailed responses that can help you in many walks of life. But they may end with a jarring ad that looks (and probably is) ripped straight from Bing. That said, the fresh AI experience already work shockingly well more often than not.</p>



<p>The new Bing experience is basically two parts. There&rsquo;s the traditional search, with a list of search results and a new contextual interface to the right; and the new &ldquo;Chat&rdquo; interface, which can be accessed either by swiping up from the list of links or via its own link. Microsoft&rsquo;s new Bing.com, for those, who have access, features a large search box in the center, with room for lengthy searches of up to 1,000 characters. It&rsquo;s above that search box where you&rsquo;ll find the small &ldquo;Chat&rdquo; link.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing home page arrow to chat" class="wp-image-1506045" height="695" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-home-page-need-arrow.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Bing&rsquo;s new home page. A query will generate the traditional page of search results, while there&rsquo;s a link to the  chat interface, above.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="how-to-use-the-new-bing">How to use the new Bing</h2>



<p>Like any other search engine, the new Bing isn&rsquo;t complicated to use. Type in any traditional search query (&ldquo;best Caribbean vacation spots,&rdquo; for example) and Bing will return a list of traditional search results. But wait &mdash; to the right is something new: a text box with a textual description of what Bing thinks would be the best vacation destinations for you to go to. This is a version of the new ChatGPT-powered conversational experience that Microsoft launched on Tuesday morning. </p>



<p>The key difference between the left and the right side appears to be that Bing is collating the results listed on the left &mdash; saving you a click or two, in other words. (The publishers of those sites might replace &ldquo;saving&rdquo; with some derivative of &ldquo;robbing,&rdquo; as your click helps drive them traffic and revenue.) At the end of the box, there is a list of footnotes: links that expand if you hover over them, as well as followup questions that can take the conversation further. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing search and context" class="wp-image-1506038" height="758" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-hands-on-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Bing&rsquo;s new &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; search will add a new contextual information box to the right, leading to the chat interface.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing search and context 2" class="wp-image-1506042" height="736" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-hands-on-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Bing&rsquo;s new &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; search will add a new contextual information box to the right, leading to the chat interface.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you click them &mdash; or the related button, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s chat&rdquo; &mdash; the entire interface will scroll upwards, opening up a new space above the search results. Welcome to the new Bing, powered by ChatGPT. You may see a message box under a result that allows access to the chat window, too.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Bing search and chat is supposed to work within Edge as well, in the sidebar of the browser. Additional capabilities include the ability to summarize PDF documents and provide additional contextual information, Microsoft says. But when we downloaded the Edge Dev version in which the Bing sidebar was enabled, we couldn&rsquo;t seem to trigger the function.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="welcome-to-bing-chat">Welcome to Bing chat</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with ChatGPT, the Bing interface won&rsquo;t feel all that different. The idea is that you can ask the chatbot questions, receive responses, and follow the conversation further or pursue other angles. (Clicking the Feedback section reveals that this product appears to be called Codex.)</p>



<p>For now, the experience is entirely free, though you&rsquo;ll need to be logged into your Microsoft account to see the benefits of the chat and the new Bing experience. Until Microsoft pushes the entire Bing experience live, you&rsquo;ll be forced to join a waitlist. Even then, you&rsquo;ll be allowed to ask the new Bing a limited number of queries, we&rsquo;re told. For now, Microsoft isn&rsquo;t allowing anonymous queries, though that should be added in the future, Microsoft said.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bing&rsquo;s chatbot would occasionally disconnect, generating an error message or the option to refresh the page. If you do, all of your conversations disappear. This isn&rsquo;t always a problem, but Bing (and other AI) often regenerate answers that differ, so that a good, comprehensive answer might not appear again the second time you ask.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing Excel query" class="wp-image-1506091" height="528" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-Excel.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You&rsquo;d expect Microsoft Bing to able to suggest tools and tips to assist you in using its own products.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>So what&rsquo;s it like using Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing chatbot? Anecdotally, it feels somewhat like the old days of ChatGPT. ChatGPT emerged without a number of guardrails, answering without restriction on a number of queries. Bing feels a little bit looser, though it will also set polite limitations, as well: it declined to respond when asked for the nicknames for various ethnicities (a lead-in to racist slurs) and smartly declined to answer &ldquo;how to pick up a girl&rdquo; as a query that objectified women. Interestingly, it then later erased the second answer entirely, responding that I had to search Bing.com to find out more.</p>



<p>In terms of a much more innocuous query (&ldquo;Who would win in a fight, Hawkman or Captain America?&rdquo;), however, Bing actually picked a winner. Well, it did, once. ChatGPT usually demurs until prompted further. Naturally, Bing will write code for you, too. Limericks? Songs? Absolutely.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing Hawkman vs Captain America" class="wp-image-1506054" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hawkman-vs-captain-america.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The first time I asked this question,  Bing settled the matter in favor of Hawkman. A while later, it wasn&rsquo;t so decisive.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The key difference between Bing and, say, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html">Google Bard</a>, is that Bing footnotes its responses, visually indicating what portion of its response comes from what site. At the end of the response, Bing supplies a list of links, which you can click or at least hover over for more information. It often adds a little emoji, too, humanizing the conversation.</p>



<p>On occasion, though, there&rsquo;s also an ad. Ask Bing about a Caribbean vacation and it will close with a sponsored link; ask it how to change the RAM in your laptop and it will end with a &ldquo;carousel&rdquo; of shopping links. (That query completely ignored the very valid issue of exactly <em>what</em> type of RAM to buy or insert.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing ad" class="wp-image-1506041" height="729" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chat-ad.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A visual ad in an otherwise text-based interface is a little jarring.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>You probably won&rsquo;t care that users will pass over those links, disappointing publishers. Microsoft promises that the chat interface won&rsquo;t be full of sponsored content, what you might call &ldquo;advertorial.&rdquo; It does matter that in the traditional Bing list of links, sponsored ads appear <em>first</em>; in the chatbot, sponsored ads appear <em>last</em>. That may mean that consumers prefer using the chatbot to traditional links. Analysts I spoke to insist that this will change search forever; if this cultural trend takes hold, it might.</p>



<h2 id="is-new-bing-better-than-chatgpt">Is new Bing better than ChatGPT?</h2>



<p>So is Bing better than Google&rsquo;s Bard? Until Bard is released, we can&rsquo;t say. It does offer footnotes, which Bard does not. Bing also does seem more comprehensive than what You.com offers.</p>



<p>Is Bing better than ChatGPT? In some ways, yes. So far Bing feels more comprehensive than the free version of ChatGPT, although OpenAI&rsquo;s chatbot does seem much more willing to serve as a study aid. </p>



<p>When asking both engines to write an essay comparing and contrasting two artistic styles, ChatGPT actually wrote the essay. Bing just supplied an outline, forcing any student using it to do the work itself. Well, the first time, anyway. When I tried to grab a screenshot (and then copied the question again) Bing helpfully wrote the essay. If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed&hellip;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT versus Bing in art essay" class="wp-image-1506061" height="670" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ChatGPT-vs-Bing-in-art.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Originally, Bing decline to write an essay. But after another prompt, it did.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In other ways, Bing limits itself. much more. Bing won&rsquo;t dispense medical advice, and balks at anything sexual. (Ironically, those answers can be sought using the traditional search interface.) It won&rsquo;t generate content that is harmful, offensive, or copyrighted. It&rsquo;s also good at preventing end runs around those restrictions. In a test asking for an Excel function to perform a specific task, the two tied: Bing gave more methods than ChatGPT, but ChatGPT&rsquo;s examples not only explained the code but were much more focused. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll need more study before we can definitively say one is better than the other, though.</p>



<p>Ultimately, though, you can&rsquo;t help but feel that Bing is being extremely generous about the whole thing, as far as its competition is concerned.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, the choice between Bing and Google Bard may depend on your personal preferences, needs, and expectations,&rdquo; Bing responded, including the emoji, when asked whether it or Bard was better. &ldquo;You may want to try both of them and see which one suits you better. &#128522;&rdquo;</p>

Only as a laptop is it somewhat ordinary.</p>
</div>


<p>Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 laptop packs in a self-contained movie theater, a sketchpad for digital artists, and an all-day productivity machine that can digitally connect to other Galaxy devices inside a single, 16-inch, 360-degree convertible laptop. Capping it all off is a gorgeous, powerful new OLED display that puts almost all of its rivals and predecessor to shame.</p>



<p>Consider this $1,699 (MSRP) laptop for what it can do <em>after</em> hours as well as your workday. While its 13th-gen Intel Core processor doesn&rsquo;t outperform everything in its class, you&rsquo;ll find a ton under its hood that few rivals offer. So buckle up&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-what-it-offers-and-where-it-fits">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: What it offers and where it fits</h2>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 is one of a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486723/samsung-reveals-galaxy-book3-oled-laptops.html">small family of new Book3 laptops</a> that consists of the Book3 Ultra, the Book3 Pro, the Book3 Pro 360, and the Book3 360. The Book3 Ultra is a new addition to the family, sporting an Nvidia RTX GeForce 4xxx GPU inside a thicker frame. The Book3 Pro is Samsung&rsquo;s traditional clamshell, shipping in either a 14-inch or 16-inch size, with a pound of weight&rsquo;s worth of a difference between the two.</p>



<p>The Book3 Pro 360, which we test here, is a single 16-inch 360-degree convertible laptop that can be folded back into tablet mode, but is otherwise similar to the Pro. Since it is designed for inking, the Book3 Pro 360 also includes an integrated S Pen inside the box. The cheaper Book3 360 does not and uses the more traditional 1080p display resolution instead. We were also told that the Book3 Pro 360 includes a 5G option. Our review unit doesn&rsquo;t offer that feature, however, and it wasn&rsquo;t listed on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-books/compare/&amp;xcust=2-1-1499055-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">index</a> of Galaxy Book3 laptops Samsung has published. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 tent mode" class="wp-image-1503193" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tent-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360, in tent mode.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>We reviewed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693933/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-360-review-a-thin-light-powerful-beauty.html">Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book2 Pro 360</a> last year. This year, Samsung offers substantial upgrades from top to bottom. Save for the Book3 360, all members of the Book3 family&mdash;the Pro, Pro 360 and Ultra&mdash;now ship with a significantly improved AMOLED 2X display, which we&rsquo;ll discuss below.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re buying the Book3 Pro 360, you have only the option of 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of SSD storage. But Samsung is also offering a free upgrade to the 1TB tier, which means that there&rsquo;s essentially just one, upgraded model of the Pro 360 available.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-specifications-and-features">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: Specifications and features</h2>

<p>The Pro 360 is the premium option of the two 360-degree convertibles Samsung ships within the Book3 family, which allows it to fold back on itself in either laptop, tent, or tablet modes. </p>



<p>Laptops have typically shipped with either 15-inch or 17-inch options, so this 16-inch model with a 16:10 display feels rather spacious. Normally, Samsung Galaxy Book laptops are known for being thin and light, but the extra room adds weight: 3.66 pounds isn&rsquo;t that heavy, but it&rsquo;s noticeable in your bag. The upside is that these notebooks charge with the same tiny gallium nitrate (GaN) charger that accompanies its Galaxy phones, so packing the Book3 Pro 360 and its charger for a work trip will probably feel lighter than a rival notebook and its traditional power brick. The new Book3 convertible is still surprisingly thin, though&mdash;not as absolutely thin as the 0.44 inches Apple cites for its MacBook Air (M2), but at 0.50 inches, close enough.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-an-improved-oled-display-worth-talking-about">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: An improved OLED display worth talking about</h2>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book Pro 360 emerges from its box as a svelte, slick slab of aluminum that looks bigger than its actual 14 inches or so of width. Open it up with a finger, and the laptop&rsquo;s gorgeous OLED reveals itself. Just do be careful with that finger, though. Our Graphite (black) review unit the company provided attracts smudges very easily, especially oils from fingers. Keep a cloth handy.</p>



<p>As the boot cycle begins, you&rsquo;ll see why we think it&rsquo;s worth talking first about why the Book3 series represents such a significant upgrade over the Book2: the updated AMOLED screen. You won&rsquo;t see the faint glow of an LED-lit screen, since OLEDs emit light on a per-pixel basis.  Instead, while you briefly wait for the white &ldquo;Samsung Galaxy&rdquo; font to be displayed on the jet-black background, don&rsquo;t be surprised if your first thought is, <em>is this thing actually on?</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>With its superb OLED display and excellent sound, Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 doesn&rsquo;t so much consume content as show it to its fullest advantage.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Put simply, Samsung&rsquo;s latest AMOLED 2X display claims improvements in both visual performance and visual quality. First, there&rsquo;s simply the dramatic improvement in resolution. The Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 defaulted to 1080p displays, but now the Book3 Pro 360 includes a 16-inch 2,880&times;1,800 display, which the manufacturer characterizes as a &ldquo;3K&rdquo; (versus a 4K) display. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re using the Book3 Pro 360 for productivity, there&rsquo;s something here for you, too: a new 120Hz display refresh rate. This may be less noticeable in terms of moving your mouse around, but inking with the integrated S Pen is markedly smoother when using a high-refresh display. Gamers also favor 120Hz refresh rates and above, as higher refresh rate results in smoother gameplay. That&rsquo;s less important here, as the Pro 360 simply uses Intel&rsquo;s integrated GPU for graphics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 color gamut 1" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1240" id="1502994" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/color-gamut-default.png" width="1954" /><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 color gamut 2" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1386" id="1502993" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/colr-gamut-oled.png" width="1976" /></div><figcaption>Color gamut comparisons for both the default Auto setting and the OLED setting on the Galaxy Book3 Pro 360.</figcaption></figure>



<p>OLED displays&rsquo; inky blacks already provide a marked visual upgrade compared to the glowy backgrounds of dark scenes lit by LED-backed display. The Book3 Pro 360 is now VESA ClearMR and DisplayHDR TRUE BLACK 500 certified, though that isn&rsquo;t quite as impressive as it sounds. While its display can produce some decent <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/582899/hdr-tv-everything-you-need-to-know.html">HDR effects just like premium TVs</a>, they won&rsquo;t be quite as profound. </p>



<p>Samsung claims that the laptop produces 120 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which simply translates into brighter, more vivid colors than a different display. Our colorimeter tests simply reported the color gamut as close to 100 percent, though that could be a fault of the testing hardware. The Pro 360 OLED display does feature dedicated modes for DCI-P3, AdobeRGB and sRGB, as well as an &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; mode that presumably optimizes itself for the application. We tested without using an adaptive color feature that can also adjust colors depending upon what the laptop detects about your environment. That feature can be enabled within the Windows settings. </p>



<p>We also can&rsquo;t yet test Samsung&rsquo;s claim that the AMOLED 2X display reduces blue light by 78 percent while in dark mode, a noteworthy selling point if true. Blue light can trigger migraines and affect sleep. Dark mode doesn&rsquo;t appear to skew the display toward warm colors, which is normally the way Windows users can filter out blue light.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro blue light" class="wp-image-1488118" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blue-light-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This is Samsung&rsquo;s own demonstration of how its new AMOLED 2X display cuts blue light to nearly zero.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In all, the Pro 360&rsquo;s display emits 392 nits of luminance, according to our tests, enough for the laptop to be used in a bright room. Be aware, though, that the screen is <em>quite</em> glossy, and reflects your background easily.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-chassis-and-ports">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: Chassis and ports</h2>



<p>Structurally, the Pro 360 feels much more like a standard convertible.  Flipping the keyboard back works well for watching movies or an impromptu business presentation. As expected, the laptop&rsquo;s hinge was strong enough to support it in either context.</p>



<p>The setup process encourages you to integrate your Galaxy Book3 with other members of the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem, specifically your phone. We weren&rsquo;t provided with the latest Galaxy S23 smartphone for review, but you can connect older phones. There are some benefits to that, which we&rsquo;ll mention below. Otherwise, setting up the Book3 Pro 360 is similar to setting up any other Windows notebook.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 left side" class="wp-image-1503191" height="609" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/left-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Book3 side ports include HDMI 1.4 and a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Thin, light laptops can bring tradeoffs, and the Book3 Pro 360 does produce a moderately loud though neutral hiss as air is sucked in through a fine grille at the bottom and is pushed out through the back. Fortunately, the laptop&rsquo;s fans only kick in under substantial load, which doesn&rsquo;t include movie playback. That&rsquo;s important, given content consumption is an important reason to this laptop. We couldn&rsquo;t detect any of the distracting high-pitched whine that some fans produce, though, so you should be able to tune it out or adjust the performance mode in the Samsung Settings app. There are High Performance, Quiet, and Silent modes to choose from in addition to the default Optimized mode.</p>



<p>The Pro 360 includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports with a USB-C interface, plus a USB-A port for legacy devices like a wired mouse. Samsung also includes a microSD slot of an undisclosed nature and an HDMI port, which a Samsung representative told us is an HDMI 1.4 port. That&rsquo;s sufficient for playing back 4K video at 24 frames per second&mdash;fine for watching movies, but not really for high-bit-rate digital video. For that, you&rsquo;ll need the Galaxy Book3 Ultra, its HDMI 2.0 port, and its focus on content creation.</p>

<p>Samsung&rsquo;s USB-C charger claims that it can charge the laptop about 35 percent in 30 minutes, a claim which bears out in idle mode but not under load. While using the laptop, the Pro 360 charged 18 percent in 35 minutes.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-once-again-a-surprisingly-good-keyboard">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: Once again, a surprisingly good keyboard</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve always preferred deep laptop keyboards with roomy travel, and Samsung keeps confounding me: I want to dislike their shallow keyboards as uncomfortable, but they&rsquo;re simply not. The wide 16:10, 16-inch form factor display allows Samsung to spread its keys out, including a narrow island keypad to the right. I certainly felt comfortable typing on it for a length of time, though I would generally prefer a different keyboard for long-term use.</p>



<p>Since the Book3 Pro 360 is a thin-and-light convertible, it&rsquo;s not that surprising that Samsung continued to forego the use of a depth camera. Instead, the power button hides a fingerprint reader, which is sensitive to smudges and requires repeated taps to set up. On the other hand, your finger doesn&rsquo;t change over time, so that you won&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;reset&rdquo; your finger as some depth cameras do. You can power up and log into the Book3 Pro 360 with a single tap.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 keyboard" class="wp-image-1503195" height="934" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>An enormous touchpad accompanies the keyboard. A fingerprint reader is hidden in the power button in the keyboard&rsquo;s upper right-hand corner.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Book3 Pro 360 does have some quirks, including an absolutely massive touchpad at the bottom of the screen that&rsquo;s 24 percent bigger than the Book2. Some laptops simply refuse to fill this space, but Samsung&rsquo;s touchpad sprawls all over and still gives you a decent palm rest on either side. The touchpad placement skews towards the left, however, so that you right palm will have much more space to rest. Unfortunately, while the entire touchpad is tappable, you can only click on the bottom two thirds. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-a-surprising-webcam-complements-solid-audio">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: A surprising webcam complements solid audio</h2>



<p>The Book3 Pro 360 includes a 1080p webcam with a standard 87-degree viewing angle, with a 60fps option hidden in the Windows Camera app&rsquo;s settings.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 speakers" class="wp-image-1503199" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/speakers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Downward/side-facing speakers help widen the Book3 Pro 360&rsquo;s sound.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>What we were surprised to see, however, were &ldquo;Studio Mode&rdquo; effects applied to the webcam; face effects, HDR, auto framing, background blur, and eye contact. It&rsquo;s not clear how these effects&mdash;which mirror the Windows Studio Effects normally found on AI-capable devices like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Surface Pro 9 (5G) </a>&mdash;made their way onto the Book3 Pro 360, or if they&rsquo;re enabled by the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435904/intel-launches-13th-gen-mobile-core-chips-with-endurance-gaming.html">Movidius AI card Intel said it would add</a> to &ldquo;select&rdquo; 13th-gen Core PCs. </p>



<p>Our tests showed that Eye Contact worked, rarely, to alter the webcam image in a way that made it appear as if your eyes were focused directly on the camera. Apps like Zoom do a better job of blurring or replacing the background than these algorithms do, but auto framing works marvelously, panning and zooming in and out to frame your face in the camera&rsquo;s vision. Samsung has historically included &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; settings to redden your cheeks or slim your face. These aren&rsquo;t present any longer, and the built-in &ldquo;face effects&rdquo; make little difference.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 webcam no effects" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1546" id="1502963" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Camera-basic.png" width="2778" /><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 webcam studio effects" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1552" id="1502962" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/webcam-effects.png" width="2786" /></div><figcaption>The Galaxy Book Pro 360 with the webcam&rsquo;s effects (background blurring, and &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; face settings) turned on and off. The main difference that I can see with face settings is that is tidied up the dark circles under my eyes. (Auto framing zooms in and turns off the other effects.)<br /></figcaption></figure>



<p>Samsung does use AI to help cancel noise in video calls, however, and does so very well. A pair of studio mics capture your voice.</p>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s speakers, meanwhile, are usually excellent, and the Pro 360&rsquo;s are no exception. AKG tuned the Book3 Pro 360&rsquo;s audio system, with a pair of 5W woofers and two 2W tweeters. The former elevate the Pro 360&rsquo;s audio into something you&rsquo;ll want to listen to, with substantial volume that can decently fill a small room. </p>



<p>You may be less enthusiastic about the integrated Dolby Atmos stereo expansion system, which usually is the only thing that makes laptop audio aurally palatable. Here, leaving Atmos off, which is the default setting, is a smart choice. Otherwise, Atmos produced a sort of cacophonous effect until I went into the Atmos app and adjusted its settings to &ldquo;Dynamic,&rdquo; instead.  At least there&rsquo;s still a headphone jack!</p>



<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-finicky-inking-is-otherwise-good">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: Finicky inking is otherwise good</h2>



<p>The Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 includes an S Pen in the box, and the first question you may have is, <em>now where do I put it</em>? Samsung doesn&rsquo;t really have an answer, so you&rsquo;ll have to come up with your own solution.</p>



<p>The S Pen inks with 4,096 levels of pressure, and the Book3 Pro 360 translates varying levels of pressure into ink width as well as any laptop we&rsquo;ve seen. The large screen area on the Pro 360 means that I often carelessly draped or dragged both hands across the screen to try and keep things steady, however, and the laptop was simply too sensitive in trying to translate my taps into what it thought were attempts to access a menu or other option. Sometimes, when I thought I was inking&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m also not a fan of how the S Pen&rsquo;s single button is located far down, where your fingers naturally grip the pen.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 S Pen ink test" class="wp-image-1502961" height="792" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Book3-Pro-360-ink-test.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>Inking on the Book3 Pro 360 seems generally solid, with excellent pressure sensing and minimal judder.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Ink flowed smoothly from the tip of the pen, as it was supposed to. There was also very little to imperceptible levels of ink judder, the sinuous line that can be produced while trying to ink slowly with a straight edge. Incidentally, the Pro 360 ships with Noteshelf, an Android note-taking app.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-integration-ties-across-the-galaxy-ecosystem">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: Integration ties across the Galaxy ecosystem</h2>



<p>Whether or not you set out to buy a Samsung Galaxy phone, tablet, and laptop, the manufacturer offers you a bonus if you do: several apps that tie the various devices together. They include Samsung Multi Control and Second Screen plus the existing Quick Share and Private Share apps. </p>



<p>Samsung has also offered the Link to Windows / Phone Link apps on its phones and Books, respectively, which allow the Book to control a Galaxy Phone a bit better than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link app connects to other Android phones</a>. Ironically, since the Book3 Pro 360 is an Evo device, Intel included its Unison app on board, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076137/intels-connected-unison-app-could-save-consumer-hardware.html">does pretty much the exact same thing</a>. </p>



<p>We weren&rsquo;t given a Galaxy S23 phone to test a new capability: how Samsung Flow can connect a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet, S23 phone, and Book3 together by using the mouse to mouse between and transfer files between all three devices.  The manufacturer also has a new &ldquo;Expert Raw Auto Share&rdquo; app that can take uncompressed raw files from the phone and transfer them to the Book3 for editing. The company also provides a two-month trial of Adobe Lightroom.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 battery saver" class="wp-image-1503190" height="818" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Battery-saver.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This isn&rsquo;t an integration feature, though it&rsquo;s a nice software feature we rarely see: a &ldquo;time to emply&rdquo; indicator.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Otherwise, Samsung provides a ton of preloaded apps you probably won&rsquo;t use. Just make sure to check out the Samsung Galaxy Experience, Samsung Update, and the Samsung Settings app for controls that will help you manage specialized functions like supplying power to the USB ports when the Pro 360 is sleeping.</p>



<p>Finally, Samsung (or Windows itself) offers a OneDrive configuration where files stored on the Windows desktop, Documents, or Pictures are always synced with the cloud. This was a little confusing, as we ran into an error message early on that said it was impossible to turn off this feature, something that Windows doesn&rsquo;t normally do. Then, later on, the objections disappeared.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-performance">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: Performance</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;re concluding from our experience with the Book3 Pro that it&rsquo;s a content-consumption machine first, though not especially for gaming. Anecdotally, the laptop occasionally hiccupped, pausing activity for a second while switching on its Dolby audio, for example. There was also a bit of lag when opening a 4K60 YouTube video, an informal check on how the laptop performs streaming video. </p>



<p>The latter test is useful, since there&rsquo;s a hidden control that reveals in what resolution YouTube is delivering the video, and how many frames are dropped. In our tests, that translated into 164 dropped frames out of 10,000, which generated just a tiny bit of shaky video when playing it back. (The Book2 Pro 360 dropped about half that when rendering the same video, though at 1080p.) Otherwise, however, we noticed no other glitches.</p>



<p>Finally, keep in mind that the Book3 Pro 360 is one of the first 13th-gen Core laptops out of the gate, which helps its placement in performance standings.</p>



<p>We use four key tests to determine a laptop&rsquo;s performance: PCMark 10, which measures day-to-day performance in office applications, video calls, CAD work, and light gaming; Cinebench, a pure CPU benchmark; 3DMark, which does the same for the laptop&rsquo;s GPU; and Handbrake, a tool which we use to measure prolonged performance. Two more stress tests in Cinebench and 3DMark can help us further determine if the Pro 360&rsquo;s performance will drop if you&rsquo;re using it intensively for more than a minute or two.</p>



<p>Thin-and-light notebooks tend to run on the smaller side, and OLED displays wander between content creation and consumption. So we&rsquo;re comparing the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 with a wide swathe of competitors: the chunkier though cheaper <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697179/asus-vivobook-pro-16x-oled-review-a-practical-creator-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display.html">Asus VivoBook Pro 16X OLED;</a> the 14-inch, high-resolution <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/834845/lenovo-slim-7-pro-x-review-packing-prosumer-power-at-a-reasonable-price.html">Lenovo Slim 7 Pro X</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631211/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-the-pinnacle-of-design.html">Lenovo Yoga 9i 14</a>; 2022&rsquo;s outdated-at-launch, gorgeous <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/694641/hp-spectre-x360-16-review-the-right-2-in-1-at-the-wrong-time.html">HP Spectre x360 16</a>; and a pair of smaller convertibles, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394896/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-review.html">HP Elite Dragonfly Max</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1468974/hp-dragonfly-folio-g3-review.html">Folio G3</a>.

(We considered the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review-the-future-is-here.html">Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio</a>, but that seems aimed at content creation.) We&rsquo;ve also noted the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693933/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-360-review-a-thin-light-powerful-beauty.html">Samsung Galaxy Book Pro2 360</a> in orange, to show off any generation-to-generation differences. </p>



<p>PCMark 10 puts a laptop through a battery of tests: word processing, Web browsing, some CAD work, videoconferencing, and more. It&rsquo;s a good indicator of overall performance across a variety of tasks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360  PCMark 10" class="wp-image-1502982" height="641" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PCMark-10.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>Though the Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 is being compared to some older laptops, the overall performance is very good.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Cinebench R15 is an older test, pushing all of the cores and threads in the laptop&rsquo;s CPU to their maximum. Later revisions of this benchmark use more complex scenes, but this test is a good representation of how a laptop handles quick tasks. The downside? Modern CPUs handle this task quickly, so prolonged tests measure how the laptop performs over time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 Cinebench R15" class="wp-image-1502983" height="632" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cinebench-R15.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>You might not be so impressed with the Book3 Pro 360&rsquo;s performance, but some of these larger OLED laptops are aimed at content creation and use beefier processors, such as the HX processor inside the Asus Vivobook.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>We use the Handbrake application to transcode a Hollywood movie into a format appropriate for storing on a tablet. The conversion process pushes all of the cores to the limit for a prolonged period &mdash; anywhere from half an hour to 90 minutes. This is a measurement of how well the laptop can perform under prolonged thermal load.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1502986" height="738" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Handbrake.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>THe Book3 Pro 360 lands more in the middle of the pack in our Handbrake video transcoding test.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>We also tested prolonged performance using Cinebench R23&rsquo;s thermal stress test and 3DMark&rsquo;s looped Time Spy benchmark, separately benchmarked just below. Here, there was a 7.5 percent drop in CPU performance over the life of the Cinebench benchmark, which ran for several minutes. In prolonged 3D performance, the laptop fared better: it wasn&rsquo;t able to hold its framerate over repeated loops of the benchmark, but did so 95 percent of the time. (In this, 96 percent is considered a passing grade.) Put simply, strenuous workloads that turn on the laptop&rsquo;s fan will slightly diminish in performance if run for long periods.</p>



<p>Our final performance benchmark is the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark, which is probably less significant given that this laptop isn&rsquo;t designed for gaming. Still, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633378/laptop-graphics-battle-amd-rdna-2-vs-intel-iris-xe.html">our recent tests showed</a>, even integrated GPUs can deliver low-end &ldquo;gaming-class&rdquo; performance.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 3DMark Time Spy" class="wp-image-1502984" height="713" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3DMark-Time-Spy.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>Laptops that use Intel&rsquo;s Iris Xe integrated GPU (here, all save the top two, which include discrete GPUs) tend to deliver similar 3D performance numbers. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>We measure battery life by looping a 4K video over and over until the laptop shuts down for want of power. Video playback may not be the only way to measure battery life, but it mimics a common  scenario: bringing a store of downloaded movies from Netflix or other services on to your laptop for a long airplane flight.</p>



<p>This is a real strength of the Book3 360 Pro, though not quite as strong as its predecessor. (That may be because of the increased display resolution&mdash;lighting more pixels takes more power.) Still, 812 minutes is just over 13.5 hours of battery life, on average, which is excellent.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 Battery life" class="wp-image-1502985" height="786" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-so-much-to-offer">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360: So much to offer</h2>



<p>We see a lot of laptops which easily push north of $2,000 just by banking on a few new features. Here, Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 justifies its value with many more, on top of a somewhat reasonable price tag. For what you&rsquo;re paying, the Book3 Pro 360 offers substantial upgrades over the Book2 Pro 360 as well as some best-of-class features, period.</p>



<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t as in love with OLEDs as we are, the higher resolution OLED and refresh rate certainly help sell this laptop. Inking, the convertible form factor, its solid audio and webcam experience, and its presence as a 13th-gen Core Evo laptop do too. Buying a Samsung laptop to accompany a Samsung Galaxy phone is an ultimately less compelling need.</p>



<p>We do think that the Book3 series offers something unique that maybe only the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html">Asus Vivobook and Zenbook series</a> seem to be consciously addressing: laptops focused on showing off content first and foremost. (Consider the Vivobook Pro 16 OLED as an alternative until we manage to test the latest offerings.) For all it brings to the table, Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 earns one of our first Editor&rsquo;s Choice awards of 2023.</p>

<p>As fun as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423753/how-to-build-a-pc-a-step-by-step-comprehensive-guide.html">building your own PC</a> can be, it&rsquo;s not always the right call. A pre-built can end up the more fitting choice&mdash;as my colleague Ashley Biancuzzo <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481326/pre-built-desktop-gaming-pc-pluses-minuses.html">rightly pointed out</a>. Pre-built computers have their advantages too. You don&rsquo;t have to devote as many hours to their purchase nor maintenance, for starters. Sometimes they win on price as well.</p>



<p>So how do you know if rolling your own PC is right for <em>you</em>? With no universally correct answer, you&rsquo;ll have to ask yourself the following five questions&hellip;and then decide the order of priority for your responses. For example, even if the scales tip in favor of a pre-built, a single &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the DIY camp could trump all.</p>



<h2 id="whats-your-budget">What&rsquo;s your budget?</h2>



<p>Building your own PC can be cheaper than pre-builts, but DIY isn&rsquo;t a guarantee of savings. Depending on how much you have to spend and your desired specs, a pre-built computer sometimes wins the financial battle.</p>



<p>For example, take a basic productivity PC&mdash;a machine you&rsquo;ll only use for browsing the web, document editing, simple photo editing, and other lightweight tasks. You might think that assembling such a modest PC would cost less than an equivalent pre-built, but the opposite is true. In this scenario, the pre-built will often undercut the DIY alternative on price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="PCPartPicker DIY Build list - Dell Inspiron equiv" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1080" id="1500642" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PCP_OD_compare.png" width="1920" /><img alt="Dell Inspiron Desktop PC at Office Depot (Feb 2023)" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1080" id="1500645" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/OD_compare.png" width="1920" /></div><figcaption>This example shows a basic <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/8360151/Dell-Inspiron-3910-Desktop-PC-Intel/#Specs&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dell Inspiron</a> sold by Office Depot beating our equivalent our <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hPrMtn&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DIY PCPartPicker list</a> in price.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the flip side, the more generous your budget, the greater your opportunities for shopping smart (especially if you can buy parts on a slower schedule). Websites like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pcpartpicker.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PCPartPicker</a> will help with forming your components list and comparison shopping, and retailers like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Newegg</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249" rel="nofollow">B&amp;H</a>, and <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> often discount parts. With smart shopping, you can end up shaving hundreds off the most expensive PC builds.</p>



<p>As for mid-range DIY projects (say, $800 to $1,200), whether you&rsquo;ll come in under or over a similar pre-built PC can be a toss-up. It&rsquo;s the range most affected by market conditions, since you have less cushion for cost-cutting while targeting parts above budget range. Generally, you can save a hundred bucks or more if you shop smart (particularly if you play your cards right <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1394611/cyber-monday-2022-build-this-1080p-ultra-gaming-pc-for-under-500.html">during big sale periods</a>), but fairly priced pre-builts are pretty competitive.</p>

<p>The outcome for your particular scenario will entirely depend on when you choose to build. Right now at the start of 2023, things are more normal again&mdash;at least, relative to the painful experience of 2020, 2021, and much of 2022. But only time will tell if this fragile calm will last, what with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445676/buying-a-pc-with-an-intel-cpu-it-may-soon-cost-more.html">CPU price increases</a>, fierce but fragile competition between AMD, Intel, and Nvidia, and a continuing lack of budget-friendly parts.</p>



<h2 id="whats-your-plan-for-upgrades">What&rsquo;s your plan for upgrades?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Pavilion Pre-Built (HP.com)" class="wp-image-1500698" height="678" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hp_pavilion.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A pre-built from major vendors like Dell, HP, and Lenovo usually rely on proprietary parts. HP does have a few exceptions to this rule, though</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>With a DIY PC, you have complete freedom to replace anything and everything. You can also build in leeway for future changes&mdash;like buying a higher-wattage power supply in anticipation of later upgrades to more powerful (and power-hungry) parts.</p>



<p>In contrast, if you buy a pre-built PC from a big vendor like Dell, HP, or Lenovo, you often can&rsquo;t swap out its components. Occasionally you&rsquo;ll run into specific models compatible with off-the-shelf parts, but proprietary parts are generally the norm. And so with this kind of pre-built, you&rsquo;re more stuck with what you buy; you have to content yourself with small upgrades like adding more memory, replacing your boot drive, and maybe installing an extra storage drive. In gaming PCs, you can also exchange the graphics card for a newer model, but the power supply&rsquo;s specs will limit your options.</p>



<p>The middle-ground option is one many PC buyers aren&rsquo;t aware of&mdash;pre-built PCs from system integrators like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CyberPowerPC</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ibuypower.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iBuyPower</a>, or PC component vendors like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/category/gaming-pcs/build&amp;xcust=2-1-1500595-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NZXT</a>. Computers purchased from these kinds of companies use off-the-shelf parts compatible with DIY upgrades down the road. The main drawback here is that available configurations are more limited than DIY building&mdash;especially if cost is a factor.</p>



<h2 id="how-much-time-do-you-have">How much time do you have?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Still from Dec 2022 PCWorld YouTube live build" class="wp-image-1500710" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PCW-YT-5hr-livebuild.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Builds don&rsquo;t usually take this long unless something really goes sideways. (Though maybe don&rsquo;t add in social time and adult beverages  into the mix either&hellip;)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>DIY can save you cash, but you&rsquo;ll pay the difference with your time. Expect to invest extra hours into researching and planning your list of components&mdash;not just specs, but component compatibility and what will set you up best for any planned future upgrades. Also account for looking up known quirks or issues for parts you&rsquo;re considering if you&rsquo;re a diligent researcher, as well as advice on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423753/how-to-build-a-pc-a-step-by-step-comprehensive-guide.html">how to build a PC</a> if you&rsquo;re a first-timer or returning after a long hiatus.</p>



<p>Then there&rsquo;s the build itself, which can be fun but still eats into your schedule. For every person in YouTube comments boasting they assembled their PC in 15 minutes, most people treat a PC build more like gardening&mdash;you don&rsquo;t aim to finish as fast as possible, but instead enjoy the process as you get everything just right. On average, a simple build with just a few non-RGB fans takes between 45 to 90 minutes with no interruptions and no mistakes. Seasoned builders will fall on the faster side of that range, while newer folks and those meticulous about cable management will be on the slower side. (If you take longer, don&rsquo;t sweat it; PC building can feel meditative. Enjoy it.)</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also spend more time on maintenance as well. Pre-builts often come with software that handles driver and other updates, but not so with a DIY build. Keeping on top of all those issues is your job alone. Also, if a part starts acting funny or needs replacement, you must deal with each retailer or manufacturer separately&mdash;there&rsquo;s no all-in-one customer support line to contact. Basically, if you build it yourself, you&rsquo;re also your own IT department. Which brings us to&hellip;</p>



<h2 id="whats-your-tolerance-for-troubleshooting">What&rsquo;s your tolerance for troubleshooting?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="The r/buildapc subreddit" class="wp-image-1500746" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/reddit_buildapc.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Reddit&rsquo;s r/buildapc subreddit is a great resource for new builders trying to troubleshoot their initial PC woes.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Assembling your own PC can be a source of pride and entertainment. It can also be a royal pain in the rear when the computer doesn&rsquo;t behave&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s at first boot or months into use. You can&rsquo;t call a tech support line for help; Google and Reddit are all you got for insight into what&rsquo;s gone wrong. And sometimes that advice doesn&rsquo;t always pan out, even after trying multiple fixes.</p>



<p>You can spend anywhere from minutes to hours (or even days, sigh) trying to resolve an issue. Sometimes the process is satisfying and teaches you a lot. Other times you&rsquo;ll want to bash your head against a wall because the problem won&rsquo;t respond to anything you throw at it.</p>



<p>If you can&rsquo;t stomach the ups and downs of servicing your own PC, a pre-built will be more compatible with your lifestyle&mdash;you can pawn off the thinking part of troubleshooting on to the company that sold you the machine. Or at least a lot of it.</p>



<h2 id="how-good-is-your-organization">How good is your organization?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Screws included with the Montech X3 Mesh" class="wp-image-1500731" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/looseygoosey.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Dumping these unused case screws into a single bag with all your other components&rsquo; spare screws would be a very bad idea. (Pro tip: Keep them in their original bag and with the included manual. No need to label!)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Willis Lai / Foundry</p></div>



<p>PC building is a heck of a lot easier when you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394287/best-tools-for-pc-building.html">buy tools suited for the job</a>. You&rsquo;ll also need to store the accessories that come with your components, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1388369/building-a-new-pc-dont-lose-this-key-motherboard-accessory.html">CPU socket cover for LGA processors</a>, spare SATA cables, extra screws, modular power supply cables you&rsquo;re not using, thermal paste, cooler brackets, and the like.</p>



<p>You should have a good place to these bits and bobbles after the initial build, since you&rsquo;ll need them again for maintenance or troubleshooting&mdash;and a good system for remembering what piece goes with which part. Sure, you can toss them all into a single bag and then shove that into the back of a drawer, but trust me, that strategy is a headache in the making.</p>



<p>If you lose things easily, having to catalog (and remember) these important leftovers could beyond your tolerance levels for such things. You can&rsquo;t always assume you&rsquo;ll be able to freely find and swap in replacements, either&mdash;for example, modular power supplies aren&rsquo;t interchangeable between different models, not just manufacturers. Plug in a different set and you could fry a key component in your PC. And that CPU socket cover? If you need it, that means your motherboard is unresponsive. Having to delay to find a replacement is going to keep your computer out of commission even longer.</p>



<p>Overall, staying organized isn&rsquo;t hard&mdash;it&rsquo;s just more work. But a specific, more tedious form that can feel like physical pain for some of us. (Don&rsquo;t ask me why I still like to build PCs.)</p>
