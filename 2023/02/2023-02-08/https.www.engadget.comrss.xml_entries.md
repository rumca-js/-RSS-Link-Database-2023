<p>Nintendo closed out today's Direct showcase with a new trailer for <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZWdlbmQtWmVsZGEtQnJlYXRoLVdpbGQtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwOTdCMllXRlg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta2gtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRmMGE3NGQ2LTE2ZDAtNGQ1Zi1iZTA4LTY3YWFmYWY5MGJiZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcbdV79HuUJJCr0nViDNcyU9TFwkm0lhCLzq68aw4Bd8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLegend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB097B2YWFX"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, showing off the game's traversal mechanics and dramatic cinematics.

<p>Here's a pleasant treat from today's Nintendo Direct: the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21ldHJvaWQtcHJpbWUtcmVtYXN0ZXJlZC1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMDA3NmE1Zi1jM2RkLTRkYjEtYWMzOC0wNjFlZWFiZTFiZGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQs8DtuExBmNZnuoAobWsFl4w3UVz5B2mYWRHxefQBFV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fmetroid-prime-remastered-switch%2F">surprise launch</a> of a revamp of the original <em>Metroid Prime</em> for the Switch. The appropriately titled <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> boasts much-improved graphics, of course, but it also includes dual-stick controls that are considerably more intuitive. You can use a GameCube-like scheme and other control options, but players used to two decades of console first-person shooters should feel more at home.</p><p>The remaster is available now in digital form through the Nintendo eShop for $40.

For now, at least, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-hands-on-130040843.html"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> is the only real way to continue Samus Aran's adventures on the Switch.

It may do the trick if you want more than a 2D platformer during your daily commute.</p>

## 'Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp' will finally arrive on April 21st

<p>Multiple delays and more than a year after it was first supposed to arrive, <a href="https://a.co/d/acJZ5bz"><em>Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp</em></a> has a new release date. Nintendo announced today that the remaster will arrive on April 21st. First announced in the summer of 2021, <em>Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp </em>was originally scheduled to hit the Nintendo eShop later that same year. However, Nintendo first delayed the title in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-wars-1-plus-2-re-boot-camp-delayed-161824641.html">fall of 2021</a> to give <em>Re-Boot Camp's</em> development team more time to work on the game. The company then subsequently pushed the remake back again after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-delays-advance-wars-1-2-over-ukraine-164417915.html">war in Ukraine began</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="6442d57155224df68bc2f6a616e6f44f"></div><p><em>Re-Boot Camp</em> bundles together &quot;reimagined&quot; versions of <em>Advance Wars </em>and <em>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</em>. The two games, long considered classics of the turn-based strategy genre, were first released by Nintendo on the Game Boy Advance in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Intelligent Systems, best known for its work on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-12-fire-emblem-three-houses-preview-nintendo-switch.html">Fire Emblem franchise</a>, was the lead developer on both titles. The remakes will include a level creator that will allow you to share your own scenarios with friends. The games will also support local and online play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## Tweets and direct messages are broken for many Twitter users

<p>Something is very wrong with Twitter right now, but it’s not clear exactly what. As of Wednesday afternoon, core features, including direct messages and tweets, are not working for large swaths of users.</p><p>While some users are able to tweet, many users are receiving messages that they can’t tweet or as they are “over the daily limit for sending Tweets.” A similar message appears when attempting retweets: “Sorry! You’ve have exceeded your Tweet limit. Try retweet again tomorrow.” Trying to follow accounts also produces an error about reaching a &quot;daily limit.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Twitter's Direct Messages are not loading." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/52e81ad0-a801-11ed-b37f-16193f2543a1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Twitter</div></figure><p>While rate limiting can in some cases be an anti-spam tactic, the messages are appearing even for accounts that have shared relatively few tweets. In my case, I’ve tweeted less than two dozen times today, and I’m receiving the errors. According <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-limits#:~:text=Current%20Twitter%20limits,Tweets%3A%202%2C400%20per%20day.">to Twitter</a>, the “technical limit” for accounts is 2,400 tweets and 500 direct messages a day. The daily &quot;follow limit&quot; is 400. For now, using Twitter's scheduling function appears to bypass the issue with sending tweets.</p><p>Additionally, direct messages are down for many users. Instead of the normal inbox view, an alert simply says: “Something went wrong. Try reloading.” Previously sent messages are currently inaccessible.</p><p>It’s not clear what the source of these issues are. Twitter, which no longer has a communications team, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The problems cropped up a day before the company is set to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tweet-daily-limit-direct-messages-broken-224453625.html">shut down</a> the free version of its API, though it's not clear if the two issues could be related.</p><p><strong>Update 2/8 6:30 PM ET:  </strong>The ability to tweet (without scheduling) seems to be back for most users. The ability to direct message or follow a new account is still broken. In a tweet from its support account, Twitter said the service &quot;may not be working as expected for some of you,&quot; but didn't elaborate on the source of the problems. &quot;We're aware and working to get this fixed.&quot;</p><div id="c7898c355fcb4f4485a4c191476c20dc"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter may not be working as expected for some of you.

## 'Pikmin 4' hits Switch on July 21st

<p>After nearly a decade in development, <em>Pikmin 4</em> is due to land on the Switch on July 21st, 2023. Nintendo shared a fresh gameplay trailer during today's Direct showcase, featuring a new Pikmin with ice abilities and a friendly dog who helps the little plant buddies on their cosmic adventures.</p><div id="7bd5075ed383487d9c45a06f0c999f13"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Apparently, Pikmin games just take a long time to develop, OK? Nintendo head Shigeru Miyamoto <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-07-pikmin-4-revealed.html">said in 2015</a> that <em>Pikmin 4</em> was &quot;very close to completion,&quot; but that clearly wasn't the case. It's now been 10 years since the release of <em>Pikmin 3</em>, which itself spent eight years in development. Of course, it ended up being an absolutely lovely experience on the Wii U.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>Wii U</em>. Wow, it really has been a long time since the last Pikmin game came out. That could explain the length of <em>Pikmin 4</em>'s production timeline, too, as it entered development at the end of the Wii U's short lifecycle, yet long before the Switch entered the market.</p>

## Meta now owns VR fitness company Within

<p>The tug of war over Meta's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-acquiring-within-supernatural-123904948.html">acquisition of Within</a> is over.  Meta has <a href="https://twitter.com/WITHIN/status/1623436391576403971">completed</a> its purchase of the virtual reality workout app maker, bringing <em>Supernatural</em> and other projects into the metaverse giant's fold. The two didn't elaborate further on their plans, but Within said in October 2021 that it would continue to develop <em>Supernatural</em> exercise content under Meta's Reality Labs wing.</p><p>The deal was in doubt for a while. The Federal Trade Commission filed an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-meta-supernatural-within-vr-metaverse-antitrust-193448429.html">antitrust suit</a> to block the deal in July 2022, contending that Meta was trying to buy its way into VR dominance by acquiring key developers like Within and <em>Beat Saber</em> creator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-26-oculus-vr-beat-saber.html">Beat Games</a>. Meta agreed to delay the acquisition to provide more time. Last week, however, a federal court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-reportedly-loses-court-order-to-block-metas-acquisition-of-vr-developer-within-172220645.html">denied a preliminary injunction</a> to block the merger while the FTC investigated. The commission decided against appealing the loss, but was yet to decide whether or not it would rely on an administrative law judge to stop the union.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d3b93176bc58484a84621396a2c02bd1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today marks a new chapter for Within and <a href="https://twitter.com/getsupernatural?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GetSupernatural</a>, as we officially join <a href="https://twitter.com/Meta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Meta</a>.

Meta is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-meta-flunked-its-first-year-as-a-metaverse-company-150049067.html">struggling to pivot to the metaverse</a> between steep losses and a lack of clear incentives to spend extensive time in VR. Within gives Meta both a fitness system and a subscription service, albeit one aimed at a relatively niche audience. It also helps Meta compete against a growing wave of headsets that includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-vr2-faq-details-headset-virtual-reality-194415674.html">PlayStation VR2</a>.</p><p>The completion isn't good news for the FTC, however. The Within buyout was an early test of commission chair <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html">Lina Khan's</a> crackdown on Big Tech. While there are still other battles to fight, such as the antitrust suit over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">Microsoft's Activision Blizzard takeover</a>, this suggests the regulator won't have an easy time keeping major companies in check.</p>

## Spotify’s ‘Exclude from your Taste Profile’ keeps Elmo out of your daily mixes

<p>Spotify is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-08/exclude-from-your-taste-profile-will-make-your-personalized-recommendations-even-better/">launching</a> a new feature today called Exclude from your Taste Profile. As its name suggests, it lets you choose playlists — perhaps those played by a child or other family member — that you don’t want affecting your personalized recommendations.</p><p>The company says the feature “reduces the impact” the playlists have on your recommended content. So if your child loves jamming out to “Elmo’s Favorite Elmo Songs!” ad nauseam, the new feature should help you avoid hearing similar children’s tunes in your Daily Mix playlists and other algorithmically generated content. (Although we wouldn’t fault you for putting on “Brushy Brush!” while cleaning those pearly whites.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Exclude from your Taste Profile only works with playlists — not albums or individual songs. Spotify says liked songs within those playlists will still affect your recommendations, so it may be wise to ask family members to ease up on the heart button. The changes will apply retroactively, excluding past and future listens of the unwanted playlists from your recommendations.</p><p>Spotify is rolling out the feature “starting today,” suggesting you may not see it immediately. The feature will work on iOS, Android, desktop and the web. Once available, you can exclude music by selecting a playlist, tapping the three-dot menu near the top and selecting “Exclude from your Taste Profile.” In addition, the company says you can turn the feature off at any time using the same process.</p>

<p>You now have a very practical reason to subscribe to Twitter Blue beyond <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-video-and-ranking-perks-arrive-to-paying-blue-subscribers-125538009.html">long video uploads</a> and the coveted blue checkmark. <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1623411400545632256">As of today</a>, Blue members in the US can post tweets up to 4,000 characters long. You can't currently schedule these posts or save them as drafts, but this could be helpful if you'd rather not write a lengthy multi-tweet thread just to share your thoughts.</p><p>Free Twitter users can still reply to and quote these tweets. And yes, Twitter is aware that scrolling through a sea of these lengthy posts could be frustrating. Any tweet longer than 280 characters now hides any extra content beyond a &quot;show more&quot; prompt. Blue normally costs $8 per month, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-now-offering-a-yearly-discount-rate-on-blue-verified-checkmarks-115514908.html">$84 per year</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1b25860cd5214aada6c2ae522f5e563f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">need more than 280 characters to express yourself?<br /><br />we know that lots of you do… and while we love a good thread, sometimes you just want to Tweet everything all at once. we get that. <br /><br />so we're introducing longer Tweets! you're gonna want to check this out. tap this 👉… <a href="https://t.co/lge9udRzLE">https://t.co/lge9udRzLE</a></p>— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1623411400545632256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>This probably won't prompt you to switch from social networks like Facebook or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html">Mastodon</a>, where long posts have been available for a while. However, it could be helpful if you'd like to share the same post across multiple social platforms without having to split it up or write a condensed version.</p><p>There's certainly pressure on Twitter to make Blue more appealing. Twitter reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-180000-paying-subscribers-us-mid-january-075214783.html">only had 180,000 Blue subscribers</a> in the US as of mid-January, and roughly 290,000 worldwide. While the revamped subscription hasn't been available for very long, it needs to be highly attractive to enthusiasts if Elon Musk wants to achieve a goal of generating half of Twitter's revenue from subscriptions.</p>

## Netflix's password-sharing crackdown begins in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain

<p>Netflix's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-charging-for-additional-homes-120520262.html">fight against password sharing</a> is expanding in earnest. The company is <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/an-update-on-sharing">rolling out</a> paid account sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain after trialing the effort in Latin America. If you live in one of these countries, you'll need to set a primary location to have unfettered access at home. If you have any friends or family who want to share your account, you'll have to subscribe to either the Standard or Premium tier and pay a fee ($8 in Canada and New Zealand, €4 in Portugal and €6 in Spain) for up to two extra users outside of your home.</p><p>You can still watch on your phone or sign into the service on a device elsewhere, like a smart TV at a hotel. Netflix also lets you convert a profile into a new account. The company promises to tweak paid sharing based on feedback, and to continue the deployment over the &quot;coming months.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The streaming pioneer isn't shy about its rationale. As it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q2-2022-earnings-subscriber-loss-204003713.html">argued in the past</a>, Netflix claims account sharing is hurting its bottom line. The 100 million-plus households sharing accounts are &quot;impacting [Netflix's] ability&quot; to invest in new content, according to product director Chengyi Long. In theory, paid sharing improves the company's revenue without forcing affected users to pay full price for a completely separate account.</p><p>It's not clear how new regions will take to the policy. Many rival services don't have account sharing restrictions, and some sharers may be averse to paying anything to use someone else's access. While we wouldn't expect users to switch services in droves, there may be some who simply forego Netflix altogether to avoid paying a fee.</p>

## Trump White House asked Twitter to take down Chrissy Teigen's mean tweet about him

<p>A former Twitter employee has shed new light on the company’s dealings with the White House while former President Donald Trump was in office. Anika Navaroli, a former senior member of Twitter’s US Safety Policy, testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing that her team had received a request to remove a tweet making fun of the former president.</p><p>She revealed the previously unreported interaction during hearing with former Twitter executives’ over their handling of a 2020 <em>New York Post</em> story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. Republicans on the committee have equated Twitter's initial decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-twitter-limit-ny-post-story-joe-biden-son-192852336.html">block links</a> to the story with “censorship,” and criticized the company for its interactions with government officials.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But Navaroli revealed that Twitter had also received at least one request, <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1170914148919590914"><ins>in 2019,</ins></a> from the Trump White House regarding a tweet they wanted removed. The tweet came from Chrissy Teigen, who had called the president a “pussy ass bitch,” in response to comments he had made about her and her husband. According to Navaroli, someone from the White House “reached out to ask that this tweet be removed” and that her team had to evaluate whether the tweet violated the company’s “insults policy.” She said they ultimately determined the tweet did not, and it remained up.</p><div id="4e827c90a17046beb05c4df866593274"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Trump WH wanted Teigen’s tweet calling Trump a PAB taken down lol <a href="https://t.co/WkyQoJ3zIP">pic.twitter.com/WkyQoJ3zIP</a></p>— Acyn (@Acyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1623357770933145607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Earlier in the hearing, Navaroli also revealed that Twitter had on at least one occasion changed its policies in order to avoid taking action against a tweet from Trump. She said that the company had removed internal “moderation guidance” that used “go back to where you came from” as an example of language that would break its rules after Trump had used the phrase in reference to New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and other lawmakers. She said a more senior executive, former trust and safety head Del Harvey, “overrode” her assessment that the tweet broke Twitter's rules.</p><div id="2dcd9d55ca5042b89b9eb819d12d9e65"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">AOC: So Twitter changed their own policy after Trump violated it to accommodate his tweets? <a href="https://t.co/ViBt5yqWC5">pic.twitter.com/ViBt5yqWC5</a></p>— Acyn (@Acyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1623359622244446217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>The hearing wasn’t the first time members of Congress have heard from Navaroli. She previously spoke with the committee investigating the January 6th attack about her efforts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-twitter-employee-jan-6th-212758549.html"><ins>to warn</ins></a> Twitter officials about threats leading up to the attack. &quot;Twitter leadership bent and broke their own rules in order to protect some of the most dangerous speech on the platform,&quot; she said in her opening statement.</p><p></p>

## 'Squid Game' is coming to VR later this year

<p>If you like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/squid%20game/"><em>Squid Game</em></a> but not enough to brave the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-squid-game-reality-tv-series-190542538.html">real-life version</a>, you'll soon have a VR option. Netflix has partnered with Sandbox VR to produce a game based on the Korean TV series, and from &quot;late 2023,&quot; you'll be able to enter this gruesome dystopia at any of the Sandbox VR arcades around the world. The game developer has over 30 locations globally — 26 of which are in North America — at the time of writing, which is a much needed rebound after lying dormant throughout the worst part of the pandemic.</p><p>According to Sandbox VR, its upcoming experience will have players &quot;transported to iconic <em>Squid Game</em> locations, where they become contestants in a variety of pulse-pounding challenges inspired by the Netflix series.&quot; You'll &quot;compete against each other to be the last one standing&quot; — presumably without anyone actually dying. As with all Sandbox VR games, players will be able to immediately rewatch, share and even download a personalized mixed-reality highlight reel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e0bbfbfd2389466282c3a1570cb5ee3f"><div class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider"></div></div><p>The San Francisco-based VR company didn't share further details on its Netflix collaboration, but judging by my recent experience with its latest zombie-shooter, <em>Deadwood Valley </em>(pictured above), the upcoming <em>Squid Game</em> title shouldn't disappoint. All Sandbox VR games allow up to six players to roam around freely in each room, while wearing wrist and ankle trackers for full-body motion capture, as well as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-02-bhaptics-tactsuit-vr-haptic-feedback-htc-vive-x-demo-day.html">bHaptic TactSuit</a> to feel gunshots or zombie scratches. Players also hold a prop weapon that matches the size of its virtual counterpart, thus making these VR games more immersive than they already are.</p><p>I'm anticipating the likes of <em>Red Light, Green Light</em>, hopscotch and <em>Squid </em>making their way into the <em>Squid Game</em> VR experience, but I'm less keen on the idea of licking a prop to solve the dalgona candy puzzles.</p>

If you own a first-generation pair of AirPods Pro, you’re probably better off buying the new model to get a fresh set of batteries. In any event, there’s no easy way to repair a set of AirPods Pro and limit your electronic waste. Replacement parts are either hard to find, expensive or non-existent, and Apple didn’t design any of its earbuds with <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Pro+Teardown/127551#teardownConclusion">repairability in mind</a>.</p><p>Robotics engineer Ken Pillonel, who became internet famous in 2021 for creating a working <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-usb-c-i-phone-becomes-a-reality-thanks-to-a-robotics-engineer-113556672.html">USB-C iPhone</a>, is trying to fix that. With his latest DIY project, Pillonel has effectively created an end-to-end solution for those who want to swap the battery in their AirPods Pro case rather than replace it altogether.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ff17c693b6c842628585ad4b278d3451"></div><p>Pillonel designed a replacement USB-C PCB he says is possible to install in an undamaged case without milling. If you’ve been following Pillonel for a while, you likely know that he also designed a USB-C PCB for the first- and second-generation AirPods and uploaded the design to GitHub. This time, he’s selling the AirPods Pro part to make the repair as easy as possible for anyone who wants to attempt it. You can get a single PCB from his <a href="https://shop.kenp.io/">online store</a> for about $38.</p><p>If you damage your AirPods Pro case trying to access the internal battery, Pillonel has thought of that too. He’s uploaded a schematic to <a href="https://github.com/kenp-io/not-for-airpods-repairs">GitHub</a> that you can use to 3D print a replacement. The USB-C PCB and case are fully compatible with one another. The only part you need to source independently is a replacement battery. You can find those online for about $20. “The goal of this project is to maximize the number of successful repairs to minimize the quantity of electronic waste,” Pillonel said in a statement. Obviously, most people won’t have the patience or confidence to service their AirPods Pro charging case, but a project like this is invaluable for those who do.</p>

They sought better pay, increased wage transparency and improved shift scheduling. Union negotiators characterized talks with Apple as positive, but it took several months before workers cast ballots.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>GMB organizer John Slaven calls the union vote &quot;historic.&quot; In a statement to <em>The Herald</em>, Apple says it's one of the &quot;highest paying&quot; retail brands in Scotland, and offers &quot;industry-leading benefits&quot; to employees. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-raising-pay-corporate-retail-082923570.html">raised starting wages</a> for store workers last year in response to mounting labor action, but it also faces formal complaints over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-nlrb-anti-union-complaint-160802668.html">alleged union busting tactics</a>.</p><p>These aren't the first Apple retail employees to create unions.

## Turkey is reportedly blocking access to Twitter following devastating earthquakes

<p>Turkey may be blocking access to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a>, two days after a pair of catastrophic earthquakes struck the area. Thousands of people are still trapped in buildings in Turkey and Syria, where the death toll is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/08/turkey-syria-earthquake-death-toll-homeless-disaster-latest-updates">approaching 12,000</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-08/twitter-access-blocked-in-turkey-days-after-massive-earthquakes?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, people in Turkey started having trouble accessing Twitter on Wednesday afternoon. Some have resorted to VPNs to use the service. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, has <a href="https://twitter.com/kilicdarogluk/status/1623320440805392384">accused</a> the government of blocking Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's not clear why the Turkish government might want to prevent access to Twitter amid such devastation. The social media service is still a valuable disaster response tool and users have also been sharing images of the destruction caused by the earthquakes. Twitter does not have a communications team that can be reached for comment.</p><p>This would not be the first time that Turkey has stopped residents from accessing social media services. It has also done so during cross-border military operations and terror attacks. In 2014, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-21-twitter-ban-turkey.html">Turkey temporarily banned Twitter</a>. Users were sharing voice recordings and documents that purportedly showed corruption within then-prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's sphere of influence. Erdoğan became Turkey's president later that year and he remains in power.

## The first Android 14 developer preview focuses on accessibility

<p>It wouldn't be February without a peek at Google's next mobile OS. Sure enough, the company has <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14">released</a> the first Android 14 developer preview (DP1) to help app creators target the new platform. This time around, the initial priorities are accessibility, battery life and security. You can scale fonts to a much larger size (200 percent versus the earlier 130 percent), and smarter scaling makes text more readable. It's easier to set preferred languages for apps, and developers can be more accommodating to people who speak gendered languages like French.</p><p>Android 14 DP1 also includes some under-the-hood improvements that can make the most of your battery and screen. There are tighter controls on alarms, foreground tasks and internal broadcasts, all of which can reduce power consumption. It should also be easier to build apps for foldable phones and tablets, so you may see software that makes better use of your hardware's visual real estate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And yes, Android 14 can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-14-blocks-sideloading-very-old-apps-173757328.html">block users from sideloading very old apps</a>. Google will require that apps target at least Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), as some malware is written for older versions to avoid a permissions system introduced in 2015. This won't prevent you from running apps that are already installed when you upgrade the OS, and you can use command line instructions to force installations. However, you may have to look for alternatives if there's an ancient app you'd hate to give up.</p><p>This first preview is available through the desktop Android emulator as well as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4a-review-price-specs-availability-150050960.html">Pixel 4a</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5</a> and newer Google phones. The first Android 14 beta should arrive in April, and Google expects &quot;platform stability&quot; (read: release candidates) in June. As always, the developer previews don't represent the sum total of what the new platform will bring. We'd expect Google to reveal more conspicuous changes at its I/O conference in the spring.</p>

## Twitter is shutting down its free API, here's what's going to break

<p>Of all the once-unthinkable changes Elon Musk had made since taking over Twitter, pulling the rug out from under developers might seem relatively minor. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html">banning</a> third-party clients without warning, Twitter announced that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-charging-developers-api-access-104917093.html">no longer</a> allow any developer to use its APIs for free.</p><p>So far, Twitter has communicated very little about the changes, other than confirming a February 9th cut-off date. Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621259936524300289">suggested</a> Twitter could charge $100 a month “with ID verification,” but hasn’t elaborated. What we do know, is that once free access is shut off, thousands of apps, research projects, bots and other services will stop functioning (or, at the very least, be interrupted). If you’re a Twitter user, chances are this will affect you in some way, and you shouldn’t wait until it’s too late to prepare.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Change logins for apps where you’ve signed in with Twitter</h2><p>If you’ve ever used your Twitter credentials to sign into another service, the coming API shutoff could prevent you from being able to access your account. That means you’ll want to double check which services you’ve used Twitter as a login for, and change your account info while you’re still able to.</p><p>You can check which services have access to your Twitter account via <strong>Settings -&gt; Security and Account Access -&gt; Apps and sessions -&gt; Connected Apps</strong> (or, clicking <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps">here</a>). Depending on the service, you may have to create an entirely new account with different credentials.</p><h2>Nuke your tweets</h2><p>There are a lot of good reasons <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-24-how-to-delete-old-tweets.html">to delete</a> your old tweets. But if you haven’t already, your window for easily doing so is rapidly closing. If you want to wipe your tweet history, check out <a href="https://tweetdelete.net/">TweetDelete</a>, <a href="https://twitwipe.com/">TwitWipe</a>, <a href="https://tweetdeleter.com/">TweetDeleter,</a> or another similar service. Note that there are a handful of subscription-based tweet deletion services. It may be a good idea to hold off on using a paid service for now until it’s clear whether any of these apps will continue to operate after the API changes go into effect.</p><h2>Find your mutuals on Mastodon</h2><p>Whether you’re new to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html">the Fediverse</a> or not, now would be a very good time to find all your mutuals from Twitter over on Mastodon. Services <a href="https://www.movetodon.org/">like Movetodon</a> and <a href="https://twitodon.com/">Twitodon</a> enable you to easily find familiar accounts on Mastodon. Rebuilding your following graph on a new platform can be one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html">biggest hurdles</a> to getting  started, so even if you’re not sure about switching, it’s not a bad idea to use these tools while you still can.</p><h2>Everything else</h2><p>Unfortunately, the effects of ending the free API will be much more far-reaching than just these services. The future of Twitter’s bots — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bot-account-label-200052748.html">automated accounts</a> that share everything from weather updates, helpful reminders, jokes and emergency alerts  — is now very much uncertain. While Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitter-will-offer-a-free-api-tier-for-good-bots-091022655.html">has indicated</a> that he may allow some bots with “good” content to access the Twitter API for free, it’s not at all clear how this will work, or if paying for Twitter Blue will be a requirement. So far, a number of bot developers have said they <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/twitter-bot-api-changes-killing-fun">will not pay</a> for use of Twitter's API and are planning for their accounts to go dark on the 9th.</p><p>The API changes will also have a disastrous impact on the <a href="https://independenttechresearch.org/letter-twitter-api-access-threatens-public-interest-research/">research community</a>. Currently, there are scores of journalists, nonprofits and academic institutions that use Twitter’s API to research misinformation, public health, education and numerous other issues. Requiring these researchers to pay could effectively end these projects, particularly for organizations that are smaller and not as well-funded. For now, it's not clear if these organizations will have any other options available to them.&nbsp;</p>

## Alibaba joins the rush to build a ChatGPT rival

<p>If it seems like everyone is rushing to develop an alternative to ChatGPT, you're not wrong. Chinese online commerce heavyweight Alibaba has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/chinese-tech-giant-alibaba-working-on-a-chatgpt-rival-shares-jump.html">confirmed</a> to <em>CNBC</em> that it's working on its equivalent to OpenAI's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">hit AI chatbot</a>. The company isn't detailing features or offering a release schedule, but says it has been developing generative AI since 2017 and is in the middle of internal testing.</p><p>The reveal comes as multiple tech giants have introduced rivals to or spinoffs of ChatGPT this week. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">unveiled Bard</a>, while China's Baidu said it was testing &quot;Ernie Bot.&quot;  Microsoft, meanwhile, launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">redesigned Bing</a> that uses a &quot;much more powerful&quot; language model built with OpenAI's help. The text-generating AI is considered particularly useful for search, where it can provide detailed responses to very specific questions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alibaba hasn't said how it would put the AI to work. However, the company is a powerhouse in online shopping and has its fingers in numerous other fields ranging from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-26-alibaba-ai-chip-cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a> through to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-regulator-ant-group-jack-ma-055841293.html">finance</a>. A counterpart to ChatGPT could be useful in many of these categories, and might help Alibaba challenge  Baidu and other Chinese firms hoping to wield AI as a competitive advantage.</p>

## Google Maps' Immersive View is rolling out in five cities

<p>At I/O 2022, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-adds-immersive-view-of-major-cities-172303086.html"><ins>revealed an Immersive View feature</ins></a> for Maps that uses computer vision and AI to combine Street View and aerial photography into a 3D format. The idea is to create a detailed perspective of buildings and other aspects of the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature is rolling out in five cities today. You'll be able to check it out in London, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Tokyo. Google started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-immersive-view-250-cities-172654290.html"><ins>offering a preview</ins></a> of the feature in those cities in September. Immersive View is coming to other cities over the next several months, including Amsterdam, Dublin, Florence and Venice.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is pitching Immersive View as a way to help folks plan a trip. The feature adds contextual information, including traffic, the weather and how busy a location typically is at different times of the day. You'll be able to soar over buildings and see things like the location of an entrance to an attraction, so you don't end up walking around an entire block to find a museum's front door (nope, I definitely haven't done that).</p><div id="789727c33c1c46009c40b8b4d83fe9bd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Are you the sort of person who needs to get the feel of somewhere before you commit? 🗺<br /><br />With immersive view on Google Maps, you can see what a neighborhood is like before you even set foot there📍<br /><br />✨ Coming to more cities in the next few months ✨<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/googlelivefromparis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#googlelivefromparis</a><a href="https://t.co/VPvqHP25ai">pic.twitter.com/VPvqHP25ai</a></p>— Google Europe (@googleeurope) <a href="https://twitter.com/googleeurope/status/1623358592303636481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>The company built Immersive View using an AI technique called neural radiance fields (NeRF), which converts photos into 3D representations. With the help of NeRF, Google can &quot;accurately recreate the full context of a place including its lighting, the texture of materials and what’s in the background,&quot; according to <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/"><ins>a blog post</ins></a>. &quot;All of this allows you to see if a bar’s moody lighting is the right vibe for a date night or if the views at a cafe make it the ideal spot for lunch with friends.&quot;</p><p>Google laid out some other Maps updates as well. A feature called &quot;glancable directions&quot; will help you track your journey from your lock screen or route overview whether you're walking, on your bike or using public transit. It can tell you where to turn and keep you updated on the estimated time of arrival, and it will update the info if you switch up the route. Glancable directions will arrive on iOS (where it will be available through Live Activities) and Android in the coming months.</p><p>Moreover, there are more features on the way to electric vehicles with Google built-in. The system will factor in charging stops for shorter trips that require one, and it will suggest the best charging station based on variables like traffic, your current battery level and how much energy your EV is using. You'll have access to a &quot;very fast&quot; filter to locate &quot;stations that have chargers of 150 kilowatts or higher.&quot; In addition, you'll be able to filter search results for locations that have charging stations to help you figure out, for instance, which supermarket to go to so you can top up your battery while buying groceries.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google is expanding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-search-with-live-view-barcelona-dublin-madrid-163721513.html"><ins>Search with Live View and Indoor Live View</ins></a> to more locations in the coming months. The company has also offered a peek at its upcoming Search chatbot, Bard, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">things didn't entirely go smoothly</a>.</p>

## Google’s Bard chatbot confidently spouts misinformation in Twitter debut

<p>If the unofficial debut of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">Google’s Bard chatbot</a> is any indication, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">misinformation is about to get a lot worse</a>. The company posted an ad to Twitter this week showing off the natural-language AI model displaying false information about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p><p>In the <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1622710355775393793">advertisement</a> (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/"><em>Reuters</em></a>), a short GIF shows an example of a Q&amp;A with Bard. “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year old about?” the query reads. The machine quickly spits out three ideas, including the last one that says, “JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system. These distant worlds are called ‘exoplanets.’ Exo means ‘from outside.’” Although the bit about exoplanets is spot-on, the first part saying the JWST took the first pictures of them is false. That honor belongs to the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, as <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/300/2m1207b-first-image-of-an-exoplanet/">confirmed by NASA</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="68abf4185dd047a4ac9a6b4091463dca"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bard is an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA.

It parallels <em>CNET</em>’s decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-gets-caught-playing-ai-mad-libs-with-its-financial-news-coverage-001026432.html">write financial advice articles</a> with an AI chatbot; they were also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html">riddled with errors</a>.</p><p>Because chatbots get so much right — and spit out answers with such supreme confidence — anyone who doesn’t fact-check their responses may be left with false beliefs. Considering the chaos that (non-AI-powered) misinformation has already let loose on society, releasing this often mind-blowing technology before it can be trusted to produce factual information reliably and consistently — even escaping Google’s copy editors — may have us in for a wild ride.</p>

## Google Maps Search with Live View is coming to Barcelona, Dublin and Madrid

<p>Last September, Google began rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-immersive-view-250-cities-172654290.html">Search with Live View</a>, a feature within Maps that adds search functionality to the app's augmented reality layer. At the time, that feature was only available if you found yourself in London, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Paris or Tokyo. Today, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/">announced</a> it's bringing Search with Live View to Barcelona, Dublin and Madrid within the coming months. The company is also greatly expanding the availability of Live View within indoor locations. Google said Wednesday it's bringing the functionality to more than 1,000 new airports, train stations and malls across cities like Barcelona, London, Madrid, Paris and Singapore. The expansion will take place over the next few months.</p><p>Separately, Google (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590699/google-ai-search-features-bard-chatgpt-rival"><em>The Verge</em></a>) showcased some of its other work in AI-augmented search. In one demo, the company asked for a summary of the best constellations to look for when stargazing. Notably, the demo Google showed wasn't as polished as the one Microsoft brought to its &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">new Bing</a>&quot; showcase yesterday. In that instance, Bing provided the user with footnotes and links to the material it used to summarize its findings, something that was missing from Google's demo.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## Discovery+ will remain as a standalone streaming platform after all

<p>Over the last several months, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has been working to smush <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hbo%20max/"><ins>HBO Max</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/discovery%20plus/"><ins>Discovery+</ins></a> together into a single, giant streaming service, which is expected to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-and-discovery-combined-streaming-service-launching-earlier-than-expected-083047658.html"><ins>debut this spring</ins></a>. However, it seems the company has rethought its strategy, as Discovery+ is sticking around as a standalone platform.</p><p>"Our plan for the enhanced platform that will bring together HBO Max and Discovery+ content remains unchanged," WBD spokesperson Jeff Cusson told Engadget. "In addition, we have decided to keep the lower-priced offering of Discovery+ in the US marketplace."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy93YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktdG8ta2VlcC1kaXNjb3ZlcnktaW4tc3RyYXRlZ3ktc2hpZnQtMTE2NzU4NTk2MzMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZiZWNmMzE0LWM3NTAtNDYyYS1hYjQ2LWZhZTlhZjY2MTIwNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAa8A3voMHorzJE6eYR2HF2XloXPVEYBHvwhX2_rfIyuD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fwarner-bros-discovery-to-keep-discovery-in-strategy-shift-11675859633"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journa</ins></em><ins>l</ins></a>, which first reported the news, executives were concerned that a sizable number of the current 20 million Discovery+ subscribers may not be willing to pay a higher price for a service that features HBO Max content. It doesn't seem that there are plans to keep HBO Max as a standalone app as well. As such, folks who want to watch shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20last%20of%20us/"><em><ins>The Last of Us</ins></em></a> and <em>Succession </em>without a cable subscription may need to pay more for a service that combines HBO Max content and most of the offerings from Discovery+.</p><p>Discovery+ costs $5 per month with ads or $7 to go ad-free, while the ad-supported version of HBO Max costs $10 per month (or $16 without ads).

## The best wireless workout headphones for 2023

<p>As some of you might know, I’m a runner. On occasion I review sports watches, and outside of work I’m a certified marathon coach. So when Engadget wanted to round up the best wireless workout headphones, I raised my hand.</p><p>In addition to fit and battery life, I considered factors such as style; ease of use; the charging case; the strength of the Bluetooth connection; support for assistants such as Siri and Alexa; water resistance ratings; and audio features such as noise cancelation and ambient sound modes. You’ll notice I don’t have much if anything to say about audio quality. Engadget’s resident expert Billy Steele has written about this plenty in his standalone reviews, which I’ve linked throughout, but for my purposes the differences were too subtle to make or break a purchasing decision.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the end, I never quite mastered some of the over-complicated controls, but at no point did an earbud fall out while I was exercising. I also never came close to running out of juice. So, participation trophies for everyone? Ha: The companies wish. I do indeed have some favorites, while some fell short in key areas.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><h3>Water resistance</h3><p>Even if earbuds aren’t marketed specifically as workout headphones, a durable, water-resistant design will, by default, make them suitable for exercise. To avoid repeating myself throughout this guide, I’ll drop a quick primer here on durability, or ingression protection (IP), ratings. The first digit you’ll see after the “IP” refers to protection from dust and other potential intrusions. That spec is measured on a scale of 1 to 6. The second refers to water resistance or even waterproofing, in the best cases. Higher numbers mean more protection, while the letter “X” means the device is not rated for protection in that regard. The ratings for water resistance are ranked on a scale of 1 to 9.</p><p>All but one of the models we tested for this guide is rated IPX4. That means there’s no dust protection, and the buds can withstand splashes from any direction but probably shouldn't be submerged. The most durable set of earbuds we tested, Jabra’s Elite Active 4, is rated IP57, which means a high level of both dust and water protection. Whereas the IPX 4 models can handle splashes, the Elite Active 4 can be immersed for up to 30 minutes in up to a meter (or about 3.2 feet) of water.</p><p>For a detailed breakdown of all the possible permutations, I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.enclosurecompany.com/ip-ratings-explained.php">this guide</a> published by a supplier called The Enclosure Company.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Earbuds we tested</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Durability rating</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beats Powerbeats Pro</p></td><td><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beats Fit Pro</p></td><td><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jabra Elite Active 4</p></td><td><p>IP57</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sony WF-C500</p></td><td><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro</p></td><td><p>IPX4</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Active noise cancelation</h3><p>For the 2022 update to this guide, I decided to add a note up top about active noise cancelation (ANC), simply because most of the available models now offer it. And since the user experience is actually pretty similar across different brands, I thought it would be easier to share what they have in common, rather than repeat myself.</p><p>First of all, no noise cancellation is perfect. If you’re looking for earbuds that you can continue wearing even after you’re done working out, you might still hear some background noise, whether it be your robot vacuum or cars honking. The difference in quality with ANC enabled is undeniable; just don’t take these companies’ marketing claims too literally. Besides, I don’t recommend active noise cancellation while exercising outdoors; it’s not safe. And even if you are working out indoors, I still think a noise cancellation horse race is probably beside the point for the purpose of this guide.</p><h2>The best all-purpose option: Jabra Elite 4 Active</h2><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Reasonably priced for the feature set; sleek, compact design; one of the lightest charging cases we tested (and some of the longest battery life); more durable than most; active noise cancelation, a transparency mode and customizable equalizer; works with Spotify Tap on Android.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Onboard controls aren’t intuitive, but Jabra offers helpful instructions in its app; less comfortable after prolonged use than other brands.</p></li></ul><p>Much like the Elite Active 75t we tested a few years back, the newer <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KYWJyYS1BY3RpdmUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUVhcmJ1ZHMtQnVpbHQvZHAvQjA5TVZHUVJERD90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NTZiZTJlMC1kYjk2LTMyNmQtYjU4Ny1jYTljZWEwMDk0Y2IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARnYSsBT4JpYdlSIBF9YSIbrkNj84GEq3S8C-kbzaxfn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJabra-Active-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built%2Fdp%2FB09MVGQRDD%3Fth%3D1">Elite Active 4 earbuds</a> make a strong first impression, with a compact, stylish design and a lightweight charging case to match. Available in three colors, the earbuds aren’t just small and light, but they look especially sleek given that they don’t have any wingtips. Though they felt comfortable when I first put them in, my ears did feel a little sore by the end of a run.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 37.5-gram case is also among the lightest we tested, but still offers some of the longest battery life, promising a total of 28 hours. (Each individual earbud on its own is rated for seven hours. Jabra says you can return to an hour’s worth of juice after a 10-minute charge.)</p><p>In my testing, the earbuds were easy to insert and pair. Less easy is learning how to use the things. As you might expect, you press the right earbud once to stop and resume playback. You can also double-press the right bud to skip a track, and triple press it to play it again. But some of the other onboard controls are less obvious. To increase the volume, hold down the right earbud for a second; to lower it, long press the left earbud. Meanwhile, single-pressing the left earbud allows you to toggle between active noise cancelation, HearThrough mode, or neither. Lastly, double press the left bud to use a voice assistant.</p><p>The good news is, you don’t have to commit all those finger gestures to memory: Jabra’s Sound+ App for iOS and Android contains a helpful illustrated tutorial, which I recommend keeping open on your phone as you get settled in with your new earbuds.</p><p>I mastered the controls quickly enough, but the physical buttons on the earbuds require a little more pressure and coordination to get an accurate press in. I found myself waiting until I had slowed to a walk before I started fiddling with the tracks. Even then, I needed to be very deliberate to make sure I got it right. And usually I did. That said, given there’s no physical volume rocker, I did wish there were an aural cue confirming I had moved the volume up or down a notch; the progression from louder to softer (or vice versa) is very subtle.</p><p>After a roughly 35-minute run the battery was still at 90 percent – a similar showing to what I saw on the Beats Fit Pro, also featured in this guide. Like the Elite Active 75t I tested previously, the Elite 4 Active uses Jabra’s HearThrough technology. With that enabled, I could hear cars along my running route, though on an especially windy day the gusts drowned out softer noises like footsteps behind me. That’s despite the earbuds having four built-in mics with what Jabra calls a “mesh covering” for added wind noise reduction.</p><p>Although I tested the Elite 4 Active on an iPhone 12, the earbuds have some additional features on Android, including support for Spotify Tap, which resumes where you last left off listening to your Spotify account on any device. Android users also get support for Alexa and Google’s Fast Pair tech.</p><p>While I recommend the Elite 4 Active for most people, it’s also worth quickly mentioning the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KYWJyYS1FbGl0ZS1BY3RpdmUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUVhcmJ1ZHMvZHAvQjA5RDE1RzhQRz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NTZiZTJlMC1kYjk2LTMyNmQtYjU4Ny1jYTljZWEwMDk0Y2IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUy7hmzcCdH3_xCP_qbebYgcWxE18Ot9b99fmkgi3sbK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJabra-Elite-Active-Bluetooth-Earbuds%2Fdp%2FB09D15G8PG%3Fth%3D1">Elite 7 Active</a>, which adds Jabra’s ShakeGrip technology for what the company claims is a more secure fit. You also get slightly better battery life – eight hours per bud, or 30 hours with the case – and even faster charging (an hour of playback after a five-minute charge). Lastly, choosing the Elite 7 Active over the Elite 4 Active gives you the option of either Google Assistant or Alexa, as well as voice guidance. However, you’d be giving up call controls, which you do get on the Elite 4 Active.</p><h2>The most comfortable option: Beats Powerbeats Pro</h2><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, stable fit; pairs seamlessly with iOS devices; intuitive controls with mirrored access on the left and right sides; tied with Sony for the longest earbud battery life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Ear-hook design isn’t the most discreet, and doesn’t fit so well with sunglasses; relatively heavy charging case; no active noise cancelation, transparency mode or customizable EQ; speaking to an assistant is slightly less convenient if it’s not Siri.</p></li></ul><p>For the purposes of this guide I tested two pairs of Beats headphones: the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlKTDQxTjlDL3JlZj1mc19hX2J0Ml91czE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta2MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU1NmJlMmUwLWRiOTYtMzI2ZC1iNTg3LWNhOWNlYTAwOTRjYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWFPdrEVVlXpzoWrYaCGgeRadqGmj1sPVmFxo7zyZRsP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JL41N9C%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us1">Beats Fit Pro</a> earbuds, and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qb3dlcmJlYXRzLVByby1Ub3RhbGx5LVdpcmVsZXNzLUVhcnBob25lcy9kcC9CMDdSNVFENTk4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NTZiZTJlMC1kYjk2LTMyNmQtYjU4Ny1jYTljZWEwMDk0Y2IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZPv0blVE_Qjfb-Ush6-ic8L71InYASz89F-9Nw1mSWT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones%2Fdp%2FB07R5QD598%3F">Powerbeats Pro</a>, earbuds with an over-the-ear hook design. I’ll start with the Powerbeats Pro, which I like better for exercising.</p><p>Other than being slightly conspicuous, the Powerbeats Pro comes in four colors and fits comfortably, though it doesn’t play as nicely with glasses and face masks as more compact in-ear designs. Compared to the other earbuds I tested, though, I felt especially confident the Powerbeats Pro would stay put during workouts.</p><p>Like Apple’s newest AirPods, the Powerbeats Pro use Apple’s H1 chip, which allows for particularly deep integration when you pair the earbuds with an Apple-made device. In addition to a fast, seamless pairing process, you can activate Siri by saying “Hey Siri,” without having to press a button. You can also share audio with other AirPods or Beats headphones, and can enjoy automatic switching between Apple devices.</p><p>For better and worse, the integration is so complete, in fact, that there’s no companion app; instead you check the earbuds’ and cases’ battery via other methods, such as a homescreen widget or by asking Siri.</p><p>The earbuds themselves are rated for nine hours of use, which is among the highest we’ve seen. The case is rated for a total of 24 hours of use, which isn’t bad, but given that it's not best in class you have to wonder why the case is as heavy as it is. (Heavy enough that my purse feels a little lighter without it.) iOS users won’t mind that the case charges via a Lightning cable and not USB-C, but others might be slightly put out.</p><p>If you’ve ever used AirPods or Apple’s old-school wired headphones, these should be pretty easy to master. Double-press the physical button on the earbud to skip tracks and triple-press it to go backward. I quickly came to love the physical key; it’s less finicky than a touch surface. I was also grateful for the mirroring of controls between the left and right earbuds — both left- and right-handed people should be happy.</p><p>Having tested other wireless earbuds that either lack onboard volume controls, or make it tedious, I have come to particularly appreciate the Powerbeats Pro’s onboard volume rockers – one for each earbud. I don’t know of any other workout earbuds that make it easier to adjust the volume, not even the Beats Fit Pro.</p><p>While it’s nice to have easier volume access, the audio experience is otherwise basic. There is no active noise cancellation or transparency mode. Not a dealbreaker for workouts, but something to consider if your goal is to get one pair of earbuds you can wear for everything.</p><p>Other features include support for voice assistants (yes, Google and Amazon too), but only Siri can be summoned by a voice command. You can also wear just one bud if you like (the right one) if all you need to do is talk on the phone, or if you want to keep an ear open to what’s going on around you.&nbsp;</p><h2>Honorable mention: Beats Fit Pro</h2><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Comfortable, stable fit; pairs easily with iOS devices; compact, lightweight charging case; adds ANC and transparency modes, which the Powerbeats Pro lacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> A smaller design than the Powerbeats Pro means shorter battery life and the loss of a physical volume rocker; no customizable EQ.</p></li></ul><p>One of my main complaints about the Powerbeats Pro is that they don’t fit as well if you’re wearing sunglasses (or, in pandemic times a mask). This is where the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlKTDQxTjlDL3JlZj1mc19hX2J0Ml91czE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta2MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU1NmJlMmUwLWRiOTYtMzI2ZC1iNTg3LWNhOWNlYTAwOTRjYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWFPdrEVVlXpzoWrYaCGgeRadqGmj1sPVmFxo7zyZRsP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JL41N9C%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us1">Beats Fit Pro</a> have the advantage: Their discreet design that promises to stay out of the way and safe even during sweaty workouts.</p><p>Available in four colors, the buds are easy to insert and comfortable to wear – just twist the bud to fold the wingtip into your upper ear. And, because the earbuds are smaller than the Powerbeats Pro, the case is markedly lighter and more compact (55g versus 80g on the Pro). Between the lightweight case and the less dorky design, the Beats Fit Pro make a strong case for themselves as earbuds you can wear not just during workouts, but everywhere.</p><p>Because the Beats Fit Pro were released more recently than the Powerbeats Pro, they have active noise cancellation, a feature older Powerbeats and AirPods products are lacking. At the same time, Apple built in a transparency mode – ideal for runners like me who would feel safer if they could still hear ambient cues like footsteps and car horns. Lastly, it supports Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spatial%20audio/">Spatial Audio</a> format for a more immersive sound and will automatically kick in if you’re playing a compatible track.</p><p>For working out, the audio is fine. But if you can only afford one pair of earbuds, my colleague Billy Steele indicated in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">review</a> that the sound quality is mediocre. He found calls could be patchy and, as he notes, Beats is one of the few brands that doesn’t offer users a customizable EQ.</p><p>Out of the box, the earbuds are set to active noise cancellation. There are two ways to adjust this: You can hold down the physical button on either earbud to cycle through audio profiles. Or, you can find the earbuds in your Bluetooth settings menu and click further to see a more detailed menu of options. Not only can you adjust the mode there, but you can also change what those physical buttons do. By default, they’re for toggling audio profiles, but you can also set them up so that one earbud controls volume up, and the other volume down. Personally, I preferred having the option of adjusting the volume from my earbuds mid-workout; it’s easy to just pick an audio mode before your run and stick with it.</p><p>Other than the slightly limited volume controls, the Beats Fit Pro works much like other Beats- and Apple-branded headphones. Press the physical button once to play or pause tracks; double press to skip forward; and triple press to replay a track. For anyone upgrading from an older pair of Beats or Apple earbuds, the transition should be easy. My only word of caution is that I found the physical button on the Beats Fit Pro harder to find by feel, as it’s smaller and less indented than the button on the Powerbeats Pro.</p><p>Apple rates the Beats Fit Pro for six hours of listening time per earbud, plus an additional 18 hours from the USB-C charging case. You can also wear just one bud if you like, to squeeze out even more runtime. In my testing, the battery on the buds dropped down to 89 percent after a 35-minute run. Extrapolate that, and the math comes close to Apple’s six-hours-per-bud claim. If you’ve managed to completely exhaust both the earbud and case, Apple says its “Fast Fuel” feature will get you back to one hour of use after five minutes of charging, the same claim Jabra makes for the comparably priced Elite Active 7. (Note: Apple’s one-hour estimate assumes you won’t be using ANC.)</p><p>Under the hood, the earbuds have the same Apple-made H1 chip as the Powerbeats Pro and Apple’s newer AirPods, allowing for hands-free “Hey Siri,” audio sharing with other AirPods or Beats headphones, and automatic switching between devices.

That would be the lightest case we tested, and nearly the lightest pair of earbuds, barring the much pricier Elite Active 7. It’s worth noting that a lighter charging case means shorter case battery life (a relatively low 20 hours). Even then, the earbuds themselves offer some of the longest battery life of the bunch: 10 hours per bud. If you do run low on charge, you can get back up to an hour’s worth of capacity in 10 minutes, Sony says.</p><p>The earbuds, available in four colors, were larger than I was expecting given their light weight, but they’re easy to insert and fit comfortably. They are slightly trickier to pair on iOS than other buds I tested for this guide, though Android users will benefit from support for Google Fast Pair.</p><p>By default, a robotic voice will tell you the earbuds’ battery charge as you’re putting them in. I found this useful, though it meant that there was a delay in getting to hear whatever I had been listening to. You can always disable voice guidance in Sony’s Headphones app if that bothers you.</p><p>The truth is, I rarely had range anxiety with these headphones anyway: Unlike other earbuds, which took a roughly 10 percent hit after my usual 35-minute run, these were still at 100 percent. It’s unlikely I’ll ever wear out both the buds and charging case before getting to a wall charger.</p><p>The controls were also easy to master without having to consult Sony’s companion app. On the right earbud, press once to play or pause audio playback, or to answer or end a call. Double press to skip tracks, and triple press to go to the previous song. Long-pressing the right earbud launches or cancels a voice assistant. You can also long press to decline a call. On the left earbud, some of the controls are mirrored: you can press once to receive/end a call, and long-press to reject it. The left bud is also where the volume controls live: press once to raise it, and hold the button down to lower it.</p><p>As one of the cheaper options in this guide, the WF-C500 are the only ones without active noise cancellation. Which to me, isn’t a dealbreaker. The eartips already do a good enough job passively blocking noise, to the point where I was startled when a group of runners ran up from behind in the park and passed me. If anything, I wished the earbuds had a transparency mode that would allow more ambient noise through. Fortunately I could still hear louder noises like nearby traffic.</p><p>The lack of ANC aside, the audio quality is quite good – which makes sense, given Sony’s heritage in audio and home theater gear. Like other models listed here (barring Beats, anyway), you can adjust the EQ in the companion app. And, as you might expect, the earbuds support Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/360%20reality%20audio/">360 Reality Audio</a> format, which is similar to Apple’s spatial tech, which in turn i<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">s built on the Dolby Atmos format</a>.</p><h2>The most customizable: Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro</h2><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The only buds we tested with wireless charging; long battery life, especially on the charging case; active noise cancelation, a transparency mode and customizable equalizer; lots of options for setting up the controls to your liking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Larger and a little harder to insert  than competing models; touch-sensitive controls can be finicky; worse sound quality than the competition; in-app battery indicator doesn’t give you a percentage.</p></li></ul><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb3VuZGNvcmUtTGliZXJ0eS1DYW5jZWxsaW5nLVdpcmVsZXNzLVBsYXl0aW1lL2RwL0IwOUNHTTFCV0g_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1rYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTU2YmUyZTAtZGI5Ni0zMjZkLWI1ODctY2E5Y2VhMDA5NGNiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAde2BoD6n_AfSmNUAp0R-Ra2dHS1ljHNI9QZ4juWmqdG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSoundcore-Liberty-Cancelling-Wireless-Playtime%2Fdp%2FB09CGM1BWH%3Fth%3D1">Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro</a> earbuds are available in four colors, and carry a big emphasis on ergonomic fit. That includes air-filled wings, silicone ear tips (similar to other brands) and a promise of air-pressure relief, per Anker. The earbuds don’t come with the eartips or wingtips attached, which adds some friction to the setup process but, on the plus side, you get a choice of four ear tip sizes, compared with three from most other headphone makers. Inside the Soundcore app you’ll find a fit test, but I actually ended up with a more comfortable fit by just following my gut. But it’s certainly worth playing around with.</p><p>The Liberty 3 Pro is right up there with the Sony CF-500 in terms of being some of the larger earbuds I tested for this guide. That said, they fit comfortably and stay put. I will say, however, that these were consistently harder to insert than some other brands I tested, even after I’d had a bit of practice.</p><p>When I originally published this guide, in September 2020, I ruled out Anker’s $55 Soundcore Spirit Dot 2 earbuds on account of their fussy touch controls and the fact that you couldn’t adjust the volume from the buds themselves. I’m happy to report that the situation has improved – mostly. First, the bad news: The controls are still finicky, and especially difficult to get right while moving. But, they do offer volume control. (Thank goodness.) The controls are also programmable inside the Soundcore app. So you can at least customize the long press and single, double and triple taps in a way that feels intuitive. In addition to music and volume playback, you can also use the controls to toggle audio modes or to activate a voice assistant (Google or Alexa).</p><p>Just as you can modify the earbud controls, you have options as far as sound quality, too. There are ANC and transparency modes, along with a “normal” setting in between. Also, like Sony and Jabra, Anker allows you to customize the EQ from within the app. Interestingly, wind reduction is a feature you have to actively opt into. Anker says this is because the wind reducing mode dings ANC performance, and since it’s unlikely people will often find themselves in strong winds, it may as well not be turned on by default. Later this year, Anker will push out a software update that will add “enhanced vocal mode,” which promises to increase vocal pickup in the area around you, according to an Anker spokesperson.</p><p>Additionally, Anker touts three mics per earbud, along with AI noise reduction. I can’t prove that there’s a connection here, but I did notice they sounded a little tinnier compared with other headphones. Sometimes, some random buzz even crept in. It’s hard to know if that slight distortion is a result of the AI doing its work, but I wonder.</p><p>As for battery life, the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro has the distinction of being the only earbuds we tested for this guide with a case that can charge wirelessly. The buds themselves are rated for eight hours apiece, or 32 hours with the case, making this the longest-lasting charging case we tested for this story. Anker also says that you can return to three hours of capacity after 15 minutes of charging. After a 35-minute run, the battery indicator in the app showed a mostly full charge, though unfortunately Anker doesn’t give you a percentage.</p>

## UK competition watchdog says Microsoft’s Activision merger ‘could harm’ gamers

<p>The UK's competition authority has found that Microsoft's proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard could result in a &quot;substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles&quot; and &quot;could harm UK gamers.&quot; In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-activision-deal-could-harm-uk-gamers">provisional finding</a>, the Competition Markets Authority (CMA) said that Activision may need to be split up into separate businesses for the merger to proceed.&nbsp;</p><p>The government said it conducted a wide-ranging probe over the last five months to determine the deal's potential impact. Noting that Microsoft already accounts for 60-70 percent of global cloud gaming services, it said that buying Activision would &quot;reinforce this strong position&quot; and substantially reduce Microsoft's competition in cloud gaming. That in turn could &quot;potentially [harm] UK gamers, particularly those who cannot afford or do not want to buy an expensive gaming console or gaming PC.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CMA said that the deal may work if Activision Blizzard divested parts of its business. Namely, it could split out either the Activision and/or Blizzard segments, or the business that operates its biggest franchise, Call of Duty (CoD). The idea, it said, would be to leave assets &quot;capable of competing effectively under separate ownership&quot; with the new business.</p><p>In response, Microsoft said it has already addressed the CMA's concerns over competition. &quot;We are committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions that address the CMA’s concerns,&quot; Microsoft corporate VP and deputy general counsel Rima Alaily told Engadget in a statement. &quot;Our commitment to grant long term 100 percent equal access to Call of Duty to Sony, Nintendo, Steam and others preserves the deal’s benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market.&quot;</p><p>First <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html">announced</a> last year, the merger would allow Microsoft to add titles like Call of Duty to its already impressive suite of games. The deal ran afoul of regulators from the get-go, though, over concerns that it would block out Sony's PS5 and other consoles from key games, particularly CoD. Rival Sony vehemently opposes the deal, having called it a &quot;game-changer that poses a threat to our industry.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Last September, the CMA announced it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-competition-markets-authority-activision-blizzard-microsoft-concerns-monopoly-130432082.html">launching an anti-trust investigation</a> into the deal. The US Federal Trade Commission has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">sued to block the takeover</a>, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">EU is set</a> to make a decision on April 11th with a statement of objections.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft said at the time that the CMA's concerns were misplaced and that its arguments were based on &quot;self-serving statements by Sony.&quot; In November, it confirmed that it would support Call of Duty on PlayStation &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-promises-support-call-of-duty-playstation-forever-060216077.html">forever</a>&quot; and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-call-of-duty-nintendo-consoles-053027619.html">promised</a> to bring it to Nintendo's Switch consoles and Steam as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft now has until February 22nd to address the CMA's concerns, with a final report from the regulator due April 26th. &quot;Our job is to make sure that UK gamers are not caught in the crossfire of global deals that, over time, could damage competition and result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation. We have provisionally found that this may be the case here,&quot; said Martin Coleman, who chaired a panel of independent experts conducting the probe.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: Microsoft’s next-gen Bing is ‘more powerful’ than ChatGPT

<p>Bing may be back. Microsoft announced yesterday it’s partnering with OpenAI to enhance <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">Bing with its AI technology</a>. However, Microsoft also had a surprise up its sleeve: The next release of Bing will tap into a new next-generation language model the company claims is &quot;much more powerful&quot; than ChatGPT and designed specifically to excel at search.</p><p>During its event, Yusuf Mehdi, the company's consumer chief marketing officer, demoed the new Bing, asking it to compare the most influential Mexican artists and their best-known paintings. Bing displayed its response in a new side panel with annotations and weblinks. Later, Mehdi asked the search engine to compare three pet vacuums while listing the pros and cons of each model.</p><p>With the chat feature, you can ask Bing to create a five-day travel itinerary for you, including links to accommodation, flights and things to do. The new Bing is already available to preview. You can visit Bing.com – which I haven’t done since 2009 – to try a few sample queries and sign up for the waitlist for when it launches in earnest.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Virgin Orbit's first UK orbital launch may have failed due to a $100 component

<p>Virgin Orbit's first orbital launch from UK soil, which was supposed to be a huge milestone for the company and for the region, may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-first-ever-uk-space-flight-virgin-orbit-startmeup-fails-to-reach-orbit-061912341.html">ended in failure</a> because of a component that cost around $100. According to <a href="https://spacenews.com/virgin-orbit-narrows-down-cause-of-launcherone-failure/"><em>SpaceNews</em></a>, Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart has revealed at the SmallSat Symposium in Mountain View, California that the evidence so far points to a filter in the rocket's second stage engine getting dislodged and causing issues.</p><p>If you'll recall, the company launched its historic &quot;Start Me Up&quot; mission from Spaceport Cornwall on January 9th, and things seemed to flow smoothly at first. Virgin's LauncherOne rocket was able to detach from its carrier aircraft, and the company reported a successful stage separation. But soon, it became clear that the rocket wasn't able to reach orbit as planned. &quot;[The rocket's] upper stage experienced an anomaly,&quot; a company spokesperson told <em>Engadget</em> at the time, and that &quot;prematurely ended the first burn of the upper stage.&quot; They added: &quot;This event ended the mission, with the rocket components and payload falling back to Earth within the approved safety corridor without ever achieving orbit.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The LauncherOne rocket for the mission was carrying satellites from seven customers, including government entities. One of its payloads was a joint project between the UK Defense Science and Technology Laboratory and the US Naval Research Laboratory called CIRCE (Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction CubeSat Experiment). Virgin Orbit promised to conduct a full investigation into the root cause of the anomaly, but it didn't wait for results to come back before announcing that it was going to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-orbit-aims-new-uk-satellite-launch-2023-01-12/">attempt another UK launch</a> as soon as later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The company isn't done with its investigation, Hart said during the event, but he was confident enough to reveal the investigators' findings: &quot;Everything points to, right now, a filter that was clearly there when we assembled the rocket but was not there as the second stage engine started, meaning it was dislodged and caused mischief downstream,&quot; he said. &quot;This is like a $100 part that took us out.&quot; Hart also said that Virgin Orbit is no longer going to use that filter and that it's currently looking for potential fixes.&nbsp;</p>

## Samsung's 77-inch S95C QD-OLED TV goes on sale for $4,500

<p>Samsung's latest 77-inch S95 QD-OLED TV generated some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2023-qd-oled-t-vs-will-hit-up-to-2000-nits-of-peak-brightness-090401455.html">buzz</a> at CES this year thanks to brightness levels up to 2,000 nits, 144Hz refresh rates and more. Now, the company has revealed that you'll pay to get those premium features: $4,500 for the 77-inch model, with shipping set to start in the US on February 15th.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, Samsung's 2023 QD-OLED TV lineup will supposedly hit up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness, a bit more than LG's latest OLED models and approaching Mini-LED TVs. That's thanks to a new QD-OLED Panel from Samsung Display, which uses a new "HyperEfficient EL" OLED material and Samsung's IntelliSense AI. The TVs will also be more energy efficient and offer more accurate colors, according to Samsung Display.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 144Hz refresh rate will make it great for gaming, as it already offers the lowest input lag you can get on any TV or monitor at just 0.1 milliseconds. As HDTVTest's Vincent Teoh <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj0zYVY4NlBNTW84YyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGFlYzQ1ZWUtY2MzNy00YzNhLWE2ODItZmE2Zjk2MDBjYWVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYIuOdePKl-7bJWrC8q2xvEQCY17oKVerVG62tH65Db9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3aV86PMMo8c">pointed out</a>, the 77-inch S95C will come with an external connect box, which allowed Samsung to make the panel extremely thin and reduce bezel sizes down to the bare minimum. However, as with all other Samsung TVs, it doesn't support Dolby Vision, using Samsung's HDR 10+ instead.&nbsp;</p><p>The price is a bit more than LG's comparable 77-inch G2 model from last year, priced at $4,200. If you order before February 20th, though, Samsung will throw in free installation worth around $200. The company has yet to reveal pricing across the rest of its lineup, but last year's 55- and 65-inch models cost $2,200 and $3,000, respectively.</p>

<p>Apple has expanded the internal testing for its Pay service's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pay-later-announced-172757123.html">buy now, pay later feature</a> to include its retail employees, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-08/apple-expands-test-of-its-pay-later-service-to-retail-staff?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. When the tech giant's experimental features make their way to its retail staff, that's typically a sign that it's going to be released in the near future. Apple Store workers started testing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-26-apple-credit-card-august-launch.html">company's credit card</a> in 2019 a month before it became available, and staff at its HQ visitor center tested Tap to Pay shortly before the first partner companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-tap-to-pay-iphone-public-launch-115532796.html">Square</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-venmo-support-tap-to-pay-iphone-092025702.html">PayPal</a> launched support for the payment solution.&nbsp;</p><p>The tech giant first announced the pay later functionality for Apple Pay at its WWDC event in June 2022. It was supposed to arrive alongside iOS 16, but the company changed its mind and rolled out the new mobile platform without the feature in tow. <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pay-later-delayed-report-154805741.html">reported at the time</a> that the company was having &quot;fairly significant technical and engineering challenges in rolling out the service,&quot; which led to delays.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Apple introduced pay later, it said the payment option will give users a way to split the cost of purchases into four equal installments paid over six weeks with no additional interest or fees. Gurman now says that the company is also working with Goldman Sachs Group to offer an option that splits up the cost of large purchases into several months with interest on top. Seeing as the company even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-financing-subsidiary-223140051.html">established its own subsidiary</a> to conduct customer credit checks and approvals, it's not hard to believe that it has plans to introduce more pay later options in the future.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A photo render showing how Apple's buy now, pay later feature works." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c5f133b0-a773-11ed-abbf-15fae744d2be" style="height: 896; width: 1195;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p></p>

## Canon's $680 EOS R50 is its most affordable RF camera yet

<p>Canon is adding a new, more affordable entry point into its RF mirrorless camera ecosystem. Alongside the full-frame EOS R8, the company unveiled today the EOS R50, an APS-C RF mount camera that will start at $680 when it goes on sale later this year. Canon didn’t send over a full spec sheet, but judging from the information the company did share, the R50 could quickly become a go-to for many beginners.</p><p>The camera features a 24.2-megapixel sensor capable of capturing uncropped 4K video footage at up to 30 frames per second. The R50 can also shoot 1080p video at up to 60 frames per second and S&amp;Q-style slo-mo footage at up to 120 frames per second. What’s more, Canon claims the camera can capture a full hour of continuous footage. Despite its modest price, the R50 also includes the company's excellent Dual Pixel autofocus technology, with built-in subject detection for people, animals and vehicles. Best of all, the tech is available for both stills and video.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Canon's $680 EOS R50 is its most affordable RF camera yet" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/a3eb1160-a74f-11ed-b9df-90825b68cdc7" style="height: 1182; width: 1750;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>You don't get any log modes, but it does have HDR PQ which also gives you 10-bit video — not bad for a budget camera. Other video features include a microHDMI port for external video, both microphone and headphone ports, and UVC compatibility for direct webcam streaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Burst shooting speeds are great at this price as well: 12 fps in electronic first-curtain shutter mode (there's no full mechanical shutter) and 15 fps in electronic shutter mode, both with servo AF. It'll only capture 13 C-RAW+JPEG files in a burst though, likely due to the slow UHS-I SD card support. There's no in-body stabilization (IS) at that price, but it can use the IS built into lenses or digital stabilization (with a crop) for vlogging. It also has an OLED viewfinder, which many cameras in this price range don't, though resolution is fairly low at 2.36 million dots.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Top render of Canon's EOS R50, showing the PSAM dial, record button and ISO dial.

The RF-S55-210mm is a compact telephoto lens with a full-frame equivalent field of view between 88mm and 336mm. It features a variable f/5 to f/7.1 aperture, four-and-a-half stops of built-in optical stabilization and close-focusing capabilities. The RF-S55-210mm IS STM isn’t the fastest option in Canon’s RF lens stable, but it does add some much-needed choice on the APS-C side of things.</p><p>At $680 for body-only, the R50 slots under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r-7-and-eos-r-10-rf-mount-crop-sensor-cameras-090900429.html">EOS R10</a>, which was previously Canon’s most affordable RF mirrorless camera. Effectively, the R50 is a more capable version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canons-eos-m-50-mark-ii-mirrorless-camera-is-aimed-at-creators-093954801.html">EOS M50 Mark II</a> that’s less than $100 more expensive and doesn’t limit you to Canon’s dead-end EF-M mount system. It’s also competitive against Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html">ZV-E10</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-lightweight-z-30-mirrorless-aps-c-camera-targets-content-creators-093725302.html">Nikon’s Z30</a>, which cost about the same but don’t offer an electronic viewfinder. The EOS R50 will arrive later this year. In addition to selling the body on its own, Canon will bundle the camera as part of a Content Creator Kit that will ship with a microphone, 18-45mm kit lens and grip for $800.</p>

## Canon's 24-megapixel EOS R8 is its most affordable full-frame mirrorless camera

<p>Canon has put Sony and its other rivals on blast with the launch of the $1,500 24-megapixel EOS R8, its cheapest full-frame camera yet. Released alongside the $680 R50 APS-C model, it's targeted to photographers and video creators on a budget. However, it's got some impressive features like uncropped, oversampled 4K video up 60 fps, shooting speeds up to 40 fps and Canon's excellent Dual Pixel autofocus.&nbsp;</p><p>On the photography front, the R8 can shoot at up to 6 fps with the first-curtain electronic shutter (like the R50, there's no fully mechanical shutter) or a whopping 40 fps with the electronic shutter. That sounds great, but rolling shutter may be an issue in electronic mode for fast moving subjects. It can capture up to a very respectable 100 C-RAW + JPEG files at a time to the single UHS-II card slot. The autofocus systems looks strong, using Canon's Dual Pixel AF along with AI subject detection for people, animals and vehicles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SoWR640q-RmLWXb2-rmJ70OlvA77DYn2/view?usp=share_link" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c975e940-a755-11ed-bfef-193a79c99290" style="height: 1600; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>For video, you can capture 4K video up to 60 fps with 6K oversampling, or Full HD at up to 180 fps — quite impressive considering the price. Editing-friendly ALL-I capture is supported up to 4K 30p with a 470Mbps data rate. It supports up to two hours of continuous recording with no 30-minute limit, though 4K 60p and 180 fps Full HD shooting times are thermally limited to around 30 minutes. You can shoot 10-bit HDR PQ or Canon Log-3 video, so this would be the perfect budget vlogging camera if not for the overheating situation. It also has focus breathing compensation (for select lenses).</p><p>The main thing missing compared to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r-6-ii-review-an-excellent-hybrid-camera-with-few-flaws-140005140.html">$2,500 EOS R6 II</a> is 5-axis in-body stabilization. However, it does have optical stabilization with supported lenses and Canon's Movie Digital IS, which works in concert with lens stabilization.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Canon's 24-megapixel EOS R8 is its most affordable full-frame camera" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/facb2730-a755-11ed-beb3-66996f48eb01" style="height: 1600; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>Other features include a micro-HDMI port that supports up to 4K 60p, mic and headphone ports, an LP-E17 battery (no CIPA battery life provided yet) and USB webcam support. The 3-inch, 1.62 million dot display flips out for vloggers, but the OLED electronic viewfinder is a low-end unit with 2.36-million dots of resolution.</p><p>Despite the low price, there are no red flags I can see on the R8 (pending a full review, of course). At a full $1,000 below the R6 II, it looks like a great camera particularly for vloggers and content creators. Canon also introduced a budget full-frame kit lens, the RF24-50mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM, selling by itself for $300. The EOS R8 goes on sale in the spring of 2023 for $1,500, or $1,700 with the aforementioned lens.&nbsp;</p>
