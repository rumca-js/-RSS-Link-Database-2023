Our advice then (as now) was to be careful when looking for Radeon software, plus maintaining good search habits in general. Life&rsquo;s far easier when you sidestep malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, this incident seemed more of a one-off reason for heightened awareness. Even with the more recent report about <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1487690/phony-bitwarden-ads-are-the-latest-to-slip-through-on-googles-watch.html\">Bitwarden suffering from a similar issue</a>, using Google seemed mostly business as usual. Turns out though our threat alert should be set much higher&mdash;other major downloads like Adobe Reader, Microsoft Teams, OBS, Slack, and Gimp are being targeted, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As thoughtfully detailed by <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1487690/phony-bitwarden-ads-are-the-latest-to-slip-through-on-googles-watch.html\">Ars Technica</a>, the sharp rise in malvertising is a new phenomenon, stemming from Microsoft&rsquo;s improved blocking of dangerous Word macros. When one field dried up, bad actors simply moved to another to farm. The trend is bad enough that security researchers have sounded the alarm&mdash;but so far, Google hasn&rsquo;t squashed the issue yet, though the company commented to Ars that &ldquo;addressing [the increase in malicious text ads] is a critical priority.&rdquo; Until a proper fix goes live, that leaves everyone who uses Google search to fend for themselves in the meanwhile.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Results for &quot;mcafee&quot; in Google\" class=\"wp-image-1502836\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Untitled-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>One of these links is not like the others.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can you do? The pat answer is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t click on results labeled as ads,&rdquo; of course. You can also always check the link address to verify its authenticity, plus scroll down the page to see if you spot a duplicate result. Currently, if you see a second link for the same site, that one is usually more trustworthy, since ads get placed right at the top of results. And as a final safety net, you can install an ad-blocker on your browser, like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-1502809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">uBlock Origin</a>. Sites you trust and want to support can get manually added to the extension&rsquo;s approved list (which allows ads to show), while all others (including Google) will get screened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of these precautions are bulletproof on their lonesome, but added all together, you should be able to steer clear of most bad links. And when you do click on a search result? Don&rsquo;t download and install anything until you&rsquo;ve had a good look at the page. Make sure you scan any downloads with antivirus software</p>\n\nInternet</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502186/blizzard-promises-to-make-overwatch-2-better-but-im-suspicious.html", "title": "Overwatch 2 started off rough.

Well. Not even the other team. One lone character. One lone character with an ultimate ability that extends indefinitely so long as it&rsquo;s dealing damage, letting them wipe your team completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Lol,&rdquo; came the match chat message from the Ramattra in question. &ldquo;His ult is so overpowered right now&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an often toxic game that yet increased in toxicity after going free to play, those words drove home just <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html\">how terrible <em>Overwatch 2</em> has been</a>. The source of my team&rsquo;s pain was <em>apologetic</em>. That person knew exactly what the rest of us did&mdash;<em>OW2</em>&rsquo;s character balance is still never quite right. And even after Blizzard&rsquo;s recent promises to address Season 2&rsquo;s issues, this interaction remains the closest I&rsquo;ve ever gotten to hearing someone say sorry for the all problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone who played Season 2 deserves a dang apology, too. At the end of Season 1, things were looking up&mdash;server issues solved and gameplay feeling more balanced. I even came to enjoy ranked play more than unranked, because I got sorted with all the other noobs and we did fun, dumb noob stuff together. I loved it. My Diamond- and Master-ranked friends would watch my game replays and hurt inside; I simply looked forward to the next round of us clumsy puppies tripping over ourselves.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Promo image of Ramattra from the official Overwatch 2 blog\" class=\"wp-image-1502206\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ramattra.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>This is Ramattra.

My friends warned me the matchmaker would be broken for the first week or two, but I never anticipated the slaughter awaiting me. I queued for game after game in ranked, only to eventually realize I wasn&rsquo;t getting paired with similar skill level players. The matchmaker was filling in with veterans on both sides. Occasionally, my team&rsquo;s strongest players carried us newbs and weaklings, but mostly we all suffered through complete carnage. After dozens of matches in the first two weeks where I tried and failed to help my team, I gave up. So did most of my friends, which then killed the appeal of unranked mode&mdash;it&rsquo;s easier to suffer through unbalanced teams when you can sigh about it with people you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blizzard seems to finally be addressing player concerns <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23910162/&amp;xcust=2-1-1502186-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">about ranked mode</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2023/01/31/overwatch-2-will-nerf-ramattras-ultimate-in-season-3-with-a-time-limit/?sh=ef44e2e1fb32&amp;xcust=2-1-1502186-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramattra&rsquo;s ridiculous ultimate</a>, and even <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.polygon.com/23579894/overwatch-2-season-3-updates-ramattra-balance-credits-hero-gallery-skins&amp;xcust=2-1-1502186-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">the lack of earnable in-game currency</a> in the upcoming Season 3, but it feels a little late. Especially since the developer seems to hold the player base responsible for their own discontent&mdash;in its blog post about Season 2, the developer said that &ldquo;The new ranked mode suffered from poor comprehension&rdquo; and &ldquo;There was confusion around players&rsquo; real rank and how that translated to their skill level.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I refuse to take blame for not understanding a system when the people in charge can&rsquo;t (<em>won&rsquo;t</em>) clearly explain the system they created. Blizzard is the only entity in <em>Overwatch 2</em> determining someone&rsquo;s <em>real rank</em> and classifying the skill levels, much less how the designations change over time. However, instead of explaining it to the audience, we&rsquo;re apparently the problem. If a developer doesn&rsquo;t care enough about its players to properly explain things to them, what&rsquo;s even the point of playing?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch 2 battle pass\" class=\"wp-image-1359595\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-2-battle-pass.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Battle passes, meh.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is my investment in the franchise is relatively low. I started just six months before the end of the first game, and only for social reasons. I&rsquo;ve cycled through <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Halo Infinite</em>, and now <em>Overwatch 2</em> as a way to stay current with my buddies, and there&rsquo;s no shortage of other games to continue in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blizzard probably doesn&rsquo;t care if I quit, nor if my friends do. We&rsquo;re not buying the battle passes each season. I&rsquo;m not supporting a game in this state with my money&mdash;nor am I eager to with my time after the emotional dumpster fire of Season 2.

It is, bar none, the biggest video game to ever use the ever-popular <em>Harry Potter</em> license. A <em>Dragon Age-</em>style open-world RPG, made by Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche Software (recently of the scuttled <em>Disney Infinity</em>), it&rsquo;s kind of a huge deal. The game been sitting at the top of the Steam sales charts even as a pre-order. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, the game has become controversial. <em>Harry Potter</em> creator J.K. Rowling has been a lightning rod of controversy for several years, and while it doesn&rsquo;t appear that she has any direct involvement in the game, it&rsquo;s hard to deny that buying it means supporting her financially. Plenty of <em>Harry Potter</em> fans aren&rsquo;t willing to do that, for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/how-harry-potter-fans-are-coping-with-jk-rowling&amp;xcust=2-1-1499840-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reasons that are both well-known</a> and beyond the scope of PCWorld&rsquo;s coverage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But neither Warner Bros. nor Rowling have an exclusive on the idea of teenage wizards and witches. So if you need to scratch that <em>Harry Potter</em> itch and you don&rsquo;t want to buy the game (or go see increasingly terrible spin-off movies), I&rsquo;ve got a humble suggestion: watch a bunch of nerds play Dungeons and Dragons instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>Misfits and Magic</em>, a <em>Kids on Brooms</em> actual play</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, some qualifications. The bunch of nerds in question are professional actors, comedians, and other masters of improvising in front of a camera. And the game they&rsquo;re playing isn&rsquo;t <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, though the actual play format is certainly inspired by it. No, in the <em>Misfits and Magic</em> mini-season of long-running D&amp;D show <em>Dimension 20</em>, game master Aabria Iyengar chose to use the <em>Kids on Brooms</em> system to tell her story. It&rsquo;s a tale that mixes the familiar and the deliberately subversive: four diverse American kids are invited to become the first exchange students at a prestigious British school of witchcraft and wizardry. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cast is filled with veterans of the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_play&amp;xcust=2-1-1499840-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">emerging, and booming, actual play genre</a>. Lou Wilson (a regular <em>Dimension 20</em> player and as of 2022 the announcer for <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>) plays Whitney Jammer, a Chicago high school athlete who&rsquo;s all about the team, whatever team he might be on. Erika Ishii (whom gamers will recognize from <em>Apex Legends, Deathloop, </em>and <em>Desitny 2</em>) plays Karen Tanaka, AKA &ldquo;:xxBrokenDreamxx&rdquo;, AKA Dream, a terminally online kid from Seattle who knows the local Hot Topic layout by heart. Danielle Radford (a regular writer from YouTube&rsquo;s <em>Honest Trailers</em>) plays Sam Black, a girl from Portland who&rsquo;s already well into a successful influencer career. And <em>Dimension 20</em>&lsquo;s usual GM, Brennan Lee Mulligan, shifts into the player character chair to embody Evan Kelmp, a gawky but sweet homeless kid who may or may not be this world&rsquo;s version of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iyengar sets the stage with familiar scenes: all four of the Misfits are going about their regular lives in America when they&rsquo;re delivered letters by owl, inviting them to Gawpenny Academy, a prestigious school that will be familiar to anyone who knows the skyline of a certain Scottish castle by heart. They&rsquo;re dropped into a wizarding world that has little knowledge or care for the non-magical one they came from, instantly out of place as both Americans and fledgling wizards. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"this-seems-familiar\">This seems familiar&hellip;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows are role-playing sessions that exhibit both deep love for, and skeptical takedowns of, the <em>Harry Potter</em> world. The player characters (and pretty much <em>only </em>the player characters) are very much aware of Rowling&rsquo;s franchise, and the parts of it that are either problematic or ridiculous. During Gawpenny&rsquo;s equivalent of the Sorting Hat ceremony, for example, the kids call out the practice as a medieval form of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(education)&amp;xcust=2-1-1499840-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">educational tracking</a>, and wonder at the expectation of a school house that seems to be explicitly reserved for &ldquo;evil&rdquo; kids. Evan, very much aware of his status as a possible Damien-style world-ender, doesn&rsquo;t appreciate it. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Misfits and magic illustration: Jammer orders a McRib from a magic table\" class=\"wp-image-1500068\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mcrib-misfits-and-magic.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dropout.TV</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The players, like the characters they embody, are also very aware of <em>Harry Potter</em> and some of the issues that have been raised with the series in the last four years. Iyengar&rsquo;s setting, while generally conforming to the expectations of Hogwarts, welcomes the realities of modern kids (and particularly modern <em>American </em>kids of widely different backgrounds). The kids, unlike the adults, are more than willing to take on topics of race, classism, sexism, and the expectations that all of them can place on young people. Though it should be pointed out that there&rsquo;s a bit of an incongruence in adults playing the role of teenagers: this show would get a TV-MA rating for language alone if it was broadcast on TV. It&rsquo;s very much made for <em>adult </em>fans of <em>Harry Potter</em>, not those who are still within its recommended age group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show serves as a great introduction to both the actual play format, already made popular by shows like <em>Critical Role </em>and <em>Dimension 20</em>, and the <em>Kids on Brooms </em>system from Renegade Game Studios. The latter is a much simpler, easier-to-pick up role-playing game than <em>D&amp;D</em>, using far fewer stats, dice, and general <em>gunk </em>than you might expect. The addition of adversity tokens, points earned by failing that can be shared between players and applied to future rolls, means that even a disastrous roll isn&rsquo;t without its upside. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Misfits and magic: Lou Wilson, Erika Ishii\" class=\"wp-image-1500074\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/misfits-and-magic-wand-ishii.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dropout.TV</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shorter, punchier series of just four episodes (less than ten hours total) does without the impressive set dressing that <em>Dimension 20</em> is known for. You won&rsquo;t get elaborate miniature battle sets or fancy editing. It&rsquo;s just five people playing in the theater of the mind, with the occasional illustration thrown on screen to help the viewer&rsquo;s imagination. But the earnestness and depth with which Iyengar and company play their roles make it compelling from start to finish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mulligan in particular shines playing just one character rather than his usual dozens: Evan&rsquo;s tales of desperately finding food or a place to sleep, in addition to possibly being an incipient dark lord, are alternately shocking and hilarious. Ishii&rsquo;s Dream, coming to terms with the disappointment of both the world of magic and her own self-expectations, goes through a similar and deliberately mirrored arc. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"poking-fun-with-pointy-wands\">Poking fun with pointy wands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Misfits and Magic</em> takes <em>Harry Potter </em>to task even while reveling in its tropes. But it does so without the biting cynicism you might expect. While the characters do call BS on a lot of the actions of both the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Hogwarts and its in-universe equivalent, many of those points are just as salient hurled at real-world educational systems and the assumptions therein. Even so, the overall attitude is one of compassion and acceptance, at first between the player characters, and eventually the other students played by Iyengar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since pretty much everyone involved has at least some degree of comedy chops, the results are frequently hilarious. Four American kids trying to order a McRib from a magical British kitchen (this time <em>without </em>the weird inclusion of slavery) is a sight to behold, even if you&rsquo;ll have to imagine almost all of the scene in your head. The &ldquo;common fucking sense die,&rdquo; which allows players to get tangible gameplay boosts for subverting the magical narrative with real-world smarts, is an especially brilliant addition. But as the series wraps up, the feeling is more of wholesomeness than comedy: watching these kids find a home and a second family tugs all the heartstrings that the <em>Harry Potter</em> books do, and then some. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first episode of <em>Misfits and Magic</em> is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1VffF1Z5-Y&amp;xcust=2-1-1499840-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">available to watch for free on YouTube</a>.

The better your timing of release, the further you&rsquo;ll sling the gnome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"loteria\">Loteria</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/loteria-100900645-orig.jpg?auto=webp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"loteria\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/loteria-100900645-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-loteria&amp;xcust=2-1-395046-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loteria</a>, often referred to as Mexican Bingo, is a traditional Mexican card game. The announcer shows a card, and you have to quickly see if you have a match on yours. Unlike bingo, the pattern you must make on your card changes each game.

If you do, quickly drag and drop a bean on the card. If you don&rsquo;t, then just wait until the announcer shows the next card. Match the pattern required for a win to complete the game.

Amazon&rsquo;s selling the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Pulsefire-Haste-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09TLCRGMN?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1502450-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HyperX Pulsefire Haste wireless gaming mouse for $49.99</a>, which is a savings of $30. The incredibly lightweight mouse weighs a total of 61 grams and the honeycomb shell design is just super cool to look at, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pulsefire Haste mouse has a maximum DPI of 16,000, six programmable buttons, and customizable RGB lighting. HyperX even claims it has up to 100 hours of battery life on a single charge, which is nothing to sneeze at. Inside the honeycomb structure, you&rsquo;ll find TTC Gold switches, which are a good option for first person shooter games, as the actuation point is rather high. The mouse is also water resistant and it comes with grip tape. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a killer deal. I love the design so much that I&rsquo;m tempted to buy one myself!</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Pulsefire-Haste-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09TLCRGMN&amp;xcust=2-1-1502450-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the HyperX Pulsefire Haste wireless gaming mouse for $49.99 at Amazon</a></p>\nMice</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502375/razers-ultralight-wireless-mouse-costs-280-speed-holes-included.html", "title": "Razer\u2019s ultralight wireless mouse costs $280, speed holes included", "date_published": "2023-02-03 14:43:21+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last few years mouse makers have been punching a bunch of holes in their designs to make them lighter, like that one car salesman on The Simpsons selling a car with &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/T8ASgGwxJyc&amp;xcust=2-1-1502375-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">speed holes</a>.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s become a definite niche for ultra-twitchy gamers, and Razer isn&rsquo;t one to shirk a trend. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-viper-mini-signature-edition&amp;xcust=2-1-1502375-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Viper Mini Signature Edition</a> combines a new magnesium alloy chassis (the same kind used in high-end laptops) with a holey hexagonal &ldquo;exoskeleton&rdquo; to make a 49-gram little monster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mouse has plenty of bells and whistles. We&rsquo;re talking a 30,000 DPI sensor, third-gen optical primary switches rated for up to 90 million clicks, and Razer&rsquo;s proprietary HyperSpeed wireless (sans Bluetooth, because l33t gamers can&rsquo;t stand the latency). In wireless mode it&rsquo;s good for up to 60 hours, and you can plug it in to a USB Type C cord when that runs short. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer viper mini signature edition\" class=\"wp-image-1502425\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/razer-ultralight-mouse-with-holes-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But that being said, there are a few omissions as well. There&rsquo;s no dock charger, no tilt on the scroll wheel, and it uses the standard five-button shooter configuration. There&rsquo;s only room for one saved profile in the mouse&rsquo;s local memory, and perhaps most shockingly, Razer&rsquo;s RGB lighting is nowhere to be seen. All that must have been necessary to cut in order to make the mouse so light. 49 grams isn&rsquo;t the lightest on the market, even among wireless models. But it beats Razer&rsquo;s previous best, the Viper V2 Pro, by almost 10 grams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viper Mini Signature Edition comes with a surprising amount of add-ons. including a set of grip tape stickers, a set of feet in both PTFE (the same stuff that goes inside non-stick pans) and Gorilla Glass, and a microfiber cleaning cloth. You&rsquo;ll need it: Razer recommends cleaning the mouse at least once a month, since its guts are on display and you&rsquo;re constantly fondling it with your gross human sausage fingers. Good thing it comes with a three year warranty, a new best for Razer. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viper mini signature box and accessories\" class=\"wp-image-1502427\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viper-mini-signature-box.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>How much will you need to pay for this ultralight luxury?

Most gamers don&rsquo;t even need all the bells and whistles of a luxury keyboard like a bazillion programmable keys and RBG lighting that syncs with your music.

Cherry switches are durable and have high actuation points, which helps prevent inaccurate key presses. That said, they can be expensive. Luckily for you, there are more affordable options out there in the universe, so I encourage you to explore. Outemu switches, for example, are a fantastic option for budget mechanical keyboards. Essentially, they&rsquo;re Cherry clones made in China. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Gamesir VX blue switches\" class=\"wp-image-1479970\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gamesir-switches.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"919\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">GameSir</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-most-people-dont-need-the-extra-bits\">3.

Most folks don&rsquo;t need all the extras. My recommendation is to spring for an affordable keyboard with the most important functions, namely the sound and feel. This is determined by the type of mechanical switch you use. Red switches (aka linear switches) require less effort to press down and don&rsquo;t provide much tactile feedback. They&rsquo;re also quieter than blue switches, which produce those pleasant click-clack sounds.

You need not sacrifice ergonomics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because a mechanical keyboard is inexpensive doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t also be ergonomic, with many options including a wrist rest can meet that need. That&rsquo;s a good thing, since long gaming stretches require comfort. Nothing kills the mood faster than hand cramps. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/AULA-F2088-Mechanical-Removable-Keyboards/dp/B09DKQWTNC&amp;xcust=2-2-1480114-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">AULA F2088</a>, for example, comes with a magnetic wrist rest. This helps prevent hand fatigue during those marathon gaming sessions. Plus, the matte finish should provide a relatively smooth surface for your hands. As of this writing, the typewriter-style keyboard is currently on sale for just $45.99. Make sure you add the 5% coupon at checkout, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-its-a-low-cost-way-to-test-drive-a-mechanical-board\">5.

The difference is really in the feel. Mechanical keyboards have keys that spring back when you press down on them. If you&rsquo;re just dipping your toes in the mechanical keyboard world, then I&rsquo;d suggest test driving a more inexpensive one first and work your way up. If you end up disliking how a mechanical keyboard feels, then at least you haven&rsquo;t put a ton of money into it.

But how much do you gain with each scenario?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 34-inch ultrawide monitor, the most common size, is not as large you might think. This size of ultrawide is nearly identical to a 27-inch widescreen monitor in height and about 8 inches wider. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purchasing a second 27-inch monitor will, of course, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2057936/how-to-set-up-two-monitors.html\">net you a second monitor just as large as the first</a>.

Most apps are programmed for use with a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio and have a user interface designed for that aspect ratio. Resizing an app to a 21:9 aspect ratio often leaves large, empty areas or forces portions of the interface to one side. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide owners end up manually resizing windows to an approximately 16:9 aspect ratio.

Dual 4K might seem appealing at a glance but, like a bug zapper, the allure can only end in pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pc-gaming\">PC gaming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide monitors have taken their thumps so far, but gamers can disregard the lashing I&rsquo;ve dished out. Ultrawide is the king of PC gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dual-monitor setup has an obvious issue: the bezel running down the middle of the display. Even the thinnest, most miniscule monitor bezels are blatantly obvious when using two monitors side-by-side. Playing a game on two monitors at once is technically possible, but it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide monitors offer not just more usable space for gaming but a more immersive aspect ratio. A wider aspect ratio means that, in most games, you can see more at once. Scenery and objects that remain outside your field of view on a 16:9 widescreen become visible on a 21:9 ultrawide.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-overall-ultrawide-monitor-is-an-oled-beast\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best overall ultrawide monitor is an OLED beast\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"alienware-aw3423dwf\">Alienware AW3423DWF</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alienware AW3423DWF\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>A wider aspect ratio is especially useful in certain games. Landing a plane in <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> is easier on a 21:9 monitor thanks to the improved sense of perspective a wide field-of-view offers. Gamers deep into <em>Civilization IV</em> or <em>Humankind </em>can see more map for a complete view of their empire. MMO fans can use the space to customize the user interface or load add-ons (in games where that&rsquo;s allowed, of course).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most gamers with dual monitors play on one monitor and use the second for Discord, a game walkthrough, or catch up on some reality TV while waiting in que to play <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. This is better than having a single monitor, to be sure, but can&rsquo;t beat the seamless feel of an ultrawide. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"console-gaming\">Console gaming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This point may seem obvious to veteran gamers, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating for those new to using a game console with a computer monitor. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game consoles don&rsquo;t support ultrawide monitors. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"best-hdmi-2-1-gaming-monitor-with-console-support\">\n\t\t\t\t\tBest HDMI 2.1 gaming monitor with console support\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"dell-g3223q\">Dell G3223Q</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Dell G3223Q\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/dell-3223q-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/708573/dell-g3223q-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-4k-uhd-gaming-monitor-g3223q/apd/210-bdbk/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;sid=2-2-395110-5-708599-11245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$769.99 at  Dell</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8200811-13502820?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-32-4k-uhd-gaming-monitor-g3223q%2Fapd%2F210-bdbk%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories?sid=2-2-395110-5-708599-11245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$799.99 at  Dell Home</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8200811-13513947?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-32-4k-uhd-gaming-monitor-g3223q%2Fapd%2F210-bdbk%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories?sid=2-2-395110-5-708599-11245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$799.99 at  Dell Small Business</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see an image if you connect a game console to an ultrawide monitor, but it will have a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio with letterboxing on each side. Resolution is also an issue. The most common ultrawide resolution is 3440&times;1440, which translates to 2560&times;1440 when connected to a 16:9 source. The PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch don&rsquo;t support this resolution and instead fall back to 1080p. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t buy an ultrawide monitor if you plan to use a monitor with a game console.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"simplicity\">Simplicity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide can claim another important advantage over dual monitors. It&rsquo;s just one monitor. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One monitor means one display connection and one power cord. There&rsquo;s no need to worry about how monitors are arranged in Windows&rsquo; display settings.

A dual monitor setup is hardly uncommon and supported by modern operating systems, but you may still encounter edge cases where a particular laptop, desktop video card, or application doesn&rsquo;t work as it should. Uncommon problems become likely as your setup becomes more complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single ultrawide monitor is a plug-and-play experience that requires zero configuration. This is useful if you don&rsquo;t want to spend time messing with settings or frequently switch computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-monitors-for-the-win\">Dual monitors for the win</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The verdict is clear. In general, dual monitors take the win over ultrawide. Going dual snags you a more flexible setup that&rsquo;s better for multitasking and, if you buy high-end 4K monitors, packs more pixels than any ultrawide in existence. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-budget-4k-monitor-would-work-great-as-a-pair\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best budget 4K monitor would work great as a pair\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"asus-proart-pa279cv\">Asus ProArt PA279CV</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ProArt PA279CV\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/asus-proart-pa279cv-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/630536/asus-proart-pa279cv-monitor-review-the-go-to-for-content-creators-on-a-budget.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean a dual-monitor setup is better for everyone. I, personally, prefer an ultrawide monitor. Simulation, strategy, and MMO games are my favorite genres, so an ultrawide&rsquo;s immersion really hits the spot. I also lack the surface space to use a pair of 27-inch monitors, while a 34-inch ultrawide is the right fit for my desk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice should fit your needs, of course. Ultrawide is my preference because it works best for my niche needs. Still, it&rsquo;s clear dual monitors win in most situations. Readers on the fence should stop worrying and buy that second monitor.
