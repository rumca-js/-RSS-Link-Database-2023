I don't think we're quite there yet, but this video seems to be a good indicator of where we're heading. </p><p>This lady was doing squats in leggings that are remarkably close to the color of her skin. That's not crucial to the story, it's just important to note that she is, in fact, wearing pants. </p><p>She found herself in a bit of a pickle when she squatted down and couldn't get up. She then looked around the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gym-shamer-girl-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">gym</a>, desperate for someone to help her. She tried to catch anyone's attention, but a solid minute passed until another woman helped her up. No gym bros to the rescue. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMy, my, my if it isn't the real-world consequences of all those gym ladies clout chasing. \\ud83d\\ude02\\ud83d\\ude43\\u201d</div> \u2014 Lauren Chen (@Lauren Chen)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLaurenChen/status/1621082742892171265\">1675331218</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you're a lady who's been to the gym, you'll know this is highly unusual. I once witnessed a poor girl collapse in the squat rack. She was fine, but the plates went everywhere. And when I tell you every single male immediately stopped what they were doing to go help her, I mean <em></em><em>every single male. </em>It was like a group of moths swarming a light. Very kind, helpful moths. </p><p>So what's changed? Well, perhaps it's this new <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitch-streamer-gym\" target=\"_blank\">cultural phenomenon</a> of taping men minding their business while you workout in your underwear, then posting it online for millions to see, all while baselessly claiming he was creepin' on you. That could definitely act as a deterrent for men to approach women in the gym in any capacity. </p><p>I hope it isn't too late to reverse course on this trend. Besides not wanting such hostility between the two genders, there could come a day when I find myself crushed beneath a squat rack because I got too cocky. And I don't have much confidence in some of these wannabe OnlyFans models coming to my rescue. </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/instagram-model-implant", "title": "Watch: Instagram model left with \"uniboob\" after her other massive size-38J implant burst and has a story to share", "date_published": "2023-02-03 17:18:26+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32976524&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>A Canadian <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-model-excoriated-funeral\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram model</a> who goes by the name \"Mary Magdalene\" has to have a size 38J, 5,000cc breast implant removed after it popped.

Mary Magdalene has gotten in trouble for her bodacious breasts in the past. Last June, she got kicked off a flight from Canada to Dallas because her 22-pound jugs were \"too explicit.\" </p><p>She wrote about the ordeal on her Instagram stories, saying,<em> \"Onviously this is why whe kicked me off cuz I loom too ecplicot bit that's not legal so she had to say it because I was sleeping snd vouldn't hear her girl bye all her dtaff os on my side ur gettinv sued ewhore!!!\"</em></p><p>I took the liberty of not correcting any of her typos, because authenticity. You're welcome. </p><p>It's unclear if Mary has since sued for getting kicked off the plane. But in another post, she alleged she was discriminated against: <em>\"I do not get how some people are saying it's ok that I would get kicked off for what I'm wearing [...] Discrimination of any kind is not a nice feeling for anyone.

The balloon, which entered continental US airspace a \u201ccouple of days ago,\u201d according to a senior defense official, is the latest sign of the growing severity of the power competition between China and the United States.</p><p>The balloon, spotted above Montana, is floating at an altitude that The Pentagon described as \u201csignificantly above where civilian air traffic is active,\u201d but in the atmosphere and not in outer space.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">U.S. officials said a suspected Chinese spy balloon had been flying over the country for a couple of days, in what would be a brazen act ahead of a planned trip to Beijing by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href=\"https://t.co/HmTkjARXMu\">https://t.co/HmTkjARXMu</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IKOuYHaizu\">pic.twitter.com/IKOuYHaizu</a><br />\u2014 Reuters Asia (@ReutersAsia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersAsia/status/1621432050447171584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Although defense officials expressed doubt that the balloon was any more valuable at gathering information than the PRC\u2019s low orbiting satellites, worries remain about the flight path the balloon is taking.<br /></p><p>When asked whether the balloon was trying to collect intelligence on nuclear weapons that are siloed in Montana, the senior defense official stated that it was a concern.</p><p>\u201cYes, so clearly the intent of this balloon is for surveillance. And so the current flight path does carry it over a number of sensitive sites.\u201d</p><p>This concern was echoed by Montana\u2019s Republican senator, Steve Daines. In a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Daines wrote, \u201cThe fact that this balloon was occupying Montana airspace creates significant concern that Malmstrom Air Force Base (AFB) and the United States\u2019 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fields are the target of this intelligence gathering mission.\u201d</p><p>After being briefed on the issue, President Biden asked for military options but was advised by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, and the commander of NORTHCOM, General Glen VanHerck, not to take kinetic action \u201cdue to the risk to safety and security of people on the ground from the possible debris field.\u201d </p><p>Some Republicans disagreed with the decision to not shoot down the balloon. Representative Ryan Zinke, a Republican from Montana, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanZinke/status/1621334674176876546?s=20&amp;t=0Dz2zCxGefcWcj8zQRj4Ig\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a>, \u201cShoot. It. Down. The Chinese spy balloon is clear provocation. In Montana we do not bow. We shoot it down.

President Biden must start putting the American people first and recognize that China is a threat to our freedom, values, and way of life.\u201d</p><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1621311735914266626?s=20&amp;t=DIIJb6bDIANTANtO7Y1Niw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">called out</a> President Biden.</p><p>\u201cChina\u2019s brazen disregard for U.S. sovereignty is a destabilizing action that must be addressed, and President Biden cannot be silent.
