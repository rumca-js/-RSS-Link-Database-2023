<p>Michigan boy Mason Stonehouse had jumbo shrimp, shawarma, salads, chicken pita sandwiches and chili cheese fries delivered</p><p>A Michigan man says he was left with a $1,000 bill after his six-year-old son ordered a virtual smorgasbord of food from several restaurants last weekend, leading to a string of unexpected deliveries – and maybe a starring role in an ad campaign.</p><p>Keith Stonehouse said the food piled up quickly at his Detroit-area home on Saturday night after he let his son, Mason, use his cellphone to play a game before bed. He said the youngster instead used his father’s Grubhub account to order food from one restaurant after another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/03/six-year-old-orders-1000-worth-food-grubhub">Continue reading...</a>

## Right Here, Right Now review – Fatboy Slim’s beach concert will make you flinch with anxiety

<p>They expected 60,000 attenders, but 250,000 showed up. Staff quit, police had to flee and – as this documentary shows – tragedy loomed. Or it would’ve, if not for the loved-up ravers…</p><p>Lingering snobbery towards dance music means the Big Beach Boutique II, a DJ set by Norman Cook – AKA Fatboy Slim – on Brighton beach on 13 July 2002, tends not to be mentioned alongside era-defining gigs like the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park in 1969, the Stone Roses at Spike Island in 1990 or Oasis at Knebworth in 1996. Right Here, Right Now (Sky Documentaries) might rectify that, but it isn’t just a thrilling document of the event itself. The combination of what happened, and what might have happened but didn’t, turns Jak Hutchcraft’s film into a surprisingly intense experience, a rush powered by the euphoria of irresponsible adventure and the sweet sadness of distant youth.</p><p>This is good going, considering that the first half is a relatively tedious summary of Norman Cook’s earlier career. We shuffle through his stint as the bass player in 80s band the Housemartins, whose tinkling guitars contrasted with the deep knowledge of funk and dance records Cook was acquiring in his spare time. By the time the Housemartins had run their course, he was a DJ, ready to embrace the new era of club culture. In 1996, he released his debut album under the moniker Fatboy Slim, layering ingeniously chosen samples over dance rhythms to create what became known as big beat. When Channel 4 held an open-air screening of an England cricket match at the Brighton seaside in 2001, it asked Fatboy Slim – who by then had scored top-five hits with Praise You and The Rockefeller Skank – to DJ afterwards. Thousands of people turned up. Fatboy Slim decided to stage a sequel the following year, planning a free set for as many people as the beach could take.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/03/right-here-right-now-review-fatboy-slims-beach-concert-will-make-you-flinch-with-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plus Gawker and the end (again) of an era, and Eva Green’s WhatsApp mishaps</p><p>When one thinks of Alec Baldwin – as this week’s news cycle sadly ensures one must – humility isn’t the first quality that springs to mind. Baldwin’s persona hinges on a comedic bombast that the 64-year-old carries over from the screen into life. Even for a man who threatens photographers in the street, yells at airline stewards and rashly tweets and deletes, however, his apparent blitheness in the wake of [checks notes] shooting and killing someone accidentally on the set of his last film has been quite something to behold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/emma-brockes-column/2023/feb/03/digested-week-alec-baldwin-on-gun-control-silence-would-be-preferable">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Perhaps it would have been more interesting if Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali had just stood in the centre circle for 90 minutes, acting out their negotiations with Benfica over Enzo Fernández on deadline day. Instead, no doubt to the disappointment of those who reckon winning a transfer window actually counts for anything, there was a game that will linger in the memory only because of Chelsea’s abject failure to produce the kind of football befitting of a spend of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/01/chelsea-signings-transfer-market-spending-analysis">over £500m on new signings</a>.</p><p>It must have been quite the comedown for the hierarchy. They gazed down from the posh seats, waiting in vain for any sign of a spark from Graham Potter’s side, and suffered along with the rest of Stamford Bridge. The boos at full-time said everything. Chelsea, drifting along in 9th place after two wins from their last 12 games, were bland, directionless and leaden. Positives? Fernández, who was tidy in midfield, albeit without ever quite showing why he cost £106.8m. David Datro Fofana almost scored. The defence kept a clean sheet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/03/chelsea-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My father, John Stewart, who has died aged 93, was friend and mentor to hundreds of local authority chief executives and other senior officers, and to politicians from all political backgrounds.</p><p>He was appointed a professor at the Institute of Local Government Studies (INLOGOV) at the University of Birmingham in 1966. The following year he created the Advanced Management Development Programme, consisting of 10-week-long residential courses held at Wast Hills House outside Birmingham. These became stepping stones for local government officers with ambitions to become chief executives. It had its own culture – everything was off the record, there was no assessment or exams, references were not given on the basis of the courses. Through these courses John knew most of the chief executives of councils in England and Wales.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/03/john-stewart-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Workers should not be paying for a recession that they did not cause</p><p>Rishi Sunak marked 100 days in office by claiming the country cannot afford <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/feb/02/labour-tories-windfall-tax-shell-profits-energy-prices-strikes-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-63dc1d5f8f08ba2ef0b6fee0#block-63dc1d5f8f08ba2ef0b6fee0">“massive”</a> pay rises for nurses. In a TV interview, the prime minister on Thursday said he’d “love to give the nurses” the money because it would “make my life easier”, but added: “Even if it’s not popular, it’s the right thing for this country to stay the course.” Mr Sunak was so unmoved by the biggest day of industrial action over pay in more than a decade that even the most popular of causes would not be entertained. Earlier that day the Bank of England hiked interest rates, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/02/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-to-4">causing</a> more pain for hard-pressed households and businesses.</p><p>The recession now forecast as a result is the price workers are paying for inflation that is driven by supply costs in food and fuel being wrongly cast as driven by demand. This is no accident, as an insightful <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-02/doom%20_loop%20paper.pdf">report</a> by the Trades Union Congress makes clear this week. Since 1979, economic policies have seen a “doom loop in GDP, and a parallel ‘boom loop’ in wealth”. The doom loop starts with the government claiming that it has to “fix” the public finances, and proceeds by public spending cuts which then lead to lower demand and lower growth – with the cycle restarting. This flies in the face of evidence that infrastructure spending <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/11/15/fatal-error-austerity/">pays</a> for itself through extra economic growth. Such inconvenient facts are dismissed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunaks-message-workers-doom-loop-wealths-boom-loop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By cancelling all its shows from March, the Oldham Coliseum  has thrown down a challenge to both central and local government</p><p>Pity the poor Oldham Coliseum. This venerable regional theatre has for some years now been trapped in a push-me-pull-you of ambition versus resources, culminating this week in a decision to cancel all shows from the end of March. The immediate reason is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/31/oldham-coliseum-theatre-manchester-events-cancelled-arts-council-england-cut">Arts Council England’s decision</a> last November to strike it from the National Portfolio, denying it the £615,182-a-year grant on which it was relying from April. But behind this crisis lies a longer-term struggle to keep running at full throttle in a 138-year-old building that is no longer fit for purpose.</p><p>Oldham is one of the areas identified as <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/case-studies/illuminate-seeing-oldham-new-light">a priority for investment</a> under the government’s levelling up agenda. So it is particularly ironic that one of the shows the Coliseum has cancelled is a touring co-production based on Ken Loach’s film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/17/i-daniel-blake-to-be-adapted-for-stage-and-updated-for-cost-of-living-crisis">I, Daniel Blake</a>: a roar of rage about the betrayal of the northern working-class projected through the story of a joiner who is failed by the welfare state after a heart attack renders him unable to work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/the-guardian-view-on-theatres-in-crisis-a-moment-to-take-stock">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Azadeh Salour,</strong> <strong>Phil West </strong>and<strong> Bonnie Pomfret </strong>respond to Rabina Khan’s article addressing the stereotypes around wearing the hijab</p><p>I read Rabina Khan’s article with interest, being an Iranian Muslim woman born and raised in Iran (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/i-proudly-wear-a-hijab-forget-the-stereotypes-its-a-sign-of-style-and-strength">I proudly wear a hijab. Forget the stereotypes – it’s a sign of style and strength, 1 February</a>). I’m glad Ms Khan brought up the oppression in Iran and how the hijab has been the backbone of a tyrannical regime. I’m an avid supporter of freedom of choice, and will never question how people wish to express themselves or their cultural identity through clothes. But I would stress that the hijab was originally forced on women by men. The philosophy that was gradually introduced was for women to cover themselves so that men would not be aroused. This is what I always found distasteful.</p><p>Even at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, women didn’t cover their hair. It was never a cultural identity for Iranian women to cover their hair for a long time after the Arab invasion and certainly not before the Islamic revolution. So please look at the history of all the countries in the world where women are forced or choose to wear the hijab and then call the practice as part of their identity.<br /><strong>Azadeh Salour</strong><br /><em>McLean, Virginia, US</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/03/for-many-women-wearing-a-hijab-is-not-a-matter-of-choice">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Like moving through water while everyone is on land’: the writers exploring sexuality through sea life

<p>A host of LGBTQ+ authors are finding parallels with mermaids, tropical fish and other creatures of the deep as a way to make sense of their own lives</p><p>“I’ve always had a very strong connection to the sea,” says author Sabrina Imbler, who grew up in California by the Pacific Ocean. “I remember always being like: ‘If I could live anywhere, this is where I would be: I would be a fish in this place.’ I think about queerness in a similar way– as a space of possibility and radical imagination.” It is with this in mind that Imbler’s essay collection, My Life in Sea Creatures, published at the end of last year, explores 10 sea or aquatic creatures and how, among other things, they relate to their identity as a queer, mixed-race person.</p><p>There is, for example, Imbler’s essay on cuttlefish, which are known for their capability to change appearance to resemble the opposite sex. “I found it very liberating to try to understand the many ways in which a cuttlefish can transform,” adds Imbler, speaking over Zoom from where they now live in New York. In another chapter, Imbler explores the yeti crab, which lives in deep-sea hydrothermal vents – spaces, they say, “that we humans would consider very hostile or inhospitable to life”. This got Imbler “thinking about the ways in which I feel like queer people often take refuge in spaces that straight people don’t want”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/03/queer-writers-exploring-sexuality-and-gender-through-sea-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Any credit I got last week for coining a term on Twitter was quite undeserved. The Ukrainians who did need Germany to do more</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, at a moment of huge frustration over Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s foot-dragging on allowing Europe’s German-made Leopard tanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/germany-leopard-2-tanks-ukraine">go to Ukraine</a>, a Ukrainian friend WhatsApped me a satirical mockup on “Scholzing”. Next to a photograph of the chancellor, it defined Scholzing, dictionary-style, as: “verb: communicating <em>good intentions </em>only to use/find/invent any reason imaginable to <em>delay these </em>and/or prevent them from happening”. I found this sharp and amusing, quickly retweeted it, and thought no more about it. My Twitter account seemed to be buzzing, but then I’d been writing a lot about the issue myself.</p><p>Six days later, I was watching an interview with Scholz on Germany’s ZDF television channel when the interviewer confronted him with “Scholzing”, attributing the coinage to “a British historian”. I went back to my Twitter feed to find that this one quick tweet had been viewed 1.1m times. In German and international media, the definition was being widely quoted as mine. Since, as we all know, the internet never lies, it has now become a historical fact that I thus defined “Scholzing”. (I had incautiously tweeted the meme directly from WhatsApp, so it didn’t show up as something sent from Ukraine. I subsequently clarified this on Twitter, but of course no one reads the clarification.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/germany-olaf-scholz-twitter-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wales’s returning head coach has put his faith in old hands, just as he did in 2008. It worked then, but will it again?</p><p>Put down your drinks, shut up that piano, and snap your head towards the saloon door. Warren Gatland’s back. Watching him work the Six Nations launch, you wondered if he had ever really left. He seems to have slipped back into his old role as Wales head coach as if he were sliding into a favourite seat at the bar. But then he left such a big impression on the Welsh game first time around that the job still fits like it was moulded to him. His trusted players are a little older, he doesn’t know the younger ones so well, but otherwise the place hasn’t changed so very much during the three years he was away.</p><p>It was supposed to. Wayne Pivac promised to get Wales playing an entirely new style of running rugby. It didn’t work out that way. The longer he went on, the more they lost, and the more they lost, the more obvious it was that it was Gatland who had held Welsh rugby together for the last decade. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/23/welsh-rugby-union-wru-facing-allegations-sexism-discrimination-bbc-investigation">current chaos at the WRU</a> is nothing new to a man who has spent as long around the game there as Gatland has. You can be sure he will deal with it the same way he always did, by closing it out and concentrating on building the tightest, toughest team he can in the time he has available.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/03/warren-gatland-relies-on-a-familiar-formula-to-revive-waless-fortunes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Law championed by Ron DeSantis also includes ID requirements and ballot box limits, making it harder to vote by mail</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Florida voters had their requests for mail-in ballots cancelled last month, a consequence of a new law <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/gov-desantis-signs-gop-backed-elections-bill/2444871/">championed by Ron DeSantis</a>.</p><p>The change is part of a suite of new restrictions on voting by mail – including new identification requirements and ballot drop box limits – Republicans passed after the 2020 election. Previously, Florida voters could elect to automatically receive a mail-in ballot for every election for up to four years. The new measure cancelled nearly all of the standing requests on file at the end of 2022. Voters can also now only request to automatically receive a mail-in ballot for up to two years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/03/florida-voting-restrictions-mail-in-ballots-cancelled-ron-desantis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sally Wainwright’s astounding drama might be a propulsive, plot-driven beast, but it’s TV perfection for another reason – the warm, spectacularly written details</p><p>For the past six weeks, it has felt as if the country has stuck to the exact same Sunday routine. First, we wait until 9pm, then we put Happy Valley on and all stop breathing for an hour.</p><p>The sheer amount of dread writer Sally Wainwright has managed to pack into each episode of Happy Valley’s third and final series is staggering. Unless Wainwright is setting us up for the mother of all anticlimaxes, the series looks as if it has all been leading up to one final confrontation between Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) and Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton). They are each keen to move on with their lives by escaping abroad – Royce to Marbella, Catherine to the Himalayas – but it would be foolish to assume that both of them will get to the end credits alive. If by some miracle they do, it’ll be time to fear the worst for Ryan (Rhys Connah), the troubled boy at the centre of their tug of war. The whole thing has been terrifying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/03/happy-valley-graffiti-grammar-and-farts-how-small-moments-make-happy-valley-an-all-time-great">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There used to be more people than cows in Visalia, but a new 3,000-seat megachurch has brought Vegas kitsch to the worshippers of California’s Central Valley</p><p>With declining congregations, shuttered chapels and an ever shrinking number of priests, it is easy to assume that church in the US is on the way out for good. As parishes struggle to attract younger generations, and almost a third of Americans now declare no religious affiliation, this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/22/us-churches-closing-religion-covid-christianity">one nation under God seems to be rapidly losing its faith</a>.<br /><br />But some regions are bucking the trend, particularly in the south and west. In California’s Central Valley, the agricultural heartland of dairy farms and orchards that sprawl across the state’s flat fertile plains, producing half the country’s fruit and veg, the Catholic population is booming, and busy building. Rising out of the rolling landscape of fruit and nut trees, which march in a mesmerising grid as far as the eye can see, stands a gargantuan new beacon that here, at least, God is back – with bigger ambitions than ever.</p><p>At a crossroads on the outskirts of Visalia, a small city 200 miles north of Los Angeles (where the local paper once remarked, “There’s nearly more cows than people”), Christian fervour is brewing. On one corner stands the 3,000-seat megachurch of <a href="https://www.visaliafirst.com/">Visalia First</a>, a big shed wrapped with the full-height tinted windows of a car showroom. Across the six-lane intersection is the more modest octagonal pavilion of the United Methodist church, as well as a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. And on the fourth corner of the holy junction, bringing a stately air to proceedings, now stands the biggest Catholic parish church in the whole of North America.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/03/visalia-inside-the-biggest-catholic-parish-church-in-north-america">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘You need romcom core in your life – even if you’re rolling your eyes at this and thinking you’re too sophisticated’</p><p>Romcom is the vibe the world needs right now, and here’s why. The story of every romcom is that two adorable people meet, but somehow, in the frantic chaos of modern life, then spend the following 90 minutes of screen time narrowly missing getting together. Or (mistakenly as it will turn out) think that they hate each other. Or both, before realising that happy ever after is there for the taking if they just stop bickering and get married already.</p><p>The classic romantic comedy tropes reflect back at us the speeded-up fractiousness of our era – our dating apps, our culture wars, a vague sense that the future has been derailed and isn’t going to plan – but wrap it up with a promise that deep down we all love each other really and that everything will be all right in the end. This is why, after two decades in the cinematic wilderness, the romcom is back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/03/romcoms-are-back-and-that-means-pastels-small-cardigans-and-a-sense-of-humour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A rising star on the stage and screen, the actor’s latest role is as a closeted teacher in the 80s-set drama Blue Jean. She sees parallels between that era and today – notably Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill</p><p>Rosy McEwen appears in the foyer of the National Theatre in London, where she is playing Desdemona in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/15/clint-dyer-interview-writer-actor-director-death-of-england-football-racially-abused-bananas">Clint Dyer</a>’s new production of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/04/othello-lyttelton-national-theatre-review-clint-dyer-giles-terera-rosy-mcewen-desdemona-fights-back-baghdaddy-royal-court-jasmine-naziha-joneshttps://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/04/othello-lyttelton-national-theatre-review-clint-dyer-giles-terera-rosy-mcewen-desdemona-fights-back-baghdaddy-royal-court-jasmine-naziha-jones">Othello</a>. Her headstrong take on the doomed wife has been hailed as “a revelation” by critics. Some have described her performance as feisty. “But I don’t know how I feel about the word ‘feisty’. It means surprisingly strong-willed for her size, but she’s not feisty. She’s been accused of something she hasn’t done. I think she’s just really pissed off,” says McEwen. In each performance – spoiler alert – she spends a considerable amount of time playing dead as the action continues around her. “I get into a very comfy position. Some nights, it’s really nice to lie there and hear the truth come out. But actually, after a while, I’m thinking: What’s in my fridge … ” she jokes. “No, I’m thinking about the character all the time.”</p><p>It has been a year of firsts for McEwen. Desdemona is her first stage role in London, but we are here to talk about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/03/blue-jean-review-watchable-section-28-drama-makes-its-point">Blue Jean</a>, the British independent film that marks her first lead role in anything. It is a knockout part. The film is set in 1988, and McEwen plays Jean, a young PE teacher at a school in Newcastle upon Tyne. Jean is a lesbian in a hostile political environment, and she lives in fear of her sexuality being discovered. When one of her pupils turns up at the gay bar where she hangs out with her friends and her girlfriend, Viv, it sparks complicated questions about shame, courage, rebellion and conformity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/03/rosy-mcewen-blue-jean-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You don’t have to be a snob to enjoy wine, and if you really want to know more, don’t be afraid to ask questions and keep trying new things – here are a few bottles to get you started</p><p>In the run-up to Christmas, which already seems aeons ago, I seemed to be constantly having conversations with people at parties that were almost always prefaced by a “I don’t know anything about wine”. But of course they did – they knew the wines that they enjoyed, but somehow felt they (the wines) weren’t worthy enough, and that they (the individual) ought to drink better and know more.</p><p>I can’t think of any other drink, or food, for that matter, that provokes such embarrassment and anguish. No one goes around saying: “I don’t know much about coffee”, do they? Or beer or whisky or cheese. And if they really don’t know much, they’ll cheerfully admit it or even say they don’t like it. (Many people I meet also seem to feel they should like wine even if they don’t.)</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/03/bottles-to-help-improve-your-wine-knowledge-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

Using this data, nurses, in conjunction with GPs, managed patients at home.

Now, as the Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-02-02/nick-carter-countersuit-rape-allegations-backstreet-boys-shannon-ruth">reports</a>, Carter has countersued her, as well as another accuser, describing them as “opportunists” looking to take advantage of the #MeToo movement.</p><p>According to that report, Carter’s lawsuit claims the women are seeking to “destroy innocent lives” and “defame and vilify Carter and otherwise ruin his reputation for the purposes of garnering attention and fame and/or extorting money from Carter.” It also claims that Carter lost $2.3m in business in the wake of the allegations. “Carter will not allow himself to be smeared in this way,” the lawsuit reads. “Protecting one’s reputation and name by calling a liar a liar is not victim blaming or bullying.

## Philharmonia/Hrůša review – genteel beginnings cede to compelling drama

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong> <br />If his Dvořák felt a little bland, with Bartók and Strauss’s Dance of the Seven Veils, the Royal Opera’s music director designate gave  London audiences a glimpse of the vivid excitement he can bring</p><p>The Philharmonia’s concert with its former principal guest conductor was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/jakub-hrusa">Jakub Hrůša’s</a> first appearance in London since he was confirmed last October as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/18/royal-opera-house-announces-jakub-hrusa-as-its-new-music-director">the Royal Opera’s next music director</a>. Appropriately there was a theatrical flavour to much of the programme as originally announced, and a distinctly operatic one to the final item, which was to have been the last scene of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/18/strauss-where-to-start-with-his-music-tim-ashley">Strauss’s</a> Salome, preceded by the Dance of the Seven Veils. On the morning of the concert, though, it was announced that the soprano Jennifer Davis, who was to have sung the Salome extract, had been taken ill and the programme rejigged; the dance was retained but the final scene was replaced with more Strauss, his symphonic poem Don Juan.</p><p>What was now a purely orchestral concert began rather tepidly, with an uninvolving performance of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/11/dvorak-where-to-start-with-his-music">Dvořák’s</a> The Golden Spinning Wheel; it was superbly played – the Philharmonia brass in particular were on fine form throughout the evening – but rather short on compelling drama. To a certain extent that’s a problem with the work itself, which, for all its imaginatively beautiful moments, lacks the narrative intensity of some of Dvořák’s other symphonic poems, but here also seemed to be a product of Hrůša’s approach, which sometimes felt a little too bland and genteel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/03/philharmonia-hrusa-review-royal-festival-hall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In several new productions, playwrights explore the cost of living crisis as their industry reels from funding cuts, cancellations and low wages</p><p>‘What galvanises me to get up in the morning and write is what is making me angry, upsetting me, frightening me,” says playwright Emily White. Like her previous plays, White’s next production, Joseph K and the Cost of Living, opening at <a href="https://www.swanseagrand.co.uk/NTWTheCostOfLiving?qpsi=booknow&amp;spevin=254602APKPVLJPGNBSQMSHLCLVNCJBRCR">Swansea Grand</a> next month, seeks to make the political personal. It is a reimagining of Kafka’s nightmarish The Trial, whose protagonist is unexpectedly arrested but not told what for and always maintains his innocence.</p><p>White was a teenager when she first read the novel, about “being trapped in this kind of bureaucratic machine”, but she returned to it more recently after feeling that there was a “creeping authoritarianism” happening, with marginalised people’s rights “being clawed back by governments all over the world”. She continues: “In my version, it’s a story about state-led persecution of particular individuals and the reasons for that. And, in the background, we are very much today in Britain, in this world that we’re living in right now.” The play is set, she says, in a country that feels as if it is teetering on the brink of resistance and revolution. As such, the story incorporates food banks, homelessness, environmental protests, strikes and the government’s attempt to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/30/peers-deliver-several-blows-to-governments-anti-protest-bill">limit </a>direct action.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/03/playwrights-fight-back-theatres-face-closures-staff-shortages-cost-of-living">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s nothing remotely revolutionary or gimmicky happening here, but a pocket-friendly pasta restaurant in the heart of the capital is an exciting prospect</p><p>One challenge for the weekly restaurant reviewer is that several times a year you’re expected to produce riveting prose on the basic art of eating pasta in a room painted in contrasting beiges. Not that I’m complaining about eating pasta; it’s almost unthinkable not to worship the stuff. Pasta is so delicious that I’ve even heard modern nutritionists describe it as more of a “social activity” than mere sustenance: all those lovely, starchy carbs with cream, oil and/or butter gliding down your throat, making you feel full and loved, but not a huge amount of vitamin K, omega-3s or anything else that may help you live to 100.</p><p>And, judging from the sight of a full restaurant on a wet Tuesday lunchtime, I am guessing that many of <a href="https://www.nottopastabar.com/">Notto</a>’s customers that day had briefly considered longevity and instead opted for a luscious bowl of handmade strozzapreti (AKA priest chokers) with black truffles, mushroom stock, parmesan and butter, or pappardelle with oxtail and beef shin slow-cooked in red wine, and a mascarpone blood orange panna cotta for afters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/03/notto-london-w1-pasta-is-safe-in-these-chefs-hands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Abigail Thaw narrates this intimate and gripping story of political and sexual awakening in middle-class suburbia</p><p>The year is 1967 and 40-year-old Phyllis Fischer is sitting at her dressing table applying lipstick ahead of an informal dinner she is hosting for the son of a family friend. Phyllis is married to Roger, a senior civil servant, with whom she has two children, Colette and Hugh, and is regarded as “an easy person. Easily made happy, glad to make others happy. She was pleased with her life.” And yet her comfortable commuter-belt existence is upended with the arrival of their dinner guest, Nicholas, a young socialist and would-be reporter whom she kisses in a moment of impulsiveness while searching for a missing shoe in the garden. Startled by her own boldness, Phyllis later tracks Nicholas down to a flat in west London where she encounters bohemian types who smoke pot, sleep around and argue about politics, and where she undergoes her own political and sexual awakening.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/12/free-love-by-tessa-hadley-review-sexual-revolution-in-60s-suburbia">Tessa Hadley’s eighth novel</a> delves beneath the veneer of British suburbia to tell an intimate and gripping story of generational discord and female self-discovery. The actor Abigail Thaw is the narrator, her cut-glass delivery aptly reflecting Phyllis’s middle-class background and her innate brittleness that gradually falls away as she casts aside her safe yet sheltered life. Hadley’s masterstroke here lies in her refusal to present Phyllis either as a hero or villain, instead leaving us to ponder the implications of her actions and to digest one of the biggest and most unfair taboos: that of a woman leaving her children in pursuit of personal fulfilment.</p><p>• Free Love by Tessa Hadley is available from Penguin Audio, 9hr and 1min</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/03/free-love-by-tessa-hadley-audiobook-review-female-self-discovery">Continue reading...</a>

## The Barber of Seville review – Payare’s perky Rossini makes this revival fizz

<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London<br /></strong>With rising newcomers such as Aigul Akhmetshina and veterans such as Bryn Terfel, this is an irresistible performance conducted with verve by Rafael Payare, in his ROH debut<br /></p><p>The Royal Opera House’s fifth revival of Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier’s 2005 staging of The Barber of Seville sees rising stars rubbing shoulders with veteran performers, conducted with startling vivacity by Venezuelan firecracker Rafael Payare.<br /><br />Shrugging off the revolutionary social subtext, the production’s Fellini-esque visuals jostle with slapstick elements that reflect the opera’s commedia dell’arte roots. However, apart from a plethora of oversized proboscises, and some spectacular hydraulics that lend a farcical feeling of seasickness to the first-act finale, the comedy relies on a cast capable of subtly heightened acting. Despite having the original directors on hand, degrees of stylisation are inconsistent here, and stage business occasionally lacks motivation.<br /><br />Chief vocal honours go to up-and-coming Russian mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina whose burgundy lower register and pinpoint coloratura are matched by impressive reserves of power. Her determined Rosina is a coiled spring, passing time by throwing darts at the walls of her spartan prison. Andrzej Filończyk’s Figaro is more likely lad than arch manipulator, but he has a heroic instrument, crowned by fearless top notes and a show-stopping gift for quickfire patter.</p><p><br />Lawrence Brownlee’s debonair tone makes him a supple Almaviva. Fabio Capitanucci, however, is vocally underwhelming and dramatically penny plain as the tyrannical Bartolo. It’s Ailish Tynan as Berta, his browbeaten maid, who shows how it should be done in a razor-sharp cameo, though Bryn Terfel gives her a run for her money. His greasy haired Basilio is a creepy delight, all sotto voce insinuations and unnerving Nosferatu hands.<br />Making his ROH debut, Payare, who holds prestigious posts in Montreal and San Diego, might seem an odd choice for Rossini. His reputation, after all, rests on big hitters such as Mahler and Shostakovich. Not a bit of it. His perky, pacy reading is full of light and shade, with nimbly sprung rhythms crisp as an iceberg lettuce.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/03/the-barber-of-seville-review-royal-opera-house-london-terfel-akhmetshinapayare">Continue reading...</a>

## One side of the C of E preaches LGBT+ acceptance, the other says I’m going to hell. This can’t go on | Jayne Ozanne

<p>‘Blessing’ LGBT+ people instead of allowing equal marriage is just the latest round of Church of England can-kicking – so I’m challenging it</p><p>The Church of England currently teaches two totally incompatible visions of God. On the one hand, there is a gospel of grace, where the love of God is unconditional and available to all. On the other, there is a God who places restrictions on that grace and asks the church to act as the gatekeeper. The latter teaches that if someone like me, a lesbian, has sex then I will go to hell – a truth as central to this branch of faith as believing in the virgin birth or the resurrection.</p><p>For years, the church’s solution to this contradiction has been to kick the can marked “LGBT+ relationships” down the road, and the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/justin-welby-archbishop-of-canterbury-church-of-england-same-sex-civil-marriages">historic” proposals </a>announced last month on sexuality were no exception. They continue to embed discrimination by refusing to recognise civil marriage as “holy matrimony” and only offer token prayers of blessing to gay couples, cunningly blessing the individuals rather than their union. There are also many shades of grey – especially as to whether our unions can actually now be consummated. All this from our established church, the official state church that operates thanks to delegated powers from parliament, which continues to be allowed to discriminate against those it serves.</p><p>Jayne Ozanne is director of Ozanne Foundation, founder of the Ban Conversion Therapy coalition and an elected member of the General Synod</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/church-of-england-excluding-lgbt-people-equal-marriage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steve Borthwick’s men will run out on Saturday in one of the worst rugby shirts of all time. It doesn’t have to be this way</p><p>The comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rob-newman">Robert Newman</a> once discussed why England’s football team wear white. Having invented football, he said, the English got to pick colours first. So they chose white, freighted with meaning and power, pure and existential.</p><p>Newman didn’t cite the greatest novel of all, Moby-Dick, but I will. Herman Melville wrote a whole chapter about white, the colour of his whale. He wrote of the “certain nameless terror” instilled by visions in white, whether sharks, bears, Death on his pale horse or even Iron Mike Teague. I might have added the last one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/03/england-rugby-union-shirt-six-nations-2023">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forest Green’s new manager on why Everton should have stuck with him, hopes for a Real Madrid friendly and the environment</p><p>Duncan Ferguson is synonymous with Everton and wherever he goes he takes a little bit of the club with him in the form of a tattoo on his arm. The ink is barely dry on his five-year Forest Green contract but he is already hoping to add the crest to his body. “Staying up could get a tattoo but if we get into the Championship, then definitely,” Ferguson says.</p><p>After two decades at Goodison Park as a player and coach he is starting his managerial career at League One’s bottom club aged 51. Ferguson came close to getting jobs at Blackburn and Middlesbrough but has had to drop to the third tier to find an owner willing to trust him. The former Scotland striker received the call from Dale Vince in the middle of last week and drove down the next morning from Formby via “15 wrong turns” to sign the deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/03/duncan-ferguson-forest-green-manager-vegan-everton-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

And so, for years, I stuck to the adult version of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off">The Great British Bake Off</a>, for fear of seeing a nine-year-old set themselves on fire or experience the disappointment that was already devastating enough on the face of a 46-year-old <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/859158/Great-British-Bake-Off-2017-James-Hillery-fifth-contestant-BOOTED-OUT-Paul-Hollywood">banker</a> from Brentwood. But, deep into one of the lockdowns, I gave it a go, and found I had been entirely wrong – this was, in fact, the Bake Off that the format was born for, and it would change my outlook on more than just baking.</p><p>Where the adult competition is now populated by <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/great-british-bake-off-cake-inflation-investigation-204808">quasi-professionals</a>, the bakes in the junior tent (whose latest series concludes on Friday evening) are often hideous, usually inedible, and only very occasionally impressive. The two hosts – Ravneet Gill and former adult Bake Off contestant Liam Charles – deserve some kind of television award for eating them all without gagging. (Then again, they are also responsible for choosing the challenges – you want to eat multiple rounds of glutinous <a href="https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/ravneet-gill-tang-yuan-frogs/">frogs poached in syrup</a>? Cooked by children? Really?) And yet despite the lurid mush they regularly serve up to the judges, these children appear to be made of steel. There are occasional tears, and downcast moments, but they bounce back instantly – they are, as it turns out, far more resilient than their adult counterparts. On coming seventh out of seven bakers in a challenge, this season’s Poppy shrugged and said: “At least I didn’t come eighth!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/junior-bake-off-better-adult-uglier-cakes-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Netherlands world No 5 got a final-round gift, while a ‘backbreaker’ in the penultimate round cost the world champion his chance of forcing a playoff</p><p>Chess tournaments can be decided by the tiniest of margins, and that certainly happened in last weekend’s final two rounds at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, the “chess Wimbledon”. The world champion, Magnus Carlsen, missed a likely winning opportunity in the penultimate round, while the Dutch home favourite, Anish Giri, received a gift point in his final game.</p><p>Nodirbek Abdusattorov, the Uzbekistan 18-year-old who had led all the way from round one, chose a conservative drawing strategy in the second half of the event, and came unstuck against the offbeat ideas of Giri’s compatriot Jorden van Foreest. Abdusattorov still made a major advance, reaching the world top 20 with a controlled focus contrasting with his rival Alireza Firouzja, whose career path has become uncertain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/03/chess-anish-giri-wins-at-wijk-aan-zee-as-carlsen-misses-out-by-just-half-a-point">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An album of swatches offers a rich historical record of middle-class life in the 19th century</p><p>In May 1848 merchant’s wife Anne Sykes rustled on to the dancefloor in a dress made of pink and purple silk taffeta. Her husband, Adam, was quite possibly in the cream velvet pile waistcoat that he had got for his birthday. Or perhaps he had opted for the bright silk tartan one. Either way, the young couple must have shimmered as they waltzed, giving the lie to the idea that the early Victorians mostly preferred to look as if they were off to a funeral.</p><p>Found on a market stall in the 1970s, an album that Sykes kept throughout much of her early adult life contains 2,000 swatches of fabric, all neatly snipped and mounted. Rather than collect her friends’ and family’s autographs, she asked instead for a sample of their clothes, which she then carefully transferred on to paper and annotated, much as you might do with seashells or foreign stamps. The result is an extraordinarily rich record of middle-class Victorian life, both at home and abroad (the Sykeses spent seven years in Singapore, which is where the pink and purple silk taffeta made its dazzling debut).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/03/the-dress-diary-of-mrs-anne-sykes-by-kate-strasdin-review-the-fabric-of-victorian-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Recent cold spell in the south-east shows how three- to five-day calculations can be wildly incorrect</p><p>In the heady days of 1991 when the Met Office’s first supercomputer was installed there were predictions of accurate UK weather forecasts – days, weeks and even months in advance. Gradually this optimism was eroded by the realisation that despite the millions of calculations the computers had the capacity to make, the outcomes still varied wildly depending on the data that was fed in.</p><p>Short-term forecasts definitely improved, but in 2009 the Met Office predicted in April that there would be a barbecue summer and had to apologise in July when large parts of the country were flooded.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/feb/03/british-weather-still-confounds-forecasting-supercomputers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A legal loophole means the identities of many foreign individuals – as opposed to companies – owning property in Britain are still unknown to the public</p><p>When Vladimir Putin launched all-out war on Ukraine a year ago, the British government realised that letting Russian oligarchs buy large chunks of west London had been foolish. The long-cherished belief that the civilising air of Eaton Square might turn kleptocrats into democrats was finally – if belatedly – abandoned.</p><p>The fruit of the government’s realisation is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-new-register-of-overseas-entities-is-live">new register of overseas owners</a> of UK properties, which ended the anonymity that oligarchs enjoyed by hiding their mansions behind offshore-registered shell companies.
