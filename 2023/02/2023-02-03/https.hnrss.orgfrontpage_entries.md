<p>Hi all, I've talked about glidesort a few times on HN already, but it's finally ready for release. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. An academic paper on glidesort that goes into a lot more detail than the readme is upcoming, but is not ready yet.<p>I will be giving a talk on glidesort tomorrow at FOSDEM 2023 in the Rust Devroom at 16:10, you can seek me out there as well.</p>

<p>After getting frustrated with Siri's inability to answer pretty basic questions with actual answers instead of "I searched the web for you", I figured out how to get GPT-3 integrated pretty seamlessly with Siri. Sharing it here in case it's useful for anyone else!<p>You can see the short writeup with instructions here:
https://alexkolchinski.com/2023/02/03/how-to-talk-to-gpt-3-through-siri/<p>The Siri shortcut is here:
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b10d3d361a3f48428a2ed8fe729dc4fa
(You'll need to add your OpenAI API key to the shortcut and update your Siri accessibility settings to get it to work smoothly – see the above-linked blog post for more detailed instructions.)</p>

## Show HN: Makejinja: Automatically generate complex Home Assistant configurations
 - [https://github.com/mirkolenz/makejinja](https://github.com/mirkolenz/makejinja)

<p>makejinja can be used to automatically generate files from Jinja templates. This allows you to load variables from external files or create repeating patterns via loops. A very interesting use case for this tool is generating config files for Home Assistant: Using the same language that the built-in templates use, you can greatly simplify your configuration. When creating for example dashboards, it allows you to create a view for each room based on a single common template, dramatically reducing the maintenance overhead of complex dashboards. I originally developed this for my smarthome setup, but thought it may be useful for others as well!<p>A concrete example for Home Assistant can be found in the tests directory: <a href="https://github.com/mirkolenz/makejinja/blob/main/tests/data">https://github.com/mirkolenz/makejinja/blob/main/tests/data</a><p>For more information like detailed features or installation/usage instructions, please visit the GitHub repo.</p>

<p>I was just offered the paid subscription yesterday for $20/mo. I went ahead and signed up for this month just to see if bringing back the late-December speeds and uptime would feel compelling.<p>I'm still not really incorporating ChatGPT into my daily workflows at all, but I give it lots of "for fun" prompts all day. So, I am not confident I will stick with the subscription past a month, but I hope the payment pushes me to find more practical uses for it.<p>How about you?</p>

## Ask HN: What were the papers on the list Ilya Sutskever gave John Carmack?

<p>John Carmack's new interview on AI/AGI [1] carries a puzzle:<p>“So I asked Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist, for a reading list. He gave me a list of like 40 research papers and said, ‘If you really learn all of these, you’ll know 90% of what matters today.’ And I did. I plowed through all those things and it all started sorting out in my head.”<p>What papers do you think were on this list?<p>[1] https://dallasinnovates.com/exclusive-qa-john-carmacks-different-path-to-artificial-general-intelligence/</p>

## Tell HN: Firefox Is an awesome browser right now

<p>I was having trouble loading GMail in Chrome. I wasn't sure if it was my spotty internet or the browser acting up so I gave Firefox a shot. And behold! Firefox opened it in a jiffy.<p>What impressed me most was that it was able to import saved passwords, bookmarks and websites history from Chrome pretty quickly. Previously, I had imported these to Chromium based web browsers (Brave & Edge) but was afraid that it might be an issue for non-Chromium browser like Firefox, but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't.<p>Some really cool observations in first 30 mins of using it :<p>1. It opens websites really quickly, much faster than Chrome<p>2. All parts feel really customizable. I was able to get rid of the Firefox View tab really easily (I may explore it in the future because it seemed quite interesting to send links from phone to desktop). It was also easy enough to customize bookmarks bar to only show up in new tab.<p>3. Extensions ecosystem is thriving . I was glad to find my old favorite: Dark Reader. But I have also found a new favorite - Tab Stash. I also found an extension to download Youtube videos - Video Downloader, something I didn't find in Chrome<p>4. Clean look that gets out of your way.<p>I had given Firefox a shot in the past and had found Chrome to be a better performing browser at the time. But this time, Firefox seems to really have clicked with me.<p>I'd be glad to learn of any other cool features and extensions that y'all might want to share.</p>

## Ask HN: Why do cameras stop recording after 30 minutes?

<p>Some say it's a technical limitation for heat management, memory management. While some others say it's to escape the additional tax that applies if a camera is classified as a video camera, the latter being defined as something that records beyond 30 minutes.<p>What's the true reason?</p>

## Small SaaS banned by Cloudflare after 4 years of being paying customer

<p>Hi, small SaaS founder here (tardis.dev) - I've been heavy Cloudflare Workers user (currently 4 billions requests  & 1PB of data per month) for about 4 years already and today at 00:00 UTC without any warning my account was restricted, both website and APIs are down or very very slow to respond/time out, customers are angry obviously. I confirmed with support that "hmm, I see that your zone seems like being restricted due to 2.8 Limitation on Serving Non-HTML Content, see that there's high JSON data transfer". - which is bit strange as I'm using workers which have different terms - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20791660 (confirmed by their CTO)...anyways I get it, perhaps I pay too little and should be on enterprise plan already, but when I got approached by Cloudflare sales team I explicitly asked if I can still be on pay as you go/self server model and reply was: "Enterprise wise, that's up to you and you could likely get away with utilising self-serve as you go, but if you did choose to go enterprise (without R2) I might be able to have something approved in the xx/month range."<p>I would fully understand that I am required to upgrade, but why not sending me an email before shutting down my business completely? I even asked about such scenario on zoom meeting I had with their Sales and they said it will never happen - few weeks forward and here we are...anyways going back to replying to my customers emails regarding service outage.</p>

<p>Hey HN!<p>I just shipped a project I’ve been working on called Maroofy: <a href="https://maroofy.com" rel="nofollow">https://maroofy.com</a><p>You can search for any song, and it’ll use the song’s audio to find other similar-sounding music.<p>Demo: <a href="https://twitter.com/subby_tech/status/1621293770779287554" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/subby_tech/status/1621293770779287554</a><p>How does it work?<p>I’ve indexed ~120M+ songs from the iTunes catalog with a custom AI audio model that I built for understanding music.<p>My model analyzes raw music audio as input and produces embedding vectors as output.<p>I then store the embedding vectors for all songs into a vector database, and use semantic search to find similar music!<p>Here are some examples you can try:<p>Fetish (Selena Gomez feat. Gucci Mane) — <a href="https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943" rel="nofollow">https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943</a> 
The Medallion Calls (Pirates of the Caribbean) — <a href="https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752" rel="nofollow">https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752</a><p>Hope you like it, and would love to hear any questions/feedback/comments! :D</p>

## Show HN: I turned my microeconomics textbook into a chatbot with GPT-3

<p>I never really read my micro-econ textbook.<p>Looking up concepts from the book with Google yields SEO-y results.<p>So I used GPT-3 to make a custom chatbot I can query at any time.</p>
