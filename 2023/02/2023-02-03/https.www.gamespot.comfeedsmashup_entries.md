## Death To Linears | Iron Banter: This Week in Destiny 2

<p><em>Just about every week brings something new to Destiny 2, whether it's story beats, new activities, or interesting new combinations of elements that let players devastate each other in the Crucible. Iron Banter is our weekly look at what's going on in the world of Destiny and a rundown of what's drawing our attention across the solar system.</em></p><p><span>I was playing a legendary PsiOp mission on the EDZ with GameSpot's own Jean-Luc Seipke earlier this week, and I spent a good deal of time just blankly staring at DIM (the third-party Destiny Item Manager) trying to figure out what would give me the easiest time. We were planning on going into the activity without a third guardian, and since the activity isn't matchmade, it can get pretty dicey. That being said, it's not that I had difficulty deciding what I wanted in my overall loadout, but the Power weapon slot was bothering me. Legendary seasonal activities aren't necessarily hard, but they can be challenging if you don't go into them with a somewhat decent kit. Unfortunately, Destiny has suffered at times when it stifles creativity--where the meta basically amounts to, "use this weapon, or you're stupid."</span></p><p dir="ltr">In this case, it's Heavy linear fusion rifles. They have dominated the PvE space for what feels like an eternity now, especially with the introduction of the burst-fire versions such as Stormchaser or Fire and Forget. Countless beefy yellow bar enemies, raid bosses, and other baddies have been on the receiving end of these overpowered weapons. If you were lucky enough to have one with damage-boosting perks, a Veist Stinger Origin trait, Enhanced craftable mods, or an Adept Big Ones perk (hello, Reed's Regret), it was a no-brainer. You used a linear (and Arbalest) if you were serious, and if you didn't…well, let's just say your clanmates probably had the higher DPS numbers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-to-linears-iron-banter-this-week-in-destiny-2/1100-6511181/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Netflix Claims Password-Sharing Rules Won't Apply To US Yet, Were Posted By Mistake

<p>Netflix's divisive password-sharing crackdown policies are apparently not coming to the US just yet, despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-reveals-the-rules-for-password-sharing-going-forward-including-check-in-every-31-days/1100-6511067/">a comprehensive breakdown of rules that were posted to its member Help Center FAQ earlier this week</a>. According to comments a spokesperson provided to <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/netflix-claims-it-errantly-posted-password-sharing-rules-that-would-block-devices-outside-of-subscribers-homes">The Streamable</a>, those policies were posted by mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">"For a brief time, a help center article containing information that is only applicable to Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, went live in other countries," the spokesperson told The Streamable. "We have since updated it."</p><p dir="ltr">What a spokesperson wouldn't be free to say is that perhaps the policies--which included a mandatory account check-in every 31 days, among other new rules--were posted deliberately to gauge reactions. Unsurprisingly, the sudden rollout of these rules were met with significant pushback from customers. For example, many criticized the requirement for traveling customers to request and subsequently secure a temporary code from the service, which would only grant access to an account for seven consecutive days.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-claims-password-sharing-rules-wont-apply-to-us-yet-were-posted-by-mistake/1100-6511172/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Live-Service Game Bubble Looks Ready To Burst

<p dir="ltr">Fortnite is several weeks into the first season of its fourth chapter. In real time, it's been going strong since the summer of 2017, and though Epic doesn't share player counts, by any available metric it seems to still be doing incredibly well. But in the live-service world, Fortnite's success feels increasingly rare. While there do exist other major successes in the pocket of the games industry where studios operate one game for years on end, many others are closing their proverbial doors for good, which is extremely scary both for players worried about gaming history and future developers concerned with the trends they may be tasked with chasing. Can live-service games survive modest successes, or must they all be as massive as Fortnite to make it?</p><p dir="ltr">This is not an investigative feature that can bring closure to some of these questions, I admit. Rather, I'm merely mourning the loss of yet more games that will soon be lost to time, including another of my all-time favorites. When Velan Studios took to social media to alert players that its PvP dodgeball game, Knockout City (KOC), would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-city-is-going-offline-forever-in-june/1100-6511140/">closing forever in June</a>, it genuinely ruined my night.</p><p dir="ltr">Roughly one year after breaking away from EA to self-publish the game and reimagine its economy for a free-to-play world, it seems KOC's successes were not numerous enough to keep the game going. Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr. put it best:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Might Not Release In 2023 - Report

<p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf might be farther from release than previously thought, according to a new report. Two anonymous sources interviewed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-details-on-dragon-age-dreadwolf-revealed/">Insider Gaming</a> disclosed that the game lacks features, voice lines, and is still using placeholder text. The report claims that, although rumors suggested that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will release in 2023, the game is likely still further out.</p><p>The sources also share details of the game's structure. Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-cuts-multiplayer-from-dragon-age-4-report-says/1100-6488093/">multiplayer was cut from the game earlier in development</a>, the report claims that some of systems connected to multiplayer remain. Players interact with a central hub between quests, where they can talk with party members, as well as buy and customize equipment. Completing missions will net players more crew members and resources to spend back at base.</p><p>One of the sources claims the combat takes cues from Final Fantasy XV, with a real-time combat system. Players are also unable to directly control crew members, instead selecting an ability for them to use during combat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-might-not-release-in-2023-report/1100-6511173/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Magic The Gathering - Phyrexia: All Will Be One Cards And Changes

<p>It's been over two months since the release of last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/magic-the-gathering-1997/">Magic: The Gathering</a> set, "The Brothers' War." There, the original Magic plane of Dominaria was under attack by one of the most evil forces in the Multiverse. Now, it's time to head to the plane behind the invasion, and take on the enemy in their home turf.</p><p>Welcome to "Phyrexia: All Will Be One." Unlike the relatively peaceful blue skies and natural oases of Dominaria, the plane of New Phyrexia is a twisted fever dream--one full of death, decay, and metal monstrosities held together by tissue and tendon. At the helm is the loathsome leader, the "Mother of Machines": Elesh Norn.</p><p>Phyrexia: All Will Be One (ONE) is a large set, bringing <strong>271 new cards</strong> into rotation. Both flavorfully and mechanically, it is a much different landscape than the previous two Dominaria-based sets we played with. To tackle your prerelease, or get a head start on building new decks for constructed, you'll want to have an understanding of everything going on in ONE.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-phyrexia-all-will-be-one-cards-and-changes/1100-6511084/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> in-game Valentine's Day celebration is nearly here, and this year Blizzard is "sharing the love" by dramatically increasing the drop rate for one of the game's most hard to come by mounts.</p><p dir="ltr">The mount in question is the X-45 Heartbreaker, a giant, flying pink rocket that is only earnable for a few weeks out of the year while the Love is in the Air event is ongoing. Players queue for the event dungeon with the hope of earning the mount in one of the Heart-Shaped Boxes rewarded for completing the dungeon once per day, per character. Because of the way the rewards are structured and the mount's incredibly low drop chance, players have long felt forced to complete the event dungeon on as many characters as possible every day the event was active in order to maximize their chances of earning the mount.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, that won't be necessary going forward. In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/x-45-heartbreaker-mount-drop-rate-increase/1511429">forum post</a>, Blizzard has explained how the event will work differently this year so that the first Heart-Shaped Box earned each day on an account-wide basis has a greatly increased chance to contain the mount. All subsequent boxes earned across various characters will still have a chance to drop the mount, but it will be the ultra-rare, original drop rate. The change should encourage players to complete the dungeon once per day for the best chance to earn the mount while simultaneously making it so players don't feel forced to grind the event dungeon on multiple characters.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-notoriously-rare-valentines-day-event-mount-is-now-much-easier-to-earn/1100-6511166/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Developer Second Dinner offers plenty of incentives to keep checking in to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a>, most notably with its Featured and Hot Locations. These in-game events give specific locations a higher chance of appearing, motivating players to change up their decks. But what exactly are Featured and Hot Locations and when do they run? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2>Featured Locations</h2><p>Featured Locations are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a> events that implement a specific new location at a higher rate. This marks the introduction of a brand new location, with a <strong>40% appearance</strong> <strong>rate</strong> during the event's duration. An example is Plunder Castle, which only allows you to play cards that cost 6 energy to be played there. Featured Locations go live every <strong>Tuesday at 10 PM Eastern</strong> and last for <strong>48 hours</strong>.</p><p>After the 48-hour period, the Featured Location will then be folded into the regular location pool, with a chance of appearing during standard play. So, even after a Featured Location period has ended, it's a good idea to be familiar with that particular location so you can adapt if it appears during a match.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-featured-and-hot-locations-explained/1100-6511164/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Valiant Hearts: Coming Home Review - In The Trenches

<p dir="ltr">In 2014, Ubisoft released Valiant Hearts: The Great War, a game that stood out by virtue of it being a smaller, more intimate tale amidst its many more action-oriented brethren. Instead of explosive set pieces and main characters that doubled as killing machines, the game focuses on the people who find themselves forever marked by war. Nine years later, Valiant Hearts: Coming Home continues the tale on mobile devices exclusively through Netflix, and it picks up right where the previous story left off. While a lack of challenging gameplay and a short lifespan could sink other games, brevity is used to its advantage to ensure the story hits just as hard as its predecessor..</p><p dir="ltr">Coming Home begins in 1917, just as American troops are entering the war for the first time. Familiar faces Freddie and Anna return, along with three new main characters: James, Freddie's younger brother; George, a fighter pilot; and Ernst, a German sailor who, through no fault of his own, finds himself an unwitting participant in the war effort.</p><p dir="ltr">The story is told across 19 scenes split into three chapters, which translates into about 2.5 hours of gameplay. On paper it sounds very short, but the story is efficiently told. None of the beats feel like they drag on; from the opening scene Coming Home does a remarkable job of being clear-cut with its narrative--even those designed to make the player feel uncomfortable. For example, the very first scene shows James's enlistment experience, which has him forced into racially segregated lines with one line receiving weapons and the other, James's line, being given brooms for custodial work. In another scene, the medic Ana frantically runs around a hospital healing wounded, putting the player in control as she removes shrapnel from limbs and administers bandages.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/valiant-hearts-coming-home-review-in-the-trenches/1900-6418024/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Every Cover Star In MLB The Show History

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094288-2642908095-38219.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Few sports franchises have managed to be as consistently good as MLB The Show, and that makes it an even bigger honor to get selected as the year's cover star. Every year, much like in Madden and NBA 2K, a player is chosen as the defining star for the upcoming season. Any time you talk about a cover athlete, you also have to discuss the "curse" associated with it. Baseball players are notoriously superstitious, but is there any truth to such a curse in the MLB The Show series, or does it pale in comparison to the Madden curse?</p><p dir="ltr">Well, it seems to depend on the year. Much of the time, as you'll see detailed below, the MLB The Show cover star actually has a pretty great season when they're selected, and occasionally even put up better numbers than the year before. However, there are also a couple examples of absolute disasters, whether it be from injury or some unexplainable dip in performance.</p><p dir="ltr">We wanted to determine, once and for all, if the curse was real for MLB The Show, or if it had the opposite effect. To do this, we went through the entire franchise and looked at season statistics for the year each athlete was on the cover as well as the year before it. The results are encouraging for most of these stars, but if your name is Yasiel Puig or Javier Baez, you're probably wishing you declined the offer. It remains to be seen what fate MLB 23 star Jazz Chisholm will meet.</p><p dir="ltr">Here is every cover star in MLB The Show history.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 06: The Show - David Ortiz</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094289-mlb06cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the most legendary Red Sox players of all time, David Ortiz etched his name in Boston sports history with his legendary clutch hitting performances. In 2006, just a few years removed from the Red Sox finally breaking Babe's curse, Ortiz had one of his <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/ortizda01.shtml">best seasons ever</a>. Big Papi managed an OPS of 1.049, hitting 54 homers (a career high) and driving in 137 runs. He followed it with what was arguably an even better season just a year later, but it's obvious that Oritz wasn't cursed at all with his MLB The Show cover.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Hell no</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 07: The Show - David Wright</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094290-mlb07cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">An all-time great Mets third-baseman, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wrighda03.shtml">David Wright's career</a> in Queens was often derailed by lingering injuries, and from 2011 to his retirement in 2017, he only played more than 134 games a single time. But back in 2007, Wright was at the absolute top of his game, and purely from a statistical standpoint, that was actually the best year in his whole career. During the 2007 season, David Wright tied his 160-game season high for games played, clubbing 30 home runs and coming close to a batting title with .325. If anything, his cover appearance only made him better.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Absolutely not</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 08: The Show - Ryan Howard</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094291-mlb08cover.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Philadelphia Phillies were straight-up dominant for a few years in the mid- and late-2000s, and first-baseman and gargantuan human Ryan Howard was a big reason for this. 2008 wasn't necessarily the slugger's <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/howarry01.shtml">best season</a>--his 2006 season meant he probably should have been the 2007 cover star, instead--but he still put up impressive numbers. It was the only year Howard played in every single game during the season, and he managed to drive in a ludicrous 146 runs. Sure, he also struck out 199 times, but it was far from a lousy year.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> No</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 09: The Show - Dustin Pedroia</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094292-mlb09cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Oh, Dustin Pedroia, perhaps the only Red Sox player as beloved as David Ortiz over the last few decades. The scrappy second-baseman was one of the smallest players in the league for the entirety of his career, but he was able to consistently hit the ball and get on base, all while playing terrific defense. In 2009, he was awarded the MLB The Show cover because of his terrific (and MVP-winning) <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pedrodu01.shtml">season the year prior</a>. He wasn't cursed by the cover, but his numbers did take a dive in a few areas. One of the biggest was his base-stealing success--thrown out just once in 2008, Pedroia got caught with his hand in the cookie jar eight times in 2009.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> No</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 10: The Show - Joe Mauer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094293-mlb10cover.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">"Well played, Mauer." Following a <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mauerjo01.shtml">ludicrousy good 2009 campaign</a> in which he hit .365 with 28 home runs--all while playing the hardest position on the field other than pitcher--Joe Mauer was a no-brainer for the MLB 10: The Show cover. His 2010 season was still quite good, but closer to his typical performance than the incredible 2009 season. Still, getting over 500 at-bats as a catcher is nothing to sneeze at, and he also managed to cut down on his strikeout total while keeping his on-base percentage high.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> No</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 11: The Show - Joe Mauer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094294-mlb11cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps lightning can't strike in the same place twice, and Mauer may have been the first player hit by the curse with MLB 11: The Show. He only played in about half the games that year--his lowest total outside of his brief experience in 2004--and nearly every statistic looked worse. His batting average dropped a full 40 points, as did his on-base percentage, and he was injured for much of the year. Though he would never again have a season like his 2009 run, he did manage to rebound from his poor 2011 with great numbers in the next two years, helping to make him a no-doubt Hall of Fame choice.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Yes</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 12: The Show - Adrian Gonzalez</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094296-mlb12cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the weirder years for the cover, MLB 12: The Show saw first-baseman Adrian Gonzalez as its star. That's not the weird part, as his <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gonzaad01.shtml">prior season was excellent</a>--what's weird is that he's wearing a Red Sox uniform and didn't even stay in Boston for a full season before heading to the Dodgers. Regardless, his numbers for the season weren't bad, especially in a Red Sox uniform, though they were a substantial step down from his time in San Diego. In fact, he'd never again reach that status, and despite cracking .900 in OPS three times prior to his cover appearance, he failed to reach that mark for the rest of his career.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Arguably</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 13: The Show - Andrew McCutchen</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094297-mlb13cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Andrew McCutchen may have saved the Pittsburgh Pirates, bringing excitement back to a team that had been nothing but a laughingstock for two decades. He followed up his excellent 2012 season by <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mccutan01.shtml">winning the NL MVP</a>, continuing to turn the Pirates from a punchline into a genuinely good club. His glove wasn't always his strongest aspect during his time in Pittsburgh (welcome back, by the way) but he also saw his best defensive wins above replacement in 2013. Not only did the cover not curse McCutchen, but it may have actually given the guy superpowers.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Quite the opposite</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 14: The Show - Miguel Cabrera</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094298-mlb14cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Miguel Cabrera will go down in baseball history as one of the greatest hitters of all time. He won the Triple Crown in 2012, being the first person to do so in more than 40 years, and he won AL MVP awards in both 2012 and 2013. He didn't win one in 2014, and his <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cabremi01.shtml">numbers took a very slight dip</a>. Still, it's really difficult to say Cabrera was cursed when he still had an OPS of nearly .900 and he drove in more than 100 runs. He also managed to play in 159 games that year, which was close to his career high, and he scored more than 100 runs.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> No</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB 15: The Show - Yasiel Puig</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094299-mlb15cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">What an absolute mess. Yasiel Puig broke onto the Dodgers when he was just 22, and he managed to have his best season ever the following season. That was enough to get him on the cover of MLB 15: The Show, but it was a <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/puigya01.shtml">season that would mark the beginning of his decline</a>. Injured for much of the year, Puig's numbers dropped across the board, including a 60-point drop in on-base percentage and a similarly large drop in slugging percentage. It wasn't his worst year statistically--that would come in 2015--but there's no denying that the spotlight being shined on Puig after such a meteoric rise doesn't look like a wise decision these days.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Yes</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 16 - Josh Donaldson</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094300-mlb16cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">There is perhaps no baseball player who thinks more highly of themselves than Josh Donaldson, but for a few-year stretch, his confidence was warranted. The Blue Jays third-baseman followed up an excellent 2015 with an <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/donaljo02.shtml">equally great 2016</a>, showing he was the right choice for MLB The Show 16's cover. He improved his on-base percentage--a great sign for a player who swings like he's trying to decapitate someone--and his slugging percentage only took a very slight drop. In fact, if it weren't for Mike Trout, it's arguable that Donaldson should have won the MVP again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> No way</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 17 - Ken Griffey Jr.</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094301-mlb17cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">A special choice for MLB The Show 17, Ken Griffey Jr. had already retired by the time he graced the cover, and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/griffke02.shtml">his numbers</a> made him one of the easiest Hall of Fame choices in history. "The Kid" hit 630 homers over the course of his career, while also limiting his strikeouts and--at least early in his career--showing impressive speed on the basepaths. He also showed impressive range and timing in the outfield, and he was one of the few sluggers from the '90s to never be tied to steroid use. There was no better ambassador for the game, and he absolutely deserved to get a spot on the cover.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> N/A</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 18 - Aaron Judge</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094302-mlb18cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Aaron Judge wasted little time making a name for himself with the Yankees, hitting more than 50 homers in his <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/judgeaa01.shtml">first full season</a> in 2017 while also managing an on-base percentage of .422--there was little doubt that he deserved the MLB The Show 18 cover. However, 2018 would also mark the first of several injury-plagued seasons for Judge, who would play in just 112 games and see a decline in nearly every offensive stat. It seems he's finally past that after winning the MVP for his once-in-a-lifetime 2022 season, but it sure looked like he was suffering from a bit of a cover curse for a while there.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Yes</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 19 - Bryce Harper</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094303-mlb19cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Following a long stretch of time with the Nationals, Bryce Harper signed an enormous contract with the Phillies in 2019, which was also the year he was featured on The Show's cover. His <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/harpebr03.shtml">numbers were very similar</a> from 2018 to 2019, though it's arguable that he didn't really deserve to be on the cover at all, with a .249 batting average the year before. Still, Harper was at least consistent, and he's continued to knock the cover off the ball and shows incredible intensity for the game. That makes him one of the most hated people in the whole game, but we get the sense that he doesn't really care.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Yes</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 20 - Javier Baez</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094304-mlb20cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Well, it can't work out for every MLB cover star. Javier Baez put up impressive numbers in 2019 with the Cubs, as the shortstop continued to show impressive power at the position while still flashing the leather on defense. His 2020 season didn't go so well, as he had <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/baezja01.shtml">absolutely dreadful numbers</a> during the pandemic-shortened season. How dreadful? He barely batted above the Mendoza line, his OPS was under .600, and he only drew seven walks. There are few worse seasons for an everyday starter, much less one who was on the cover of a video game, though he did rebound the following year. For his part, Baez said the <a href="https://theathletic.com/2053724/2020/09/09/javier-baez-is-just-being-honest-when-he-blasts-mlbs-in-game-video-ban/">ban of in-game video</a> in dugouts--brought on after the Astros' cheating scandal--meant he could make adjustments mid-game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> Take a wild guess</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 21 - Fernando Tatis Jr.</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094306-mlb21cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Fernando Tatis Jr. has still not played in a <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/tatisfe02.shtml">full MLB season</a>--injuries and a suspension cost him the entirety of 2022--but his 2021 campaign was as close as he has gotten. He made the most of his, clubbing 42 homers in just 130 games and stealing 25 bases. The star was only 22 years old that year, and though his defense as shortstop made him a little bit of a liability, he certainly proved he deserved a spot on the cover.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cursed by cover stardom?:</strong> No</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 22 - Shohei Ohtani</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4094307-mlb22cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">No baseball player since Babe Ruth has been more exciting than Shohei Ohtani. The Japanese two-way superstar hit 46 home runs in 2021 while also compiling a 3.18 ERA and starting 23 games. There was no year when it was more obvious who should be the cover star than 2022, and Ohtani had another very impressive season. His <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/ohtansh01.shtml">offensive numbers</a> dropped a little bit, as he hit with less power and also avoided stealing bases frequently, but his pitching actually improved.

But not everyone liked it, due in part to the episode's gay romance storyline. Offerman is now hitting back at the haters. He replied to a tweet from someone who said the Episode 3 storyline "ruined" the show for them.

<p dir="ltr">The Nier Automata <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-automata-anime-gets-teaser-will-descend-in-january/1100-6507819/">anime adaptation</a> is currently on hiatus due to COVID-related production problems, but series creator Yoko Taro has a surprise for update-hungry fans. He's collaborated with rock band Amazarashi to create a 15-minute long music video that consists of a puppet show that retells the story of Nier Automata itself.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Set to the ending theme of the Automata anime, Antimony, this is a telling from the perspective of its ubiquitous robots, who are controlled by two creators known as "Father" and "Mother." Though we won't give away how exactly this conflict turns out for our cute robot friends, let's just say that there are a lot of parallels between theirs and the plight of the androids that star in the original Automata.</p><p dir="ltr">Yoko Taro has made music videos with Amazarashi before, collaborating on the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiNKk3fPed8">Deserving of Life</a> to mark Nier Automata's original release all the way back in 2017. As spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/2/3/23584391/nier-automata-yoko-taro-anime-puppet-show-music-video">Polygon</a>, Yoko said in a recent interview that the music video's script was inspired by the Japanese author Kenji Miyazawa, who is best-known for his work Night on the Galactic Railroad. We don't know when the Nier Automata anime will return from its hiatus, but it'll surely make for a memorable time.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niers-yoko-taro-made-a-puppet-show-while-we-wait-for-delayed-anime/1100-6511157/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Described as a very different kind of superhero story that'll be seen in the DCU's Gods and Monsters lineup of projects, Gunn says that the film will lean into the morally grey area of justice that the Authority represents.

<p>The director of photography for HBO's The Last of Us series has shared some behind-the-scenes photos and images from the much-loved third episode, "Long Long Night." Eben Bolter shared an incredible and fascinating look into the gripping and emotional episode, confirming, among other details that HBO basically built an entire town for the episode.</p><p>One of Bolter's images also shows the precise latitude and longitude of the much-talked about scene claiming to be "10 miles west of Boston." Because of those specific geopositioning details, we know that this scene was not actually filmed anywhere near Boston.</p><p>In fact, based on the coordinates that Bolter provided in one of the behind-the-scenes images, we can see it was filmed in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/50%C2%B037'00.5%22N+114%C2%B042'09.4%22W/@50.6168034,-114.7047887,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x49512268b8a0904a!8m2!3d50.6168!4d-114.7026?coh=164777&amp;entry=tt&amp;shorturl=1">Kananaskis, AB, Canada, near the Sheep River Falls</a>.

<p dir="ltr">It turns out that Detective Pikachu 2--specifically the film, not the game--is still in the works, though getting it made doesn't sound like an easy task.</p><p dir="ltr">2019's Detective Pikachu was an immediate hit, amassing $433 million worldwide--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/">making it the second highest grossing video game film of all time</a>--and generally positive reviews, so a sequel was presumed a safe bet. It's almost four years later, and we haven't really heard much, with the star of the first film Justice Smith even saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/detective-pikachu-2-is-unlikely-star-justice-smith-says/1100-6491023/">Detective Pikachu 2 is unlikely</a>. But according to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23560467/pokemon-detective-pikachu-2-release-update">Polygon</a>, a sequel is in development, it's just not clear how far along it is.</p><p dir="ltr">A representative for Legendary Entertainment told Polygon that the film is still "in active development," but the production company wasn't able to divulge who is actually working on it at the moment. Polygon also reported that The Pokemon Company declined to comment when asked about the film or other projects.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/detective-pikachu-2-is-still-in-active-development/1100-6511151/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Forspoken Star Is Unbothered By "Cringe" Criticism

<p>Square Enix's new action-RPG Forspoken takes a lot of inspiration from Isekai anime, but one area where the game differs from that anime genre is with its protagonist Alfre "Frey" Holland. A cynical New Yorker and orphan who was bounced around foster homes, Frey's arrival in the fantasy land of Athia has been a running joke online, with many out-of-context examples of her interactions giving the game a somewhat cringey atmosphere. Frey's voice actress Ella Balinska has seen all the discourse circulating online, and she's not bothered by it, having instead embraced the varying reactions to her spell-slinger.</p><p>"There are things that we all do that might be eyebrow-raising to other people," Balinska said to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/2/23582914/forspoken-dialogue-memes-ella-balinska-ps5">The Verge</a>. "I think people always have a positive or negative response to something they're not used to seeing, and that's completely okay because that’s the way we incite change."</p><p>Balinska added that she thinks of her eight-year-old self when she talks of projects that she's proud of doing, and the idea of playing a game in which she's essentially the main character, has left her speechless. "I just never would have thought me playing games downstairs with my mom's hairdresser's son while she was getting her hair done," Balinska said. "Now, to think that he can pick up this game and play as me, it's just unbelievable. And I hope it inspires other people to realize that if you commit to the bit hard enough, something really crazy can happen."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-star-is-unbothered-by-cringe-criticism/1100-6511144/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Destiny 2's Witch Queen era officially comes to an end on February 28, as the game begins the next chapter in its Light and Darkness saga with the arrival of its Lightfall expansion. Like previous expansions, Bungie will be prepping the game for an influx of new content, tweaks, and changes to the core experience, so get ready for some downtime.</p><p>According to the studio, Destiny 2 will be brought offline for 24 hours starting at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on February 27, 2023. You'll have until then to wrap up any lingering seasonal objectives as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-seraph-seasonal-challenges-guide-week-9/1100-6509714/">Season of the Seraph</a> comes to an end, as once the downtime begins, you won't be able to play Destiny 2 until the servers are back online.</p><p>The developer is warning that the download file for Destiny 2 will be quite large, but the game will have a smaller footprint on your SSD and you'll see improved loading times as well. During this time, preloading for Lightfall will be available.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-be-offline-on-february-27-for-maintenance-and-lightfall-preloading/1100-6511142/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Lightfall introduces a new arsenal of the best-quality gear to be found in Destiny 2, powerful pieces of armor, and firearms that offer unique perks. Each Exotic comes with a unique look and trait, and when combined with Destiny 2's build-crafting system, there's usually a powerful setup that can be explored to help maximize your Guardian skills and personal playstyle.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-release-date-strand-subclass-and-everything-we-know/1100-6506893/">Lightfall</a>, several of these Exotics will be focused on the new Strand subclass. Bungie has only shown off a few of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-trailer-shows-off-new-and-deadly-exotics/1100-6510998/">new Exotics</a> so far, but these new tools look set to provide a powerful boost to Guardian arsenals. As the year goes on, you can expect more Exotics to be made available through the rewards track that accompanies each new season, and if you're ready for a challenge, taking on Raids, Legend Lost Sectors, and dungeons are a good source for acquiring this powerful gear.</p><p>One of the Lightfall Exotics has actually been around for several months now, as Bungie offered the auto rifle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-quicksilver-storm-exotic-in-destiny-2/1100-6506884/">Quicksilver Storm</a> as a preorder bonus for its expansion. At its base level, that weapon delivers a versatile payload of damage to anything in your path. It can fire off high-impact kinetic rounds, landing successive hits launches a homing mini-rocket, and it can be transformed into a powerful grenade launcher. For those of you who already have the weapon, its Exotic catalyst will be available in Lightfall and adds new Strand effects to its build.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Warning - Energy Sidearm</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094512-finalwarning.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A Kinetic slot Strand sidearm, Final Warning can mark targets within range and load a burst of bullets. When hip-fired, these rounds will track aggressively toward marked targets, making this a useful weapon for quickly clearing out cannon fodder enemies.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deterministic Chaos - Void Machine Gun</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094513-dterminchaos.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>A Void machine gun with a rhythmic design, every fourth bullet fired becomes a heavy projectile that weakens targets on impact, while every fourth heavy projectile makes targets volatile on impact. For boss encounters, this could significantly weaken a tougher foe, while using it to clear trash mobs can create some devastating explosions.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Winterbite - Stasis Glaive</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094514-winterbite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Exotic glaives are a rarity, but Winterbite slots nicely into that category while providing some tactical firepower. As a Stasis-energy glaive, it can fire a large ball of energy that locks onto nearby targets and freezes them.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cyrtarachne's Facade - Hunter Helmet</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094517-2023_lightfall_launch_presskit_gear_16x9_compressed_009.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>The right piece of armor can make a huge difference in your Guardian build, and with Cyrtarachne's Facade, that Exotic helmet gives Hunters extra protection when grappling and some handy flinch resistance that'll come in handy during PvP activities.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Abeyant Leap - Titan Leg Armor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094515-2023_lightfall_launch_presskit_gear_16x9_compressed_011.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>For Titans looking to dress to impress on Neomuna, Abeyant Leap looks like a handy set of Exotic leg armor. When using your Barricade subclass ability, it'll add extra armor and spawn two additional seeking projectiles that track targets aggressively and suspend them in midair.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Swarmers - Warlock Leg Armor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094516-2023_lightfall_launch_presskit_gear_16x9_compressed_010.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Warlocks also get a great armor Exotic in Lightfall, with Swarmers manifesting Strand Threadlings that infest and attack enemies after a tangle has been destroyed.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

<p>Developer InnerSloth has unveiled the 2023 roadmap for Among Us, which includes details on new content, features, and more.</p><p>Sharing in a recent <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/the-among-us-2023-roadmap/">blog post</a>, InnerSloth confirmed that the first thing it will be focusing on is adding multiple patches to the multiplayer game's UI and UX, specifically by updating the in-game store to be better to navigate, making account merging easier, as well as finding a better way of reporting toxic players. Although this is a big priority, the roadmap doesn't feature a release date for these changes, only that they're "coming soon."</p><p>Probably the most notable update to come this year is a brand-new map. Details on map 5 are currently still under wraps, but InnerSloth did say that it'll have new tasks, new cosmetics, and more hidden surprises. Players can expect the map to arrive "later in the year."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/among-us-future-plans-include-new-roles-new-map-better-matchmaking-more/1100-6511141/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/knockout-city/">Knockout City</a> is shutting down forever on June 6, Velan Studios revealed in a <a href="https://www.knockoutcity.com/updates/knockout-city-special-announcement">blog post</a>. The PvP dodgeball game will no longer be playable, with the exception of a PC-only "private server version" which will allow the game to "live on forever." The lengthy post addressed to the community explained at length why the difficult decision was made by the team. You can read an excerpt below.</p><p><em>"Creating such a different game with no points of comparison and running live services for the first time in many of our careers has also made the past couple years particularly challenging. Despite over 12 million players and billions of KOs around the globe, there are several aspects of the game in need of major disruption to better attract and retain enough players to be sustainable. Since we are a small, indie studio, it’s simply impossible for us to make those kinds of systemic changes in the live game while continuing to support it. </em></p><p><em>So it became clear to us that we needed to take a step back and pave the way for Velan to do what we do best by innovating. Now we can take everything we learned, everything that succeeded and everything that needs improvement, and get to work on exploring new possible experiences for Knockout City and other games and products we are very excited about. We’re currently in the process of doing a comprehensive retrospective on every aspect of the game, all the community feedback and analytics data, and even our development processes. </em></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-city-is-going-offline-forever-in-june/1100-6511140/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
