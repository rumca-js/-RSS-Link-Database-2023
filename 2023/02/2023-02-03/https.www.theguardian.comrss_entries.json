Right Here, Right Now (Sky Documentaries) might rectify that, but it isn\u2019t just a thrilling document of the event itself. The combination of what happened, and what might have happened but didn\u2019t, turns Jak Hutchcraft\u2019s film into a surprisingly intense experience, a rush powered by the euphoria of irresponsible adventure and the sweet sadness of distant youth.</p><p>This is good going, considering that the first half is a relatively tedious summary of Norman Cook\u2019s earlier career. We shuffle through his stint as the bass player in 80s band the Housemartins, whose tinkling guitars contrasted with the deep knowledge of funk and dance records Cook was acquiring in his spare time. By the time the Housemartins had run their course, he was a DJ, ready to embrace the new era of club culture. In 1996, he released his debut album under the moniker Fatboy Slim, layering ingeniously chosen samples over dance rhythms to create what became known as big beat. When Channel 4 held an open-air screening of an England cricket match at the Brighton seaside in 2001, it asked Fatboy Slim \u2013 who by then had scored top-five hits with Praise You and The Rockefeller Skank \u2013 to DJ afterwards. Thousands of people turned up. Fatboy Slim decided to stage a sequel the following year, planning a free set for as many people as the beach could take.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/03/right-here-right-now-review-fatboy-slims-beach-concert-will-make-you-flinch-with-anxiety\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/emma-brockes-column/2023/feb/03/digested-week-alec-baldwin-on-gun-control-silence-would-be-preferable", "title": "Digested week: Alec Baldwin on gun control?

I went back to my Twitter feed to find that this one quick tweet had been viewed 1.1m times. In German and international media, the definition was being widely quoted as mine. Since, as we all know, the internet never lies, it has now become a historical fact that I thus defined \u201cScholzing\u201d. (I had incautiously tweeted the meme directly from WhatsApp, so it didn\u2019t show up as something sent from Ukraine.

Despite having the original directors on hand, degrees of stylisation are inconsistent here, and stage business occasionally lacks motivation.<br /><br />Chief vocal honours go to up-and-coming Russian mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina whose burgundy lower register and pinpoint coloratura are matched by impressive reserves of power. Her determined Rosina is a coiled spring, passing time by throwing darts at the walls of her spartan prison.

His greasy haired Basilio is a creepy delight, all sotto voce insinuations and unnerving Nosferatu hands.<br />Making his ROH debut, Payare, who holds prestigious posts in Montreal and San Diego, might seem an odd choice for Rossini. His reputation, after all, rests on big hitters such as Mahler and Shostakovich. Not a bit of it. His perky, pacy reading is full of light and shade, with nimbly sprung rhythms crisp as an iceberg lettuce.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/03/the-barber-of-seville-review-royal-opera-house-london-terfel-akhmetshinapayare\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/church-of-england-excluding-lgbt-people-equal-marriage", "title": "One side of the C of E preaches LGBT+ acceptance, the other says I\u2019m going to hell.
