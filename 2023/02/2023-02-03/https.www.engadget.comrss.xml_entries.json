Seawater typically needs to be purified before electrolysis splits it into hydrogen and oxygen. The team says its results, using cobalt oxide with chromium oxide on its surface as the catalyst, had similar performance to a standard process of applying platinum and iridium catalysts to highly purified and deionized water.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Compared to freshwater, seawater is an abundant resource, and the ability to extract hydrogen fuel from seawater without pre-treatment could save money. However, even if successfully scaled, it would likely only be practical for coastal communities with plenty of seawater \u2014 not so much for Iowa or Kansas.</p><p>The team\u2019s next step is to scale the system with a larger electrolyzer.

Generative AI (or, more succinctly, gen-AI) is the practice of using machine learning algorithms to produce novel content \u2014 whether that\u2019s text, images, audio, or video \u2014 based on a training corpus of labeled example databases. It\u2019s your standard unsupervised reinforcement learning regimen, the likes of which have trained <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-19-google-alphago-zero-ai.html\">Google\u2019s AlphaGo</a>, song and video recommendation engines across the internet, as well as vehicle driver assist systems. Of course while models like Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion or Google\u2019s Imagen <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/how-ai-creates-photorealistic-images-from-text/\">are trained to convert progressively higher resolution patterns of random dots into images</a>, ATGs like ChatGPT remix text passages plucked from their training data to output suspiciously realistic, albeit frequently pedestrian, prose.</p><p>\u201cThey're trained on a very large amount of input,\u201d Dr. Peter Krapp, Professor of Film &amp; Media Studies at the University of California, Irvine, told Engadget. \u201cWhat results is more or less\u2026 an average of that input. It's never going to impress us with being exceptional or particularly apt or beautiful or skilled.

They\u2019re using it in a host of applications, from improving search engine results and proposing computer code to writing marketing and advertising content.</p><figure><img alt=\"A text-based conversation with the Eliza program talking about depression\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/17f0eb20-a3e0-11ed-b1be-d3e871b8d558\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Wikipedia / Public Domain</div></figure><h2>The secret to ChatGPT\u2019s success</h2><p>Efforts to get machines to communicate with us as we do with other people, as Dr. Krapp notes, began in the 1960s and \u201870s with linguists being among the earliest adopters. \u201cThey realized that certain conversations can be modeled in such a way that they're more or less self-contained,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I can have a conversation with, you know, a stereotypical average therapist, that means I can also program the computer to serve as the therapist.\u201d Which is how <a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/18/12/linux-toy-eliza\">Eliza became an NLP easter egg hidden in Emacs</a>, the popular Linux text editor.</p><p>Today, we use the technological descendents of those early efforts to translate the menus at fancy restaurants for us, serve as digital assistants on our phones, and chat with us as customer service reps. The problem, however, is that to get an AI to perform any of these functions, it has to be specially trained to do that one specific thing. We\u2019re still years away from functional general AIs but part of ChatGPT\u2019s impressive capability stems from its ability to write middling poetry as easily as it can generate a fake set of Terms of Service for the Truth Social website in the voice of Donald Trump without the need for specialized training between the two.</p><p>This prosaic flexibility is possible because, at its core, ChatGPT is a chatbot. It\u2019s designed first and foremost to accurately mimic a human conversationalist, which <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/08/1009845/a-gpt-3-bot-posted-comments-on-reddit-for-a-week-and-no-one-noticed/\">it actually did on Reddit for a week in 2020</a> before being outed. It was trained using supervised learning methods wherein the human trainers initially fed the model both sides of a given conversation \u2014 both what the human user and AI agent were supposed to say. With the basics in it robomind, ChatGPT was then allowed to converse with humans with its responses being ranked after each session. Subjectively better responses scored higher in the model\u2019s internal rewards system and were subsequently optimized for. This has resulted in an AI with a silver tongue but a \u201c<a href=\"https://mikewise.ca/2023/01/30/i-asked-chatgpt-to-write-an-obituary-for-hazel-mccallion-it-did-not-go-well/\">just sorta skimmed the Wiki before chiming in</a>\u201d aptitude of fact checking.</p><p>Part of ChatGPT\u2019s boisterous success \u2014 having garnered a record <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\">100 million monthly active users</a> just two months after its launch \u2014 can certainly be marked up to solid marketing strategies such as the \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d neg of 2020, Natasha Allen, a partner at Foley &amp; Lardner LLP, told Engadget. \u201cI think the other part is just how easy it is to use it. You know, the average person can just plug in some words and there you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who previously hadn\u2019t been interested in AI, didn't really care what it was,\u201d are now beginning to take notice. Its ease of use is an asset, Allen argues, making ChatGPT \u201csomething that's enticing and interesting to people who may not be into AI technologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's a very powerful tool,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI don't think it's perfect. I think that obviously there are some errors but\u2026  it'll get you 70 to 80 percent of the way.\u201d</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"LONDON, ENGLAND - FEBRUARY 03: In this photo illustration, the OpenAI \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/8bb96be0-a3e0-11ed-aeae-9e63f3f1e57a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Leon Neal via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>Will Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT be Microsoft\u2019s Taye for a new generation?</h2><p>But a lot can go wrong in those last 20 to 30 percent, because ChatGPT doesn\u2019t actually know what the words it\u2019s remixing into new sentences mean, it just understands the statistical relationships between them. \u201cThe GPT-3 hype is way too much,\u201d Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive, warned <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?lang=en\">in a July, 2020 tweet</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Those \u201csilly\u201d mistakes range from making nonsensical comparisons like \u201cA pencil is heavier than a toaster\u201d to the racist bigotry we\u2019ve seen with past chatbots like Taye \u2014 well, really, all of them to date if we\u2019re being honest.

The text generator has notably <a href=\"https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/2023/would-chat-gpt3-get-a-wharton-mba-new-white-paper-by-christian-terwiesch/\">passed the written portion</a> of Wharton Business School\u2019s entrance exam, along with <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.22283643v2.full\">all three parts of the US Medical Licensing exam</a>. The response has been swift (as most panicked scramblings in response to new technologies tend to be) but widely varied. The New York City public school system took the traditional approach, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/01/05/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt/\">ineffectually \u201cbanning\u201d the app\u2019s use by students</a>, while educators like Dr. Ethan Mollick, associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's prestigious Wharton School, have embraced it in their lesson plans.</p><p>\"This was a sudden change, right? There is a lot of good stuff that we are going to have to do differently, but I think we could solve the problems of how we teach people to write in a world with ChatGPT,\" Mollick told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/26/1151499213/chatgpt-ai-education-cheating-classroom-wharton-school\"><em>NPR</em></a> in January.</p><p>\"The truth is, I probably couldn't have stopped them even if I didn't require it,\" he added. Instead, Mollick has his students use ChatGPT as a prompt and idea generator for their essay assignments.</p><p>UCI\u2019s Dr. Krapp has taken a similar approach. \u201cI'm currently teaching a couple of classes where it was easy for me to say, \u2018okay, here's our writing assignment, let's see what ChadGPT comes up with,\u2019\u2019 he explained. \u201cI did the five different ways with different prompts or partial prompts, and then had the students work on, \u2018how do we recognize that this is not written by a human and what could we learn from this?\u2019.\u201d</p><h2>Is ChatGPT coming for your writing job?</h2><p>At the start of the year, tech news site <em>CNET</em> was outed for having used an ATG of its own design to generate entire feature-length financial explainer articles \u2014 75 in all since November 2022. The posts were supposedly \u201crigorously\u201d fact checked by human editors to ensure their output was accurate, though cursory examinations uncovered rampant factual errors requiring <em>CNET</em> and its parent company, Red Ventures, to issue corrections and updates for more than half of the articles.</p><p><em>BuzzFeed\u2019s</em> chief, Jonah Peretti, upon seeing the disastrous fallout <em>CNET</em> was experiencing from this computer generated dalliance, immediately decided to stick his tongue in the outlet too, announcing that his publication plans to employ gen-AI to create low-stakes content like personality quizzes.</p><p>This news came mere weeks after <em>BuzzFeed</em> laid off a sizable portion of its editorial staff on account of \u201cchallenging market conditions.\u201d The coincidence is hard to ignore, especially given the waves of layoffs currently rocking the tech and media sectors for that specific reason, even as the conglomerates themselves bathe in record revenue and earnings.</p><p>This is not the first time that new technology has displaced existing workers. <em>NYT</em> columnist Paul Krugman points to coal mining as an example. The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wNi9vcGluaW9uL2NoYXRncHQtYWktc2tpbGxlZC1qb2JzLWF1dG9tYXRpb24uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTJkMTAzNDItNjcwZS00ZGFiLWI0YTYtMGE3N2MxNDBkZWFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARwWiXHR32Qq_UB9M_RzNUmdUurLZnwALkluMeNjLIK7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F12%2F06%2Fopinion%2Fchatgpt-ai-skilled-jobs-automation.html\">industry saw massive workforce reductions</a> throughout the 20th century, not because our use of coal decreased, but because mining technologies advanced enough that fewer humans were needed to do the same amount of work. The same effect is seen in the automotive industry with robots replacing people on assembly lines.</p><p>\u201cIt is difficult to predict exactly how AI will impact the demand for knowledge workers, as it will likely vary, depending on the industry and specific job tasks,\u201d Krugman opined. \u201cHowever, it is possible that in some cases, AI and automation may be able to perform certain knowledge-based tasks more efficiently than humans, potentially reducing the need for some knowledge workers.\u201d</p><p>However, Dr. Krapp is not worried. \u201cI see that some journalists have said, \u2018I'm worried. My job has already been impacted by digital media and digital distribution. Now the type of writing that I do well, could be done by computer for cheap much more quickly,\u2019 he said. \u201cI don't see that happening. I don't think that's the case. I think we still as humans, have a need \u2014 a desire \u2014 for recognizing in others what's human about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201c[ChatGPT is] impressive. It's fun to play with, [but] we're still here,\u201d he added, \u201cWe're still reading, it's still meant to be a human size interface for human consumption, for human enjoyment.\u201d</p><h2>Fear not for someone is sure to save us, probably</h2><p>ChatGPT\u2019s shared-reality shredding fangs will eventually be capped, Nonnecke is confident, whether by congress or the industry itself in response to public pressure. \u201cI actually think that there's bipartisan support for this, which is interesting in the AI space,\u201d she told Engadget. \u201cAnd in data privacy, data protection, we tend to have bipartisan support.\u201d</p><p>She points to efforts in 2022 spearheaded by OpenAI Safety and Alignment researcher Scott Aaronson to develop a cryptographic watermark so that the end user could easily spot computer generated material, as one example of the industry\u2019s attempts to self-regulate.</p><p>\u201cBasically, whenever GPT generates some long text, we want there to be an otherwise unnoticeable secret signal in its choices of words, which you can use to prove later that, yes, this came from GPT,\u201d <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6823\">Aaronson wrote on his blog</a>. \u201cWe want it to be much harder to take a GPT output and pass it off as if it came from a human. This could be helpful for preventing academic plagiarism, obviously, but also, for example, mass generation of propaganda.\u201d</p><p>The efficacy of such a safeguard remains to be seen. \u201cIt's very much whack-a-mole, right now,\u201d Nonnecke exclaimed. \u201cIt's the company themselves making that [moderation] decision. There's no transparency in how they're deciding what types of prompts to block or not block, which is very concerning to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody's going to use this to do terrible things,\u201d she said.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-ev-tax-credit-2023-174121949.html?src=rss", "title": "Tesla's five-seat Model Y and other EVs now qualify for the new $7,500 federal tax credit", "date_published": "2023-02-03 17:41:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Don't worry if the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/teslas-long-range-model-y-may-not-qualify-for-the-ev-tax-credit-101229812.html\">lack of a federal tax credit</a> put you off from buying certain Tesla Model Y variants or other EVs \u2014 they might now qualify.

When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room \u2014 which requires the iOS app \u2014 the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn\u2019t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it\u2019s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable. It\u2019s also compatible with a slew of streaming services, including major ones like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>The main benefit that a Sonos speaker brings over the competition is that it\u2019s a gateway to a multi-room audio setup that you can build out over time.

We like that it's compact enough to fit most places in your home.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s compact enough to fit in most areas in your home, but more importantly, it delivers excellent audio quality that\u2019s superior to a lot of other smart speakers out there. When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room \u2014 which requires the iOS app \u2014 the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn\u2019t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it\u2019s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable. It\u2019s also compatible with a slew of streaming services, including major ones like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>The main benefit that a Sonos speaker brings over the competition is that it\u2019s a gateway to a multi-room audio setup that you can build out over time.

The larger-capacity <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLWlQYWQtMTAtOS1pbmNoLVdpLUZpL2RwL0IwOVYzSkRXU0w_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tamUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViNTg2MGIxLTUzMmUtNDJjMi1iZGVhLWNmZTUxMTAzNzdiNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbQCahxPkJC4_UyZTr-6_yL7FKsl75waWj3uhgGtV8rU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB09V3JDWSL\">256GB model</a> is also $99 off, bringing it down to $650. The M1 chip is fast enough for content creation, gaming and running other demanding apps. And you'll get an impressive 10 hours of battery life. The build is top-notch and overall, we think it's the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\">best iPad for most people</a>. Especially when it's nearly $100 cheaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Pixel Buds Pro</h2><p></p><p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">estimation</a>, Google's Pixel Buds Pro are the best earbuds for anyone who carries an Android device in their pocket. Right now at Wellbots, you can save a healthy $55 off the usual $200 price tag when you use the code <strong>ENGTSOUND</strong> at checkout. We called them Google's best earbuds yet, praising their ability to deliver deep and punchy base notes along with active noise cancellation that effectively blocks out world around you. On-board tap controls let you easily adjust volume, control your playlist and toggle the ANC and you can easily recharge the buds and case wirelessly. One of our complaints was the price bump over the previous models, but hopefully this discount makes that less of an issue.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kindle Paperwhite</h2><p></p><p>Amazon just added two new colors to the backs of their Kindle Paperwhites and are offering a 27 percent discount to go with the new look. That brings the $150 e-reader down to $109, which doesn't beat the Black Friday sale price of $99, but is the best price the device has seen since then. The discount only applies to the 16GB capacity model in the new colors, green or blue. The 8GB capacity model isn't available in the new colors and the black version is still full price.&nbsp;</p><p>The new colors \u2014 and discount \u2014 apply to the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk1SjNUS1NQLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWplLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YjU4NjBiMS01MzJlLTQyYzItYmRlYS1jZmU1MTEwMzc3YjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYjczdyIG5tdS1mCaW1w_DHyFFOvcQkyWgkXufcVw6xU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB095J3TKSP%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> as well. We called it the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html\">best e-reader period</a>&quot; in our review and this is one of the few times outside of the holidays that the device has gone on sale. Both the blue and green versions are on sale for $140, which is a 26 percent discount off the usual $190 price tag.&nbsp;</p><h2>Disney+</h2><p></p><p>To make it easier for us to afford the growing list of streaming services out there, many providers are offering ad-supported versions of their services at reduced prices. Right now, the Disney Plus ad-supported variant is down to $6.99 a month for your first three months. It goes back up to $7.99 after that, but you're free to cancel at any time. You may remember a time when Disney plus <em>without</em> ads was only $7, but just like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-increase-ad-free-170242563.html\">many</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-price-us-increase-canada-203548569.html\">other</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-tv-plus-one-price-increase-173909045.html\">streaming</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sling-tv-is-getting-another-price-hike-051610504.html\">services</a> out there, they've raised prices recently.

Then the trivia show app was beset by one problem after another until it fell off the radar, lost its audience and shut down. CNN <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cnn-hq-trivia-documentary-162822490.html\">announced</a> last year that it ordered a documentary that'll tell the game show's story, with the promise of launching it in 2023. Now CNN Films, the news channel's motion picture division, has released a trailer for the documentary entitled <em>Glitch: The Rise &amp; Fall of HQ Trivia, </em>which is scheduled to premiere on CNN on March 5th at 9PM ET/PT.</p><p>During the height of its popularity, HQ Trivia ran two games a day, and users could win part of the prize pot by answering several questions correctly in a row. It was hosted by Scott Rogowsky, though celebrities like The Rock and Kelly Clarkson would sometimes serve as guest hosts. In 2018, however, its controversial co-founder <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-16-hq-trivia-and-vine-co-founder-colin-kroll-dies.html\">Colin Kroll passed away</a>, and then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/hq-trivia-new-host/\">Rogowsky left</a> reportedly after having a disagreement with management over another hosting job he took.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>According to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/14/trivia-game-of-thrones/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, more than half of HQ Trivia's staff also signed a petition to remove CEO Rus Yusupov, accusing him of mismanaging the startup. Yusupov then reportedly fired some of the people who led the petition before the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-hq-trivia-shuts-down.html\">shut dow</a>n following a failed acquisition in 2020. The trivia app quickly came back thanks to a new investor, but it only ran games once a week with a prize pot of $1,500.

Based on what Salima Koroma, the docu's director said, we're in for an entertaining ride: &quot;HQ Trivia was supposed to \u2018revolutionize television\u2019. But what happens when the people who are running it\u2014'the smartest guys in the room\u2019\u2014 don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re doing? The CEOs who make the Vines and the WeWorks and the Twitters are hailed as the rockstars of our age. But a lot of them are simply emperors with no clothes on. It\u2019s kind of absurd. And I wanted that absurdity to be felt all throughout the film.&quot;</p><p>Pay TV subscribers can stream the documentary when it premieres through CNN's website, its mobile apps and CNNgo.

Apple TV lets you stream Apple's shows, some third-party services and titles you've purchased or rented. Apple Music, meanwhile, offers access to both the all-you-can listen subscription and your personal music library. AirPlay allows casting from iPads, iPhones and Macs, while HomeKit gives you control of your TV through Siri or Apple's Home app.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The features aren't universally available.

Nor did management review whether there were any material issues that would have warranted public disclosure, the SEC found.</p><p>In addition, the SEC determined that the company violated a whistleblower protection rule as a result of separation agreements it carried out between 2016 and 2021. Activision Blizzard allegedly required former workers to provide it with notice if the SEC contacted them for information. &quot;Taking action to impede former employees from communicating directly with the Commission staff about a possible securities law violation is not only bad corporate governance, it is illegal,\u201d Burt, one of the supervisors of the investigation, said.</p><p>&quot;We are pleased to have amicably resolved this matter. As the order recognizes, we have enhanced our disclosure processes with regard to workplace reporting and updated our separation contract language,&quot; an Activision Blizzard spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. &quot;We did so as part of our continuing commitment to operational excellence and transparency. Activision Blizzard is confident in its workplace disclosures.\u201d</p><p>The agency started investigating Activision Blizzard over these issues by September 2021, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sec-activision-blizzard-investigation-212143469.html\">according to reports at the time</a>.

It says that the company changed its processes for handling complaints between 2020 and last year to make sure that it documented the complaints more thoroughly and better communicated them to its senior management and legal team. Last June, Activision Blizzard <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-report-sexual-gender-harassment-discrimination-194909090.html\"><ins>agreed to release an annual report</ins></a> that discloses how the company handles sexual harassment and gender discrimination complaints, and what it's doing to prevent such incidents.</p><p>In January 2022, Microsoft said it planned to buy Activision Blizzard <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html\"><ins>for $68.7 billion</ins></a>.

We've only seen them cheaper during a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-fall-to-new-low-of-145-for-today-only-085343121.html\">limited-time sale at Woot</a> in which they were $145, so if you missed that, now's a good time to pick up a pair for nearly the same cost.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html\">Fit Pros</a> were cut from a similar cloth as the Beats Studio Buds, but they include an wing tip for a more secure fit. They are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, and the wing tip keeps them even more stable than other buds during fast-paced workouts. Beats didn't skip on other hardware features either: the Fit Pros have solid onboard controls, an IPX4 rating and a wear-detection sensor that will pause audio when you remove a bud.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Sound quality is pretty good here, and users will appreciate the Fit Pro's punchy bass when they need a little extra motivation during a tough workout. They also have good active noise cancellation that blocks out most surrounding noises. But the kicker for many might be their integration with Apple devices, which make them a good alternative to AirPods. The Beats Fit Pro quickly pair and switch between Apple gadgets, plus they support hands-free Siri and Find My capabilities, the latter of which will help you locate your buds if you misplace them. Android users will get some of these perks as well since the Fit Pros have a dedicated Android app that gives them fast-pairing features and customizable controls.</p><p>But if you prefer a more subtle design sans wing tip, you should consider the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk2U1Y4U0pHL3JlZj1mc19hX2J0Ml91czI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tamMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZlNmVlNzg1LTk4Y2EtNDJmMi1iYWQ5LWViNTQzY2E4ZGYxMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARVCJ89BWxoTGY3xwVIOfRTq9DNHHhIaVFKrEqxuLOIa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB096SV8SJG%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us2\">Beats Studio Buds</a>, which are also on sale at the moment. Normally $150, these buds are down to $100 right now, which is nearly a record low. They do not have things like wireless charging, sound customizations or onboard volume controls, but they will give you all of the same Apple integrations along with a comfortable, IPX4-rated design, good sound quality and solid ANC.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2023-s23-ultra-apple-homepod-review-133021333.html?src=rss", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Unpacking Samsung's Galaxy announcements and our HomePod review", "date_published": "2023-02-03 13:30:21+00:00", "description": "<p>This week, Cherlynn is joined by guest co-host Sam Rutherford to break down everything Samsung announced at its Unpacked event this week.

FB and IG stand for Facebook and Instagram, which could mean that Meta is thinking of verifying users for a fee across platforms. IDV, as <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, is a known acronym for &quot;identity verification.&quot; Paluzzi has unearthed numerous unreleased features in the past, including a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bereal-candid-challenges-232117658.html\">BeReal-like feature</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-in-app-scheduler-055239620.html\">in-app scheduler</a> on Instagram.</p><p>In addition, the developer also reportedly discovered code referencing a new type of subscription, though it's unclear if it's directly connected to paid verification. Twitter Blue, as you know, is a subscription service that costs $8 to $11 a month and gives users access to the website's verified checkmark, along with some experimental features. Offering paid verification was one of the earliest moves Elon Musk made upon taking over Twitter, and it did make Blue look more appealing to prospective subscribers. Its launch was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html\">pretty disastrous</a>, however, as the company didn't implement safeguards to prevent random users from impersonating companies and high-profile personalities.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If Meta truly is developing paid verification, it has to find a way not to repeat Twitter's mistake. Especially since Instagram users might scramble to get their profiles verified, considering how hard it currently is to get a blue badge on the app. There's even a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/instagram-spotify-verified-fake-musicians\">black market for Instagram verification</a>, with people paying up to tens of thousands of dollars to get a blue tick next to their name. <em>TechCrunch</em> says Meta chose not to comment on Paluzzi's discovery, though, so whether it truly is working on paid verification is still up in the air.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/senator-michael-bennet-tiktok-apple-google-ban-005604950.html?src=rss", "title": "Senator asks Apple and Google to ban TikTok from their app stores", "date_published": "2023-02-03 00:56:04+00:00", "description": "<p>TikTok is facing yet another call from a prominent lawmaker for the app\u2019s ban, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent <a href=\"https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=F0E5599B-C7E4-47DC-8C9D-7AD46BC3EF93\"><ins>a letter</ins></a> to Apple and Google urging the companies to ban TikTok from their respective app stores.</p><p>In the letter, Bennet says that \u201cTikTok, in its current form, [is] an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United States.\u201d The letter, addressed to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, repeats many of the same points that have been raised by other lawmakers seeking to ban the app.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Specifically, Bennet raises the possibility that TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, could be compelled to \u201cuse its influence to advance Chinese government interests,\u201d via TikTok. \u201cLike most social media platforms, TikTok collects vast and sophisticated data from its users, including faceprints and voiceprints,\u201d Bennet writes. \u201cUnlike most social media platforms, TikTok poses a unique concern because Chinese law obligates ByteDance, its Beijing-based parent company, to \u2018support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work.\u2019\u201d</p><p>TikTok has long denied that such scenarios could play out, and has attempted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-homeland-security-hearing-tiktok-twitter-youtube-meta-003024670.html\"><ins>to downplay</ins></a> its ties to China.
