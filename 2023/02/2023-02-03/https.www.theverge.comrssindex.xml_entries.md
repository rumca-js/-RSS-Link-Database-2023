  <p id="ag5SmX">Nvidia says there’s a fix for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579759/discord-nvidia-graphics-cards-memory-slowdown">recently discovered issue</a> where Discord being open in the background limited the performance of some graphics cards. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/nvidiacc/status/1621625204404371456">a tweet from the company</a>, the patch will download automatically when you log into Windows, so you won’t have to go through the trouble of manually downloading a graphics driver or other software update.</p>
<p id="vX9lDm">The issue, which affected systems with cards like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3060 Ti, was seemingly caused by a recent Discord update. It kept GPUs from reaching their maximum memory clocks, missing by around 200Mhz. That came with a slight performance penalty when playing games, which isn’t exactly ideal given that Discord is made to help you talk to friends while gaming.</p>

  <p id="xqnc2W">Over the course of this week, the developers of several major live service titles announced that their games would be shutting down. That means that players who actively enjoyed those games — and possibly spent money on them — might have to move on to something else. </p>
<p id="bQpQn2">The shutdowns are a reminder of the challenges facing these ambitious online titles. If they don’t quickly become massive hits, they might be closed down before they really have time to find their footing. Any new entrants have to fight an uphill battle to compete against juggernauts like <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone, </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
<p id="Zq8hz4">That means, for many of these newer games, they’re stuck in a chicken-and-egg situation: they need players to become a hit, but players may...</p>

  <p id="dgooSO">Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621544497388875777?s=20">says</a> that Twitter will start sharing revenue from reply-thread ads with creators who are subscribed to Twitter Blue Verified. (<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621546844882079744">According to Musk</a>, “legacy” verified marks will be going away in “a few months.”) He says the program will start today, though there are currently very few details about how it will work. </p>
<p id="pmEgex">Currently, subscribing to Blue will cost you $8 per month if acquired directly via its site or $11 per month from Apple’s App Store or Google Play, but the cheapest version is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23559959/twitter-blue-annual-subscription-discount-offer">an annual subscription directly from Twitter for $84</a>. It’s unclear how many viral tweets it would take to pay that off, but it could be difficult given Twitter’s rocky relationship with advertisers right now. </p>

  <p id="kIpbOl">The US Treasury Department says it is modifying the electric vehicle tax credit to potentially allow more vehicles to qualify — for now. </p>
<p id="jT2Kxe">In a press release, the department said that to determine whether a vehicle is a sedan, SUV, pickup truck, or van, it would use the Environmental Protection Agency’s Fuel Economy Labeling standard rather than the EPA’s corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standard.</p>
<p id="XLTyq7">In plain language, this could clear up some of the confusion around which vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, which was written into law last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). </p>

But combining two of them in a stereo pair really takes the listening experience to a different level. It’s not a cheap proposition, but you’ll end up with even more immersive room-filling sound — and if you use two HomePods as speakers for an Apple TV, they’ll outperform many sound bars that are in a similar $600 price range.</p>
<p id="sV0Gsl">It’s important to note that you need two of the exact same model (first-gen HomePod, HomePod Mini, or second-gen HomePod) for a stereo pair; you can’t mix the old and new HomePods together, for example.</p>

  <p id="nfoE7A">It’s far too easy to overlook a key component of a great Super Bowl watch party experience: quality audio. Although we’ve already covered some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23569293/best-tv-deals-super-bowl">best TV deals</a> taking place ahead of the big game, it’s also advisable to not assemble a room full of football fans when all you have for sound is the tinny built-in speakers on your TV. Thankfully, Sonos is running a sale until February 12th on a few of its speakers and soundbars, which can help you level up your system when it comes to watching sports and listening to music. </p>

  <p id="rRqrmF">Apple’s legendary Lisa computer was a flop by commercial standards, but its influence on computing can’t be understated. In the 40 years after its debut, ideas from the Lisa <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23570610/apple-lisa-computer-legacy">changed our relationship with computers</a> – influencing their design to be more human-centered. If you’re reading this on a computer screen, your experience has probably been shaped in some way from the lessons forged by the Lisa.</p>
<p id="KpaODF">Today, in partnership with The Computer History Museum, we’re excited to share another part of what makes the Lisa feel, well, <em>human</em>: a selection of exclusive Polaroid photos from the Lisa’s development taken by Bill Atkinson, the designer and developer of the computer’s graphical user interface. Atkinson sat down with CHM for an interview...</p>

  <p id="KtNUUl">A key feature from Meta’s $1,499.99 Quest Pro headset will make an appearance — in some form — in a more affordable consumer-focused headset coming later this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/META-Q4-2022-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">company’s latest earnings release</a>.

The X90 Pro is notable for being the latest to use Sony’s 1-inch-type 50-megapixel IMX989 camera sensor, and Vivo is keen to emphasize the low-light photography capabilities such a large (for a smartphone) sensor allows for. It’s joined by the non-Pro X90, which is getting a more limited release outside China. </p>
<p id="vTJQvB">Vivo is being annoyingly vague about exactly <em>when</em> the phones will actually be available to buy outside China, however. For now, it’s only saying that they’ll be releasing gradually across markets, starting with Malaysia, where the X90 Pro will cost 4,999 MYR (around $1,174 / €1,073) and the X90 will cost MYR 3,699 (around $869 /...</p>

  <p id="VTfFep">YouTube is rolling out a collaboration feature that allows two users to livestream together. “<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12112663">Go Live Together</a>” was first introduced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIUhkVPWD1Y">in November last year,</a> but as per <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1621217017817698307">a recent tweet from YouTube</a> (and our own tests), seems to now be available more broadly across iOS and Android mobile devices. </p>
<p id="23IuLe">The feature enables creators with 50 or more subscribers to invite a guest to livestream with them.
