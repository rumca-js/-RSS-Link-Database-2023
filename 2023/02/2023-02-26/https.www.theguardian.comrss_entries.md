<p>Prop was traumatised by 2019 Cardiff defeat but says Saturday’s success was significant ‘not only in my career but my life’</p><p>Two contrasting post-Cardiff verdicts are still vying with each other. One is that Wales, who have lost 12 of their past 15 internationals, displayed almost no cutting edge and even less tactical acumen. The second is that England defended so capably and did such an effective job of suffocating Welsh momentum that, enticing for neutrals or not, this was among their more valuable results since they reached the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report" title="">2019 Rugby World Cup final</a>.</p><p>Both conclusions felt valid on Saturday night, especially when you listened to one of the visitors’ try-scorers, Kyle Sinckler, speaking from the heart after England’s biggest win in Cardiff since 2003. Sinckler, who now has 59 caps for his country, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-six-nations-match-report" title="">endured a traumatic time at the same venue</a> in 2019 when his loss of discipline helped Wales to a significant 21-13 victory and few redemption stories have involved more honesty or self-awareness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/26/rugby-union-six-nations-england-wales-kyle-sinckler">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Some of Eddie Howe’s team are not likely to stay for much longer but Saudi fortune should see them continue to improve</p><p>Trafalgar Square, Saturday evening. White smoke against a red sunset, the hot breath of a thousand singing voices wafting into the cold London air like pissed little doves. Wembley is still a day, a three-zone Oyster card journey and several cans away. But in a way, the 2023 League Cup final has already been under way for several hours.</p><p>They’ve braved the trains, the traffic and London prices. Whole towns have emptied for the weekend. Sam Fender and his band have come along for the party, and pump out a raucous version of Local Hero. Everyone wants a piece of this. And of course the game still means everything. But somehow there is also a larger undertaking here, the idea that what matters above all is their <em>presence</em>: a reclamation of turf, an assertion of self. We can win or we can lose. But either way, you will notice us again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/26/newcastle-not-yet-an-evil-empire-side-but-cup-final-feels-like-a-springboard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former supreme court justice <strong>Jonathan Sumption</strong> on last week’s ruling on the home secretary’s decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship. Plus letters from<strong> Ilina Todorovska, Owen Stewart, Andrew Snowdon </strong>and <strong>Carmel Bedford</strong></p><p>Prof Conor Gearty complains about the special immigration appeals commission’s “deference” to the government in its judgment on Shamima Begum (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/23/shamima-begum-courts-government-human-rights-national-security" title="">Shamima Begum has shown up courts’ deference to this government. It’s a worrying new era, 23 February</a>). Decisions on deprivation of citizenship are required by statute to be made by the home secretary. The commission’s job was therefore to decide whether the home secretary’s decision was properly made, not whether it agreed with it. That is what it did. In a democracy governed by the rule of law, Prof Gearty should not have been surprised.</p><p>Meanwhile, his analysis distracts attention from the real scandal. By statute, the home secretary cannot deprive a person of British citizenship if it would render them stateless. The person must have citizenship of at least one other country. When the decision was made, in 2019, Ms Begum was 19. She was a citizen of Bangladesh, but only in the most technical sense. She had provisional citizenship until she was 21, when it would lapse unless she took it up. This was because her parents were born there. But she has never been to Bangladesh. She has no links with the country. And Bangladesh has disowned her. Her Bangladeshi citizenship always was a legal fiction. Today, it is not even that. She is 23. As a result of the home secretary’s decision, she is stuck in a camp in Syria, with no citizenship anywhere and no prospect of one. Children who make a terrible mistake are surely redeemable. But statelessness is for ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/26/the-real-scandal-of-the-shamima-begum-citizenship-case">Continue reading...</a>

The spindle is then rotated to add twist to the drafted fibres, and the spun fibre is wound around the shaft. The base of the artefact is wider than the tapering shaft; that would help stop the fibre slipping off.

This final, Newcastle’s first since the FA Cup of 1999 when they took on the same opponents, was all about who could chart fresh territory, who could own the occasion. As in 1999, it was the Reds – and by the same scoreline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/26/manchester-united-newcastle-united-carabao-cup-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The debt cancellation, worth more than a fifth of national GDP, was driven by the United States, the UK and France.

Meanwhile, the cost of servicing the country’s external debt was <a href="https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article3549" title="">capped</a> at 5% of export revenues.

Creditors in the 1950s were expected to take a haircut if the German economy faltered. The country was allowed to industrialise by replacing imports with home-manufactured goods, while creditor nations agreed to reduce their own exports. Unlike the current International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/no-imf-thousands-protest-argentina-against-debt-deal-2022-02-09/" title="">bailouts</a>, West Germany’s state was allowed to get bigger.

<p>It was appropriate that the two pieces of genuine quality in an instantly forgettable final were sufficient to win the League Cup for Celtic. Rangers had a pulse after Alfredo Morelos reduced a deficit which had sat at 2-0 but Kyogo Furuhashi’s earlier interventions proved key. Ange Postecoglou’s team have successfully defended their trophy and punctured the sense of optimism apparent at Ibrox since Michael Beale’s arrival. The more cohesive football here was played by those in hoops.</p><p>Furuhashi rounded off a sweeping move also involving Reo Hatate, Aaron Mooy and Greg Taylor to afford Celtic an interval lead they just about deserved.

<p>(4AD)<br />Meg Remy’s life-changing experiences colour a scattershot album that works best the closer it sticks to straightforward pop<br /></p><p>The making of Meg Remy’s eighth album as <a href="https://4ad.com/artists/109">US Girls</a> was set against the backdrop of pregnancy and the birth of twin boys, so it’s perhaps inevitable that <em>Bless This Mess</em> is informed by such life-changing experiences. Indeed, Pump even begins with a sample of her breast pump, before Remy makes reference to caesareans and breastfeeding, and asks herself: “So what are we talking about? Bodies, birth, death, machines.” Elsewhere, Screen Face dissects relationships that exist purely on phones, and how poorly they compare with real-life touch and scents (“No way this is a date/ My screen is not your face”). The opulent disco stylings of Tux (Your Body Fills Me, Boo), meanwhile, soundtrack the despairing musings of a rarely worn tuxedo, “lonely, suffocating in this plastic bag”.</p><p>Stylistically, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/25/st-vincent-review-annie-get-your-scream-on-daddys-home">St Vincent</a>-adjacent <em>Bless This Mess</em> is a little scattershot, with Remy most sure-footed on the straightforward pop of St. James Way. Her more experimental material can be heavier going: the sparkling funk of Pump’s first half gives way to an interminable coda that’s far more annoying than clever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/26/us-girls-bless-this-mess-review-bodies-birth-and-dating-pains">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former PM’s high earnings have been partly attributed to the way he speaks. But I’ll take Bill Paterson or Maya Angelou’s sonorous tones over the voice of privilege any day</p><p>Why does Boris Johnson command stupid money for public speaking? In February he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/08/boris-johnson-advance-payment-speeches">reported a £2.5m advance</a>; that seems awfully steep for 20 minutes of “Caecilius est in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/22/boris-johnson-praises-peppa-pig-and-loses-place-in-rambling-speech">Peppa Pig World</a>”. It’s a fair, indeed pressing, question <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b9fee92-e12c-48ba-b58d-6ff2977501dc">posed by the Financial Times recently</a>. I would happily pay a significant sum – all the money I spend on takeaways in a year, say, with the attendant sacrifice that involves for a reluctant cook – never to see or hear him again.</p><p>The journalist Janan Ganesh concluded that it’s partly Johnson’s voice: “Beautiful … deep and textured, raspy without crossing into sibilance”. I forced myself to listen to a little of it, and, OK, it’s deeper than I remembered, but he sounds slightly congested to me, like he needs to lay off the Daylesford cheese. I understand the point, however. It’s a voice redolent both of a more lighthearted, Wodehousian time and, if you’re truly deluded, the Churchillian doggedness to which he aspires.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p><p>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>In their own different ways, the two leaders dream of a return to ‘normality’ – but that’s what got us into this mess </p><p>Eight long years ago, British politics began its passage into a new era of disruption and upheaval. The Scottish independence referendum of 2014 had already highlighted the weaknesses of politics-as-usual, but everything turned on the 2015 general election, in which David Cameron secured the win that set Britain on the path to Brexit, and Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/snp-surge-claims-first-major-labour-scalp-with-douglas-alexanders-defeat">took 40 of Scotland’s Westminster seats from Labour</a>.

The ensuing years would see our drawn-out departure from Europe, Labour’s revival at the election of 2017 and its rout only two years later, pro- and anti-Brexit protests, an insatiable Conservative party spitting out four prime ministers, and the rising sense that the United Kingdom itself would perhaps not survive.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/union-politics-restoration-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hayward Gallery, London; Lightroom, London<br /></strong>A maze of masterful installations engulfs you in a singular and complex mind. Elsewhere, David Hockney does immersion his own way </p><p>You enter, stage right, through an unfamiliar door straight into a storeroom. Corridors of shelves bear nameless bubble-wrapped objects, old doors of all sorts are propped against the walls. Oak fitted with barred grilles and ancient locks, reinforced metal, painted panels pierced with Stars of David: why are they here? As in life, so in art: you are immediately looking for clues.</p><p>The body parts of a building, perhaps, except that the winding warren points to an entire city. Italian lettering appears on a sack. Stencilled numbers hint at the Venetian ghetto. Red darkroom lights cast a fixed glow over it all, as if you were walking through a monochrome photograph. It feels like an image of reality and yet also the reality itself. A label on a swaddled armchair seems to allude to this cognitive mystery. Back Room, it reads – both an instruction to some notional handler, but also a pun on the place in which you find yourself, here and in the artist’s milieu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/26/mike-nelson-extinction-beckons-david-hockney-bigger-and-closer-review">Continue reading...</a>

Untutored but curious, she began to photograph her immediate environment and soon realised that she had found her own, singular way of seeing the world around her.</p><p>“At first, I really didn’t know what I was doing,” she says, “but I remember shooting a picture through the leaves of the trees in front of the house and suddenly knowing somehow that this was how I should do it, this was how I should look.

The architects added a finishing touch, a subtropical tree in one corner, and, each year, as the southern hemisphere spring takes hold, this jacaranda tree erupts into bloom, its fragrant lilac flowers calling time on the academic year. Jacarandas across Sydney join in, transforming the city. For a month, the parks and pavements are blanketed with petals.

## Song from Far Away review – Will Young acts with melodic grace in poignant monologue

<p><strong>Home, Manchester</strong><br />The star performs with a musician’s sense of rhythm in this alternately arch and elegiac piece by Simon Stephens and Mark Eitzel about a bereaved brother attempting to reconnect with his former life</p><p>There is a theory that in the course of human prehistory, hunter-gatherers sung before they spoke. The idea crops up in this bitter-sweet monologue by playwright <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/simon-stephens">Simon Stephens</a> and singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/29/popandrock1">Mark Eitzel</a> as a way to explain the emotional gulf between two brothers. The bereaved Willem is materialistic where his late sibling Pauli was artistic. Where Willem plays a numbers game on the New York stock market, his musical brother was rooted with his Amsterdam family until his premature death. “We are animals born to sing,” says Willem.</p><p>And if ever there was an actor born to sing, it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/24/will-young-interview-song-far-away-cabaret-vortex-pop-idol">Will Young</a>. He plays the part of the disconnected Willem in this 80-minute miniature with melodic grace. In an expensive-looking ivory sweater and a distinguished grey crop of hair that belies his youthful smile, he glides between a pretty sing-song speaking voice and a brash Manhattan bass. At turns louche, comic and fragile, he has a musician’s sense of rhythm. When he actually sings, as he does in the cathartic pay-off, it is delicate and angelic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/26/song-from-far-away-review-will-young-home-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Its magnificent capital is justly famous but there are other lovely places to visit that are only a train ride away from Prague </p><p>The Czech Republic’s capital remains one of the most beautiful eastern European cities, with iconic sights such as the Charles Bridge, Prague Castle and elegant Wenceslas Square. The best way to explore is to walk; the city is famous for its street musicians, and many of the city’s churches hold concerts and recitals. Alongside the Old Town, the Jewish quarter is dotted with synagogues, historic buildings and traditional cafés. Pop into U Rotundy (<a href="http://urotundy.cz/" title="">urotundy.cz</a>), which serves up hearty Czech staples – pork knuckle, dumplings – and excellent local beer. Visit Letná Park at sunset for gorgeous views across the city, and in the evening take a glass-topped boat trip along the Vltava to see the city’s elegant buildings picked out in warm, golden light. No trip to Prague is complete without a visit to a cellar bar – the modern city is built on top of the old, creating a network of caves, tunnels and cellars.

<p>The rise in global antibiotic resistance means huge sums are being invested in ground-breaking treatments. But some scientists are turning back the clock in the hunt for effective alternatives</p><p>For several long months in the 1990s, Ronald Sherman travelled all over southern California catching flies. As a qualified doctor pursuing an infectious diseases fellowship, Sherman was curious about a potential new – and also very old – way to clean wounds. At medical school, he’d written a paper on the history of maggot therapy, tracing how the creepy crawlies helped heal soldiers in the Napoleonic wars, the American civil war and the First World War. Now Sherman wanted to test maggots in a modern setting. The problem? No one farmed and sold the species of flies that the doctor needed – so he went out and caught them himself.</p><p>Once the specimens were collected and “as soon as everyone stopped laughing”, Sherman got to work. After treating his first patients with maggots, he was impressed by the results, but nonetheless he struggled to get his initial research papers published. A rejection letter from one journal read: “Publishing the manuscript might be interpreted as an endorsement for a therapy that is ancient.” Yet today, Sherman says, “that same journal probably has two or three articles about maggot therapy every year!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/26/the-return-to-medieval-medicine-to-treat-ailments">Continue reading...</a>

Yoghurt is the magic ingredient, bringing harmony to a hearty soup and crisp zingy salad<p>I have started my day with yoghurt, the sharper the better, for as long as I can remember. It may be a tiny dish of pure white curds eaten with a teaspoon or, as it is now at the tail end of winter – in a deep bowl with sliced blood oranges, clusters of jewel-like pomegranate, passionfruit, chia seeds and toasted oats. More often than not, I end it that way, too, with a spoon or two before I climb the stairs to bed. In this house, a day without yoghurt is pretty much unthinkable.</p><p>In the kitchen, I prefer the thinner, unstrained version rather than those that are thick and creamy, which can sometimes lack the necessary refreshing snap of acidity. Here, yoghurt may find itself used as a salad dressing; tipped into a sieve, salted and drained to produce homemade labne; or stirred into a lentil soup or chicken casserole. A last-minute fizz of acidity to liven up a recipe or simply to introduce a little harmony and balance to a dish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/26/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-yoghurt-wheat-spinach-and-lentil-soup-and-for-beetroot-orange-and-yoghurt-salad">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Playground; @sohoplace; Donmar Warehouse, London<br /></strong>Richard Norton-Taylor and Nicolas Kent’s second Grenfell drama is a shocking dissection of negligence; Sophie Okonedo breathes fire as Medea; and Diana Nneka Atuona brings wartime Cardiff to life</p><p>The inquisitorial plays of Richard Norton-Taylor and Nicolas Kent have altered the theatrical landscape – and changed minds. Most overtly political drama deals in opinions. Kent and Norton-Taylor deliver facts. Staging actual trials and tribunals, using words from transcripts, this least theatrical of theatre-making can discomfort in multiple ways: performances are so transparent it can be hard to know if an actor is struggling for breath or stumbling over forgotten words.</p><p><strong>Grenfell: System Failure</strong> is the second reenactment of evidence from the public inquiry into the fire. (The first, <em>Grenfell: Value Engineering</em>, premiered in 2021.) Staged minutes away from the tower, it is an uncompromising evening. The setting is bland, corporate: a dark screen and light wood desks. The legal team are focused, unrhetorical: Thomas Wheatley’s chairman drills calmly into witness statements; as the QCs, Ron Cook is unimpressible, undeviating, Sally Giles exacting and exasperated. Much of the two and a half hours is made up of technical evidence about cladding and insulation. The detail mounts, numbingly: the dryness makes survivors’ accounts the more lacerating. Stumbling down the stairs in black smoke, a woman saw by the light of her son’s mobile phone that she was treading not on hosepipes but on hands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/26/the-week-in-theatre-grenfell-system-failure-medea-trouble-in-butetown-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Does gene editing hold the key to improving mental health?

<p>Research suggests traumatic childhood experiences embed themselves in our brains and put us at risk of mental illness, but epigenetic editing may offer us hope of removing them</p><p>The way depression manifested itself in mice in the laboratory of the psychiatrist and neuroscientist Eric Nestler was hauntingly relatable. When put in an enclosure with an unknown mouse, they sat in the corner and showed little interest. When presented with the treat of a sugary drink, they hardly seemed to notice. And when put into water, they did not swim – they just lay there, drifting about.</p><p>These mice had been exposed to “social defeat stress”, meaning that older, bigger mice had repeatedly asserted their dominance over them. It is a protocol designed to induce depression in mice, but in Nestler’s lab, it affected some more than others: those with a history of early trauma.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/26/does-gene-editing-hold-the-key-to-improving-mental-health">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘My dad wanted to be James Bond. He nearly killed us both’: actor and writer Katy Wix

<p>Katy Wix had a difficult relationship with her dad. But after a near-fatal car accident, they found themselves growing closer</p><p>Good dads are all alike, but every shit dad is shit in his own way.</p><p>When I was little, I used to worry that my dad loved James Bond more than he loved me. When Bond films were on, he would shush me when I asked if we could watch <em>The Simpsons</em>. He was a tall man, jammed with sadness and mystery. He worked late in a job he didn’t like and slept in the day. His dream was to have been an actor or an artist, but these weren’t practical choices for a man from a small Welsh town who left school young. I would catch him crying at the news, or singing songs from musicals when he did the washing up and didn’t know we could hear him, but apart from that he was remote. Other friends’ dads had a comfortable, confident ease where they would loudly give an opinion and everyone had to fake agree. I longed for mine to have some of that, whatever it was. My dad was only really relaxed when he was holding a drink in his hand and could be left alone to watch another man drive a fast car – and wish it was him. He was frightened by anything that challenged him. He went his whole life without trying hummus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/26/my-dad-wanted-to-be-james-bond-he-nearly-killed-us-both-katy-wix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The principal ballerina on portraying Virginia Woolf, why she’s so enthusiastic about ageing, and what she learned from the greats</p><p>Born in Milan in 1963, Alessandra Ferri was a principal with the Royal Ballet at 19, and two years later was invited by Mikhail Baryshnikov to join American Ballet Theatre. After a glittering career, she retired in 2007 before returning in 2013. She is now in the rare position of being a leading dancer performing internationally at the age of nearly 60. From next week she is at the Royal Opera House in a revival of <em>Woolf Works</em>, a ballet about the life and writing of Virginia Woolf, created for her in 2015 by Wayne McGregor.</p><p><strong>Did you ever expect to still be dancing </strong><strong>10 years after you came back to the stage?</strong><br />This whole 10 years of afterlife has surprised me.

<p>The Booker-winner’s dark and brilliant tale of a gardening collective’s clash with a billionaire explodes the notion of caring capitalism</p><p>In his great critical work <em>The Sense of an Ending</em>, Frank Kermode wrote about the end-directedness of fiction, the way that novels rehearse and forestall their endings – a process he called peripeteia. One thing he doesn’t discuss in that book is what happens when an ending entirely alters your understanding of the text. There are numerous examples of tricksy plot twists – think <em>Fingersmith</em> or <em>Fight Club</em> – but I’m not sure I’ve read a novel whose ending so brilliantly and brutally changes our perception of what has gone before as <em>Birnam Wood,</em> Eleanor Catton’s follow-up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/11/eleanor-catton-luminaries-how-she-wrote-booker-prize">her Booker-winning </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/11/eleanor-catton-luminaries-how-she-wrote-booker-prize">The Luminaries</a></em>.</p><p>For nine-tenths of its 400 pages, <em>Birnam Wood</em> comes across as a Kiwi Jonathan Franzen – a smart, satirical novel about the clash between a gardening collective and a scheming tech billionaire. There are numerous Franzen tropes here – countercultural/capitalist discord; the striving for ideological purity; the relentless and vampiric march of big business; environmental crisis. There’s even a rare bird – here it’s an orange-fronted parakeet. <em>Birnam Wood</em> is like a Franzen greatest hits album until its glorious, apocalyptic final pages enlarge and complicate our understanding of its message.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/26/birnam-wood-by-eleanor-catton-review-the-root-of-all-evil-luminaries-booker-prize">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Brighton Dome and touring<br /></strong>The South African choreographer transforms The Rite of Spring using the music, rhythms and rituals of her Tswana background</p><p>The South African choreographer Dada Masilo has made her name by reimagining big old ballets like <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/23/why-giselle-still-haunts-us-enb-akram-khan-brb-dado-masilo">Giselle</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/18/swan-lake-review-dada-masilo-sadlers-wells">Swan Lake</a></em> in a way that fuses contemporary and southern African dance. But <em><a href="https://danceconsortium.com/touring/dada-masilos-the-sacrifice-2023/">The Sacrifice</a></em>, her version of <em>The Rite of Spring</em>, is something else. It jettisons Stravinsky’s music except as an inspiration, and while it preserves the structure of <em>Rite</em> – the idea of a community coming together and deciding to kill a woman for society’s greater good – Masilo refashions it into something new, with its music, rhythms and rituals rooted firmly in the Tswana dance of her own background.</p><p>The result is both deeply moving and astonishingly fresh. It opens with Masilo herself, bare-chested, fragile, moving across the stage with slow deliberation, arms flexing and stretching in delicate shapes, her back arched, hands flicking in circles, responding to the subtle beats of the music (played live by a group of exceptional musicians and singers on the side of the stage).</p><p><em><a href="https://ttps//danceconsortium.com/touring/dada-masilos-the-sacrifice-2023/">The Sacrifice</a></em><a href="https://ttps//danceconsortium.com/touring/dada-masilos-the-sacrifice-2023/"> opened at Brighton Dome and is touring</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/26/dada-masilos-the-sacrifice-review-deeply-moving-and-astonishingly-fresh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Parlophone)<br />A thoughtful eighth album blends Damon Albarn’s state-of-the-world concerns with the talents of collaborators from Stevie Nicks to Thundercat</p><p>Even though their eighth LP found this cartoon band decamping to California to work with producer Greg Kurstin, it’s hard not to speculate which benighted island the title of this record might refer to. As ever, much lore <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S03T47hapAc">plays out in the band’s videos</a> and Jamie Hewlett’s art. But it’s clear that a 2023 sense of unease powers this record, with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/06/on-my-radar-damon-albarn-cultural-highlights"> Damon Albarn</a> often in bittersweet mode, pondering how a deranged cult might take over a fragile society. Familiar, but inexhaustible, founts of anxiety abound: “Machine assisted, I disappear” Albarn croons affectingly on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Pf48RqSsg">Silent Running</a>.</p><p>This is, simultaneously, a very Albarn-forward, state-of-the-world Gorillaz record, and one packed with guests channelling different energies. More prominent west coasters figure: Afrofuturist funk bassist Thundercat, plus the indefatigable Stevie Nicks, whose guest vocal on Oil is less the “fairylike companion” of the lyrics than an excellent, bone-dry counterpoint to Albarn. Somehow, even reggaeton party-bringer Bad Bunny sounds nuanced on his song, Tormenta. Meanwhile, on the knockout New Gold, Pharcyde rapper Bootie Brown returns (alongside Tame Impala) for a delightfully old-school call-back. It all ends on a thoughtful thumbs up for the opposable-thumbed, with the pogo-friendly Skinny Ape investing hope in us scrawny simians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/26/gorillaz-cracker-island-review-bittersweet-tunes-for-anxious-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Scottish-Iranian director’s heartwarming new film, Winners, tells the tale of a child in Iran with a passion for movies. He talks about escaping to Europe and juggling four restaurant jobs to fund his early works</p><p>Hassan Nazer was in his first month at university in Iran when he realised that he would have to leave his homeland to fulfil his dream of becoming a film-maker. As a fledgling theatre director, he had been “red-flagged” – a possibly irredeemable offence – for putting women on stage in the holy city of Mashhad. His father, who ran a family confectionery business from a factory outside Tehran, had been opposed to his career choice from the start, but one of his uncles was on his side. “He said, after you get a red flag in this age, they’re not going to let you work. So basically, if you want to go into cinema or continue with theatre, this is not your place. You need to leave.”</p><p>Nazer had avoided military service, and had no passport or visa, so his uncle paid for him to be smuggled across the border into Turkey. “I didn’t have a destination at the time, I just wanted to go somewhere else,” he says. It took six gruelling months, often travelling on foot, to reach Europe, where his uncle put him in touch with a Kurdish family who had found asylum in Scotland and were willing to help, as they had been helped by his family back in Iran at an early stage of their own migration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/26/film-maker-hassan-nazer-iranian-cinema-winners-interview">Continue reading...</a>

It’s chunky and when I say chunky I mean almost impossible to break off, especially in the small bars where there’s less leverage. The moulds it’s made in are in a crazy-paving style and I struggled to get pieces off with my fingers, or my teeth, in the end going at it with a cleaver. The makers may want to look at this. Although I loved the thickness, the accessibility was not great.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/26/annalisa-barbieri-notes-on-chocolate-i-love-a-chunky-one-but-may-have-met-my-match">Continue reading...</a>

As with many contemporary debates, the controversy is freighted with confusions, and sometimes with bad faith, and requires careful unpacking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/kate-forbes-politicians-have-right-to-strong-religious-views-but-not-shielded-from-scrutiny">Continue reading...</a>

The prime minister has to press ahead with a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol, which would remove a festering sore in the UK’s relations with both the EU and the US<br /><p>The in-tray of a prime minister is never empty and often overflowing, as Rishi Sunak has discovered since he moved into Number 10. Jumbo issues are circling Downing Street like planes stacking over Heathrow. There is the pressing need to resolve the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/24/junior-doctors-england-strike-three-days-march" title="">strikes</a> that have been paralysing essential public services for months. There’s the biggest conflict in Europe since 1945 and complex decisions to make about how the west can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/british-typhoon-jets-ukraine-ben-wallace" title="">best aid the Ukrainians</a>. There’s a looming budget that will have to be very skilfully crafted if it is not to go down badly with the public, the media and his party. Yet observers in Whitehall report that, despite all the other urgent and critical matters jostling for his attention, no issue has been devouring as much of the prime minister’s time and energy as trying to land a deal that would ease the problems with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/17/northern-ireland-protocol-deal-key-political-hurdles-brexit-rishi-sunak" title="">Northern Ireland protocol</a>.</p><p>We ought to give him a bit of credit for putting in the effort to tackle one of the most baleful consequences of Brexit, one that has destabilised Northern Ireland, disrupted its trade and aggravated its population while creating festering sores in the UK’s relationships with both the EU and the US. A success would be a feather in Mr Sunak’s cap. Not a tremendously resplendent feather, because he is trying to fix a mess of his own party’s making while offering no remedies to other negative impacts of Brexit. Nor will the mooted agreement with the EU solve all the Brexit-generated headaches with the Irish border. That said, smoothing the rough edges of the protocol would give Mr Sunak something he could claim as an important achievement. It might counter the prevailing narrative that he is a rudderless prime minister who can’t get anything difficult done and runs for the hills at the first whiff of trouble from malcontents within his party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/rishi-sunak-must-not-flinch-from-a-vital-fight-with-the-tory-brextemists">Continue reading...</a>

Martin Scorsese’s latest film will join a slew of three-hour slogs. These directors, mostly male, need to rein themselves in<p>Let’s be honest about this. No film needs to be longer than three hours. And fewer than you might think can justify breaking the 2hrs 40m mark. News that Martin Scorsese’s latest film, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, is clocking in at well over three hours is only the latest in what seems to be a trend in mainstream cinema towards the butt-numbing end of the running time spectrum. If any director knows what to do with every last frame of a rumoured 3hrs 20m, it is Scorsese. But this does raise the question: are marathon movies really what the audience wants? There’s a theory that, in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/30/tiktok-mental-health-social-media" title="">age of TikTok</a>, the collective attention span is shrinking. Is expecting punters to sit through more than three hours the best way to lure post-pandemic audiences back into cinemas?</p><p>There’s a tacit assumption that a hefty running time automatically conveys event movie status or that anything over three hours is a Big, Important Artistic Statement worthy of note. In the last year, Damien Chazelle’s <em>Babylon</em> clocked in at an overwrought 3hrs 9m; <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> was 3hrs 12 damp minutes; Andrew Dominik’s polarising Marilyn Monroe biopic <em>Blonde</em> was just shy of the three-hour mark at 2hrs 47m. And the original cut of Alejandro González Iñárritu’s <em>Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths</em> hit 2hrs 54m, before Iñárritu re-edited, shaving off 20 or so minutes. But of these, only <em>Avatar</em>, with a current box-office tally just shy of $2.25bn, can legitimately lay claim to the event movie tag. The others? It’s fair to say that audiences stayed away in droves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/guys-length-isnt-everything-film-making">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the skies are full of unidentified objects, it’s no wonder that podcasts are obsessing on paranormal themes</p><p>When I first started running, last winter, it would be dark in the morning when I’d leave the house, and I took to listening to podcasts where real people would describe a supernatural event from their past. There was the woman who grew up in a very haunted house, and the boy saved from a suicide attempt by an unseen presence, and a student bedroom that its tenant said contained “pure, distilled evil”. I’d be puffing along a muddy trail as the sun clawed its way out of a hole while a sensible adult dripped another mad terror into my ears, and by the time I got home the day would have already chosen its direction.</p><p>Although, to be fair, perhaps I chose that direction myself some years ago, when, as a child, I became obsessed with the <em>Usborne Book of Ghosts &amp; Hauntings</em>. Apart from the story about the one-eyed ghost dog, Black Shuck, it didn’t give me nightmares so much as provide a lens with which to view the entire world, a place groaning with mysteries, fear and inexplicable events.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/26/supernatural-stories-seem-to-make-sense-in-these-inexplicable-times">Continue reading...</a>

Keep your skin hydrated and buy a quality blush to radiate youthfulness. Plus, a matte lipstick with a soft finish<p>Blushers help radiate youthfulness. But go overboard and it can have the opposite – and sometimes comic – effect. The key is to get your Q&amp;As right. That is Quality and Application. Quality of skin makes all the difference: if it’s hydrated, your blusher sits better. A quality blusher is also essential – it’ll make your application easier (use fingers to blend into apples of cheeks, or a brush for precision). The blushers here are light textures that are well pigmented, but not overly so. Meaning, hopefully, even the cack-handed won’t inadvertently end up putting too much on. Never a good look.</p><p><strong>1. Bobbi Brown Brightening Blush</strong> £39.50, <a href="https://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/" title="">bobbibrown.co.uk</a> <strong>2.

<p>Eddie Howe and Erik ten Hag have overseen a revival on the pitch at Newcastle and Manchester United but protest and discontent at the clubs’ owners continues</p><p>Positivity tends to be the prevailing feeling around clubs before a cup final. There is plenty of it at Newcastle and Manchester United before Sunday’s Carabao Cup showdown. Eddie Howe’s “intensity is our identity” motto has won him admirers on Tyneside and beyond, and Erik ten Hag has overseen the reawakening of Old Trafford’s sleeping giant. But their trip to Wembley will be made against a backdrop of protest and discontent, too.</p><p>Ownership is the cause of that. Since October 2021 Newcastle have been majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, making the club’s revival harder to swallow for some fans and many more outsiders. Unhappiness at the Glazer family’s stewardship of Manchester United is longstanding and now comes the possibility the club will end up in hands of a Qatari sheikh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/26/club-ownership-set-to-dominate-wembley-carabao-cup-final-narrative">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I knew it would be OK’: Jonathan Majors on his remarkable rise from troubled teen to Hollywood  A-lister

As the emotional and uniquely self-aware actor prepares for global fame, he talks to Tom Lamont about being homeless at 16 and how becoming a young father has shaped him<p>Jonathan Majors, an American actor in his early 30s, wakes up on the day of our interview lying next to his nine-year-old daughter. He has some chores to see to before we are due to talk at 9am, including the school run. One wrinkle: his daughter goes to school on the east coast of America and this morning they are on the west coast, in Los Angeles, having just attended the premiere of a Marvel movie called <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>, in which Majors stars. Before he has to shake his daughter awake to get her to the airport, he takes a few minutes to himself in the stillness of the early morning. Socks off. Feet on the carpet. “A moment of meditation, then some journalling. I used to call this my ‘monk mode’,” Majors says. He is a talented, distinctive actor, a performer who often takes a character off at unexpected angles, moving diagonally, so to speak, where other performers might go straight. He is equally eccentric in real life. Despite the rush to get his child to the airport in time for afternoon classes, 2,000 miles away, he is inspired by the sight of her sleeping to sit a moment longer and write a poem.</p><p>The poem is still flip-flopping about in his head hours later, when we chat. Since getting his daughter on a plane, Majors has also crammed in a gym session (bike then weights), a cold shower, breakfast (oats then chicken-bacon), a cup of tea, as well as some more mild reckonings with the self. “I like getting up early, always have,” says Majors. He believes in the early mornings “the subconscious is more forward than she usually is. I try to focus on what’s going on in there.” The results of these work-outs are obvious when you speak to him. Majors is 6ft 1in, broad, a wall of a dude wearing a bomber jacket and jeans. With this, he is self-aware to a high degree, honest and loquacious about his tough upbringing, perhaps the most emotionally articulate Hollywood actor I’ve yet encountered. When it comes to discussion of one’s hopes and anxieties, Majors says, “You can’t fake the funk. There has to be a certain level of integrity to it.” Otherwise, why bother?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/26/jonathan-majors-interview-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-creed-3">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Lehman Trilogy is an enthralling and acclaimed play. But, as it returns to London, we should discuss the profound problem at its core</p><p>Of all the stereotypes about Jews in the lexicon of antisemitism, none is as commonplace or enduring as the one about Jews and money. From Shylock and Fagin to Joe Rogan’s podcast and TikTok videos about the Rothschilds, the idea that Jews have a unique taste for acquiring wealth is the one thing that people think they “know” about them. Yet this historic anti-Jewish trope seems able to hide in plain sight, in the most surprising of places.</p><p><em>The Lehman Trilogy</em>, which has returned to the London stage, tells the story of the Lehman Brothers bank from its origins as a fabric store in Alabama to its collapse in the 2008 financial crash, the ultimate symbol of unregulated and uncontrollable banking. This award-winning, acclaimed play is an enthralling piece of theatre with five star reviews and a clutch of Tony awards. Unfortunately, it is also profoundly antisemitic. Not in a crude way – a clumsy turn of phrase here, a jarring stereotype there – but in its innermost essence, connecting a modern audience to malevolent beliefs about Jews and money that are buried deep within western thought. Most striking of all, none of the people responsible for writing, acting, directing or producing this play seem remotely aware, and most reviews have missed it entirely. I’m happy to accept that none of them are antisemitic, but it is as if the idea that Jews love money and power is – to use an appropriate phrase – priced in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/antisemitic-tropes-are-back-on-stage-again">Continue reading...</a>

The starting point for those conclusions is the event that haunted him most from those decades: not the interviews with the dictator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/jun/11/features11.g21">Idi Amin</a> in Uganda, or his reports from Iran on the hostage crisis – but the sight of smoke on the horizon in London on 14 June 2017. Having arrived at the Channel 4 studios that morning and seen horrific images from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire/2017/jun/14/all">Grenfell Tower</a>, Snow characteristically jumped on his bike and pedalled over to west London.</p><p>He arrived while the fire was still being fought and spent much of the next four or five days there, talking to survivors and locals, presenting news from under the blackened skeleton of the building. It was only a couple of days into this reporting that he discovered, among the photographs of the missing, a face he recognised. Twelve-year-old Firdaws Hashim had, a few months earlier, won a nationwide public-speaking competition. Snow, alongside Bill Gates, had been a judge at that event – entranced by the schoolgirl’s eloquence. Firdaws, who lived on the 22nd floor at Grenfell, died in the fire along with her two siblings and her parents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/26/the-state-of-us-by-jon-snow-review-screen-titans-vision-of-a-better-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>German photographer Yana Wernicke follows women saving farm animals from slaughter to ​explore our connection with fellow mammals​</p><p>In the past couple of years, looking for ways to depict a different kind of relationship between humans and the natural world, the German photographer <a href="https://yanawernicke.com/">Yana Wernicke </a>has spent time at two animal rescue projects. In each place, young women – named as Rosina and Julie – have saved farm animals from slaughter and modelled an alternative possibility. Wernicke’s book of pictures from those projects, called <em>Companions</em> in English, depicts their kinship and tenderness across species boundaries. The German title of her book captures this spirit better – <em>Weggefährten</em> – a compound word that literally translates as “those who walk the path together”.</p><p>Images such as this one, which invite you to look at animals in profound or surprising attitudes, are typical. Cattle, prime economic units in a global food industry, are central to this story. Wernicke takes inspiration from John Berger’s thought-provoking essay Why Look at Animals? Other recent reference points would be Rosamund Young’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/09/secret-life-cows-rosamund-young-review">The Secret Life of Cows</a></em>, which revealed how individual animals formed playful bonds of friendship and loyalty within a herd, and Andrea Arnold’s eye-opening film <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/cow-review-andrea-arnold-first-documentary-is-meaty-slice-of-bovine-socio-realism">Cow</a></em>, which documented the whole life of a dairy animal, a being with its own biography and emotion, its own time and space.</p><p><em><a href="https://loosejoints.biz/products/companions">Companions</a></em><a href="https://loosejoints.biz/products/companions"> by Yana Wernicke is published by Loose Joints (£40)</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/26/the-big-picture-bonds-of-friendship-across-species-boundaries">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s that moment of mastery when something difficult gives way’: Adam Gopnik on the pleasure of learning a new skill

<p>In an extract from his new book, The Real Work, the New Yorker writer and critic sets out to learn to draw for the first time – and to drive a car</p><p>Magicians have a beautiful term. Over late-night drinks in New York, or over 3am breakfasts in Las Vegas, they love to talk to one another about “the real work”. By the “real work”, they mean the accumulated craft, savvy and technical mastery that makes a great magic trick great.</p><p>We all know the real work in whatever field it is we’ve mastered. It’s shorthand, one might say, for the difference between accomplishment and mere achievement. Yet the real work doesn’t seem to be a goal of the way we live, which favours, over the real work, what we might call the rote work. We live in an achievement-driven society in which kids of all kinds and classes are perpetually being pushed toward the next evanescent achievement instead of the next enduring accomplishment. Yet anyone who is a parent of any sensitivity at all recognises that what really stirs and moves children isn’t the “A” you get in the test. No, what really moves and stirs us is <em>accomplishment</em>, that moment of mastery when suddenly we feel that something profoundly difficult, tenaciously thorny, has given way and we are now the Master of It, instead of us being mastered <em>by </em>it. That feeling may not be the very best feeling in life – there are a few competitive others – but it is, I’ve come to believe, the most sustaining feeling. <em>I know how to do this and this is the thing I know how to do.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/26/adam-gopnik-new-yorker-real-work-learning-to-draw-skills">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Ben Stokes enforces follow-on early on day three in Wellington</li><li>Hosts trail by 24 runs with seven second-innings wickets intact</li></ul><p>A couple of days out from the second Test, at a drinks reception, the chief executive of New Zealand Cricket, David White, referred to the Basin Reserve as the “spiritual home” of the sport in the country, prompting a few harrumphs from the visiting heads of the country’s major associations.</p><p>Lighthearted harrumphs, admittedly, they nevertheless spoke to the pride that underpins cricket in New Zealand and the collective drive from the bottom up that saw the men’s national team climb the mountain and claim the inaugural World Test Championship title in Southampton two years ago.<br /><br />The ICC mace was on display at the New Zealand Cricket Museum on the third day at the Basin and, out on a field, a good deal of local pride was too. Overnight rain had turned the ground’s grass banks into mudslides but the two sets of supporters were undeterred, sitting transfixed by a gripping arm-wrestle out in the middle.<br /><br />For the first time as England captain, Ben Stokes had the chance to enforce the follow-on and took it. New Zealand had finally been bowled out for 209 in the morning – a deficit of 226 runs – after Stuart Broad had snuffed out some bludgeoning tail-end work from Tim Southee, 73, to finish with figures of four for 61.<br /><br />But any thoughts of two days off were thwarted by a characterful response from New Zealand, reaching 202 for three at stumps and just 24 runs behind. Half-centuries from Tom Latham, 83, and Devon Conway, 61, laid the foundation for this, and though a wobble came after tea, Jack Leach and Joe Root sharing three wickets in the space of nine overs, the hosts had unquestionably won the day.<br /><br />The pushback began first thing when Southee rolled back the years to that six-hitting Test debut in Napier in 2008, resuming on 23 and crunching 50 from 31 balls, with Leach launched over the ropes three times in one over. Though not enough to prevent the follow-on, a 98-run stand with Tom Blundell, 38, had given Stokes food for thought.<br /><br />Not that he pondered too long. And beyond England’s desire for fast cricket there was sound merit: with the surface turning brown after its emerald-green start, this was possibly the last day with something for the seamers before it flattened out. Not that it proved the case. The wind had changed direction from the previous day and with it the fortunes of New Zealand’s opening pair.<br /><br />Over the next two and a half hours, as muggy cloud cover made way for sunshine, they offered diligent resistance. Latham, curiously overlooked for the captaincy last December despite nine Tests as a stand-in previously, waited for the chance to pull and cut predominantly, passing 5,000 Test runs along the way, while Conway drove languidly when the seamers went full. He is so easy on the eye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/26/williamson-and-nicholls-dig-in-as-new-zealand-resistance-frustrates-england">Continue reading...</a>

This insistence on photo ID to vote in May’s elections runs the risk of disenfranchising several groups of people – many of whom aren’t natural Conservatives<p>Combating voter fraud is a worthy objective. And that is what the government says it is doing by requiring all voters to show photo ID before being allowed to cast their ballot in person from May. Ministers would have us believe this is a landmark reform that will prevent fraudsters from posing as other people in order to cast votes on their behalf.</p><p>But voter ID has been described by a wide range of opponents, including election experts, local government representatives and charities representing disenfranchised groups, as a <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-9187/CBP-9187.pdf" title="">solution in search of a problem,</a> or, in the words of the Electoral Reform Society, “<a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/campaigns/voter-id/" title="">a sledgehammer to crack a nut</a>”. There is very little evidence to suggest that in-person voter fraud is anything other than a minuscule problem.

It may not change the world, but it’s a sip in the right direction<p><strong>Co-op Fairtrade Carmenère, Central Valley, Chile 2020 (£6.65, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/products/co-op-fairtrade-carmenere-368697">Co-op</a>)<br /></strong>Fairtrade Fortnight, the Fairtrade Foundation’s annual festival of ethically sourced products, begins tomorrow, and I’ve noticed an interesting shift in emphasis in the activities planned until 12 March. If you happen to be in east London this week, for example, you can call in at the Endangered Aisle pop-up which the Foundation is running in Shoreditch to, in its words, “shine a light on the supermarket staples most at risk of becoming endangered from the climate crisis”. The Foundation says that coffee, chocolate and bananas are most at risk, with climate change “making crops like these harder and harder to grow. Combined with deeply unfair trade,” the foundation adds, “communities growing these crops are being pushed to the brink”. These harsh realities have been particularly evident this month for wine producers in southern Chile, where unprecedented wildfires, which the authorities have explicitly linked to climate change, have burned through hundreds of hectares of vineyards. All the more reason to support wines such as the Co-op’s blackberry-juicy Fairtrade Carmenère.</p><p><strong>Adama Fairtrade White, Wellington, South Africa 2021 (£10, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/products/adama-fairtrade-white-806110">Co-op</a>)<br /></strong>According to the Fairtrade Foundation, more than 50 producers now offer Fairtrade wines in the UK, either with their own brands or in partnership with supermarket own-labels. Although Chile and, more recently, Lebanon have played a part in contributing to the 20 million or so litres of Fairtrade-accredited wine consumed in the UK annually, the two most developed Fairtrade wine producing countries are undoubtedly South Africa and Argentina. Indeed, The Co-op – which, with more than three-quarters of the UK’s total Fairtrade wine sales, and a total of 57 Fairtrade wines, is comfortably the biggest retailer in this sector – has just announced that it will be switching all of its South Africa wines to Fairtrade. Whereas once this might have meant a significant compromise on quality, it’s hard to argue with wines such as the pair made at the Bosman Adama project: a robustly spicy Shiraz-based red blend (also £10), and, my favourite, the richly textured chenin blanc-grenache blanc white blend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/26/wines-of-the-week-david-williams-raise-a-glass-to-fairtrade-fortnight-wines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tests carried out on remains of young communist who confessed to arson attack that proved a gift to Hitler</p><p>When flames enveloped Germany’s parliament on the evening of 27 November 1933, six days before national elections, it was a political gift to Adolf Hitler, the recently appointed chancellor. The arson attack on the Reichstag by an “enemy within” secured his re-election and gave him the pretext to grab the dictatorial powers he craved.</p><p>Whether that gift fell into the Nazi leader’s lap by chance or was placed there via a covert false-flag operation has been the subject of bitter historical disputes ever since. Now, 90 years later, the body of the young communist whom historians have traditionally regarded as the sole perpetrator of the attack has been exhumed in the hope of finding a definitive answer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/26/blind-chance-or-plot-exhumation-may-help-solve-puzzle-of-1933-reichstag-blaze">Continue reading...</a>

## Kino, Leeds: ‘Expect dramatic bursts of harissa and tahini’ – restaurant review

Mezze and small plates £5-7.50, sharing plates £7.50-22, desserts £6, wines from £21.95 a bottle</strong></p><p>I have only ever attended one performance by the great Leeds-based company, Opera North. It was a 1987 production of <em>Daphne</em> by Richard Strauss, a work subtitled “a bucolic tragedy in one act” which, funnily enough, later became my fond nickname for the whole of Surrey. <em>Daphne</em> is about love and the caprices of the gods. It ends with our eponymous heroine becoming a tree. In truth, the whole thing made me extremely dizzy, although it turned out that this was on account of the German measles with which I was diagnosed the very next day, this being a year before the universal introduction of the life-saving MMR.

There hadn’t been so many substantial women around since the Edwardian era, apparently<p>On 20 July 1986, <em>The Observer Magazine</em> celebrated the return of ‘big girls’. That descriptor gives the 2023 reader pause, as it appears inside the magazine below a picture of the far-from-big French actor Béatrice Dalle – and there’s more to come. Kelly McGillis has a ‘throat like a tree trunk’ and ‘almost a double chin’ in <em>Witness</em>. She looked ‘as if she were about to smother poor little Tom Cruise in <em>Top Gun</em>’.</p><p>The tone is celebratory if the language is startling. ‘There haven’t been so many substantial women around since the Edwardian era,’ says the – female, it’s worth noting – author, approvingly, ‘when the goddesses were 6ft and size 16’.
