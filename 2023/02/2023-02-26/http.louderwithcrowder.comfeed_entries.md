I love them. In fact, I love all animals, and I have a particular disdain for people who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dog-abused-saved-bystanders" target="_blank">abuse</a> creatures who literally just want to love them and be fed. </p><p>However, I just cannot understand why people own pit bulls. I understand that *some* of them can be very sweet. But others can literally eat your face and kill you in an instant. And that's just not a gamble I'm willing to take. </p><p>That's what happened recently in San Antonio when police officers had to fend off several pit bulls with pickaxes after they killed an 80-year-old man and mauled several other people.  </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cPitbull attack in San Antonio, Texas\n\n\u2018Horrific scene\u2019: Dog owner arrested after elderly man killed, 3 others injured.\u201d</div> — PPV-TAHOE - News Journalist (@PPV-TAHOE - News Journalist)

<p>The attack happened this past Friday when the man and another woman were going for a walk. The man was reportedly dragged by the dogs, and the woman was viciously mauled. The woman is currently in critical condition. All in all, two people were mauled, another was bitten, and the man was killed. </p><p>The San Antonio Fire Chief <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11791057/Man-80-killed-three-injured-dog-attack-San-Antonio.html" target="_blank">said</a>,<em> "As they rounded the corner they could see a man being dragged by a dog. He was completely bloodied before they got out of the truck. This is not something that is normal for us. We don't normally have to defend patients from animals or ourselves. The firefighters in this instance were very heroic fighting off these pit bulls with pickaxes and pipes to try and get to the patients."</em></p><p>The dogs reportedly have a history of violence. They were confiscated in 2021 for a "mild bite" and neighbors made several calls over the past few years complaining about the dogs' aggression and animal neglect. The dogs have been taken by San Antonio Animal Care Services and placed into quarantine kennels. The Fire Chief said the owner is likely to face charges. As they should. </p>

## Woody Harrelson under fire for 'anti-science' SNL monologue about drug cartels locking people in their homes

	Woody Harrelson was the host of SNL on Saturday night. In his monologue, he shared a sci-fi/horror story he had pitched years ago that critics in 2023 are calling anti-science.
</p><p>
	Woody's pitch was about "the biggest drug cartels in the world get together and buy up all the media and all the politicians and forcing all the people in the world to stay locked in their homes, and people can only come out if they take the cartel’s drugs, and keep taking them, over and over."
</p><p>
	But he threw the script away. After all, who would believe such a crazy idea?
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote></div><p>
	Haters were quick to attack, for some reason. <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine, which <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rolling-stone-oklahoma-hospital" target="_blank">has been getting stories</a> wrong since they threw William Miller under the bus for his article on Stillwater in the 70s, claims that in sharing a story idea he had years and years and years, Harrelson was spreading conspiracy theories.
