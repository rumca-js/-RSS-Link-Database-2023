<p>Today at MWC, Lenovo showed off the latest updates to their business-oriented ThinkPad and IdeaPad lines. The focus is on better performance from modern chips across the board, increased use of more eco-friendly materials, and so on. </p>



<p>While I was impressed with Lenovo&rsquo;s many offerings, there were a couple of standouts for me, namely the fifth generation of the ThinkPad E14 and the first generation of the E16, as well as the IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook. From taller displays to punchier audio, I really liked what the upgrades the manufacturer made to these specific machines. Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>

<p>When it comes to business-oriented laptops, a solid display can make a world of difference, especially where productivity tasks are concerned. Lenovo made a really smart move here by increasing the size of the ThinkPad E14&rsquo;s display. The aspect ratio is now 16:10. The taller display makes scrolling through documents much easier, which is perfect for those who primarily use a laptop for work. The touchpad is also larger at 115mm, making it a more comfortable user experience. Now, let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s going on beneath the hood.</p>



<p>The E14 will have either a 13th-gen Intel Core or an AMD Ryzen 7000 Series processor, up to 40GB of DDR4 RAM (wow), and dual SSD storage up to 2TB. That&rsquo;s a sufficient amount of power, especially for work-related tasks. The 14-inch display will have a touch option and, according to Lenovo, a maximum brightness level of 300 nits. </p>



<p>Lenovo also added the brand new ThinkPad E16 to their lineup, which has a bigger display and the same 16:10 aspect ratio. However, for the top-tier configuration, the maximum brightness level gets bumped up to 400 nits. The hardware is near-identical to the E14. The E16 will have the latest Intel or AMD processors, up to 40GB of RAM, and dual SSD storage up to 2TB.</p>



<p>The E14 and E16 will launch in May 2023 with a starting price of $739 and $759. </p>



<h2 id="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook" class="wp-image-1523325" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Untitled-design-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">I love Chromebooks</a>. They&rsquo;re simple, affordable, and secure. They have great battery life, too. </p>



<p>Lenovo is updating its IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook with better speakers, brighter screen options, and so on. The Chromebook will now feature front-facing speakers with Waves MaxxAudio tuning as well as a 14-inch touch-enabled 1080p display with a maximum brightness of 300 nits. These upgrades add a great deal of versatility, as it&rsquo;s ready for both work and play. </p>



<p>The Chromebook will feature a MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of eMMC storage. It&rsquo;s not the most powerful Chromebook we&rsquo;ve ever seen, but it should be fine for basic everyday use. The port selection is diverse, too. You&rsquo;re getting one MicroSD card slot, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and one combo audio jack. </p>



<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook will become available to purchase in May 2023 with a reasonable starting price of $340.</p>
