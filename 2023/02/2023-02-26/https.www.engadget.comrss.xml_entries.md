<p>Like many other PC and phone manufacturers, Lenovo is at MWC Barcelona this week, sharing details about what it has in store for the rest of the year. The company’s 2023 lineup includes refreshed ThinkPad laptops and ThinkCentre monitors, but perhaps the most interesting announcement involves the IdeaPad Duet 3i.</p><p>Lenovo is updating the Windows 11 2-in-1 to add a larger 11.5-inch IPS panel with a 2,000 x 1,200 resolution, 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage and 400 nits of peak brightness. The new model also has upgraded 5-megapixel and 8-megapixel front and rear-facing cameras and an N200 processor from Intel. The four-core, four-thread processor features a boost clock of up to 3.7GHz. You can configure the IdeaPad with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It also comes with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity, and with the option to pair the device with a stylus, Lenovo says the IdeaPad Duet 3i is perfect for students. The 2-in-1 will arrive in Europe later this year and cost €449 (about $473).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A rear photo fo the IdeaPad Duet 3i, showing the 2-in-1 " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/eb102630-b626-11ed-bdff-a75890ec3ac1" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>Lenovo is also updating its affordable IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook line. The company will offer the 14-inch laptop in three different display options. At the top of the stack, there’s a Full HD model with an IPS panel that offers 100 percent sRGB coverage and 300 nits of brightness. Another FHD model comes with a TN panel that peaks at 250 nits. And for those looking to spend as little as possible on their next computer, Lenovo will also offer a 1,366 x 768 option. You can configure the IdeaPad Slim 3 with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of eMMC storage. With a modest MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor powering everything, Lenovo says its latest Chromebook can go up to 13.5 hours on a single charge. The company expects the IdeaPad Slim 3 to start at $340 when it arrives in May.</p><p>You can read Engadget’s hands-on with the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 and Z16 Gen 2 to get the full scoop on those laptops, but the short version is that they feature AMD’s latest Ryzen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-16-core-033046361.html"><ins>7000 series processors</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-rdna-3-laptops-radeon-rx-7000-033006886.html"><ins>Radeon GPUs</ins></a>. You can configure both devices with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of internal storage. Lenovo will offer two screen options with the Z13. You can either go with an IPS panel or a 2.8K OLED. Both displays feature a 16:10 aspect ratio and 400 nits of peak brightness. With the Z16, meanwhile, your options are between an IPS panel and a 4K OLED. Both computers also come with WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.1 support, and Lenovo will allow you to outfit the Z13 with an optional casing made partially from woven plant fibers. The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 will arrive in July and start at $1,249. Lenovo expects to begin selling ThinkPad Z16 Gen 2 one month later. It will start at $1,749.&nbsp;</p>

## Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 and Z16 Gen 2 hands-on: Slick updates for hybrid work

<p>Back at CES, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=59bdf74a-dd5e-49bf-af3d-ef9ab46255e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Lenovo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1OWJkZjc0YS1kZDVlLTQ5YmYtYWYzZC1lZjlhYjQ2MjU1ZTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVub3ZvLmNvbS91cy9lbi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU4YzY4YTllLTRhOGYtNDRjZi05MDBiLTZkMjEyNTI3YjczNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfmPoKlXoBXSw5b8YKxvwOp14Of_jz39wMDAUAElsvs1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2F">Lenovo</a> showed off a huge portfolio of new devices including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-yoga-book-9-i-hands-on-ces-2023-a-huge-leap-for-dual-screen-laptops-160045296.html">true dual-screen laptop</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovos-desk-light-has-an-integrated-webcam-wireless-charger-and-135-w-power-input-143028207.html">desk lamp that doubles as a webcam</a>. But now, Lenovo is back at Mobile World Congress with a few more refreshed notebooks and tablets headlined by two interesting updates to the ThinkPad Z family.</p><p>Designed to be ideal companions for hybrid workers, the new ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 and Z16 Gen 2 feature an all-AMD setup. You’ll be able to choose from a range of Ryzen 7000 processors and even an optional Radeon 6650M graphics card on the larger Z16, along with up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage. However, for people who are constantly hopping on and off video calls, the ThinkPad Z13 and Z16’s new communication features might be the bigger draw.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="acbf106c89ae4f2a93b8e4c1852d031c"></div><p>That’s because in addition to new full HD webcams, you’ll also get support for Wi-Fi 6E and Dolby Voice-enabled microphones, so you should look and sound good on Zoom meetings. But my favorite new feature is the TrackPoint Quick Menu that can be summoned by simply double-tapping the company’s signature red nub. This opens a window that lets you quickly adjust things like camera settings, mic volume, voice dictation, noise suppression and more. You can even customize which settings you want to see so you have fast access to the things you tend to change most often and I think it’s a great way of adding new functionality to a classic component like the TrackPoint.</p><p>Other specs include up to a 13.3-inch 2.8K OLED display on the Z13 Gen 2 or a larger and higher resolution 16-inch 4K OLED panel on the Z16 Gen 2. Lenovo has also retained handy features like an electronic shutter for the webcam, in addition to dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, two or three USB ports depending on the system, and a dedicated SD card reader on the Z16.</p><figure><img alt="The second-gen ThinkPad Z line will be available in two sizes: the 13-inch Z13 Gen 2 and the 16-inch Z16 Gen 2. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/f14263f0-b465-11ed-bbbd-f865071627d2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, to help improve your mousing experience, both the Z13 and Z16 Gen 2 feature a Fusion FX touchpad from Sensel, which adds more sophisticated haptics, better palm rejection and more. On top of being physically larger (120mm across), long-time Trackpoint fans will also appreciate that Sensel’s touchpad supports three virtual haptic buttons that run across the top of the touchpad, so you’ll still have easy access to left and right mouse clicks without having to reach too far.</p><p>Finally, the last big change for the Z13 is that alongside the default aluminum finish, as part of its commitment to sustainability, Lenovo is also introducing a new flax fiber lid which is made from waste material collected during the harvesting process. This material is something we’ve seen before on a handful of concept cars from companies like <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2021/motorsport/porsche-concept-study-motorsports-mission-r-all-electric-gt-racing-car-body-chassis-world-premiere-iaa-mobility-25655.html">Porsche</a> and <a href="https://www.polestar.com/us/precept/flax-fibre-composites/">Polestar</a>, but Lenovo says this is the first time this reinforced flax fiber material will be available on a consumer electronic device.</p><figure><img alt="On the new Z13 and Z16 Gen 2, there's a new TrackPoint Quick Menu that can be summoned by double tapping the company's signature red nub." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/1cf2c710-b466-11ed-ba35-529bdf4e463d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Admittedly, this isn’t for everyone, but I kind of like it because it looks almost like a futuristic take on wood paneling. Not only does this add a bit of warmth to the laptop’s appearance, just like a nice piece of furniture, each flax fiber lid features a unique grain, which gives the whole system a bit of added personality. On top of that, Lenovo says the lid is bonded to a top cover made from 75 percent recycled aluminum.</p><p>While their designs aren’t changing a ton (aside from that new lid option on Z13), the addition of speedier components, larger touchpads and better conferencing features should make the second-gen ThinkPad Z-series laptops even better at getting work done – both at home or in the office. And thanks to its optional flax fiber lid, the Z13 Gen 2 might be the most stylish and sustainable ThinkPad yet.</p><figure><img alt="The Z13's new Fusion FX touchpad from Sensel features a row of haptic mouse buttons, improved palm rejection and overall better accuracy. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/5554d440-b466-11ed-befe-560b263e4473" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 is expected to go on sale sometime in July starting at $1,249, with the ThinkPad Z16 Gen arriving a bit later in August starting at $1,749.</p>

## Twitter has reportedly laid off product manager Esther Crawford

<p>For at least the fourth time since he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-done-with-job-cuts-blue-verified-062148989.html">said the company was done with layoffs</a>, Elon Musk is reportedly cutting more of Twitter’s workforce. According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiYTBhNGNkYy1jZWM4LTQxNmEtOWU5My1lMTFiODE3OTEyOWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaW5mb3JtYXRpb24uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3R3aXR0ZXItbGF5cy1vZmYtYXQtbGVhc3QtNTAtaW4tcmVsZW50bGVzcy1jb3N0LWN1dHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT10aV9hcHAmcmM9d2hmMGZkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2Yzc4YmI0YS1jOWNkLTQ1YjYtOGI1OC1kZmZlMjA2ZWMzODAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUve4RkIoNBgPMGHUPuuluJLc-b1_KNyb_deTOloBRVO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ftwitter-lays-off-at-least-50-in-relentless-cost-cuts%3Futm_source%3Dti_app%26rc%3Dwhf0fd"><em>The Information</em></a>, the social media website laid off “dozens” of employees on Saturday evening. The outlet put the number of affected staffers at approximately 50, a number <em>Platformer’s</em> Zoë Schiffer later said was likely much higher.</p><p>“Hearing that the Twitter layoffs last night were well above 50 and hit multiple departments including engineering,” Schiffer <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1629863291903430659?s=20">tweeted on Saturday</a>, subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1629917304799760384?s=20">adding</a> that product manager Esther Crawford was among those Twitter let go on over the weekend. Crawford’s departure is notable for a few reasons. Outside of Musk himself, she was one of the most recognizable faces at “Twitter 2.0.” She led the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-monday-11-per-month-ios-221436172.html">Twitter Blue redesign</a> and oversaw work on its upcoming payments platform. At one point, she even shared a photo of herself sleeping on the floor of Twitter’s office.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f72faf9b1cf64f2dba00ca7120823cdb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Look, you're gonna feel pretty silly about this once you get canned with 0 severance.</p>— cliff@leaninto.it on mastodon (@moonpolysoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/moonpolysoft/status/1587838127808581634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The company’s latest cuts claimed at least one other prominent employee. On Saturday morning, Revue founder Martijn de Kuijper <a href="https://twitter.com/mdekuijper/status/1629731350612791296?s=20">tweeted</a> he was among those who had lost their job. “Waking up to find I’ve been locked out of my email,” he said. “Looks like I’m let go.” Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-down-revue-171029741.html">shut down Revue</a> at the start of this year. Musk did not address the cuts on Twitter. “Hope you have a good Sunday,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1629914011415244803?s=20">tweeted</a> early Sunday afternoon. “First day of the rest of your life.” Since his takeover of the company last year, it’s believed Twitter has cut more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/80-percent-of-twitters-full-time-staff-has-evaporated-under-musk-234247201.html">80 percent of its full-time staff</a>.

## Russia's replacement Soyuz spacecraft arrives at ISS to bring back MS-22 crew

<p>MS-23, the Soyuz spacecraft Russia sent to bring cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio back to Earth, has arrived at the International Space Station. Per <a href="https://www.space.com/russia-soyuz-replacement-ms-23-international-space-station-docking"><em><ins>Space.com</ins></em></a>, Russia’s Roscosmos Space Agency announced early Sunday morning that the unmanned vessel docked with the ISS at 7:58PM ET on Saturday evening. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-targets-february-24th-for-soyuz-ms-22-crew-rescue-launch-211028905.html"><ins>As expected</ins></a>, the flight launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on February 24th.</p><p>MS-23 was originally scheduled to launch later this year, but Roscosmos was forced to push up the flight after MS-22 – Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio’s original return craft – <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iss-soyuz-ms-22-capsule-leak-205133518.html"><ins>sprung a coolant leak</ins></a> in December following a micrometeoroid strike. The incident put Roscosmos and NASA in a tricky spot. If an emergency broke out on the ISS and the entire crew had to evacuate, it wasn’t clear whether MS-22 could carry its crew safely back to Earth. Roscosmos and NASA eventually settled on a contingency plan that would have seen MS-22 transport Prokopyev and Petelin, while Rubio would have hitched a ride on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-soyuz-capsule-rescue-mission-iss-205343374.html">SpaceX Crew-5 Dragon</a>. Thankfully, the two agencies weren’t forced to put that plan to the test.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With MS-23 safely docked with the ISS, Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will remain at the space station until at least September. The three were originally due to complete their mission in March. In the meantime, Roscomos plans to bring MS-22 back to Earth sometime next month.</p>

## This is Nokia’s new logo

<p>For the first time in nearly 60 years, one-time smartphone giant Nokia is changing its iconic logo. On Sunday, before the official start of Mobile World Congress Barcelona, the company unveiled a new brand identity, and it’s a dramatic change. Gone is the iconic typeface and “<a href="https://brandpalettes.com/nokia-logo-colors/"><ins>Yale blue</ins></a>” that defined its previous logo. The company has instead adopted a look it claims is more modern and digital.</p><p>“We are updating our strategy, and, as a key enabler, we are also refreshing our brand to reflect who we are today: a business-to-business technology innovation leader pioneering the future where networks meet cloud,” Nokia said in a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=057fc781-5783-4a42-8d58-fc0d58ce3e82&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nokia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNTdmYzc4MS01NzgzLTRhNDItOGQ1OC1mYzBkNThjZTNlODIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm9raWEuY29tL2Jsb2cvdGhpcy1pcy1ub2tpYS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM1ZGExYjFkLWU5MGYtNDkwNy1iYTEyLTNjNmVkMzJhOTZiYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXBDPneP9lKSswvVFnwgxGLfrjnp1TenGFwxIyOPibPM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fblog%2Fthis-is-nokia%2F"><ins>blog post </ins></a>attributed to CEO Pekka Lundmark. "In most people’s minds, we are still a successful mobile phone brand, but this is not what Nokia is about,” Lundmark <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-26/nokia-redesigns-logo-because-people-think-it-still-makes-mobile-phones?sref=10lNAhZ9">told Bloomberg</a>. "We want to launch a new brand that is focusing very much on the networks and industrial digitalization, which is a completely different thing from the legacy mobile phones.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Is this the end of a logo so many people know and love? Not necessarily. You may recall, Nokia’s phone business hasn’t been a part of Nokia proper since Microsoft’s ultimately disastrous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-25-microsoft-nokia-merger-details.html"><ins>$7 billion</ins></a> acquisition of the company’s Devices and Services division in 2014. After the tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-18-microsoft-feature-phones-foxconn.html"><ins>washed its hands clean</ins></a> of that deal in 2016, HMD Global, a company made up of former Nokia execs, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-18-nokia-hmd-global-fih-mobile-smartphone-tablet-android.html"><ins>acquired the rights</ins></a> to use the Nokia brand for smartphones and tablets, and has been doing its own thing ever since then. In fact, the company announced its latest device, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-nokia-g22-is-hmds-first-phone-built-with-repairability-in-mind-140030302.html"><ins>the G22</ins></a>, just one day before today’s announcement, and as it so happens, that phone features the classic Nokia logo. Engadget has reached out to HMD Global to find out if the company plans to continue using that logo.</p>

## TCL gave its color paper-like display tech an upgrade for its latest tablets

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tcl/"><ins>TCL</ins></a> is back at Mobile World Congress this year with a bunch of budget-friendly new gear to show off. Among other things, the company has developed a new version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtpaper-display-e-ink-video-eye-protection-110057051.html"><ins>color paper-like screen technology</ins></a>, which it's calling NXTPAPER 2.0.</p><p>Compared with the previous version, TCL says NXTPAPER 2.0 delivers 150 percent more brightness with up to 500 nits, making it easier to use outdoors during the day (the anti-glare tech should help too). The company claims that, due to hardware-level filtering, the technology exceeds TÜV-certified levels of blue light reduction. TCL says the tech can help protect your eye health while maintaining color accuracy and avoiding screen yellowing. The screen's color temperature will adjust automatically based on the time and environment as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll soon be able to check out NXTPAPER 2.0 on a new tablet. The NXTPAPER 11 has an 11-inch, 2K display and TCL says there's a feature called AI Visual Boost that makes colors &quot;bolder and more lifelike.&quot; The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2013/"><ins>Android 13</ins></a> tablet runs on an octa-core processor. It has 8MP cameras on the front and rear, four speakers, dual mics and an 8,000mAh battery. The tablet, which weighs just over a pound (462g), starts at $249 and it will initially be available in Europe in May.</p><p>Also new is the TCL TAB 11, another 11-inch tablet, albeit with a 2K NXTVISION display. It otherwise has similar specs as the NXTPAPER 11. The TAB 11 will be available in May and it starts at $179. Versions with LTE start at $209.</p><figure><img alt="TCL 40 XE 5G smartphone" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/931efb30-b483-11ed-a1df-af82deb7fde3" style="height: 1750; width: 2480;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>On the phone front, TCL has a few new models for the US market: the 40 XE 5G, 40 X 5G and a 40 XL with 4G connectivity. The $169 40 XE 5G is the lowest-cost 5G TCL phone to date, the company said. It has a 6.56-inch HD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate and 180Hz touch sampling. The rear camera array features a 13MP main camera and 2MP depth and macro sensors. On the front, there's an 8MP lens. The phone has a 2.2GHz octo-core processor and 4GB of RAM. There's just 64GB of storage, but you can add another 1TB via microSD.</p><p>The 40 XE 5G will be available in June, just like the 40 X 5G, which has similar specs, but a more advanced 50MP main camera. That model starts at $199. The 4G-only 40 XL, meanwhile, has a 6.75&quot; HD+ display, dual speakers and a 50MP main camera. There's an octa-core processor and base storage of 128GB. You can pick that Android 13 phone up in May for $149.</p><p>Along with the phones and tablets, TCL has a fresh set of earphones.

<p>It's been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-12s-ultra-leica-one-inch-sensor-130451208.html">a long time coming</a>, but Xiaomi is finally bringing its Leica-endorsed smartphones to the international market. Following their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-13-pro-type-1-snapdragon-8-gen-2-101000001.html">China launch</a> back in December, the Xiaomi 13 and 13 Pro are going global at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mwc%202023/">MWC</a>, with Germany, France, Spain and Italy being some of their first markets in the west. As you'd expect, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chip-offers-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-230008445.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> flagships now come with Google services pre-installed, but they are otherwise identical to their China counterparts.</p><p>The Xiaomi 13 and 13 Pro share similar-looking Leica camera islands on the back, but only the 13 Pro offers the much-hyped Type 1-inch sensor (Sony's IMX989; 1.6um pixel size) — arguably the industry's most powerful camera sensor at the moment — for its 50-megapixel f/1.9 OIS (optical image stabilization) main shooter. You also get a 50-megapixel 3.2x telephoto camera (75mm equivalent) with OIS and a 50-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (14mm equivalent).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the lesser Xiaomi 13, it comes with a 50-megapixel f/1.8 OIS main camera with a smaller sensor (IMX800; 1um pixel size), a 10-megapixel 3.2x zoom OIS zoom camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide (15mm equivalent) camera.</p><p>Both models share the same 32-megapixel f/2.0 punch-hole selfie cam on the other side. On a similar note, both phones offer two modes of capture — Leica Authentic and Leica Vibrant — along with Google's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magic-eraser-is-coming-to-older-pixel-phones-and-google-one-starting-today-170019112.html">Magic Eraser</a> tool.</p><figure><img alt="Xiaomi 13 Pro and 13" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/e0a37a00-b5ed-11ed-9bbb-29403acc015e" /><figcaption>Xiaomi 13 Pro and 13</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The Xiaomi 13 series also comes in two designs. The 13 Pro comes with a curved 6.73-inch 3,200 x 1,400 AMOLED screen with vegan leather or ceramic back versions. On the other hand, the 13 packs a flat 6.36-inch 2,400 x 1,080 AMOLED display, which is surrounded by iPhone-like aluminum sides and complemented by either glass or leather back options. Both screens support a refresh rate of up to 120Hz for a slick scrolling experience.</p><p>Other noteworthy features include the 13 Pro's 120W charging (from zero to 100 percent in just 19 minutes for its 4,820mAh battery), the 13's 67W charging (38 minutes to fully charge its 4,500mAh cell), and 50W wireless charging, Dolby Atmos dual speakers and IP68 ruggedness for both Android devices. The 13 Pro starts from 1,299 euros (around $1,370), whereas the 13 starts from 999 euros (around $1,060).</p><figure><img alt="Xiaomi 13 Lite" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/495df1c0-b5f2-11ed-ae6f-c9090fefa0b0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>As a surprise for MWC, Xiaomi also announced the 13 Lite, which appears to be a variant of the selfie-centric <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/xiaomi-civi-2-hello-kitty-special-limited-edition-hk-125959272.html">Civi 2</a> sold in China. And no, there's no Leica involvement here. This model starts from 499 euros (around $530) and boasts dual front cameras (32-megapixel + 8-megapixel depth sensor) plus dual &quot;Selfie Glow&quot; LEDs for supposedly better selfies. It's powered by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-120047819.html">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> processor, and it also packs a 50-megapixel main camera (IMX766), a 20-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 2-megapixel macro camera, a 4,500mAh battery with 67W charging, and a 6.55-inch Full HD+ 120Hz display. This is all tucked into a 171g-heavy, 7.23mm-thick body, which obviously goes well with its &quot;Lite&quot; branding.</p>

Reprinted with permission from The MIT Press. Copyright 2023.</p><hr /><p>Just seven years later Henry Ford began to sell his Model T, the first mass-produced affordable and durable passenger car, and in 1911 Charles Kettering, who later played a key role in developing leaded gasoline, designed the first practical electric starter, which obviated dangerous hand cranking. And although hard-topped roads were still in short supply even in the eastern part of the US, their construction began to accelerate, with the country’s paved highway length more than doubling between 1905 and 1920. No less important, decades of crude oil discoveries accompanied by advances in refining provided the liquid fuels needed for the expansion of the new transportation, and in 1913 Standard Oil of Indiana introduced William Burton’s thermal cracking of crude oil, the process that increased gasoline yield while reducing the share of volatile compounds that make up the bulk of natural gasolines.</p><p>But having more affordable and more reliable cars, more paved roads, and a dependable supply of appropriate fuel still left a problem inherent in the combustion cycle used by car engines: the propensity to violent knocking (pinging). In a perfectly operating gasoline engine, gas combustion is initiated solely by a timed spark at the top of the combustion chamber and the resulting flame front moves uniformly across the cylinder volume. Knocking is caused by spontaneous ignitions (small explosions, mini-detonations) taking place in the remaining gases before they are reached by the flame front initiated by sparking. Knocking creates high pressures (up to 18 MPa, or nearly up to 180 times the normal atmospheric level), and the resulting shock waves, traveling at speeds greater than sound, vibrate the combustion chamber walls and produce the telling sounds of a knocking, malfunctioning engine.</p><p>Knocking sounds alarming at any speed, but when an engine operates at a high load it can be very destructive. Severe knocking can cause brutal irreparable engine damage, including cylinder head erosion, broken piston rings, and melted pistons; and any knocking reduces an engine’s efficiency and releases more pollutants; in particular, it results in higher nitrogen oxide emissions. The capacity to resist knocking— that is, fuel’s stability— is based on the pressure at which fuel will spontaneously ignite and has been universally measured in octane numbers, which are usually displayed by filling stations in bold black numbers on a yellow background.</p><p>Octane (C8H18) is one of the alkanes (hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n + 2) that form anywhere between 10 to 40 percent of light crude oils, and one of its isomers (compounds with the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms but with a different molecular structure), 2,2,4-trimethypentane (iso-octane), was taken as the maximum (100 percent) on the octane rating scale because the compound completely prevents any knocking. The higher the octane rating of gasoline, the more resistant the fuel is to knocking, and engines can operate more efficiently with higher compression ratios. North American refiners now offer three octane grades, regular gasoline (87), midgrade fuel (89), and premium fuel mixes (91– 93).</p><p>During the first two decades of the twentieth century, the earliest phase of automotive expansion, there were three options to minimize or eliminate destructive knocking. The first one was to keep the compression ratios of internal combustion engines relatively low, below 4.3:1: Ford’s best-selling Model T, rolled out in 1908, had a compression ratio of 3.98:1. The second one was to develop smaller but more efficient engines running on better fuel, and the third one was to use additives that would prevent the uncontrolled ignition. Keeping compression ratios low meant wasting fuel, and the reduced engine efficiency was of a particular concern during the years of rapid post–World War I economic expansion as rising car ownership of more powerful and more spacious cars led to concerns about the long-term adequacy of domestic crude oil supplies and the growing dependence on imports. Consequently, additives offered the easiest way out: they would allow using lower-quality fuel in more powerful engines operating more efficiently with higher compression ratios.</p><p>During the first two decades of the twentieth century there was considerable interest in ethanol (ethyl alcohol, C2H6O or CH3CH2OH), both as a car fuel and as a gasoline additive. Numerous tests proved that engines using pure ethanol would never knock, and ethanol blends with kerosene and gasoline were tried in Europe and in the US. Ethanol’s well-known proponents included Alexander Graham Bell, Elihu Thomson, and Henry Ford (although Ford did not, as many sources erroneously claim, design the Model T to run on ethanol or to be a dual-fuel vehicle; it was to be fueled by gasoline); Charles Kettering considered it to be the fuel of the future.</p><p>But three disadvantages complicated ethanol’s large-scale adoption: it was more expensive than gasoline, it was not available in volumes sufficient to meet the rising demand for automotive fuel, and increasing its supply, even only if it were used as the dominant additive, would have claimed significant shares of crop production. At that time there were no affordable, direct ways to produce the fuel on a large scale from abundant cellulosic waste such as wood or straw: cellulose had first to be hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid and the resulting sugars were then fermented. That is why the fuel ethanol was made mostly from the same food crops that were used to make (in much smaller volumes) alcohol for drinking and medicinal and industrial uses.</p><p>The search for a new, effective additive began in 1916 in Charles Kettering’s Dayton Research Laboratories with Thomas Midgley, a young (born in 1889) mechanical engineer, in charge of this effort. In July 1918 a report prepared in collaboration with the US Army and the US Bureau of Mines listed ethyl alcohol, benzene, and a cyclohexane as the compounds that did not produce any knocking in high-compression engines. In 1919, when Kettering was hired by GM to head its new research division, he defined the challenge as one of averting a looming fuel shortage: the US domestic crude oil supply was expected to be gone in fifteen years, and “if we could successfully raise the compression of our motors . . . we could double the mileage and thereby lengthen this period to 30 years.” Kettering saw two routes toward that goal, by using a high-volume additive (ethanol or, as tests showed, fuel with 40 percent benzene that eliminated any knocking) or a low-percentage alternative, akin to but better than the 1 percent iodine solution that was accidentally discovered in 1919 to have the same effect.</p><p>In early 1921 Kettering learned about Victor Lehner’s synthesis of selenium oxychloride at the University of Wisconsin. Tests showed it to be a highly effective but, as expected, also a highly corrosive anti-knocking compound, but they led directly to considering compounds of other elements in group 16 of the periodic table: both diethyl selenide and diethyl telluride showed even better anti-knocking properties, but the latter compound was poisonous when inhaled or absorbed through skin and had a powerful garlicky smell. Tetraethyl tin was the next compound found to be modestly effective, and on December 9, 1921, a solution of 1 percent tetraethyl lead (TEL) — (C2H5)4 Pb — produced no knock in the test engine, and soon was found to be effective even when added in concentrations as low as 0.04 percent by volume.</p><p>TEL was originally synthesized in Germany by Karl Jacob Löwig in 1853 and had no previous commercial use. In January 1922, DuPont and Standard Oil of New Jersey were contracted to produce TEL, and by February 1923 the new fuel (with the additive mixed into the gasoline at pumps by means of simple devices called ethylizers) became available to the public in a small number of filling stations. Even as the commitment to TEL was going ahead, Midgley and Kettering conceded that “unquestionably alcohol is the fuel of the future,” and estimates showed that a 20 percent blend of ethanol and gasoline needed in 1920 could be supplied by using only about 9 percent of the country’s grain and sugar crops while providing an additional market for US farmers. And during the interwar period many European and some tropical countries used blends of 10– 25 percent ethanol (made from surplus food crops and paper mill wastes) and gasoline, admittedly for relatively small markets as the pre–World War II ownership of family cars in Europe was only a fraction of the US mean.</p><p>Other known alternatives included vapor-phase cracked refinery liquids, benzene blends, and gasoline from naphthenic crudes (containing little or no wax). Why did GM, well aware of these realities, decide not only to pursue just the TEL route but also to claim (despite its own correct understanding) that there were no available alternatives: “So far as we know at the present time, tetraethyl lead is the only material available which can bring about these results”? Several factors help to explain the choice. The ethanol route would have required a mass-scale development of a new industry dedicated to an automotive fuel additive that could not be controlled by GM. Moreover, as already noted, the preferable option, producing ethanol from cellulosic waste (crop residues, wood), rather than from food crops, was too expensive to be practical. In fact, the large-scale production of cellulosic ethanol by new enzymatic conversions, promised to be of epoch-making importance in the twenty-first century, has failed its expectations, and by 2020 high-volume US production of ethanol (used as an anti-knocking additive) continued to be based on fermenting corn: in 2020 it claimed almost exactly one-third of the country’s corn harvest.</p>
