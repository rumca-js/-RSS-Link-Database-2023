The room was lit with multicoloured fluorescent flashing bulbs, and we weren’t alone – we were in a Zumba dance class with 40 other bodies sweating it out in activewear. And there was my 61-year-old Chinese mum, coiling her torso back and forth like I had never seen.</p><p>I had been to Zumba before, but had dismissed it as a novelty exercise featuring a giddy instructor in a wireless headset and clashing prints. But in this unassuming gym in Melbourne’s south-east, it felt different. The odour of sweat was the same, the dance routines were familiar, but in the front rows of the class were a dozen or so Asian “aunties” – middle-aged women – gyrating their hips in time to the music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/27/let-it-all-go-and-be-sexy-the-asian-aunties-exploring-their-sensuality-through-zumba">Continue reading...</a>

## My mum was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 14. Here’s what I wish I’d known | Elfy Scott

<p>The stigma surrounding complex mental health is such that<strong> Elfy Scott </strong>completed a psychology degree to learn more – but even that fell short</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>When I was first told that my mum was living with schizophrenia – by my school counsellor, when I was about 14 – I had almost no concept of what that really meant. All I knew for sure was that it felt dark, scary and taboo. In other words, my understanding of complex mental health was almost entirely defined by the stigma that surrounds it.</p><p>I had begun to suspect that there was something rather odd about mum, beyond the normal eccentricities. Maybe not everyone’s parents spoke to unseen voices from time to time, or became wildly obsessed with home break-ins. Putting a name to the diagnosis made parts of the puzzle fall into place – but it also opened the door to more questions: <em>What was schizophrenia, actually? Who else was living with it? And why hadn’t I heard their stories?</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/my-mum-was-diagnosed-with-schizophrenia-when-i-was-14-heres-what-i-wish-id-known">Continue reading...</a>

Nonetheless, many workplace experts question whether the NLRB’s efforts, no matter how vigorous, can assure that workers have a fair shot at unionizing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/26/amazon-trader-joes-starbucks-anti-union-measures">Continue reading...</a>

## Green and hairy, huperzia is a real delight

<p>This new arrival on the UK market is weird and wonderful, but it really grows on you</p><p>With the huge surge of new tropical plant introductions flooding into the trade right now, it is probably the most exciting time in a century to be a houseplant collector. I wonder if this is what it felt like to be a head gardener of a grand estate in Victorian England, when plant hunters were sending back a flurry of new introductions from all over the globe that had never been seen in Britain before. During the first few years of the recent houseplant renaissance, many “new” plants were, in fact, just 1970s staples making a long-overdue comeback, but suddenly there seem to be dozens of truly “new” species, even entire genera, entering the UK market for the first time. There are dozens to pick from, but it’s hard to think of one that’s more weird and wonderful than the huperzia.</p><p>I first saw these amazing plants at a roadside plant stall high up in the mountains of rural Borneo in the early 2000s. Growing upside down straight out of the bottom of wire hanging baskets were Rapunzel-like cascades of what looked just like fluffy green pipe cleaners. Proper cartoon Martian stuff. One of the earliest forms of land plant, the huperzia has a wonderfully primitive growth pattern called bifurcation, where its tips literally split in two, giving its branches a forked “Y” shape. The interesting thing is that this isn’t just the case in the parts above ground as even the skinny, white roots are a fuzzy mass of forks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/26/james-wong-on-gardening-green-and-hairy-huperzia-is-a-real-delight">Continue reading...</a>

## Cocaine Bear review – larky horror comedy is roaring good fun

<p>Elizabeth Banks’s playfully anarchic creature-feature about a rampaging beast high on drugs is as daft as it is entertaining</p><p>“If a man and an ant were exposed to radiation simultaneously,” intones John Goodman’s B-movie maestro in Joe Dante’s 90s cult gem <em>Matinee</em>, “the result would be terrible indeed; for the result would be… Mant!” You can hear an echo of Goodman’s “Half man, half ant, all terror!” mantra in the pitch for this campy horror comedy in which an apex predator and a ragtag group of humans are exposed to several million dollars’ worth of class-A narcotics simultaneously and the result is… <em>Cocaine Bear</em> – a title so brilliantly simple and outrageously WTF? that it almost makes the movie itself redundant. Could any feature really be as much fun as the viral trailer that dropped last month, mashing up sweary kids (“There was a bear; it was <em>fucked</em>!”) and roaring behemoths to the pumping strains of White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)? Or is this, like 2006’s much-hyped <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/20/horror">Snakes on a Plane</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/20/horror">,</a> just another case of all title and no trousers?</p><p>The answer to both questions is no or at least not quite. While this may not be the head-spinning chaos-fest we hoped for, nor is it “terrible indeed”. Instead, actor turned film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/elizabeth-banks">Elizabeth Banks</a>’s third directorial feature (after <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/pitch-perfect-2-review-hilarious-rebel-wilson">Pitch Perfect 2</a></em> and the 2019 <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/charlies-angels-review-kristen-stewart-elizabeth-banks">Charlie’s Angels</a></em> reboot) is sporadically goofy fun, a scrappy carnival of ripped limbs, severed heads and spilled intestines, all softened by an only partly parodic family-centred Spielbergian sensibility.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/26/cocaine-bear-review-larky-horror-comedy-is-roaring-good-fun">Continue reading...</a>
