<p>David Malpass’ decision comes after running afoul of White House for failing to say whether he accepts global warming consensus</p><p>World Bank president David Malpass on Wednesday said he would leave his post by the end of June, months after running afoul of the White House for failing to say whether he accepts the scientific consensus on global warming.</p><p>Malpass, appointed by former president Donald Trump, will vacate the helm of the multilateral development bank, which provides billions of dollars a year in funding for developing economies, with less than a year remaining in a five-year term. He offered no specific reason for the move, saying in a statement, “after a good deal of thought, I’ve decided to pursue new challenges”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/15/david-malpass-world-bank-president-steps-down">Continue reading...</a>

## Matildas look to set tone at Cup of Nations ‘dress rehearsal’ for World Cup | Emma Kemp

<p>With the global showpiece on home soil looming the three-team mini tournament is crucial for coach Tony Gustavsson’s planning</p><p>Tony Gustavsson possesses an undeniable stage presence. Enthusiastic – almost earnest – he arrives in Matildas camp from the air via umbrella, toes out-turned, ready to dance in dreamed-up settings with a smile and some catchy quotes. Five months before a World Cup for which Australia is still not convinced his national team is adequately prepared, he is in dress-rehearsal mode. “Everything we do now is like a World Cup rehearsal,” Gustavsson said on Wednesday, the eve of the Cup of Nations tournament – effectively a series of friendlies against Czechia, Spain and Jamaica.</p><p>Whether the main act turns out to be Mary Poppins or something more like Death of a Salesman remains unknown, even at this late juncture. But the next seven days might at least offer a ‘vibe’. The evidence currently at hand is a mixed 2022: a pretty awful Asian Cup, a 7-0 friendly capitulation to Spain and back-to-back losses against Canada – a World Cup group-stage opponent – followed by a more stirring series of friendly results including a 4-0 win over world No 3 Sweden and 3-1 defeat of Denmark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/16/matildas-look-to-set-tone-at-cup-of-nations-dress-rehearsal-for-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not the first doc to herald the eco-nuclear movement but, even so, this is still a convincing argument in favour of the long-tabooed energy source</p><p>Here is a film that returns us to a thorny revisionist subject which I haven’t seen aired in documentary form since the film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/pandoras-promise-review">Pandora’s Promise in 2013</a> – which isn’t mentioned here, though a poster for it is visible in one shot. For many environmentalists, the last realistic hope we have to avert climate disaster is the great unthinkable, the great unmentionable: stop worrying and learn to love nuclear energy, because nuclear is a colossally efficient and very clean energy source.</p><p>Like Pandora’s Promise, Atomic Hope revisits the case studies of Chornobyl and Fukushima and argues that, although clearly catastrophic, a mythology of horror has grown up around these events that has stymied all debate and shut down thought. The film doesn’t say so, but another way the eco-nuclear movement became tainted was perhaps <a href="https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107817">a speech by Margaret Thatcher</a> to the UN general assembly which made the case in 1989, partly to undermine the coal industry as a trade union powerbase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This tale of a 17th-century African female ruler features impressive academics, but they’re drowned out by poor-quality dramatic sequences. It lacks context, analysis or personality</p><p>There was a time, not so very long ago, when Black people rarely featured in period drama or documentary – and even then, only as slaves. Other historical stories from Africa and her diaspora – of scientists, soldiers, philosophers, artists and adventurers – were routinely omitted from our screens. This new docudrama, launched to coincide with US Black History Month, joins the ongoing effort to redress that wrong, with a series on Njinga, the 17th-century ruler of Ndongo and Matamba (in present-day Angola). Stories of other powerful women in the continent are planned to follow.</p><p>African Queens’s production team also includes royalty – Black Hollywood royalty, that is: Jada Pinkett Smith is credited as executive producer and narrator. Although “narration” is a rather grand way to describe her contribution: reading a few lines of scene-setting voiceover at the beginning of each episode.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/15/african-queens-njinga-review-jada-pinkett-smiths-docudrama-is-like-a-mediocre-channel-5-show">Continue reading...</a>
