<p dir="ltr">The second season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a> adds the new Ashika Island map for battle royale and DMZ. This new map also includes a new Weapon Case event for DMZ, and here we guide you through everything you need to know to get all the new rewards.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon Case events explained</h2><p dir="ltr">Ashika Island's DMZ's Weapon Case event works much like the one on Al Mazrah. The event only happens once per match, and it can quickly turn into a chaotic free-for-all, as only one person can claim the reward each game. There are seven unique rewards that can be earned here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to locate and complete the event</h2><figure style="width: 1825px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4100007-dmzashikaislandtacmap.jpg"><img alt="Ashika Island tac map and event location" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394540/4100007-dmzashikaislandtacmap.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Ashika Island tac map and event location</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The event is located at the island's Castle POI, and there's a yellow folder icon with a question mark to highlight the specific area within the castle. Here you'll need to gain access to a locked area and fight through enemies to collect a weapon briefcase. This case then needs to be successfully extracted for you to earn the rewards.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-dmz-how-to-get-all-ashika-island-weapon-case-event-rewards/1100-6511574/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Metroid Prime Remastered Remains A Revelation

<p dir="ltr">Revisiting games you loved as a kid isn't always a pleasant homecoming. The nostalgia might propel you to the end, but it's always possible you'll set the controller down with the realization that one of your favorite games hasn't aged all that gracefully. Rather than being a truly timeless classic, it becomes more of a had-to-be-there experience that's maybe even been rendered somewhat obsolete by newer games that took everything you loved about it and made it better. Thankfully, Metroid Prime isn't one of those games.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Metroid Prime Remastered remains as fresh and inventive today as it did at launch. Despite releasing more than 20 years ago on GameCube, Metroid Prime still has a novel aura about it. Granted, every touchstone in gaming has been subject to imitations, iterative improvements, or spiritual successors. But to this day, I'd argue that not a single game has meaningfully restructured the foundation laid by the Metroid Prime series.</p><p dir="ltr">Certain similarities can be found in first-person immersive sims such as Prey and Dishonored. The interconnected 3D levels of Control, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and the Batman Arkham games have world designs that are somewhat Metroid Prime-like. And BioShock's underwater world of Rapture offers its own take on environmental storytelling inside a perilous world. But none of these games fit cleanly into the Metroid mold.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After starring on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, Bob Odenkirk is working with TV network AMC yet again for a new series called Lucky Hank. The first full-length trailer has now arrived, and it shows Odenkirk's character, an English department chairman named Hank, having what appears to be a mid-life crisis.</p><p>Odenkirk's character is having a tough time. His college is underfunded and his temper is getting him into trouble after his students surreptitiously record him calling his school "mediocrity's capital." A bunch of unfortunate things happen next, including Hank getting smacked in the face by a notebook, the binding rings of which get lodged into his nose. Here's the trailer:</p><div>          </div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-bob-odenkirk-get-a-binder-ring-jammed-through-his-nose-in-first-trailer-for-lucky-hank/1100-6511572/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania is about to set in motion the Marvel Cinematic Universe's wildest story arc yet: that of the multiversal juggernaut Kang the Conqueror.</p><p dir="ltr">Kang is an incredibly complex character, not just in terms of his motivations but also his very existence. He's a paradox, having lived for an eternity and constantly interfering with his own past and future through endless time-travel adventures--many of which apparently involved genocide.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, Kang is not really concerned with the same things normal human beings are. His sights are set a bit higher. And, on some level, he is unknowable. But that's not going to stop Jonathan Majors, who plays the character, from giving it his best shot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jonathan-majors-explains-kang-the-conqueror-without-spoilers/1100-6511573/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>I Am Legend 2, the sequel to the 2007 post-apocalyptic film starring Will Smith, is moving ahead at Warner Bros. Akiva Goldsman, who heads up production company Weed Road, told <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/akiva-goldsman-first-look-warner-bros-deal-constantine-keanu-reeves-i-am-legend-will-smith-michael-b-jordan-sequels-1235260641/">Deadline</a> that the sequel is inspired by HBO's The Last of Us and picks up "a few decades" after the first movie. As confirmed previously, Smith will return alongside Michael B. Jordan.</p><p>"I'm obsessed with The Last of Us, where we see the world just post-apocalypse but also after a 20-30-year lapse. You see how the earth reclaims the world, and there's something beautiful in the question of, as man steps away from being the primary tenant, what happens?" Goldsman said. "That will be especially visual in New York. I don't know if they'll climb up to the Empire State Building, but the possibilities are endless."</p><p>I Am Legend 2 will also take inspiration from the Richard Matheson book. While the theatrical ending of I Am Legend saw Smith's character sacrifice himself for the greater good, I Am Legend 2 picks up the plot from the alternate ending in which Smith survives.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-am-legend-2-moving-ahead-as-writer-talks-last-of-us-inspiration/1100-6511568/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2's</a> first event of Season 3, Ultimate Valentine, has arrived, bringing some new cosmetics, challenges, and game modes to the hero shooter. The event is themed around love, with the main new addition being a Cupid Hanzo skin, equipping the archer with pink arrows. There is also a new browser game, <a href="https://www.loverwatch.gg/en-us">Loverwatch</a>, which is a short dating sim where you can try and romance either Mercy or Genji. Here's everything you need to know about Overwatch 2's Ultimate Valentine event.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Love of Geometry</h2><p dir="ltr">The Love of Geometry arcade mode is a twist on Team Deathmatch. Two teams of four Cupid Hanzos are pitted against each other in a battle to the death. Hanzo's ultimate ability will have a bit of extra visual flair in this mode, but the big draw is the return of Hanzo's old ability, Scatter Arrow. Scatter Arrow lets Hanzo ricochet arrows off any surface, making for some interesting trick shots and a deadly close range ability. While this ability isn't likely to return to regular Overwatch 2 anytime soon, it does let new players see what Hanzo used to be like.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to that, there are a ton of free cosmetic rewards available through event challenges, many of which can be completed in regular game modes. The big reward here is two epic skins, the Ascendant Zenyatta skin and the Bitrate Lucio skin.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ultimate-valentine-event-all-skins-free-rewards-and-special-game-modes/1100-6511569/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The current season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> is now slated to end a few days earlier than planned. Chapter 4 Season 1 of Fortnite will now end on March 8, two days earlier than expected.</p><p>Epic Games took to <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1625919035442438144">Twitter</a> to announce the new end date, but did not specify the reason for the sudden change. Previously, the battle pass page listed the season as ending March 10. To make up for the lost days, players can log in each day starting March 2 to get a boost of Supercharged XP, which drastically increases the amount of XP you earn during each match.</p><p dir="ltr">This change has broken the cadence of the last few Fortnite seasons, where the season would end on a Friday or mid-day on Saturday depending on when the season finale event was scheduled, before starting back up with a new season on Sunday. Now Chapter 4 Season 1 will conclude on a Wednesday, although the exact timing has not been confirmed. Epic Games has also not said if this change will impact the release time of Chapter 4 Season 2, with the start date of the next season not yet confirmed. While it seems unlikely that Epic Games would want Fortnite to be down for maintenance for two extra days, it is a possibility.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-is-ending-a-few-days-early/1100-6511567/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Theatrhythm Final Bar Line Review - Greatest Hits

<p dir="ltr">Since the franchise's introduction in 2012, the Theatrhythm games have masterfully capitalized on the Final Fantasy series' incredible soundtracks. Using a gameplay system that's approachable yet deceptively challenging, while also mixing iconic scenes from past games in the background, the games act as a playable portfolio of FF's most memorable moments. Final Bar Line is speculated to be the final game in the Theatrhythm series, at least for a while, and if that's true, it's an incredible final act.</p><p dir="ltr">Theatrhythm Final Bar Line presents 385 music tracks from across the Final Fantasy spectrum, with a healthy mixture of fan favorites and deep cuts spread out across 29 different categories. After selecting a song, players will press buttons along to its rhythm via three types of notes: red, which requires a single button press; yellow, where a button press is paired with flicking the joystick in a designated direction; and green, which must be held for as long as the green bar is present.</p><p dir="ltr">This traffic light-esque system sounds simple, but it can be downright devilish in practice, especially on higher difficulty levels. Keying in on which parts of the song the notes are corresponding to can be tough, especially with compositions as complex as what longtime composer Nobuo Uematsu and his peers have devised over the years. That said, it's still immensely fun being able to interact with these iconic songs in this way, as I found my whole body moving to the beat while I tapped along on the controller.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/theatrhythm-final-bar-line-review-greatest-hits/1900-6418029/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW Player Reaches Max Level Without Ever Stepping Foot In Starter Zone

<p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> player has taken the art of leveling to new heights, having reached the game's recently increased max level of 70 without ever stepping off the tutorial boat that takes players to the Exile's Reach starter zone.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/world-of-warcraft-player-completes-200-day-grind-to-max-level-without-even-setting-foot-on-the-games-tutorial-island/">GamesRadar</a>, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/10zmgu2/world_first_level_70_on_exiles_reach_starting_ship/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Cheatcho</a> is claiming the title of "world first level 70 on Exile's Reach starting ship." At first glance, the feat sounds absurd. There are no enemies or quests to complete on the ship that takes players to the starter zone. There's not even any herbs to pick or ore to mine, which grant small amounts of experience that have been used by other creative levelers over the years to accomplish "pacifist" leveling runs.</p><div>                </div><p dir="ltr">Cheatcho's not-so-secret-secret is five account-wide pet battle quests. Because these quests are account-wide, they can be done on separate characters, but can be turned in for the rewards on an entirely different character on the same account. By parking five characters at each of the five daily pet battle quest givers, Cheatcho only needs to play for about five minutes a day, completing the quests on each character. Then, all they need to do is log into their boat-bound character to turn the quests in order to earn the maximum experience available while on the boat. As Cheatcho explains, the pet battles themselves are fairly trivial if you have a level 25 Chrominius's pet on your account, which has an arcane explosion ability that can quickly take out all three of each quest giver's pets.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-reaches-max-level-without-ever-stepping-foot-in-starter-zone/1100-6511564/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Apex Legends Season 16 Sees Highest Peak Player Count On Steam Since Season 14

<p>With the launch of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/">Apex Legends Season 16: Revelry</a>, Apex has broken its record for the highest number of Steam users playing the game concurrently, according to<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">Steam's most-played list</a>,<span> where </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a><span> is currently sitting in fourth place. As of today's writing, Apex Legends' peak player count record on Steam has expanded to 610,433, beating its previous record of roughly </span>510,000 players (earned during Season<span> 14's launch). But given the amount of </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-patch-notes-buff-peacekeeper-and-mastiff-add-shiny-gold-shotgun-bolt/1100-6511419/">new content</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-takes-a-swing-at-the-scan-meta-buffs-wraith-and-pathfinder/1100-6511289/">quality-of-life fixes</a><span> Season 16 has introduced to the game, the recent increase in popularity isn't too surprising.</span></p><p>Many reasons may be behind the spike in players. Despite launching over four years ago, Apex Legends has never offered team deathmatch to its players--not even as a limited-time mode. The permanent addition of the mode has players of all kinds excited to try the mode many of them have been waiting for since day one. New modes have been record-breaking in the past as well--the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-sunsets-arenas-adds-tdm-playlists-to-apex-legends/1100-6511167/">now-defunct Arenas mode</a> in Season 9 also surpassed the previous peak player count.</p><p>Respawn is also kicking the season off with a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-fourth-anniversary-collection-event-all-cosmetics-and-rewards/2900-4643/">Anniversary Collection Event</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-gameplay-trailer-reveals-players-can-get-heirloom-shards-soon/1100-6511312/">gives players access to Heirloom Shards</a> if they unlock all 24 cosmetics. Heirloom Shards allow players to purchase any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-heirlooms-guide/1100-6495067/">Heirloom Weapon</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-prestige-bloodhound-skin-everything-you-need-to-know/1100-6500308/">Prestige Skin</a> in the Mythic Store, and are coveted by players due to their rarity. With only one set of Heirloom Shards appearing for every 500 Apex Packs a player opens, the opportunity to purchase them doesn't come around often. The new Collection Event also includes a free reward track that will give players two Anniversary Collection Event Packs, which will unlock two of the 24 items in the collection, saving players $14 USD. It's likely that many players are trying to grind for reward track points to get their hands on those Event Packs as quickly as possible.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-sees-highest-peak-player-count-on-steam-since-season-14/1100-6511563/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>PUBG: Battlegrounds' new update has launched on PC, and with it comes a snow-covered version of Vikendi where you can find bears and a new thermal scope.</p><p>Vikendi's bears can be found hibernating in caves, guarding precious loot. You can enter into their caves at your own risk, as bears will attack if you enter within range. Vikendi's snowy makeover is complete with an aurora borealis and a moonlit landscape, though this variant appears randomly. You can also pick up a 4X Thermal Scope to spot enemies in the darkened and sometimes blizzard-ridden Vikendi.</p><p>After community feedback, Deston is returning to the Normal Match and Ranked Match random rotation in North America. In the meantime, the map Taego will be out of Normal Match random rotation. Season 22 is also starting, which means player-rank will be reset and you will receive rewards based on which rank you hit last season.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-battlegrounds-season-22-adds-polar-bears/1100-6511565/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## A Major Free Update Just Made This Game From 2021 A 2023 GOTY Contender

<p dir="ltr">No one would've guessed Hitman would go the way of the roguelite 24 months after its World of Assassination finale debuted, but an even bigger surprise is just how great the free update actually is. While roguelite fans are probably willing to give a new entry to the genre a try, I worry that, for others, the word "roguelite" may be enough to stop reading and shrug off the new Freelancer mode. But this would be a mistake, because Freelancer Mode pushes Hitman to new heights. We loved Hitman 3 so much that we named it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-games-of-2021/">best games of 2021</a>. Since then, we've continued to enjoy a long run of post-launch updates. In a surprising twist, the most recent addition has reimagined an already exceptional trilogy, making it a game of the year contender <em>again</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">In Freelancer, Agent 47's mission is to eliminate members of The Syndicate, a shadowy cabal whose function in the story is simply to give the bald assassin a renewed excuse to globetrot and hunt down the world's most wicked billionaires. The story-light mode consists of 18 missions in a single successful campaign, including four showdowns with bosses along the way. Fail any two missions, or one boss mission, and it's back to the start.</p><p dir="ltr">Each chunk of locations is pre-selected by you in groups of three, four, or five as you progress, so you'll want to lean into the levels you know well. For me, that's places like Paris, Sapienza, and Dartmoor, and less so stuff like Haven Island, New York, or the newest map, Ambrose Island. You can't handpick every level; instead, you select from established sets of levels. The tactical advantage comes in finding a group that has more of your favorites than not. This familiarity is key because so much else in Freelancer depends on variables that are beyond your control.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-major-free-update-just-made-this-game-from-2021-a-2023-goty-contender/1100-6511560/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Rian Johnson's Peacock Whodunit Poker Face Renewed For Season 2

<p dir="ltr">Peacock has announced that Poker Face, the streaming service's star-studded mystery-of-the-week series starring Natasha Lyonne, has been renewed and will return for a second season. Season 1 premiered in late January and quickly secured <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/poker_face/s01">a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"Poker Face is one of those rare, undeniable shows that we all fell in love with from the start, but the critical acclaim and viewer response has been beyond our wildest dreams," NBCUniversal executive Susan Rovner said in a release. "Working alongside the creative genius of Rian Johnson, Natasha Lyonne, and Ram Bergman, along with our partners at MRC and T-Street, has been a spectacular ride, and we can't wait to hit the road for another season as we continue to build momentum across Peacock's originals slate."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In Poker Face, Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who "has an extraordinary ability to determine when someone is lying. She hits the road with her Plymouth Barracuda and with every stop encounters a new cast of characters and strange crimes she can’t help but solve." Lyonne is joined by an impressive group of guest stars that include Adrien Brody, Chloë Sevigny, Ellen Barkin, Hong Chau, Jasmine Aiyana Garvin, Jameela Jamil, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Judith Light, Nick Nolte, Rhea Perlman, Ron Perlman, S. Epatha Merkerson, Stephanie Hsu, Tim Blake Nelson, and Tim Meadows. Season 2 will no doubt try to outdo or at least match this impressive roster. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rian-johnsons-peacock-whodunit-poker-face-renewed-for-season-2/1100-6511557/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Apex Legends' New Weapon, Nemesis, Was Stolen From Rampart

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> Season 16: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">Revelry</a> launched yesterday, and with all of the game's new features--including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">TDM</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-new-character-classes-explained/1100-6511265/">new legend class system</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-patch-notes-buff-peacekeeper-and-mastiff-add-shiny-gold-shotgun-bolt/1100-6511419/">firing range makeover</a>--it can be easy to miss the little things. But a detail in one of the transition screens from the Season 16 battle pass provides an interesting look at the history of Apex's newest weapon: the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-is-finally-getting-a-new-gun/1100-6511170/">Nemesis</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nemesis is an assault rifle that uses energy ammo and has a unique spin-up mechanic that increases the rate of fire the longer you shoot. But unique gameplay features aren't the only feature that makes the weapon stand out--it's also got an interesting backstory that ties into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rampart-guide-apex-legends/1100-6501990/">Rampart</a>'s past. Even more curious is the fact that the weapon's design was stolen, not an original creation. But to understand the full story of the Nemesis, you have to take a look at previous events.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she joined the Apex Games in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-6-new-character-rampart-announ/1100-6480651/">Season 6</a>, Ramya "Rampart" Parekh was a member of The Sisters, a gang underground of weapon-modders. Presumably operating out of Gaea (homeworld of Rampart, Caustic, Crypto, and Storm Point), The Sisters gang is run by a crime boss known only as Big Sister. But as seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Pmf9AB4Mo">Rampart's episode</a> of Stories From The Outlands, it appears that Rampart eventually left the gang, choosing instead to open her own weapon modding business.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-new-weapon-nemesis-was-stolen-from-rampart/1100-6511558/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A big new Xbox firmware update is out now, and the big ticket feature is the highly touted "carbon aware" power management changes.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-will-now-default-to-energy-saving-option-as-microsoft-looks-to-reduce-carbon-footprint/1100-6510478/">As announced previously</a>, this new update makes every Xbox console default to the energy-saving option as part of Microsoft's push to reduce its carbon footprint overall. This will reduce console power consumption when the console is off. This won't affect performance or how updates can install overnight. However, the ability to remotely wake your console in the energy-saving option is not supported. Consoles in energy-saving mode boot more slowly, too.</p><p>All of this is optional. Players can go into the settings and opt for "Instant On" option to boot their console faster, though this uses 20X more energy, according to Microsoft.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-now-the-first-carbon-aware-console-with-february-update/1100-6511550/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>There are numerous collectibles found all over the game world in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.

Thankfully, navigation is a lot easier this time. That's because, once revealed, these pages do appear on the world map.

<p>Stuffed animals and plushies are arguably one of the most universally loved gifts on the planet. That’s especially true during these cold winter months, as there’s nothing better than hitting snooze and snuggling up with your ultra-soft friend. However, the best plushies on the market are typically ultra-expensive, making it difficult to stockpile a small army of loveable squishes. </p><p>That’s not the case this month, as from now until February 28 you can cash in on a <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-11557364?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.entertainmentearth.com/s/tomy-promo/s">Buy One Get One</a> </span>40% Off Sale that features plushies from Mario, Kirby, Zelda, and other hit video games.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-11557364?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.entertainmentearth.com/s/tomy-promo/s">Shop the sale at Entertainment Earth</a> </div></div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-bunch-of-gaming-themed-plushies-are-on-sale-right-now/1100-6511552/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Hogwarts Legacy - All 55 Hogsmeade Field Guide Pages

<p>There are countless collectibles scattered all over the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. One particular type, the Field Guide Pages, will have you searching every nook and cranny of the only wizarding village in England. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you find all 55 Field Guide Pages in Hogsmeade.</p><h2>Collecting the Hogsmeade Field Guide Pages</h2><p>The Hogwarts Legacy Field Guide Pages in Hogsmeade can be obtained by using Revelio (i.e., in case a page is transparent and stationary), or Accio (i.e., in case it's flying around an area). While the premise of collecting 55 pages might be daunting at first glance, the process is a lot easier compared to, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-field-guide-pages-castle-guide/1100-6511492/">looking for those in the castle</a>. The reason for this is due to Hogsmeade's layout. Instead of winding corridors and secret passageways, we can divide Hogsmeade into interior and exterior locations.</p><p>However, do take note that some areas won't be accessible from the get-go. For instance, the Spintwitches Broom Shop won't be open until you reach a main quest where you need to buy a broom. Meanwhile, some rooms are locked, and you'll have to learn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-how-to-unlock-doors-and-chests/1100-6511253/">Alohomora</a> via a main quest as well. As such, it's often advisable to start collecting only once you've progressed further in the campaign. Likewise, we advise you to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-moth-mirror-puzzle-guide/1100-6511449/">Moth Mirrors guide</a>, as each puzzle you complete rewards you with a Field Guide Page.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-hogsmeade-field-guide-pages/1100-6511531/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Lightning Port on iPhones might become a relic of the past, as USB-C is looking like a real possibility for Apple’s eventual 2023 release.

<p>Square Enix has confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII DLC for Powerwash Simulator will officially release on March 2 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-is-cleaning-up-final-fantasy-7-in-next-crossover-dlc/1100-6511003/">Announced earlier this year</a>, the add-on developed by Futurlab for its relaxing grime-fighting simulator will take players to the streets of Midgar where they'll be tasked with completing some tough and <em>filthy </em>levels.</p><p>Only a few teasers were given during the initial reveal, but Square Enix has expanded on what you can expect when this free DLC launches. Five levels set above and below the plate of Midgar will be available, as Don Corneo's lackeys, Professor Hojo's "specimens", and Heidegger's rampaging tech have made a huge mess that needs cleaning up.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4099589-powerwashff7%281%29.jpg"><img alt="The Mako energy exhibit in Powerwash Simulator" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4099589-powerwashff7%281%29.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The Mako energy exhibit in Powerwash Simulator</figcaption></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4099590-powerwashff7%282%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4099590-powerwashff7%282%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4099591-powerwashff7%283%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4099591-powerwashff7%283%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4099592-powerwashff7%284%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4099592-powerwashff7%284%29.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>There's even a new dirt-type to deal with, bio-residue, which you'll find in these new levels.

## The Word "Zombie" Was Not Allowed On Set Of The Last Of Us, Apparently

<p>According to a cinematographer working on HBO's The Last of Us, the word "zombie" was banned from the set of the TV series. Eben Bolter, who is responsible in part for the show's absolutely stunning visual imagery, said in an interview that the word "zombie" was banned on set because The Last of Us universe doesn't have zombies--the humanoid enemies are instead known as Infected.</p><p>"It's not a cliché zombie movie, it's not Hollywood backlit where everyone's close-up is perfect. It's a world of organic cinematic naturalism, and that's something I could just feel," Bolter told <a href="https://www.motionpictures.org/2023/02/the-last-of-us-cinematographer-eben-bolter/">The Credits</a>. "We weren't allowed to say the 'Z word' on set. It was like a banned word. They were the Infected. We weren't a zombie show."</p><p>The "Infected" in The Last of Us are humans who have been <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Cordyceps_brain_infection">infected by a Cordyceps fungal disease</a>. The fungus infects the brain of its host and gives them traits and characteristics associated with the traditional "zombie."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-word-zombie-was-not-allowed-on-set-of-the-last-of-us-apparently/1100-6511540/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With its release just days away, Sony has provided a detailed teardown of PSVR 2 and its accompanying Sense controllers. Similar to how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-official-teardown-video-gives-great-view-of-internals/1100-6483012/">internal hardware of the PS5 was shown off</a> before it launched in November 2022, the pair of videos uploaded by Sony goes into deep detail about the structure and internal workings of the virtual reality headset.</p><p>In the first video, presented by Takamasa Araki from the mechanical design team, the PSVR 2 headset is pulled apart and the engineer explains how Sony aimed to develop a well-balanced and symmetrical internal structure that could be used to deliver a comfortable gaming experience. Araki also added that the headset is developed to be light and compact while maintaining a high-functioning and sturdy structure.</p><div>          </div><p>The second video is hosted by Takeshi Igarashi from the peripheral design team, and dives into several interesting facts about the Sense controller. Designed to resemble a sphere, the Sense controller was an interesting combination of challenges for the developers to tackle. Not only did it need to look like a controller designed for the PS5 console, it also had to build on the haptic feedback ideas introduced by the DualSense controller and provide intuitive motion controls for VR gaming.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psvr-2-teardown-videos-reveal-the-guts-of-sonys-new-hardware/1100-6511535/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going big with its tiniest heroes, as Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania opens in theaters on February 17. The stakes are higher than ever for Scott Lang, and with Kang the Conqueror making his triumphant debut in the MCU, the third Ant-Man film has loads of narrative weight to bear on its shoulders as it paves the way for the future of Marvel movies.</p><p>Directed once again by Peyton Reed and reuniting Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lily, Michael Douglas, and Michele Pfeiffer, early reviews for Quantumania paint the film as being typical of the Marvel formula: big special effects scenes, a charismatic villain in the form of Jonathan Majors' Kang, and lots of foreshadowing in the background that help create a safe but generic MCU movie.</p><p>"In our reality, Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania is the most generic Marvel movie imaginable, smoothing over every edge that might alienate viewers until anything of substance has been expunged," Phil Owen wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-review/1900-6418027/">Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania review</a>.

The actor said at the World Government Summit in Dubai this week that he is more interested in playing and promoting his Luther character.</p><p>"You know, a lot of people talk about another character that begins with 'J' and ends with 'B,' but I'm not going to be that guy. I'm going to be John Luther.

<p>Game Freak is going to continue making games outside of Pokemon, according to new developer statements. In an interview with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/02/14/pokemon-studio-game-freak-pocket-card-jockey">Axios</a>, Pocket Card Jockey director Masao Taya stated that the team believes "it is very important for the studio to continue making and releasing titles outside of the Pokémon series.” While the studio's output has been very Pokemon-focused since Red and Blue's release, Game Freak has also released a fair amount of games outside of that. In recent years, Game Freak has developed Little Town Hero and Giga Wrecker.</p><p>Most recently, Game Freak put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pocket-card-jockey-coming-to-apple-arcade/1100-6510249/">the Apple Arcade exclusive remake of Pocket Card Jokey</a>, subtitled Ride On! This version added 3D races, updated visuals more generally, and changed some of the rule set. Taya directed both versions.</p><p>The complexity of putting out Pokemon titles almost every year has made it difficult to make games without external support. In the interview, Taya said, “In recent years, the resources needed for game development have grown and grown, so Development Department One has been trying out a style of development where it works with external studios.” On Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On, Game Freak worked with Infiniteloop Co. and Pixyda.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-freak-wants-to-make-more-games-besides-pokemon/1100-6511526/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
