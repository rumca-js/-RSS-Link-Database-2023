It still does, although there are places where you would be hard pressed to see it, places where it wobbles, turns a corner or generally behaves in a most un-Roman manner.

Although apparently direct and uncomplicated, her paintings of people alone, of couples and families and mothers and children, not only unpick the dynamics between her sitters but also their complicity with the artist. In her long career, she painted everyone from black radicals, academics and intellectuals to Latin American families and kids in Spanish Harlem. She left most of her painting of a black conscript unfinished when he went off to Vietnam, in the hope of his return (he did come back, but never sat for her again). She painted New York\u2019s bohemia, art critics and lovers. She painted demonstrations and street life, police violence against strikers, a young man stricken with tuberculosis, celebrations and poverty.</p><p>When a couple of agents from the FBI came knocking on the artist\u2019s door in the 1950s, Neel asked if they would sit for her. They declined. Who, even an uptight Fed, wouldn\u2019t want to be painted by Neel? Her painted encounters distilled her subject\u2019s eagerness to please, their self-consciousness and their pleasure in being painted by this redoubtable, unshockable woman.
