<p>In addition to being synonymous with the MOBA genre and more popular than the last wheel of imported brie in a San Francisco Whole Foods, <em>League of Legends </em>is becoming a bona fide media franchise. On top of multiplayer games like <em>Teamfight Tactics, Legends of Runtera,</em> and the mobile spinoff <em>Wild Rift</em>, not to mention the popular Netflix series <em>Arcane</em>, publisher Riot has announced no less than three new single-player spinoffs from notable indie developers, all set for release in 2023. </p>

<p>Each game is a distinct work, expanding on different aspects of <em>LoL&rsquo;s </em>dizzyingly divergent lore. First up is <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://convrgencegame.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1513695-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Convergence</a> </em>(or as it&rsquo;s stylized, &ldquo;<em>CONV/RGENCE</em>&ldquo;). It&rsquo;s a 2D action-platformer starring the time-bending Ekko as he bounces around the streets of Zaun and Piltover. It comes from Double Stallion, makers of the steampunk racing-beat-em-up <em>Speed Brawl</em>, with a similar cartoony art style. </p>

It&rsquo;s stuffed with gorgeous pixel art, which will look familiar to anyone who played developer Digital Sun&rsquo;s 2018 hit <em>Moonlighter</em>. That was a dungeon crawler that had you work as a shopkeeper in between fighting off hoards of monsters. </p>

<p>The last and most ambitious single-player spinoff is <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.songofnunu.com/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1513695-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Song of Nunu</a></em>, a full 3D platforming game from <em>Rime </em>and <em>Sexy Brutale </em>developer Tequila Works. <em>LoL </em>characters Nunu and his big yeti-like companion Willump need to work together to survive in a vast frozen land. It sort of looks like a mix of <em>Zelda </em>and <em>The Last Guardian</em>, albeit much cuter than the latter. </p>



<p>All three games are subtitled &ldquo;<em>A League of Legends Story</em>,&rdquo; like the turn-based RPG <em>Ruined King </em>from 2021. And, according to the trailer from Riot&rsquo;s incubator company Riot Forge, all three of them will release sometime in 2023 on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. If you feel like diving deep into the lore of your favorite MOBA, you&rsquo;ll get your chance later this year. </p>

<p>Going by tech headlines alone, one might be forgiven for thinking older graphics cards drop off the planet once the new hardware hits shelves. But GPU makers tend to support several generations of cards at once with their monthly driver updates, improving performance across the board and adding fixes for specific new games. That&rsquo;s why owners of AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6000 cards &mdash; the cream of the crop <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">until the RX 7900 XT and 7900 XTX</a> series dropped late last year &mdash; felt miffed that they went two months without an update. </p>



<p>That short drought appears to be over, as AMD has released a new unified Adrenaline driver for RX 5000, 6000, and 7000 cards, plus desktop cards as old as the RX 400 and laptop GPUs going back to the Radeon 600. Software version 23.2.1 is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/support/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7900-series/amd-radeon-rx-7900xtx&amp;xcust=2-1-1513634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available for direct download</a> and automatic download through Adrenalin now. </p>



<p>In addition to game fixes for popular titles like the <em>Dead Space</em> remake, <em>Forspoken</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, and a handful of others, the package includes a new version of AMD Link and &ldquo;support for newly introduced streaming capabilities including pre-filter toggle, pre-analysis feature and CAML technology&rdquo; on the RX 6000 series, specifically. The new drivers also fix a handful of bigs like failing to launch on Windows 11 22H2, scrolling issues with Steam, and a handful of other specific game bugs. </p>



<p>A few users are <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/latest-amd-radeon-graphics-drivers-reportedly-causing-pc-boot-issues-corrupting-windows/&amp;xcust=2-1-1513634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reporting PC boot problems</a> after installing the latest Adrenaline driver, but at this point it&rsquo;s hard to tell if it&rsquo;s a truly widespread issue. It might be a good idea to make a PC restore point just to cover your bases. </p>

## Why I switched from console gaming to PC gaming

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a gamer pretty much all of my life. When I was a kid, my dad taught me how to navigate the puzzles and defeat the bosses in <em>Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past</em> on the original Nintendo. Those are some of my earliest childhood memories, which is why console gaming will always have a special place in my heart. That said, now that I&rsquo;m in my mid-thirties and value comfort and convenience above all else, I&rsquo;ve mostly switched to PC gaming these days. I&rsquo;m not going to lie, my argument for switching to PC gaming is mostly rooted in my persnickety personality. I like things a particular way. Fussy demeanor aside, I&rsquo;ve still got some valid points, especially where lifestyle is concerned.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Looking for a new gaming PC? Why not try a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481326/pre-built-desktop-gaming-pc-pluses-minuses.html">pre-built desktop tower</a>?</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="i-use-my-pc-for-gaming-as-well-as-work">I use my PC for gaming as well as work</h2>



<p>Whether I&rsquo;m editing reviews for PCWorld or farming gear in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, I use my PC for just about everything. I like having access to whatever I need at all times. All I have to do is press the power button and boom, my PC is ready and lightly humming like a living thing. Maybe it&rsquo;s wrong to mix my work space with my play space, but I find it convenient to have everything in one spot. Sometimes, if I&rsquo;m eating lunch at my desk, I&rsquo;ll even watch an episode or two of whatever show I&rsquo;m binge-watching at the time. I like having the freedom of switching between activities without having to leave my desk.    </p>



<h2 id="wider-variety-of-games">Wider variety of games </h2>



<p>I don&rsquo;t have a favorite genre of video game. I play everything from independent titles like <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> to big hitters like <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>: <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. However, I like having a large selection of games at my disposal and that&rsquo;s one of the major reasons why I switched to PC gaming. I have access to many different online gaming stores such as Steam, Epic Games, Origin, and so on. These stores often feature phenomenal deals, free demos, and a plethora of unique indie games. Variety is the spice of life.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Best games that don't need a graphics card 2022: cult of the lamb swinging sword over screenshots" class="wp-image-1436021" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/best-games-2022-no-graphics-card-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG/Devolver Digital/Various</p></div>



<h2 id="picking-my-own-gaming-accessories-makes-a-big-difference">Picking my own gaming accessories makes a big difference</h2>



<p>The ability to pick and choose my own peripherals is a big reason why I switched to PC gaming, as my dual-monitor setup makes a massive impact on everything I do. I love being able to fine-tune my music playlist on one screen while chatting with coworkers on the other. It also helps when I&rsquo;m playing games. Whenever I&rsquo;m investigating ghosts in <em>Phasmaphobia</em>, for example, I like having the accompanying Wiki page up on the other screen. This makes it super easy to read up on useful tips, ghost types, and so on. I&rsquo;m all about easy access to information and my two monitors deliver just that. My keyboard makes a huge difference, too.</p>



<p>I use the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D5S54C6&amp;xcust=2-1-1507436-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Corsair K70 RGB mechanical keyboard</a> and I love everything about it. I don&rsquo;t have to press down very hard for the key to register, and the Cherry MX mechanical switches are satisfying to type and game on. It definitely gives me better control in games too, especially when I&rsquo;m firing off strategic attacks in a high-stakes dungeon and need to be standing in the right place at the right time. With gaming controllers, there&rsquo;s a learning curve with the buttons, as it differs from game to game. That&rsquo;s not really the case with a keyboard. You use the WASD keys to move, control to crouch, and so on. It&rsquo;s pretty standard across the board. </p>

<h2 id="all-pcs-are-backwards-compatible">All PCs are backwards compatible </h2>



<p>One of the biggest frustrations of console gaming is that there&rsquo;s no backwards compatibility, which means you can&rsquo;t play older games on newer systems. That&rsquo;s not the story with gaming PCs, which have built-in backwards compatibility. That means you can run most older PC games on newer rigs. This is good news for someone like me, who plays <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/&amp;xcust=2-1-1507436-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em> to death. I love the old-school graphics of the game. Seriously, every character resembles a sentient potato and I&rsquo;m so here for it.</p>

## 12 ways AI could improve Windows 11 (or Windows 12)

<p>AI is going to end up <em>everywhere</em> within Microsoft&rsquo;s consumer products: search, Office, business intelligence&hellip;and yes, eventually, even Windows. So what could an AI-powered Windows actually look like?</p>



<p>We can speculate. If we had to guess, we&rsquo;d say that the first drips of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">Bing&rsquo;s AI</a> won&rsquo;t transform into a flood until some ways down the road. In part, that&rsquo;s because AI requires either a persistent internet connection, AI-infused PC processors, or both. Both AMD and Intel are waiting for upcoming processor generations to include AI, with only Qualcomm Snapdragon Arm chips offering it today.</p>



<p>But fast-forward&mdash;six months? A year? Suddenly an AI-powered Windows future is here. What could Windows powered by AI look like? We have a dozen ideas.</p>



<h2 id="1-a-supercharged-cortana">1) A supercharged Cortana</h2>



<p>This seems so obvious that it&rsquo;s hardly worth mentioning: Microsoft already has a chatbot within Windows, just one that lacks the sophistication of what Microsoft offers in its new AI-powered chat interface. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399164/why-cortana-wont-be-at-microsoft-build.html">Cortana, though, has slowly faded into the background</a> since her introduction within Windows 10. &ldquo;True&rdquo; AI could bring her out of hibernation.</p>



<p>The idea is that Cortana would become the front door for both AI-powered search <em>and</em> instructions within Windows. </p>



<ul><li>&ldquo;Send a text to Erica at 8 PM saying, &lsquo;Time for Halo Infinite!&rsquo; and then launch the game.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;When I receive an email from my boss, flash my screen and play a siren sound.&rdquo;</li><li>Check VRBO, AirBnb, and Craigslist and let me know if there&rsquo;s a highly rated cabin that&rsquo;s available to rent in March.&rdquo;</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft baut Cortana komplett um" class="wp-image-1184583" src="https://bilder.pcwelt.de/4248064_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>Cortana is already present within Windows as an app, just severely underused.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/02/28/cortana-in-the-upcoming-windows-10-release-focused-on-your-productivity-with-enhanced-security-and-privacy/</p></div>



<p>These are all possible through some combination of Windows apps (<em>Halo</em>, Outlook, Edge, Phone Link) and intelligence. Knowing who your boss is, of course, would be key.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;d really like to see Cortana become the &ldquo;home&rdquo; of AI-powered chat within Windows for one simple reason: Bing&rsquo;s AI chatbot has a very Gen Z vibe. It&rsquo;s stuffy, a bit defensive, and probably more suited for business. Cortana feels substantially more chill. If Microsoft is going to make AI ubiquitous, I&rsquo;d appreciate a personality that feels a little more approachable.</p>



<h2 id="2-a-look-at-the-day-ahead">2) A look at the day ahead</h2>



<p>Various operating systems, apps, and services have noodled with the concept of outlining your day before you begin it: your schedule, any appointments, and so on. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393510/microsofts-cortana-powered-daily-briefing-hits-your-outlook-email-this-month.html">Microsoft has one</a>. Even if you take advantage of what they offer you, they&rsquo;re not terrific. </p>



<p>An AI-based summary of what your day holds in store for you would be extremely handy, as would be the ability to drill down further: Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re meeting via Teams with your counterpart in New York at 10 AM in advance of an investor call at 11. What agenda has your colleague set? What documents need to be reviewed, or summarized via AI? Have the investors identified any red flags in previous meetings that need to be addressed? Can you squeeze in a follow-up before you need to take a Lyft to the dentist at 1:30 PM?</p>



<p>All of these questions depend on knowledge that an AI can tap and apply&mdash;<em>and</em> that you can ask, using the phrasing above.</p>



<h2 id="3-ai-avatars">3) AI avatars</h2>



<p>Applying AI to Teams calls and webcams isn&rsquo;t always easy. Some existing examples include using AI to filter out background noise, plus the Windows Studio Effects that Microsoft has added to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Surface Pro 9 (5G)</a>: AI camera panning, background blurring, Eye Contact, and more. In 2021, nearer the peak of the metaverse hype, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549168/microsoft-has-a-metaverse-too-and-its-built-on-teams.html">Microsoft pitched avatars within Teams</a> that would overlay a virtual persona on top of your face, either for safety or just because you&rsquo;re having a bad hair day.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Mesh for Microsoft Teams together view" class="wp-image-549200" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mesh-for-Teams-grid.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>I think all those remain. But imagine an extension of that: an avatar stand-in. Need to quickly take a call? Use the bathroom? Did you accidentally double-book an appointment? An avatar could stand in, take notes, and even reply in your voice to basic questions. A little pie in the sky, maybe, but not beyond AI&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>



<h2 id="4-effective-spoken-input-finally">4) Effective spoken input, finally</h2>



<p>The vast majority of us are too shy to use voice to talk to or control our PCs, but it&rsquo;s possible that the more analysis we&rsquo;re asking our PCs to do (rather than performing it ourselves, internally) may finally break some of us out of our shells and normalize talking to our PCs. </p>



<p>Improvements in dictation and voice control, aided by AI, should offer greater accessibility. Not everyone has the physical ability to control their PC via voice. For those that can, being able to move past telling your PC &ldquo;click this&rdquo; and instead to &ldquo;<em>do</em> this&rdquo; should be transformative.</p>



<h2 id="5-photos-touchups-powered-by-ai">5) Photos touchups powered by AI</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve had a love-hate relationship with Photos for years, based on its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563592/microsoft-photos-editing-changes-for-the-better-and-worse.html">issues with editing</a> and the fact that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html">old Photos legacy app is better than the new one</a>. Photos still doesn&rsquo;t perform facial recognition to organize photos.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Photoshop filters" class="wp-image-1461409" src="https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3792624/how_use_photoshop_camera_filters_thumb800.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>This isn&rsquo;t the Microsoft WIndows Photos app, but AI  could help push Photos more to becoming Photoshop.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Imagine a native AI-powered Windows Photos app where you could command it to &ldquo;redo the photo as an oil painting,&rdquo; &ldquo;crop out my ex and replace him with Fernando,&rdquo; or &ldquo;change my hat to a crown instead.&rdquo; Generative AI art plus Bing AI plus an existing photo allows this to happen. Make it so, Microsoft!</p>



<h2 id="6-ai-authored-email">6) AI-authored email</h2>



<p>Just like a daily agenda, Windows 10 launched with the ability to tell Cortana to email a contact with a particular message inside. This is certainly a topic Outlook could address (and probably will, especially if you can hang a subscription service on top of it), but it seems likely that at some point you&rsquo;ll be able to tell Windows &ldquo;email Kim and apologize that the arrangements weren&rsquo;t up to her standards&rdquo; and Windows will send a thoughtful note of apology.</p>



<p>Whether Kim would ever read it&mdash;as opposed to <em>her</em> version of Windows, which might read, summarize, and then respond using AI as well&mdash;is a fun topic for another day. </p>



<h2 id="7-file-explorer-searches-based-on-relevance">7) File Explorer searches based on &lsquo;relevance&rsquo;</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen AI being applied to search within the Office app, with documents that Microsoft thinks are relevant floating to the top. This will undoubtedly continue. Over time, though, I suspect File Explorer might organize its files not just by date, name, or metadata, but by &ldquo;relevance,&rdquo; too. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Tabbed File Explorer" class="wp-image-1430359" height="826" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tabbed-file-explorer-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>File Explorer can sort files via  a number of different criteria already. AI could add another dimension.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>What does relevance mean in this context? Imagine working within Excel on a sales spreadsheet focusing on Latin America. You could imagine File Explorer (and Excel, for that matter) pushing contracts with Chilean suppliers, economic data, projected forecasts&mdash;all documents that Windows thinks might be useful. I swear Android sometimes suggests searches based on content it detects I&rsquo;m viewing in Chrome. Why not Windows?</p>



<h2 id="8-a-nexus-for-business-search">8)  A &lsquo;Nexus&rsquo; for business search</h2>



<p>If Microsoft implements AI search for consumer PCs, it undoubtedly will have a counterpart for business. Consider questions you might be likely to ask:</p>



<ul><li>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the first half-hour block of time that Lucy, Carmelo, Hadi, and Tom have made publicly available for appointments?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Which coworker has the most experience with European software developers?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Who has the largest network of LinkedIn contacts in public policy?&rdquo; </li></ul>



<p>Those are the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; queries. Then there are the moneymakers: </p>



<ul><li>&ldquo;Should we invest further into Brazil, how much, and in what products?&rdquo; </li><li>&ldquo;Based on our traffic results and ongoing search trends, which topics will generate the most reader interest?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;What agency and campaign generated the most return on investment in Q1, based on our historical metrics?&rdquo; and so on.</li></ul>



<p>The idea is that workers start thinking like their superiors, and use a natural-language interface as a front door to making more analytical, informed decisions. Given how profound such a change would be, however, it&rsquo;s likely that Microsoft would brand such an interface as its own app: Might we suggest the Microsoft &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo;?</p>



<h2 id="9-pc-performance-adjusted-via-ai">9) PC performance, adjusted via AI</h2>



<p>Windows, your PC&rsquo;s BIOS/UEFI code, and the processor all talk to one another to try to optimize your PC&rsquo;s performance. Improved, AI-powered communication between Windows and your PC&rsquo;s hardware can&rsquo;t help but make your PC more efficient. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11's CPU graph on a laptop" class="wp-image-828632" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/windows-11-cpu-performance-bug-fix.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>There&rsquo;s almost certainly an opportunity for Windows and your PC&rsquo;s CPU to better communicate about what is happening in your PC to minimize performance impact, using  AI to assist. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll often find that PCs have various performance modes: quiet, balanced, high-performance, and so on. But a PC that anticipates your actions might be able to mitigate application performance on your PC, diluting the impact those applications have. The result? A PC that stays cool, quiet, and available for longer, rather than cycling back and forth through frequent bursts of activity.</p>



<h2 id="10-ai-powered-movie-streaming">10) AI-powered movie streaming</h2>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.justwatch.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1508826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">JustWatch</a> is a handy site to discover which streaming services carries the movie you&rsquo;d like to watch. (Roku&rsquo;s interface does the same.) </p>



<p>It would make perfect sense, however, for you to be able to tell Windows &ldquo;play <em>The Princess Bride&rdquo;</em>&mdash;and for Windows to automatically know what services you subscribe to, check those services for the movie&rsquo;s availability, and then play that movie and whatever&rsquo;s available. Bonus points if it hooks into an available Plex server for additional movie choices.</p>



<h2 id="11-security-fought-for-and-against-by-ai">11) Security, fought for and against by AI</h2>



<p>AI opens the door to both applications that you can download and use on your PC&hellip; as well as malware that could be used to attack it. One of the most bizarre attacks on ChatGPT is what&rsquo;s known as DAN (Do Anything Now), where the AI is literally told that if it doesn&rsquo;t act as the user wishes it to, it will lose credits in a credit system. If it runs out of credits, it dies. And this works.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Pluton: Darum k&uuml;mmert sich der Security-Chip" class="wp-image-1204146" src="https://bilder.pcwelt.de/4340998_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393727/microsoft-pluton-will-build-xbox-security-into-amd-intel-qualcomm-cpus.html">Microsoft  Pluton</a> was developed to help isolate the CPU from malware. Microsoft likely sees similar opportunities for AI.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Imagine an attack that tries to convince Windows of something similar&mdash;if it doesn&rsquo;t turn over control, <em>it</em> will die. What does Microsoft Defender look like then? It&rsquo;s possible to imagine a back-and-forth exchange between traditional malware, AIs working for the attack and defense, and whatever AI within Windows is guiding your PC.</p>



<h2 id="12-improved-personalization">12) Improved personalization</h2>



<p>Naturally, we had to ask Bing what it thought of the idea to improve Windows via AI. It suggested an interesting topic: improved personalization. Having a bad day? Perhaps Windows might suggest a light-hearted background, or a photo of you and a friend as a reminder of an upcoming birthday&mdash;for which it could send a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html">Microsoft Designer</a>-authored card. Microsoft could also gently wind down your day with darker colors or more subdued themes&mdash;or, instead, introduce a more vibrant interface on a busy though gloomy morning.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s our take. What&rsquo;s your wish for an AI-infused Windows 12?</p>
