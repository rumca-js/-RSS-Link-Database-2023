Depending on the complexity of the question users may have to visit multiple websites, then sift through that collected information and stitch it together into a cohesive idea before evaluating it.</p><p>\u201cThat's more work than having a model that hopefully has read these pages already and can synthesize this into something that doesn't currently exist on the web,\u201d <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brendan-dolan-gavitt\">Brendan Dolan-Gavitt</a>, Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at NYU Tandon, told Engadget. \u201cThe information is still out there. It's still verifiable, and hopefully correct. But it's not all in place.\u201d</p><p>For its part, Google\u2019s vision of the AI-powered future has users hanging around its search page rather than clicking through to destination sites. Information relevant to the user\u2019s query would be collected from the web, stitched together by the language model, then regurgitated as an answer with reference to the originating website displayed as footnotes.</p><p>This all sounds great, and was all going great, right up to the very first opportunity for something to go wrong. When it did. In its inaugural Twitter ad \u2014 less than 24 hours after debuting \u2014 Bard, Google\u2019s answer to ChatGPT, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html\">confidently declared</a>, \u201cJWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.\u201d You will be shocked to learn that the James Webb Space Telescope did not, in fact, discover the first exoplanet in history.

Search has always been a bit of a crapshoot, ever since the early days of Lycos and Altavista. \u201cWhen search was released, we thought it was \u2018good enough\u2019 though it wasn't perfect,\u201d Singh recalled. \u201cIt would give all kinds of results. Over time, those have improved a lot. We played with it, and we realized when we should trust it and when we shouldn\u2019t \u2014 when we should go to the second page of results, and when we shouldn't.\u201d</p><p>The subsequent generation of voice AI assistants evolved through the same base issues that their text-based predecessors did. \u201cWhen Siri and Google Assistant and all of these came out and Alexa,\u201d Singh said, \u201cthey were not the assistants that they were being sold to us as.\u201d</p><p>The performance of today\u2019s LLMs like Bard and ChatGPT, are likely to improve along similar paths through their public use, as well as through further specialization into specific technical and knowledge-based roles such as medicine, business analysis and law. \u201cI think there are definitely reasons it becomes much better once you start specializing it. I don't think Google and Microsoft specifically are going to be specializing it too much \u2014 their market is as general as possible,\u201d Singh noted.</p><p>In many ways, what Google and Bing are offering by interposing their services in front of the wider internet \u2014 much as AOL did with the America Online service in the \u201890s \u2014 is a logical conclusion to the challenges facing today\u2019s internet users.</p><figure><img alt=\"REDMOND, WA. - FEBRUARY 7: Washington Post reporter Geoff Fowler asks a Microsoft spokesperson questions about the new, AI-powered Bing search during a demo at the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., on Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2023.

We are seeking some information, eventually to act on that information,\u201d Singh argues. \u201cIf we think about that as the role of search, and not just search in the literal sense of literally searching for something, you can imagine something that actually acts on top of search results can be very useful.\u201d</p><p>Singh characterizes this centralization of power as, \u201ca very valid concern. Simply put, if you have these chat capabilities, you are much less inclined to actually go to the websites where this information resides,\u201d he said.</p><p>It\u2019s bad enough that chatbots have a habit of making broad intellectual leaps in their summarizations,  but the practice may also \u201cincentivize users not go to the website, not read the whole source, to just get the version that the chat interface gives you and sort of start relying on it more and more,\u201d Singh warned.</p><p>In this, Singh and Dolan-Gavitt agree. \u201cIf you\u2019re cannibalizing from the visits that a site would have gotten, and are no longer directing people there, but using the same information, there's an argument that these sites won't have much incentive to keep posting new content.\u201d Dolan-Gavitt told Engadget. \u201cOn the other hand the need for clicks also is one of the reasons we get lots of spam and is one of the reasons why search has sort of become less useful recently. I think [the shortcomings of search are] a big part of why people are responding more positively to these chatbot products.\u201d</p><p>That demand, combined with a nascent marketplace, is resulting in a scramble among the industry\u2019s major players to get their products out yesterday, ready or not, underwhelming or not. That rush for market share is decidedly hazardous for consumers. Microsoft\u2019s previous foray into AI chatbots, 2014\u2019s Taye, ended poorly (to put it without the white hoods and goose stepping). Today, Redditors are already jailbreaking OpenAI to generate racist content. These are two of the more innocuous challenges we will face as LLMs expand in use but even they have proven difficult to stamp out in part, because they require coordination amongst an industry of viscous competitors.</p><p>\u201cThe kinds of things that I tend to worry about are, on the software side, whether this puts malicious capabilities into more hands, makes it easier for people to write malware and viruses,\u201d Dolan-Gavitt said. \u201cThis is not as extreme as things like misinformation but certainly, I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to make spam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of the thinking around safety so far has been predicated on this idea that there would be just a couple kinds of central companies that, if you could get them all to agree, we could have some safety standards.\u201d Dolan-Gavitt continued. \u201cI think the more competition there is, the more you get this open environment where you can download an unrestricted model, set it up on your server and have it generate whatever you want. The kinds of approaches that relied on this more centralized model will start to fall apart.\u201d</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-ai-will-change-the-way-we-search-for-better-or-worse-200021092.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-15 20:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's iRobot purchase reportedly faces EU investigation", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/politicians-want-ftc-to-oppose-amazon-irobot-acquisition-144534035.html\">American politicians</a> may not be the only government figures concerned about Amazon's proposed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-buys-irobot-roomba-creator-122257453.html\">acquisition of iRobot</a>. <em>The Financial Times</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b05a1260-ee5a-4ac8-9a34-31cdb8104cf1\">sources</a> claim European Union regulators are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b05a1260-ee5a-4ac8-9a34-31cdb8104cf1\">grilling</a> Amazon ahead of a &quot;likely&quot; official investigation.

There\u2019s more space to peruse notifications, calendar entries and more, too  \u2013 it can be a finickity task on the Z Flip 4. Oppo offers a handful of pre-programmed replies too, so you can subtly (or lazily) send a response without even opening the Find N2 Flip.</p><p>You can quick-launch the camera by double-pressing the volume down button \u2013 you just need to make sure the phone is in standby, otherwise, it will just lower the volume. The cover screen also features a cute animated animal mascot \u2013 you can pick between a dog, cat, an unidentifiable bird, hamster or rabbit \u2013 and they\u2019ll come alive when you activate the front display. It's a cute addition \u2014 it'd be nice if there was some Tamagotchi-style features, though, perhaps tagged to your step-count or even the device's battery life.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the quirks of a flip smartphone is the fact that the primary cameras are also your selfie cameras.  Like the bigger, China-only,  Find N2 Fold, the array on the Flip consists of a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera, with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera. That\u2019s a higher-res main sensor compared to the Z Flip 4. However, while testing it out for the week, the most noticeable difference has been a 2X zoom toggle, which is admittedly a digital crop \u2013 but still, it's a benefit of having such a high-megapixel sensor to begin with.</p><section><img alt=\"Three shots from the Find N2 Flip. At wide (x0.5), x1 and x2 zoom settings.\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ef107f10-ad2e-11ed-9ef5-c5ac624eb07f\" /></section><p>Another benefit of the more expansive front screen is that you can turn on the preview mode even while someone is taking photos for you, making it easier to ensure that a stranger has managed to fit everyone into your group pic \u2013 or ensure they aren\u2019t capturing video instead of a still image. (That has happened to me.) Oppo\u2019s Hasselblad partnership informs its color calibration choices on the cameras again. If you like peppy color filters (I do), you\u2019ll get a handful of these straight from the camera app.</p><p>Unfolded, there\u2019s also a 32-megapixel f/2.4 front-facing camera if you\u2019re feeling a little old-fashioned.  Like Samsung\u2019s foldables,  some apps will adjust to fit if you position the phone with the screen raised at an angle. These include the camera app as well as video call apps and YouTube. The hinge itself isn\u2019t quite as stiff as the Z Flip, so it\u2019s more liable to collapse to flat, but once you figure out the right angle, you\u2019ll be fine. Oppo says the hinge\u2019s range of motion is between 45 and 110 degrees.</p><p>The company is also proud of its subtler crease, and that\u2019s down to a more refined hinge. It claims that its second-generation flip phone has a crease that\u2019s 63 percent less visible \u2013 which is\u2026 <em>specific</em>. It\u2019s easy to scoff because, well, it\u2019s still <em>there</em>, but it\u2019s definitely smoother compared to the flip phones that came before it. Oppo\u2019s new Flexion hinge is also smaller, and its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-china-101211924.html\">waterdrop design</a> leaves less space between the sides when it\u2019s closed. This is especially notable compared to the Z Flip 4.</p><figure><img alt=\"Oppo Find N2 Flip hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/7bef17f0-ad27-11ed-bf9b-de9243fe117c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another area where Oppo has made a wise upgrade is when it comes to battery capacity. The Find N2 Flip has a 4,300mAh cell \u2013 the biggest we\u2019ve seen so far in this form factor, and closer to the Z Fold 4 than the Z Flip 4 \u2013 along with 44W fast charging support. That\u2019s decent, again, for this form factor, but Oppo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-as-we-knew-it-is-dead-heres-what-next-133017093.html\">sibling/cousin/frenemy</a>, OnePlus, is already showing off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-review-price-release-date-cameras-150015371.html\">more typical smartphones with support for 100W</a>. Still, it should fully charge in less than an hour, the company claims. (I'll be updating this story after further battery testing). However, just like OnePlus\u2019 latest phone, there\u2019s no wireless charging.</p><p>The device will launch in Astral Black and Moonlit Purple and in the UK, it will be priced at \u00a3849 (roughly $1,018), which would put it around the same price as the Galaxy Z Flip 4. For now, there are no plans to bring either Find N2 devices to the US.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-hands-on-fixing-the-foldables-shortcomings-150021728.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-15 15:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Traeger's redesigned Ironwood grills pack touchscreen controls and more efficiency", "description": "<p>When Traeger overhauled <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/traeger-timberline-2022-smart-grills-announced-price-specs-163043089.html\">its Timberline pellet grills</a> last year, the company undertook a complete redesign of its flagship model. It introduced a truckload of new features that made cooking on and cleaning the grills much easier. Today, Traeger revealed a retooled version of its Ironwood series, the WiFi-connected pellet grills that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-24-traeger-ironwood-650-review-wifi-pellet-grill-smoker.html\">sit in the company's midrange</a>. While it did bring a lot of the upgrades from the new Timberline to these more affordable options, there are still premium tools reserved for the more expensive model.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the Ironwood is now equipped with a touchscreen controller like the Timberline. This display puts critical information in an easier to read format on the grill. Of course, the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-15-traeger-wifi-grills-pro-series-ironwood-timberline.html\">WiFire tech</a> is onboard as well, allowing you to control and monitor the Ironwood from anywhere via <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/traeger-grills-app-redesign-video-guides-personal-customization-191141115.html\">the Traeger app</a>. This includes adjusting grill temperature, monitoring food temperature, setting alerts/timers and watching pellet supply levels (there's a dedicated pellet sensor). You can also control Ironwood and other Traeger grills <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-trager-grills-alexa-voice-control.html\">with Alexa</a> or Google Assistant if you'd rather go the hands-free route. The app is a wealth of culinary knowledge with over 1,600 recipes and cooking guidance from the company's pros. Like previous Traeger pellet grills, the new Ironwood is capable of everything from low-and-slow smoking to high-heat searing, including baking, roasting, braising and grilling.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Inside, Traeger has taken steps to make the new Ironwood more efficient. The company says its Smart Combustion tech \"maintains incredibly precise temperatures\" while an EvenFlow heat shield evenly distributes heat over the entire cooking area. There's also an insulated double wall construction to help prevent unwanted fluctuations in temps. The combination of Traeger's existing Super Smoke mode and its Downdraft exhaust system keep wood smoke circulating around the cooking chamber. Plus, the company says its FreeFlow firepot now assists with that task of keeping smoke moving during a cook.&nbsp;</p><p>On the bottom, the so-called EZ-Clean grease and ash keg that debuted on the Timberline is here as well, sending both liquid run-off and pellet debris to one place for easy removal and cleaning. Like the Timberline, the pellet hopper is cleaned out from the front on the new Ironwood, making it much easier to swap out pellets between cooks when you need to switch to a different variety.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll notice the most difference between the Ironwood and Timberline on the outside. Not only do the grill lids have a different look, but the Ironwood keeps the four-leg base Traeger grills traditionally have. The new Timberline sits on more of a cart, with an enclosed cabinet, casters and small exterior shelves. What's more, the Timberline has an induction burner on the left side where that area on the Ironwood is just a shelf. The Ironwood does offer Traeger's ModiFire system of accessories though, thanks to a \"Pop-And-Lock (PAL)\" rail that allows you to snap on an assortment of shelves, storage bins, tool hooks and more \u2014 and it allows you to position those items exactly where you need them. The Ironwood only comes with two wired food probes where the Timberline ships with a set of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/traeger-grills-wireless-meat-thermometer-meater-acquisition-183944452.html\">Meater wireless probes</a>. However, you can purchase them separately as the Ironwood does support them.

This morning, the studio announced it will release not one but three games from its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-06-riot-games-riot-forge-league-of-legends.html\"><ins>Riot Forge publishing label</ins></a> before 2024. The slate opens with <em>The Mageseeker</em>: <em>A League of Legends Story</em>, a new action RPG from <a href=\"https://www.digitalsungames.com/\"><ins>Digital Sun Games</ins></a>, the studio behind 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/\"><em><ins>Moonlighter</ins></em></a>. <em>The</em><em>Mageseeker</em> casts you as Sylas, everyone\u2019s favorite rogue Damacian mage, as he attempts to lead a revolution against the kingdom that imprisoned him. Riot is billing the game as a \u201c2D hi-bit\u201d title, meaning it features a pixel art style that takes advantage of modern rendering techniques. Judging from the trailer Riot shared, <em>The</em><em>Mageseeker</em> looks like it draws inspiration from games like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hyper-light-breaker-announcement-trailer-201547113.html\"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Titan Souls</em>. It will arrive this spring on PC and consoles.</p><div id=\"734c86d4274f4ca39a1d612308af94e1\"></div><p>Sometime this summer, Riot will then release <em>Convergence: A League of Legends Story. </em>Double Stallion, a Montreal-based studio that\u2019s best known for its work on <a href=\"https://dblstallion.com/games/speed-brawl/\"><em><ins>Speed Brawl</ins></em></a>, has been working on the game since at least 2019. It stars Ekko, one of the <em>League</em> champions who makes an appearance in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html\"><ins>Netflix\u2019s </ins><em><ins>Arcane </ins></em><ins>animated series</ins></a>, in a 2D action platformer. This being a game about Ekko, expect to use time manipulation to solve some of the challenges and puzzles <em>Convergence</em> throws at you.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Lastly, there\u2019s <em>Song of Nunu</em>: <em>A League of Legends Story</em>. This spinoff comes courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-03-rime-tequila-works-nintendo-switch.html\"><em><ins>Rime</ins></em></a> creator <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tencent-tequila-works-160733677.html\"><ins>Tequila Works</ins></a> and will arrive sometime in the fall. Of the three games that Riot shared release dates for today, <em>Song of Nunu</em> is probably the one I\u2019m most excited to play since Nunu and Willump are such a loveable pair<em>&nbsp;</em>and Tequila Works has a consistent track record. Both <em>Convergence</em> and <em>Song of Nunu </em>will be available to play on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store when they arrive later this year.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-mageseeker-is-a-league-of-legends-rpg-from-the-studio-behind-moonlighter-140016250.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-15 14:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple's MLS Season Pass will stream games in 1080p", "description": "<p>Apple already announced a lot of the details on its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-mls-season-pass-launch-120017178.html\">MLS Season Pass</a>, the company's biggest entry into live sports streaming yet. However, the company and the league still had a few details they hadn't yet revealed. As the start of the new season draws closer, the two collaborators <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/apple-and-major-league-soccer-unveil-live-event-production-plan-and-talent-pairi\">announced more info today</a>, including streaming and audio quality in addition to scheduling, the number of games and studio show formats</p><p>In what will be a disappointment for some, Apple will stream every game in 1080p. That's the same quality the company offered for its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball-181930932.html\">weekly Major League Baseball games</a> last year. However, it's an improvement for MLS as every game wasn't available in 1080p previously. The plan is to have more cameras on the field at each match, so despite a lack of 4K, the comprehensive nature of the visuals should be better than what fans are used to seeing. All MLS regular season and Leagues Cup matches will also be streamed with Dolby 5.1 audio as well as alternate broadcast options like local radio.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>One key thing that will be a welcome change for MLS fans is that the league has standardized game start times and scheduling. With a few exceptions, games will be on Saturday or Wednesday nights and they'll start at 7:30PM local time. There are some Sunday matches scheduled and a few afternoon games, but since MLS is dealing primarily with one broadcaster now, it had the ability to make things a lot easier to follow. Fans can expect at least 13 matches every Saturday or Wednesday night and they'll start at one of four times: 7:30PM Eastern, Central, Mountain or Pacific.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple TV MLS Season Pass\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/a5e0e6d0-a1d1-11ed-affb-91a77d59eaa2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>This schedule change also makes it easier to plan studio programming. Apple and MLS will offer three options: a preview show (<em>MLS Countdown</em>), a post-game show (<em>MLS Wrap-up</em>) and continuous &quot;whiparound&quot; coverage for the entire five hours games take place (<em>MLS 360</em>). A typical Saturday will begin with <em>MLS Countdown </em>30 minutes prior to the east coast games kicking off. There will also be 15-minute installments of <em>Countdown </em>before the Central, Mountain and Pacific time zone matches begin. During the entire night, <em>MLS 360 </em>will offer coverage of key moments (goals) as they happen with live look-ins of in-progress matches with studio commentary. Finally, <em>Wrap-up </em>will air when all the games have concluded as a recap of all of the day's action.</p><p>In total, Apple and MLS will offer up almost 1000 games through Season Pass. That's every regular season game, the All Star Game and MLS Cup playoffs. Then there's the 77 matches of the Leagues Cup that will include every team from MLS and Mexico's Liga MX (group stage and knockout rounds). Season Pass will also stream 250 live MLS Next Pro matches from league-affiliated development teams, including playoffs and the championship game. There will also be over 100 games from the MLS Next youth level, some of which are tournaments or qualifying tournaments, with MLS club academies on display here.&nbsp;</p><p>As Apple has said before, MLS Season Pass will be available everywhere you find the Apple TV app. That includes the web, Apple TV (4K, HD and 3rd generation), iPhone, iPad and Mac as well as Samsung, Vizio, LG, Sony, Panasonic and Hisense smart TVs. You'll also find it on Roku, Fire TV, Android TV and Google TV streaming devices and it's available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Comcast in the US, Sky in the UK, Free in France, Magenta TV in Germany and B TV in Slovakia are TV providers that offer access.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2023 season starts February 25th, but MLS Season Pass has already launched. There's plenty of on-demand content to prepare you for the season if you want to sign up now. The streaming plan costs $15 per month or $99 for the season. If you're an Apple TV+ customer, you'll get the discounted rates of $13/month or $79 a season. There will be a number of free games during the season, including every match on opening weekend.

But now that the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html\"><ins>PlayStation 5</ins></a> is more widely available (kind of), the company is finally ready to show the world what it can do. While the $200 DualSense Edge costs a bit more than its rival, it offers a few nifty features you don't get on Microsoft's controller, combined with one potentially major shortcoming.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>For the Edge, Sony didn't stray much from its default template. From the top, the Edge looks almost exactly the same aside from a black D-pad and face buttons and a black touchpad adorned with a subtle pattern featuring the company's signature \u25b2 \u25a0 \u25cf and \u2716 icons. Where things get interesting is when you notice the two little nubs that stick out below the analog sticks, which are function buttons reserved for changing your controller's button assignments.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Can you tell which one is which? Hint: the Edge is on the right.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/6f0b5b70-aca5-11ed-bbfa-e700a30b4ab5\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>In back, there are two switches on either side next to the shoulder triggers for adjusting their pull length, along with slots to accommodate the gamepad's removable rear paddles. The controller comes with two sets of rear paddles: longer, more traditional levers and short stubby half-domes, the latter of which ended up being my favorite. You also get a total of three different joystick nubs (standard, short-stemmed convex and long-stemmed convex) that can be swapped out on the fly, and a cable lock which can prevent the included USB-C cord from getting pulled out by accident.</p><p>Both the thumbsticks and the rear paddles attach magnetically, which makes it super simple to test out different layouts before finding a combo you like. The long-stemmed domed thumbstick can be helpful for snipers in shooting games, especially if you prefer playing at lower sensitivities. But I was less concerned with trying to get an edge than I was with making the controller as comfortable as possible.</p><figure><img alt=\"The back of the DualSense Edge features switches for adjusting the pull length of the triggers and magnetic slots for accommodating the controller's rear paddles. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/958731c0-aca5-11ed-a6ee-f9052724731e\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the Edge's highlight features are those fully replaceable analog sticks. By sliding the release toggle in back, the shroud around the analog sticks lifts off, revealing removable modules that attach via USB-A and can be changed out in seconds. This means when you start to experience some controller drift (which you will, given enough wear and tear), you can simply buy replacement thumbstick modules that cost $20 each. For hardcore gamers that put in hundreds or thousands of hours into their consoles, this can represent huge savings over time. If one joystick starts to get a bit wonky, just switch it out, or replace both sticks at the same time and get almost a brand-new gamepad.</p><p>Finally, to round everything out, the Edge comes with a hardshell carrying case that looks and feels like an extra-large space egg. It has a lightly padded interior and a small mesh pocket for any additional accessories you might need (like the included charging cable). There's also a nifty velcro pass-through flap in back that allows you to route a cord inside so you can charge the controller while it remains tucked safely inside the case.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt=\"In the PS5's settings menu, you can easily do stuff like remap the Edge's buttons or create a number of quick presets. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d85fed20-aca5-11ed-b7fa-aef57eb56256\" style=\"height: 2160; width: 3840;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another big advantage the Edge has over rivals (especially third-party offerings like <a href=\"https://scufgaming.com/playstation5-scuf-reflex\"><ins>Scuf's Reflex</ins></a>) is the ability to set custom button configurations. The PS5 supports four quickset options and has the ability to save even more in settings. Switching layouts takes less than a second and is as simple as pressing either one of the function buttons and one face button at the same time. I also appreciate that the PS5 pops up a simple walkthrough on how to set everything the first time you connect the controller. And whenever you want to revisit your button presets, all you have to do is open the console's settings menu.</p><p>Other handy features include the ability to customize your joystick sensitivity, adjust their deadzone and even set the actuation point for the triggers. So depending on your preferences, you can tell the controller to ignore shallow pulls to avoid inadvertent presses. This also works in conjunction with the slider on the back of the controller which can change the physical travel distance of the triggers to three distances (short, medium and long), which is nice when switching from a racing game, where you want the full analog feedback, and an FPS, when you want a real hair trigger setup.</p><h2>In-game</h2><figure><img alt=\"Unlike the standard version, the DualSense Edge features a couple of small design tweaks including a black D-pad, black buttons, and a black touchpad with a subtle PlayStation icon pattern. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/0f1311d0-aca6-11ed-97ff-25d2e007741c\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>When you get around to actually using the Edge, gaming with it almost feels like having a Swiss Army Knife. Sure, it looks and feels like a standard DualSense, but when you run into an awkward situation, the gamepad always seems to have a solution. For example: Some of my first console shooters were <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/goldeneye-007-nintendo-switch-xbox-release-date-144644341.html\"><em><ins>Goldeneye</ins></em></a> on the N64, so I've always preferred what gamers often call a Southpaw joystick setup, which means aiming with the left joystick and moving with the right. Unfortunately, not every shooter supports this layout. But with the DualSense I can use it in whatever game I want.</p><p>Additionally, while the DualSense's deep triggers are great for racing games, that long pull is kind of annoying in fighters or beat 'em ups like <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>. But simply by moving the toggles in back, I can significantly shorten the pull, making things feel snappier and more responsive.</p><figure><img alt=\"A highlight feature on the DualSense Edge is replaceable joystick modules that can be swapped out for just $20. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/4f498400-aca6-11ed-9d59-8a23a630985d\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now I should mention that some other premium controllers like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-white-140019249.html\"><ins>Xbox Elite Series 2</ins></a> offer multiple D-pad options, but in my opinion, both of them are worse than Sony's arrow-shaped version. And while I'll probably never use the cable lock, I can see it being useful in tournament settings where you want the confidence of a wired connection but don't want to worry about your USB cable getting yanked out by accident.</p><p>My one small complaint is that I wish you could assign custom actions to the little function nubs. Right now they're dedicated to switching button presets and there's no way to change that, which seems like a bit of a waste. There are two nubs, at least let me use one of them as an extra button, especially since I feel like they're in the perfect location for launching grenades in shooters.</p><h2>Battery Life</h2><figure><img alt=\"While it may not be an important feature to everyone, the DualSense Edge comes with a cable lock that can be used to ensure its USB cord isn't yanked out by accident. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/8b07db90-aca6-11ed-bfcf-d564f20a063c\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The DualSense Edge's biggest weakness is its battery life, which is somehow worse than the standard PS5 controller. On average I was getting around five to six hours of use on a single charge, compared to six or seven for the regular DualSense. And that's just frustrating because not only does the Edge cost more than twice as much, the type of people that would pay big money for a premium controller are also quite likely to engage in marathon gaming sessions. And there are few things more annoying than having to scramble for a USB cord when your controller dies in the middle of the firefight. Thankfully, the Edge comes with a lengthy 10-foot USB cable, so even if it runs out of juice, you'll probably still be able to plug it in and have the cable reach your couch.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"At $200, Sony's DualSense Edge is the company's take on a premium gamepad for the PS5. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/8500ce70-aca4-11ed-bf7b-8996e2b0b336\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>While the idea of paying $200 for a fancy controller might seem like a bit much (and it kind of is), after using the DualSense Edge I can see the appeal. It offers a familiar design with a handful of extra features including easy button remapping, multiple joystick nubs, customizable rear paddles and more. And the Edge is actually a tiny bit cheaper than some third-party options like those from Scuf, which doesn\u2019t have replaceable joystick modules. Its short battery life is definitely a downer and I would have liked to see Sony include support for a second pair of paddles in back, like you get on of other premium gamepads. But if I had to choose just one controller to use with my PS5 until it dies, the DualSense Edge would be it.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/playstation-dualsense-edge-review-sonys-pricey-but-powerful-sidekick-for-the-ps5-130041956.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-15 13:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Amazon still plans to 'go big' on grocery stores", "description": "<p>Despite recently saying it would lay off more than 18,000 people, Amazon is still looking to expand its empire \u2013 which could mean more physical stores.

As a result, over 90 percent of Musk's 128.9 million followers saw his tweets, and even those who don't follow the Twitter owner kept seeing his posts on their timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>While Musk didn't speak at length about the issue, he did acknowledge the change in his own way, specifically by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1625368108461613057\">posting the &quot;forced to drink milk&quot; meme</a>. He also asked people <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1625407245218648065\">to stay tuned</a> while Twitter made adjustments to the &quot;algorithm&quot; (his quote, not ours) after users started complaining of seeing all Elon all the time. &quot;Adjustments&quot; reportedly didn't mean removing his advantage completely, though: according to <em>Platformer</em>, Elon's tweets are still artificially boosted, but by a factor less than 1,000. Bottom line, users will still see his tweets a lot, unless they choose to move over to the Following tab instead.&nbsp;</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-artificially-boost-elon-musk-tweets-053602807.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-15 05:36:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
