The student, a gender-fluid lesbian, also brought their gang of furry friends. Under the school's bathroom policies, students are permitted to use the bathroom of their choice. </p><p>Well, the high school of that same school district has now voted on a \"compromise\" to revise these controversial policies. What's that? Just make girls use the girl's bathroom and boys use the boy's? Oh no, that's far too simple. No, instead, Milford High School decided to ban urinals. For some reason. </p><p>They also decided to ban shared spaces in <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ymca-locker-room-speaks-out\" target=\"_blank\">locker rooms</a>, which makes slightly more sense than the urinals, but still less sense than simply not allowing males in female spaces and vice versa. </p><p>The decision caused about 150 students to walk out in protest last Friday, with some decrying the alleged discrimination against LGBTQ students and others saying they didn't want men in the women's bathroom. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cStudents at a Milford, New Hampshire school stage a walkout after the school board bans urinals in school bathrooms to protect trans students from \"harm.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Catch Up (@Catch Up)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1625943597345562625\">1676490136</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There was a separate proposal on the table for students to use the bathroom according to their biological sex. But that one was apparently too hateful. So now no one gets urinals. </p><p>The urinal proposal would also require students to change for gym class in bathroom stalls instead of open locker room spaces. This means only eight girls and three boys can change at a time. And installing stalls instead of urinals would cost tens of thousands of dollars, according to the Superintendent. As someone whose high school gym classes were made up of 50+ kids, I could see how this would be a <em>bit</em> problematic. </p><p>It's almost like there's an extremely simple solution to this problem that was widely accepted as normal until about seven years ago when the world lost its mind because of one very orange man. But sure, let's ban urinals. Why not. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/high-school-compromise-urinals", "date_published": "2023-02-15 22:24:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Big Red monster goes on the rampage against Walter at school and everyone's wondering what Walter did", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33034696&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C59%2C0%2C59\" /><br /><br /><p>Poor Walter. He woke up expecting carpe the f*ck out of this diem. Instead, he finds himself hiding in a classroom and pulling the door closed for dear life. Big Red Hannah was pissed and on a rampage.

Like most of the internet, I have questions.</p><p>All we know is that Hannah is cross with Walter.

It's all <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@the_frugal_adventurer/video/7200132494404947243\" target=\"_blank\">anyone is talking about in the comment section</a>:</p><p>\"I'm here.

I\u2019m scared for Walter did he make it out alive?\"</p><p>We may never know what Walter did. Perhaps he deadnamed Hannah, but if that were the case the teacher would let Hannah beat Walter to death with his own shoes in the name of tolerance. Walter could owe Hannah money from the Super Bowl. It would have been a rookie mistake. Never take a bet with a woman big enough to look like she eats people your size for breakfast.</p><p>Or, it could have been something as simple as unrequited love. Hannah asked Walter to Winterfest '23. Walter isn't into Hannah like that. Hannah in a fit of rage decides if she can't have Walter, no one can.</p><p>Whatever is causing the drama, we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website ask everyone to keep Walter in your prayers.
