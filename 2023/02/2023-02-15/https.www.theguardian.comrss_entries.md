<p>Comments by You actor Penn Badgley are the latest in a conservative move away from celebrating eroticism on-screen</p><p>Twitter may be slowly decaying, but it still finds a way to generate a minor sex panic. The latest micro-iteration blazing through one corner of the pop culture sphere: Penn Badgley, best known for playing Dan Humphrey on Gossip Girl and as the star of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/09/you-season-four-review-penn-badgleys-frothy-thriller-is-awful-and-hugely-entertaining">You</a>, said that he no longer wished to act in sex scenes, citing fidelity to his wife. According to his podcast, Badgley asked You showrunner Sera Gamble for<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2023/02/13/penn-badgley-you-netflix-sex-scenes-podcast-cp-orig-kj.cnn"> </a><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/penn-badgley-less-sex-scenes-you-season-4-1235322600/">a reduction in intimate scenes in the show’s fourth season</a>, which premiered last week; his character, the disarmingly bookish serial killer/love addict Joe Goldberg, still has sex in the new season but less so than in prior ones, and fully clothed.</p><p>Specific contractual clauses regarding intimacy on camera are not new – Julia Roberts is one of many actors who’ve said they’ll <a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/julia-roberts-i-won-t-do-nudity-202541">never do on-screen nudity</a>, for example. And Badgley is certainly entitled to his own boundaries. (A new <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/penn-badgley-you-season-4-blake-lively-surviving-gossip-girl-1235521142/">Variety story</a> connects his reluctance to film intimate scenes to his feelings of discomfort as a child actor.) But a segment of the Twittersphere’s extension of his personal logic into an argument against sex on-screen in general, and the conflation the professional performance of intimacy with individual fidelity, feels disturbingly puritanical. Some have expressed distaste at any on-screen nudity, or asserted that most sex scenes are gratuitous, unnecessary and rife with issues of consent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/15/sex-scenes-penn-badgley-denial-basic-desire">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Labour and antisemitism: two cheers for Keir Starmer | Editorial

<p>Putting right the wrongs committed under Jeremy Corbyn should not mean ditching every advance made between 2015 and 2020</p><p>By any yardstick, it has been a huge turnaround. Just over two years ago, the Equality and Human Rights Commission concluded an investigation into Labour and antisemitism that found the party was responsible for “unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination”, while the leadership was guilty of “serious failings”. It was a terrible moment for a party that often lays claim to being a champion of equality. On Wednesday, the EHRC took Labour out of special measures, saying it was satisfied that the party had done what was necessary “to protect current and future … members from discrimination and harassment”.</p><p>Much of the credit goes to Keir Starmer, who became Labour leader shortly after that report and who promised in his acceptance speech to “<a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/read-in-full-sir-keir-starmers-victory-speech-after-being-named-new-labour-leader" title="">tear out this poison [of antisemitism] by its roots</a>”. He was right to take such a strong stance, just as Jeremy Corbyn was wrong in his initial response. Mr Corbyn has a formidable record fighting against racism and in speaking up for many persecuted peoples, but in this case he was too slow and too defensive. To show how much better he was than some of his critics allowed, he should have tried harder to engage with their criticisms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-antisemitism-two-cheers-for-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

## Decades on, I am still traumatised by my visit to the school toilets

<p>The first time I tried to use a cubicle, my classmates did their damnedest to put me off. Even now communal loos are a no-go area</p><p>It was at primary school that going to the toilet became a big issue for me. I had never used one of the cubicles before, but the moment came when home time was too far away for me to wait. I had to go. I must have been breaking new ground in my year group because the moment I shut the door my classmates were clambering up to look down, and getting down to look up, over and under the partitions, to see what I was up to. I don’t know whether this happened at all schools, or, indeed, whether it happened to anyone but me at my school, but I inadvertently caused a sensation. Word went out in the playground: “Eggy’s having a poo!” Eggy was my nickname. Long story; let’s not go there.</p><p>More pupils streamed into the toilets to climb and crawl to a vantage point. Needless to say, I couldn’t go. I gave up and the crowd dispersed. I told the teacher what had happened – Mrs Dalman, I believe. She said the other children were very naughty and it wouldn’t do. Back to the toilet I went, escorted by Mrs Dalman who, to my dismay, stood guard outside the cubicle door while I struggled within. It was no good; again I couldn’t go. I told her I had, but I hadn’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/decades-on-i-am-still-traumatised-by-my-visit-to-the-school-toilets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘The man was tenderly caring for his sick partner, and a smartly dressed woman walked past them, totally oblivious’</p><p>I spent my early adulthood in South Africa during the apartheid era. In 1974, the government passed a law stipulating that all lessons for black children had to be in Afrikaans, which most could not speak, and which was considered the language of the oppressor. By 1976, Black schoolchildren took to the streets of Soweto to protest and were met with police violence, with over 176 deaths. It was then that the tide turned, the protest movement grew and people worldwide became more aware of the injustices of apartheid.</p><p>Sensing the country was on the cusp of change, I went out to try to photograph what was happening around me. I was in my early 20s and working for a company that printed magazines, so I’d take my own pictures at weekends. I’d had no photographic training and because I could hardly afford film, I bought bulk reels of black and white, which were cheaper. I had to limit the number of exposures I could make due to the cost, and used cat litter trays for developing the silver gelatin prints.</p><p>South Africa in the 1970s: Photographs by Steve Bloom<em> </em>is at <a href="https://www.leicestermuseums.org/South-Africa-1970s">Leicester Museum and Art Gallery</a> until 14 May</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/15/pictures-like-this-meant-i-couldnt-return-to-south-africa-until-apartheid-was-abolished-steve-blooms-best-shot">Continue reading...</a>

The waves come choppy, clean, short, thick, fast, chest high and occasionally over my head. On this frigid day I’m encouraged to surf with a longboard, and I’ve almost forgotten to don my cap. The wind greets my face and I howl in return, grateful. I look around after finishing my ride and see people simmering in joy. These are the scenes at New York’s Rockaway Beach, a harbor for Black surfers.</p><p>Coming from the security of snow-blanketed mountain peaks to the crashing, storm propelled waves of the east coast, I’ve stumbled on a dynamic community of surfers: artists, activists, community leaders, film-makers, and creatives.

## Ukrainian composer Heinali on preserving the sound of Kyiv: ‘I wanted to protect my city from harm’

<p>The field recordings on Kyiv Eternal, released exactly a year on from Russia’s invasion, document ‘a world that has disappeared’, the artist explains</p><p>The latest album by Heinali is a rather beautiful piece created from field recordings made around his home city – recordings from rail stations, the sound of traffic and birdsong, the dripping of water in a tunnel, the rumbling of trains on a track, the babble of voices in a shopping mall – all sliced up, manipulated, accompanied by synthesisers and transformed into a piece of compelling ambient music. What transforms this niche arthouse project into an urgent piece of work is the fact that the city in question is Kyiv. “These are recordings of a world that has disappeared,” says Heinali, AKA Ukrainian musician Oleh Shpudeiko. “The album documents a city that has changed for ever.”</p><p>The album, Kyiv Eternal, was completed after the Russian invasion, but the project dates back more than a decade. “I bought myself a handheld digital tape recorder in 2012 and started to record sounds around Kyiv,” says Shpudeiko. “I had hundreds of these sound sketches on my hard drive when I had to flee the city in February last year.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/15/ukrainian-composer-heinali-on-preserving-the-sound-of-kyiv-i-wanted-to-protect-my-city-from-harm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pacific island nation will qualify for first World Cup if they win two playoffs and manager Spencer Prior is not wasting a minute</p><p>Two games of football – that is what it will take for Papua New Guinea to make history. As they take the field in New Zealand this week for the World Cup intercontinental playoffs, two wins would see the Pacific island nation reach its first World Cup.</p><p>The journey has been far from easy. The national team did not play a match from July 2019 until April 2022 but with New Zealand co-hosting the tournament this July and August, PNG seized the opportunity to qualify by winning the Oceania Nations Cup last July. Since then, results have slid, with Nicola Demaine losing her job as manager and little to no football played over almost three months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/15/how-papua-new-guinea-are-preparing-for-historic-shot-at-world-cup-glory-moving-the-goalposts">Continue reading...</a>

## Sylvia review – storming show sets suffragettes to soul, funk and hip-hop

<p><strong>Old Vic, London</strong><br />Historical characters bust contemporary dance moves while the troubled relationship between Sylvia Pankhurst and her mother Emmeline is laid bare<br /></p><p>So many shows seem to want to be the new Hamilton.

It carries the same revisionism and irrepressible energy, its cast boasting Hamilton alumni too, even if it feels self-consciously fashioned around Lin-Manuel Miranda’s concept.</p><p>Dynamically directed by Kate Prince, it has been long in the making, staged as a work-in-progress in 2018, and its polish shows. History of the women’s suffrage movement is set to hip-hop, rap, soul and funk. The music by Josh Cohen and DJ Walde is rousing and adrenalised, the book (by Prince with Priya Parmar) accompanied by its beat and often half sung.</p><p><a href="https://www.oldvictheatre.com/stage/event/sylvia">Sylvia is at the Old Vic, London</a>, until 8 April.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/15/sylvia-pankhurst-review-old-vic-london">Continue reading...</a>

I have a weakness for stories about outsiders finding each other, and games make that happen with charming regularity. I once wrote about a long-distance couple who stayed connected by playing Dark Souls, wrestling with that game’s opaque online matchmaking to ensure that they could always find each others’ summon signs, hidden in a nook behind a wall or under a distinctive vase. And I’m fascinated by how Eve Online has attracted a particular flavour of person – usually science-fiction-obsessed, very often in some position of power in real life – to create an intergalactic community that mimics the economics and power structures of our own, but with extra skullduggery.</p><p>Online gaming has brought us so much in this regard: people have formed lifelong friendships through all kinds of video games, from World of Warcraft to No Man’s Sky.

## Marcel the Shell With Shoes On review – bijou stop-motion animation will win you over

<p>What should be an irritating story about a tiny talking shell with shoes trying to find his family is somehow funny and beguiling</p><p>Here is a genuine oddity: a weird little hothouse flower of a film that looks as if it might crumple at the slightest breath of wind – but is actually very resilient. It’s a quirky stop-motion animation, developed from a series of online short films, whose comedy frequency takes a little time to tune into. You have to wait a bit to hear its batsqueak, and before this happens there is a real and understandable danger that you will simply find it insufferably annoying. The film appears to exist in the Venn diagram-overlap between twee and hipster, which isn’t for everyone – but let it grow on you, and there is a real sweetness and gentleness in its absurdity, a savant innocence and charm.</p><p>The idea is that the film’s director, Dean Fleischer Camp, is staying in an Airbnb after the collapse of his marriage; this house itself has become available for rental because the couple who own it have split up. Fleischer Camp becomes aware that there is someone else in the house: a tiny mollusc called Marcel (voiced by Jenny Slate) with a single, blinking human eye and dinky little human shoes. Marcel is a calm, childlike figure who talks with absolute candour in his tiny voice to Dean about his own problems and Dean’s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/15/marcel-the-shell-with-shoes-on-review-dean-fleischer-camp-jenny-slate">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Jermyn Street Theatre, London<br /></strong>In historian Orlando Figes’ rather too formal first play, the passionate romantic’s friends try to persuade him to be a little more worldly </p><p>While researching his book, The Europeans, Orlando Figes fell for the famous writers that populated his expansive work on 19th-century Europe. Turgenev was at the heart of The Europeans, but Flaubert is the focus of Figes’ very first play. With the great French writer’s life and money draining away, Turgenev, Zola and George Sand run increasingly desperate circles round their stubbornly romantic (and oyster-loving) friend, doomed to die for his art. It’s a sort of dream dinner party setup – only a lot of it is true.</p><p>Figes is known for the depth and vibrancy of his research, and those trademark strengths shine through in Philip Wilson’s measured production. As the four writers discuss life, love and literature, fascinating details emerge. We hear about the famous actor Sarah Bernhardt’s book, In the Clouds, narrated by a chair in a giant hot air balloon. As Flaubert’s friends burst into his modest apartment in Rouen, we discover the great writer lived seven floors up. And when Turgenev and Zola mournfully discuss Flaubert’s achingly inevitable funeral, they laugh as they remember the coffin hovering above the ground – too big to fit in the hole below.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/15/the-oyster-problem-review-jermyn-street-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A few celebrated names dominate our understanding of this ‘last great cause’, but these novels and memoirs show there is much more to learn</p><p>Sometimes a cause arises that seems so clearcut – so right-or-wrong – that we can seize our position with something like relief, because we have found something good and true to believe in, and to fight for. The Spanish civil war, or rather the democratic Republic that was ended by it, is sometimes described as “the last great cause”. Because Hitler and Mussolini supported the military rebels attacking Spain’s elected leftwing government, the war has often been seen as a missed opportunity to face down Europe’s fascist dictators. It became a rallying cry around the world, bringing politics alive for a young generation in the 1930s.</p><p>The war famously inspired writers, some of them very famous – George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway dominate the anglophone field. I wrote my book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/tomorrow-perhaps-the-future-9781787332409?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Tomorrow Perhaps the Future</a> in pursuit of individuals who – though not always as male, or white, or famous – turned out to be just as politicised by their times. I wanted to think about the imperative they’d identified of taking sides – a position that felt more relevant than ever over the last few years – but I was also curious about how writers, who surely need seclusion to do their best work, negotiated the clamour of such polarised, crisis-riven times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/15/top-10-neglected-books-about-the-spanish-civil-war-sarah-watling-tomorrow-perhaps-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Online, stock images tend to show older women exercising with featherlight weights. Personal trainer Anna Jenkins knew this wasn’t representative – so she set up an alternative shoot</p><p>When 50-year-old Anna Jenkins, the founder of We Are Fit Attitude (Wafa), a woman-only health and fitness club, looked online for images of older women exercising, she was irritated by the pitiful size of the weights: the stock image is of a woman with grey hair lifting a 1kg weight, as if doing so were some kind of milestone. My personal bugbears are the photos in which there is a personal trainer with an expression of infinite patience next to the older woman, as if the latter is weak and half witted.</p><p>Stock photos are the internet’s idea of what the world should look like, sets of generic images intended to illustrate articles and advertising, often revealing more worldview than they probably set out to. There are famously a lot of photos of white women laughing near salad, meant for healthy eating content, but also reinforcing inane cheer and self-denial as cornerstones of femininity. If fitness imagery of the young is all about aspiration – six packs, muscle definition and impossible body fat percentages – fitness imagery of older people is almost anti-aspirational. Its message is: “You probably can’t do anything at all, but look over here, there’s a lady managing this tiny thing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/15/you-dont-have-to-be-young-to-build-muscle-how-women-are-breaking-fitness-taboos">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A friend demanded I meet him in the pub immediately and I assumed the worst. Instead, I was greeted by 20 close friends dressed as Theresa May</p><p>We were about to be married, and second marriages are weird. Sorry, weird is the wrong word. What I mean is skint: I didn’t have any money, because I’d just got divorced. So, a lot of the things you associate with getting married – photographers, flowers, sit-down meals, bridesmaids, maids of honour, really everything apart from alcohol – were ditched. Also, I was a bit older than I was the first time, so I didn’t miss any of that, least of all the photographer. A hen night hadn’t even crossed my mind.</p><p>It was 2018, five days before the event, which was on a Wednesday, to avail ourselves of Southwark council’s midweek register-office special. Mr Z was, as it turned out, only pretending to make a romantic candlelit dinner, to mark one of our last evenings living in sin. My friend called and asked if he could see me in the pub, quick smart, as he had something urgent to discuss. Awks, as there was a dinner to eat, but of course I said yes and rushed out of the house to the sound of: “If you’re not back in an hour, everything will be <em>ruined, ruined!</em>”– failing to process how peculiar that was.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/15/my-most-romantic-moment-my-hen-party-was-a-real-surprise-i-thought-i-was-about-to-be-fired">Continue reading...</a>

## Hungry Ghosts by Kevin Jared Hosein review – lyrical Trinidadian saga

<p>The spectres of war and social injustice hang over a community battling the inexorable forces of change</p><p>Passage, for which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/04/kevin-jared-hosein-the-1940s-in-trinidad-was-like-the-wild-west">Kevin Jared Hosein</a> won the 2018 Commonwealth short story prize, tells the tale of a middle-aged urban Trinidadian who becomes fixated on a “forest family” he chances upon while hiking. At its heart is the clash between the mediated reality of modernity – the selfie sticks brandished by tourists, the iPads the narrator’s children barricade themselves behind – and the meaning and value of the lives of those who have rejected such apparent progress.</p><p>Hungry Ghosts expands on this theme of histories and cultures at an impasse. Set in the 1940s, as American destroyers arrive in Trinidad’s diminutive harbours and naval bases displace village communities, it reaches into the country’s past as a much-trafficked colonial possession and hints at the complications that might accompany its journey towards a still-distant independence. High on the list of these complications is the treatment of the island’s marginalised Hindu population, whose rights are curtailed in law. In a scene near the beginning of the book, we witness 13-year-old Krishna railing at a shopkeeper who will not let him enter, while his father, Hans, enjoins his son not to cause trouble.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/15/hungry-ghosts-by-kevin-jared-hosein-review-lyrical-trinidadian-saga">Continue reading...</a>

There were people of every age, race, religion and nationality, from huge numbers of school students to members of the Muslim community and other faith organisations and trade unionists. There were tens of thousands of banners and placards ranging from “make tea not war” to “not in my name”. Part of the reason for the sheer size of the march was that people thought that being there in person, as individuals, really could make a difference and convince the government not to go to war.</p><p>Lindsey German is the convener of the Stop the War Coalition and was one of the organisers of the march on 15 February 2003</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Nature of performance last year hinted at Arsenal’s progress and Premier League leaders have a team to stand up to the best</p><p>On one level it was same old Arsenal; on another it was something palpably different. Last year was less than 15 hours old when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">they lost in added time</a> to a snaffled Rodri finish at the Emirates, meaning a first-half lead had been completely overhauled and Manchester City looked bound for the title. They felt the big decisions, such as Gabriel Magalhães’s red card and VAR calls in either penalty area, had gone against them but anyone looking merely at the bare facts would have assumed the wearyingly familiar tendency to shoot themselves in the foot told enough of a tale.</p><p>Those watching more closely, including a Covid-stricken Mikel Arteta who had to dial in his team talk from home, would have rejected that as a lazy interpretation. This was not the same: yes, Arsenal had fallen short, but until Gabriel’s departure they had outplayed City. The clinical finish supplied by Bukayo Saka had been the least they deserved in a relentless display of speed and daring. Four months previously a 5-0 defeat at the Etihad had brought the darkest period of Arteta’s managerial career but now only the finest of margins separated his team from the gold standard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/15/artetas-arsenal-must-navigate-fine-margins-to-topple-citys-gold-standard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wales is the measure of all things in this time-shifting story of ecological change</p><p>Just as the first lockdown was beginning to lift in late summer 2020, Tom Bullough set out to walk Sarn Helen, the Roman road that once cut through Wales from Neath in the south to Caerhun in the north. It still does, although there are places where you would be hard pressed to see it, places where it wobbles, turns a corner or generally behaves in a most un-Roman manner. The road gets its name from the fourth-century princess turned saint, Elen Luyddog, who, according to the Mabinogion, insisted that her Roman husband, Magnus Maximus, build her “a great road” linking her home town in the foothills of Snowdonia all the way to the Bristol Channel.</p><p>Sadly, the timings don’t work. The Romans laid down their roads shortly after settling in Britain in the first century, long before the historical Elen was in any position to start making demands about infrastructure. Still, it is these layering, time-shifting stories that Bullough holds in his head as he pulls on his boots, packs blister plasters and prepares to be nibbled to death by midges along the 160 miles of what translates into English as “Helen’s Causeway”. A few days in and he ruefully recalls a story about how the legionaries who built the road found their sandals lasted only a week. His feet, let alone his boots, feel as if they might be heading the same way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/15/sarn-helen-by-tom-bullough-review-notes-from-a-small-country">Continue reading...</a>

## Thomas Commeraw: the Black 19th-century potter who historians assumed was white

<p>A fascinating and illuminating new exhibition acts as ‘a cautionary tale to not make assumptions about identity’</p><p>For Margi Hofer of the New-York Historical Society (NYHS), the fate of potter Thomas Commeraw – long presumed white but later proven to be Black – speaks volumes about how we look at race and history. “I hope the story of Commeraw’s identity is a cautionary tale to not make assumptions about identity when we look at objects from the past,” she said.</p><p>Although Commeraw’s pottery had been celebrated for well over a century by institutions like the Philadelphia Art Museum and the Grolier Club, it was only in 2010 that scholar Brandt Zipp revealed he was Black. Until that point Commeraw had been presumed to be a white man, as were most of the potters of the era. “When it came to light in 2010 that he was a Black craftsman, I was blown away,” said Hofer. “I knew it was a perfect exhibition for the NYHS.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/15/thomas-commeraw-the-black-19th-century-potter-who-historians-assumed-was-white">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I want to use another airline as I can’t enter the transit country used by BA flights to south-east Asia, but the airline has only offered a voucher</p><p><strong>When Covid lockdowns prevented us taking our BA flight from London to Malaysia, I accepted its </strong><strong>eVouchers</strong><strong> to rebook at a later stage. Since then, BA has changed the route, so all flights to south-east Asia transit through Qatar. Since I have HIV, which is classed as a disability under UK law, I am not legally allowed to enter Qatar and so I cannot book flights to the region with BA. I therefore need a refund so that I can book with another airline. However, BA customer service took a month to inform me that it operates a no-refunds policy for eVouchers. One operative actually suggested I call the Qatar embassy to check if I’d be deported if I flew into the country.</strong><br /><em><strong>KC, London</strong></em></p><p>If BA had listened to your predicament and cashed in your voucher, it might have retained a loyal customer for future flights and spared itself a public shaming. Instead, its robotic refusal to look beyond its small print has caused you weeks of distress.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/15/i-have-hiv-and-cant-fly-through-qatar-but-ba-wont-give-me-a-refund">Continue reading...</a>

Until recently, I thought I’d tried all the productivity tricks ever invented.

He is also, as you would expect from an engineer at Meta, committed to optimising every second of his time. He is constantly experimenting with productivity “hacks” and <a href="https://simonberens.me/blog/i-hired-5-people">recently hired people</a> to sit behind him for six to eight hours a day, four to five days a week, at $20 (£16) an hour, to ensure he was being productive.

## Alice Neel review – sexy, wonky portraits of radicals, poets, feminists and naked art critics

<p><strong>Barbican, London</strong><br />She immortalised New York’s bohemia and her own joys and struggles in paintings powerfully alert to body language and psychological vulnerabilities</p><p>Alice Neel was a painter of fearless and tender portraits. Although apparently direct and uncomplicated, her paintings of people alone, of couples and families and mothers and children, not only unpick the dynamics between her sitters but also their complicity with the artist. In her long career, she painted everyone from black radicals, academics and intellectuals to Latin American families and kids in Spanish Harlem. She left most of her painting of a black conscript unfinished when he went off to Vietnam, in the hope of his return (he did come back, but never sat for her again). She painted New York’s bohemia, art critics and lovers. She painted demonstrations and street life, police violence against strikers, a young man stricken with tuberculosis, celebrations and poverty.</p><p>When a couple of agents from the FBI came knocking on the artist’s door in the 1950s, Neel asked if they would sit for her. They declined. Who, even an uptight Fed, wouldn’t want to be painted by Neel? Her painted encounters distilled her subject’s eagerness to please, their self-consciousness and their pleasure in being painted by this redoubtable, unshockable woman. Never quite an expressionist, nearly a caricaturist, sometimes deliciously wonky and frequently sexy, Neel’s portraits are alert to body language, to physical mannerisms and vulnerabilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/15/alice-neel-review-sexy-wonky-portraits-of-radicals-poets-feminists-and-naked-art-critics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Oyster mushroom feeds on roundworms using a deadly nerve agent that causes paralysis</p><p>A mushroom that eats animals sounds like a horror story. But the oyster mushroom is a full-bloodied carnivore that feeds on roundworms, killing its prey using a nerve gas.</p><p>Even though oyster mushrooms are a prized food delicacy, don’t be fooled; they kill nematodes, tiny roundworms. The oyster mushroom <em>Pleurotus ostreatus</em> usually grows on dead or dying trees, but the wood has so little protein that the fungus turns to consuming nematodes for nourishment. It uses a lethal array of tiny balls attached to the hypae, the long hair-like filaments of the fungus. When a nematode brushes past a ball it instantly bursts, paralysing and killing the tiny worm in minutes. The fungal filament then penetrates the carcass, dissolving its tissues and sucking out the nutrients.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/15/plantwatch-the-mushroom-that-is-both-delicacy-and-predator">Continue reading...</a>
