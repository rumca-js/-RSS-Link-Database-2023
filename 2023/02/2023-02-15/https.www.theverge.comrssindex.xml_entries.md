This update will include a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/11/23549812/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-energy-saver-mode-switch">one-time switch</a> for Xbox Series X and S owners over to an energy-saving power mode.

<p id="g0tB0g">The difference between both Xbox power options is big when it comes to energy usage. The Sleep option lets you instantly boot an Xbox Series X / S console, but it uses around 10–15 watts while in standby. If you pick the Shutdown power option, it takes around 15 seconds to boot up a console, but it only uses 0.5 watts while it’s turned off.</p>

  <p id="97n0hj">It is an inevitable truth that you will, at some point, lose the remote control. Perhaps it’s fallen into an interdimensional hole between couch cushions. Maybe your cat is sitting on it. Or, worst-case scenario, the remote is out of batteries and the last episode of your show ended on a cliffhanger. The good news? You can use your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables">Apple Watch</a> to control your TV. </p>
<p id="4IWtgq">The ability to control devices from your wrist isn’t limited to TVs, either. If you’re already ensconced within Apple’s ecosystem, you can also use the Apple Watch to control your iPhone and iPad. If you use HomeKit, it’s an easy way to control your smart home without having to pull out your phone at all. Regardless of which device you want to control, here’s how to do it. </p>

<p id="7D0GGR">In November 2021, in response to inflation, the Fed announced it would hike interest rates. It’s not done, either — the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20230208a.htm">Fed has indicated it will continue to hike</a> until enough of us are unemployed. I’m sure the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-07/powell-says-further-rate-hikes-needed-amid-strong-labor-market">Mr. Burns-steepling-fingers style the Fed is taking</a> is just a coincidence.</p>
<p id="OKq8pZ">This is a big deal because the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low pretty much since the 2008 financial crisis. Borrowing money is now more expensive than it’s been in over a decade. That means that a lot of investors aren’t being forced to look to stocks for returns — they can invest in bonds or treasuries instead. And that changes some things...</p>
