[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Lessons From TryContra", "description": "<p><span>\n\nAs I </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/help-update-trycontra\">wrote yesterday</a>, I\nrecently brought my little \n\n<a href=\"https://www.trycontra.com/\">contra\ndance search tool</a> up to date.  I realized I've been running it for\nten years now, which seems like a good time to look back over the\nexperience for lessons.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen I built it <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/where-can-i-dance\">in 2013</a> I wrote:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nExperienced dancers know how to use <a href=\"http://www.contradancelinks.com/\">ContraDanceLinks.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thedancegypsy.com/\">Dance Gypsy</a>, and the <a href=\"http://dancedb.com/DanceDB/\">DanceDB</a> to find places they can\ngo contra dancing, but those sites are too complex and confusing for\nme to want to give to a new dancer.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nHere's what those dance-community focused sites looked like:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/contradancelinks-screenshot-2013-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/contradancelinks-screenshot-2013.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/dancedb-screenshot-2013-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/dancedb-screenshot-2013.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/dancegypsy-screenshot-2013-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/dancegypsy-screenshot-2013.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd here's what I built:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-screenshot-2013-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-screenshot-2013.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAlmost the same as it is today:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-screenshot-2023-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-screenshot-2023.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI wanted to build something easy to use and was willing to give up\npretty much everything else, and I think I succeeded at that.  You put\nin your location, get a list of nearby dances, and click through to\ntheir sites for more information.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere were several other choices I made, primarily out of laziness:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>The site is completely static: HTML, CSS, JS.  The searching\nhappens in your browser, since it only takes a few kB to store all the\ncontra dances in the country.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>No dependencies: vanilla JS using browser APIs only.  Not even\nminified.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>It's just a directory.  I don't host pages for dances.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>No accounts.  If you want to update the listing for your dance\nyou can email me.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Minimal information.  Just a link, city, weekday, approximate\nfrequency, and whether it's gender-free.  No \"1st and 3rd Sundays\",\npricing, addresses, hours, performers, etc.  More details would mean\nmore information to collect, but more importantly it would mean more\ninformation to go stale.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn retrospect I feel like these decisions turned out well: the site\nrequires <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/designing-low-upkeep-software\">very little\nupkeep</a>.  I can leave it alone for years and it will keep chugging\nalong, and every so often I get an email with a correction and make a\nsmall change to a <a href=\"https://www.trycontra.com/dances.json\">text\nfile</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(This has also given me a lot of experience at reading contra dance\nwebsites.  I <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/dance-website-checklist\">wrote advice for\npeople making these sites</a> in 2013, which I think is mostly still\ngood, but at this point I'd also add specifying covid details and\nwhether your dance is gender free.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0URdwQLwAvFKEsBwBCDgnz8J6GJjmDoYWuTLojUpkcBD4yut15jGDtYTNx2phPwi6l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/ijS2zSuqh2N5KwGje\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109869399599247144\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/lessons-from-trycontra", "date_published": "2023-02-15 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
