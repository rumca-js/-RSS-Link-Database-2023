Her internationally bestselling debut, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lessons-in-chemistry-9781804990926\">Lessons in Chemistry</a></em>, out in paperback next month, is soon to be televised with <em>Captain Marvel</em> star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/20/brie-larson-short-term-12-interview\">Brie Larson</a> in the role of Elizabeth Zott, an American scientist who, sacked for being pregnant in 1955, takes revenge when she\u2019s hired to front a teatime cookery show. For Stephen King, the novel is \u201cthe <em>Catch-22</em> of early feminism: witty, sometimes hilarious, angry and often surreal\u201d. Garmus, who also works as a copywriter and creative director, discussed the book<strong> </strong>on her return from a literary festival in Dubai.<br /><br /><strong>What led you to write a comedy about sexism and misogyny?</strong><br />I think any time a writer wants to take on a difficult topic without sounding didactic, humour really helps. Sexism is demeaning, depressing, infuriating, boring, inefficient, stupid, revolting and completely unscientific \u2013 in other words, not funny. But people reveal both their strengths and weaknesses when they try to deal with it, or <em>not</em> deal with it, and therein lies the potential for humour.<br /><br /><strong>Why do you think the book has struck such a chord around the world?</strong><br />Readers identify with Elizabeth Zott. There are so few of us who haven\u2019t been put down, pushed aside, maligned, passed over, rejected, ripped off, lied to or treated badly simply because we\u2019re women, people of colour, gender-diverse, neuro-diverse, too fat, too thin, too short, too tall \u2013 you name it. But Elizabeth is a rationalist; she doesn\u2019t confuse societal prejudice with facts, nor does she accept direction from those who do. It\u2019s fun to write a character like that. And it\u2019s an honour to talk with readers from every corner of the world \u2013 the Middle East, Africa, South America, Australia, North America, Europe and beyond \u2013 and discover not only how aligned we are, but how dedicated we are to real societal change.</p><p><strong>What drew you to the novel\u2019s free-floating voice, which roams between the thoughts of each character, major and minor, to say nothing of Elizabeth\u2019s dog, </strong><strong>Six-Thirty</strong><strong>?</strong><br />I love the freedom of being in the heads of other people (and one dog). I know a few writing books will caution against it, but as long as you don\u2019t lose the reader, I say go for it. I never wanted to write only from Elizabeth\u2019s point of view: how others view her and react to her is ultimately what drives the story. Chemically speaking, she\u2019s the catalyst \u2013 she changes every character she comes in contact with.<br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/25/bonnie-garmus-so-few-of-us-havent-been-pushed-aside-lessons-in-chemistry\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/25/bonnie-garmus-so-few-of-us-havent-been-pushed-aside-lessons-in-chemistry", "date_published": "2023-02-25 18:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dina Asher-Smith powers past Shericka Jackson to win World Indoor Tour gold", "description": "<ul><li>Sprinter also breaks British 60m record in heats before final win</li><li>Keely Hodgkinson and Neil Gourley set national records</li></ul><p>For British track and field fans there are few sights more thrilling than Dina Asher-Smith going supersonic.

Everyone in Laramie, Wyoming, says they know who did it and the person they name \u2013 a former Laramie cop named Fred Lamb \u2013 was even charged at one point. He\u2019s even seemed to admit to the murder, on tape. So why is he still free?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/25/the-week-in-audio-the-coldest-case-in-laramie-carol-and-muriel-the-rabbit-hole-detectives-and-more\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/25/the-week-in-audio-the-coldest-case-in-laramie-carol-and-muriel-the-rabbit-hole-detectives-and-more", "date_published": "2023-02-25 17:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bad managers on brilliant pay: that\u2019s why the UK\u2019s not working | Phillip Inman", "description": "<p>Productivity is much lower than in comparable countries, yet bosses just award themselves millions \u2013 and hire consultants</p><p>Banker bonuses are on the rise again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/17/natwest-makes-largest-profit-since-financial-crisis-on-higher-rates\" title=\"\">NatWest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/21/hsbc-quarterly-profits-interest-rate-rises-ceo-ping-an\" title=\"\">HSBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/22/lloyds-bankers-bonus-pot\" title=\"\">Lloyds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/15/barclays-staff-bonuses-drop-in-profits\" title=\"\">Barclays</a> have in the past fortnight reported shelling out millions of pounds to bosses and assorted directors as a reward for their exceptional efforts.

In recent years, reports of cetacean strandings on UK coasts have reached record levels, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/24/group-of-whales-washed-up-on-east-yorkshire-beach\">numerous mass strandings </a>and a <a href=\"https://theecologist.org/2020/jun/10/rare-whale-beached-uk-first-time\">greater variety of species</a> appearing on beaches.

To the man who swims in the forest lake where she resides, she is merely another aqueous ripple. Her only way to win him is to become human. In the pretty trappings of a Slavic fairy story, <em>Rusalka</em> (1901) is a shattering tale of the danger of trying to be other than we are. To an audience today it is also a fable about tending the planet we live in.

Bychkov, among other roles, is music director of the Czech Philharmonic. His pre-eminence in responding to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s folk-inspired rhythms and modes is never in doubt. Casting was luxurious: the Lithuanian soprano Asmik Grigorian versatile and affecting in the title role, the British tenor David Butt Philip an intelligent and musically formidable Prince, with Aleksei Isaev (Vodnik), Sarah Connolly (Je\u017eibaba) and Emma Bell (the Duchess) leading the supporting ensemble. In the opera\u2019s most famous moment, the song to the moon, Grigorian showed all her vocal colours, with the orchestra wrapping itself delicately round every phrase, each instrument \u2013 sensuous harp, throbbing horn, melancholy clarinet \u2013 casting its own shaft of light.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/25/the-week-in-classical-rusalka-the-rhinegold-review-royal-opera-eno\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/25/the-week-in-classical-rusalka-the-rhinegold-review-royal-opera-eno", "date_published": "2023-02-25 12:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Beale must show Rangers can match Postecoglou\u2019s Celtic when it counts", "description": "<p>The Old Firm collide again on Sunday and landing the Scottish League Cup final would add to a sense of rejuvenation at Ibrox</p><p>In Ange Postecoglou, Celtic hired a manager who afforded them a crucial edge.

Up here on the seventh floor of the Dior building in Paris, where the light from the Seine bounces off the zinc rooftops and takes on a chic silvery filter, there are no sketchbooks, no tape measure-draped mannequins, no bolts of taffeta or tweed. Instead, every inch of the imposing room is lined with books: philosophy, gender studies, art history, literature.
