At the time, the commission accused Meta of \"trying to buy its way to the top... instead of earning it on the merits.\" It said the company had the resources to enter \"the VR fitness market by building its own app\" and doing so would increase consumer choice and innovation. By buying Within, the FTC alleged Meta would stifle \"future innovation and competitive rivalry.\"</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>US District Judge Edward Davila, who oversaw the federal case, ruled in favor of Meta.

Now, you can get a pair of the wireless earbuds for even less, since they're currently on sale at Amazon for  $150, or $19 cheaper than their usual price these days. The tech giant completely redesigned the AirPods for the third-generation model, giving them a new look with reduced weight, a more tapered silhouette and a shorter stem than their predecessors. While they still don't have the Pro's silicone eartips, we found them more comfortable to wear than the older models.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The earbuds come with Apple's redesigned in-ear detection system and use an optical sensor to detect whether you're truly wearing them. Since they're equipped with Apple's H1 chip, they're easy to pair with the company's devices and they have access to always-on, hands-free Siri. When we <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html\">tested them out</a>, we found their audio quality to be superior to older models', thanks to Apple pairing a custom driver with a high-dynamic-range amplifier for \"rich consistent bass\" and \"crisp, clean\" highs. The model is capable of dynamic head tracking, as well, and the sounds it generates are bigger and more immersive.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If you are looking for something even more affordable, though, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdQWEdRQzFRLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tYi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmRkMjBjNTMtMWY0ZC00MzRhLTkxMjktMzBlYjU2MTQ4NDkwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAT1wt4J-dzAFEKrDp8YsfbycnYsBe4Cam7DQaG035RzS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%2F\">Apple's second-gen AirPods</a> are also currently on sale for $99 or $60 less than their usual price.
