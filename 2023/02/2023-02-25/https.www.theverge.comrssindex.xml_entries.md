  <p id="C2qR6z">A short story titled “The Last Hope” first hit Sheila Williams’ desk in early January. Williams, the editor of <a href="https://www.asimovs.com/"><em>Asimov’s Science Fiction</em></a> magazine, reviewed the story and passed on it.</p>
<p id="5jYQDq">At first, she didn’t think much of it; she reads and responds to writers daily as part of her job, receiving anywhere from 700 to 750 stories a month. But when another story, also titled “The Last Hope,” came in a couple weeks later by a writer with a different name, Williams became suspicious. By the time yet another “The Last Hope” came a few days later, Williams knew immediately she had a problem on her hands.</p>
<p id="CW5A0s">“That’s like the tip of the iceberg,” Williams says.</p>

The Nokia G22 will be available on March 8th in the UK for £149.99 (€179 / around $180) and will be sold in select global markets like Europe but not the US.</p>

  <p id="ULnAeZ">Apple has made a notable hire that could signal its intent to move into ads on Apple TV Plus. The company has hired advertising exec Lauren Fry to “to help build a video advertising business for its Apple TV Plus streaming service,” <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-hires-ad-executive-for-apple-tv-a-sign-of-apples-video-ad-ambitions">according to <em>The Information</em></a>.</p>
<p id="nyl2oy">Apple has been turning more to ads to help grow its revenues; it added new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/apple-now-showing-more-ads-in-app-store/">ad placements in the App Store last year</a> and reportedly wants to bring ads <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/14/23305200/iphone-more-ads-advertising-apple-maps-podcasts-books-mark-gurman-rumors">to apps like Maps, Books, and Podcasts</a>, so it’s not surprising that it’s looking at ads for TV Plus as well. And this hire isn’t even the first exploration of ads with its streaming offerings, as it has run ads against its Major League Baseball games and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/5/23441872/apple-advertisements-mls-major-league-soccer-games-2023">reportedly building an ad network</a> around its streaming service with Major...</p>
