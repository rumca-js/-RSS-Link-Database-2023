<p>A classic braised pork belly dish, a lip-smackingly hot-and-sour fish stew and a mustard green duck stew make up this trio of warming south-east Asian dishes</p><p>Malaysia isn’t known for its cold weather, but, when the rainy season arrives in November and December, the temperature does tend to drop – to 25C. During the colder months in Britain, meanwhile, I eat lots of peppery broths spiked with chilli and ginger, and often serve them with “cooling” vegetables to balance the heat, as well as hot-and-sour curries and slow-braised meats. These are dishes to warm the soul and keep you going until the sun returns.</p><p>Abby Lee is chef/owner of <a href="https://www.mambow.co.uk/">Mambow</a>, London SE15</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/25/one-pot-malaysian-recipes-pork-belly-fish-stew-mustard-greens-abby-lee">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The modern-day uptick in team-switching has made for less of the classic rivalries that defined previous eras. But matchups like Zion v Ja and Celtics v Bucks are bursting with promise</p><p>The NBA’s ever-changing nature means that rivalries are fickle. When Philadelphia traded picks with Boston to take Markelle Fultz with the No 1 overall pick in the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2017.html">2017 NBA draft</a>, and the Celtics selected Jayson Tatum third, the teams’ proximity and prior history had all the makings of a classic. But while Tatum is a perennial All-Star, Fultz soon developed the shooting yips and was quickly shipped to the Magic.</p><p>The modern-day uptick in team-switching has made for less of the classic rivalries that defined previous eras, such as Magic Johnson’s Lakers v Larry Bird’s Celtics and Michael Jordan’s Bulls v the Bad Boys’ Pistons.

<p>A quick, filling midweek meal you can make from economical store-cupboard ingredients</p><p>When I was growing up, this traditional Bengali curry was our go-to store-cupboard dish – the thing we made when there wasn’t any decent fish at the market or we’d forgotten to defrost some chicken. It was made with ingredients we always had and I used to think of it as the poor cousin of the richer meat dishes we had at other times. Nowadays, I remember it far more fondly: a gentle, nutritious and filling meal and, most importantly of all, a taste of home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/25/tamal-ray-recipe-boiled-egg-curry">Continue reading...</a>
