<p>The bill <a href="https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/drag-show-ban-for-minors-passes-house-vote" target="_blank">defines</a> drag performance as “topless dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, or male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to prurient interests.” Prurient interest is defined as “having a tendency to excite lustful thought," which is definitely not an appropriate setting for young children.

But I think I speak for most conservatives when I say the main issue is, in fact, the half-naked men engaging in stripteases. That's typically not something children want to, or should, see. And it's not art. Sorry.</p>

## The LA District Attorney Suspended a Prosecutor For Misgendering a Child Molester. No Really, This Happened.

At least in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-clerk-robber-knife" target="_blank">California</a> - the rest of the country might have a little more time.</p><p>LA County Deputy District Attorney Shea Sanna has been suspended for deadnaming a criminal who sexually assaulted a child in a Denny's bathroom. The criminal is Hannah Tubbs, formerly known as James Tubbs. Tubbs was nearly 18 at the time of the crime. But because of a policy instituted by LA DA George Gascón, Tubbs cannot be tried as an adult. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cEXCLUSIVE: LA County Deputy DA Suspended by Gascon for 'Misgendering' Has Been Subjected to a Retaliatory Internal Investigation for 7 Months https://t.co/I11VUhBb9b\u201d</div> — RedState (@RedState)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/RedState/status/1629243610695716870">1677276921</a>
</blockquote>

<p>According to prosecutors, Tubbs walked into the Denny's bathroom, grabbed a 10-year-old girl by the throat, locked her in a stall, and put their hand down the girl's pants. Tubbs wasn't tried until they were 26, but still could not be tried as an adult. So the maximum sentence Tubbs faced was two years in a juvenile facility. With children. Do you see the problem here?</p><p>Sanna fought Gascon on this policy, but Gascon held firm - even when he was criticized by the public. Sanna has been under investigation for seven months for alleged “misuse of county resources” and “<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bbc-quotes-rape-victim-pronouns" target="_blank">misgendering</a>” Tubbs. The "misgendering" allegation is due to the fact that, after being arrested, Tubbs began to identify as a woman and ask to be called "Hannah". </p><p>Sanna warned Gascon that Tubbs was probably trying to game the system and identify as a woman, since Tubbs was in a women's bathroom at the time of the crime. Sanna told RedState an internal investigation was opened against him last year, alleging that he misused county resources, released confidential information and made inappropriate public statements. Sanna had to undergo a second investigation for "misgendering" Tubbs, which resulted in a five-day suspension without pay. <br /></p><p>Now, I know this sounds bad. But I'll remind you that we've been reliably informed by the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-crowder-suspended" target="_blank">powers that be</a> that no sexual predators <em>ever</em> take advantage of transgender bathroom or jail policies. So we can just chalk this up to more right-wing propaganda. </p>

## Watch: South Park tackles allowing biological men to compete against women in sports as only they can

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=23138755&amp;width=980" /><br /><br /><p>There is a trend on Twitter of reliving classic South Park clips, and this one is a favorite. In 2019, we first started debating -- or "debating" in quotes -- whether it was fair to allow men to compete against women in sports. By "men" i of course mean beautiful and brave trans-women as they are defined in the AP Style Guide.</p><p>On one side, people believe those born as men competing against people born as women is inherently unfair. On the other side, you're a transphobe if you're on the first side. As with any of the great debates of our generation, there's always <em>South Park</em> to respectfully air both sides of the argument.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Since reliving old South Park clips are what we’re doing this week, don’t sleep on trans-athlete Heather Swanson… <a href="https://t.co/F7Ay4ZGskL">pic.twitter.com/F7Ay4ZGskL</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1628475025484292097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's what I find most sad about the whole transgender "ladies" in women's sports. In the olden days, the "moral of the story" was uplifting and usually offered important lessons: it's wrong to steal, be a nice person, Epstein didn't kill himself. They were life lessons people needed to hear at that moment to grow into better people.<br /></p><p>The life lesson in this clip from 2019 is that maybe, just maybe, opening a discussion just to possibly consider as to whether or not something may or may not be fair does NOT make you a transphobe. Or any -phobe for that matter. That's the debate. </p><p>Or, in my naivete, thought that should have been the debate in 2019. The last four years have had different ideas:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-athlete-usa-today" target="_self" title="view post: USA Today Edits Female Track Star's OpEd After Trans Complaints.

Yet the same side which says it's championing the rights of women is somehow the same side eager to grant special rights to men... who just say they're women.</p><p><p>

## Enjoy watching this drunk driver get chased down and driven to the ground after trying to flee deadly accident

The police officer's wife and kids were in the car as well and while injured, survived. The drunk, Dylan Molina, attempted to flee the scene but a bystander chased him down. Video of the incident made its way to the YouTubes this week. </p><p>It doesn't bring the officer back. But thanks to the glorious power of CONTENT, seeing Molina dropped like a rodeo calf and being told in no uncertain terms what he just did ensures a lifetime of ridicule and embarrassment for him and his family for generations to come.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>"Get your f*cking ass over here motherf*cker!"</p><p>Molina did NOT get his f*cking as over there. Instead, in his drunken state, he attempted to make a run for it. Our hero samaritan friend wasn't having it, and the chase was on. I'm sure the samaritan would have caught up to him too if gravity and a cement block didn't get him first.</p><p>"You f*cking killed someone, motherf*cker. You see what you did?"</p><p>According <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/good-samaritan-pins-down-drunk-driver-trying-to-run-away-after-killing-euless-cop?taid=63f7a9b31403bb00013cfbc3&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=trueanthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">to local news reports</a>, Molina pounded EIGHT double Redbulls and vodkas in under three hours. When you go that hard in the middle of the day, it says a lot about the type of person you are. And that's before he stumbled into his car and drove off. He now gets to spend the next fifteen years as a guest of the Texas Penal system.</p><p>Police released the video this week because they say "it highlights a heartbreaking story that hopefully someone can learn from."</p><p><p>
