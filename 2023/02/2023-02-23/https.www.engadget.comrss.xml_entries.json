Finally, the company has rectified that problem with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-launches-its-first-hybrid-autofocus-cameras-the-s-5-ii-and-s-5-i-ix-150053908.html\">launch of the S5 II</a>. It has a new 24-megapixel sensor with phase-detect pixels that should get rid of the wobble and hunting that have plagued the contrast-detect AF on Panasonic cameras over the years.</p><p>To make it even better for content creators, Panasonic also brought over its new, more powerful stabilization system from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh-6-review-video-a-vlogging-workhorse-153048534.html\">the GH6</a>. And you still get the powerful video features you\u2019d expect on Panasonic cameras, like video up to 6K, monitoring tools and advanced audio features.

I also wanted to see if it would let you leave your gimbal at home, as the company suggests in its ads. To find out, I took it around Paris and my hometown of Gien, France.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Body and Handling</h3><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The S5 II\u2019s body and control layout is identical to the S5, and that\u2019s generally a good thing. At 740 grams, it is a bit heavier than its main rivals. However, it\u2019s still a reasonably lightweight video camera that\u2019s comfortable enough to shoot for a full day.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a big comfortable grip, along with lots of manual controls that let you change settings without the need to dip into menus. It has all the controls you\u2019d hope for like a joystick, dedicated AF control and more. The record button is placed on top so it\u2019s easy to find when vlogging, but it would be nice to have a record button on front like the GH6.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Should you need to use the menus, Panasonic has nailed that part, with well-organized categories that make important adjustments fairly easy to find. It\u2019s also quite easy to customize things, so as with any camera, I\u2019d recommend doing that for your own workstyle.&nbsp;</p><p>The 3-inch, 1.8 million dot rear display is the same one as before and is bright and sharp for video work. It of course fully articulates, so you can flip it around for vlogging, hold it high or low and more. The only drawback is that it can get tangled up with any cables, particularly the headphone jack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Panasonic boosted the OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF) resolution to 3.68 million dots from 2.34 million dots on the original S5. It's now decently sharp and clear, addressing one of my biggest complaints of the last model.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II full-frame mirrorless camera review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cb39b890-b2f6-11ed-afff-4d399c6315d8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Another welcome update is two fast UHS-II card slots, rather than one UHS-II and one UHS-I slot on the S5. That allows for faster transfer speeds and more reliable backups, if you like to shoot video to two cards at once. It also now uses a full-sized, rather than a micro HDMI jack as before, making it far more reliable when using an external recorder.&nbsp;</p><p>There are of course headphone and mic jacks, but the S5 II now offers 4-channel recording via the DMW-XLR1 hotshoe audio adapter, just like the GH6. It also borrows the latter\u2019s audio interface that gives you a central hub for all audio settings. It doesn\u2019t have a dedicated button like the GH6, but you can assign any function button.</p><p>Finally, the batteries are borrowed from the S5 II, and deliver up to 470 shots on a charge or a solid two hours of 4K recording.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Video</h3><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Panasonic\u2019s mirrorless cameras are primarily designed for video shooters, so let\u2019s get into that first. The centerpiece of this camera is that new phase-detect autofocus, designed to eliminate the wobble or hunting that happened with past Panasonic models that had contrast-detect only autofocus. So how does it work for content creators</p><figure><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II full-frame mirrorless camera review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cb50c300-b2f6-11ed-9bb1-23e4796ab23a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As with other recent models, the S5 II\u2019s system includes regular continuous AF modes along with subject tracking, for both humans and animals. However, it\u2019s not as sophisticated as recent rival cameras like the A7 IV and EOS R6II, though, as it can\u2019t track things like cars and airplanes, and doesn\u2019t distinguish between birds and other animals.</p><p>Luckily, the capabilities it does have are on par with those models. It smoothly tracks subjects and has very little lag if they move toward the camera, for example. Face and eye detection is good, though it struggles a bit if the subject turns, and can\u2019t track their eyes if they\u2019re not reasonably close to the camera. It\u2019s also not quite as sticky as rival models.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, it generally tracks focus reliably for interviews, vlogging and other situations. More importantly, the pulsing, hunting and wobbling is completely gone, so you can now rely on the S5 II\u2019s autofocus in most situations.</p><p>There is one caveat that may be important to some users. As YouTuber <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1kRXBtVWZ5RVNSYyZ0PTUxcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjlmNDkyNTgtOGQ0Yi00ZDU3LTkwMzEtMTk5ODZiNzI5OWJlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbU17jRCglyuPT7OSBoWe7Ubj_aXtU5EHVDYOHDz95_z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdEpmUfyESRc%26t%3D51s\">CameraOfChoice</a> notes, the phase-detect AF works great at all 4K and 6K resolutions, and 1080 25p. However, the camera switches to contrast-detect AF at 10-bit 1080p 60 fps and 120 fps resolutions, along with 3.3K 422/10L 25p. I\u2019ve reached out to Panasonic for more information, but if you use those resolutions frequently, you may need to look at a different model.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II full-frame mirrorless camera review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cb285370-b2f6-11ed-9dea-f59230ea350f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">With autofocus issues mostly gone, the S5 II is a far more attractive vlogging and video camera thanks to its other powerful features.</p><p>You can shoot 5.9K video at 30p using the full width of the sensor, or full-width supersampled 4K at up to 30 fps. 60p 4K video is possible as well, but requires an APS-C crop and some loss of sharpness. The S5 II can also handle 4:3 anamorphic video at up to 6K using the full sensor width, or 3:2 \u201copen gate\u201d video that makes it easier to crop or deliver in social media formats.</p><p>There are few temperature-related time restrictions in any of these modes, thanks to the inclusion of a clever fan that only kicks in when you need it (below). Namely, there are no time restrictions on any video at 4K and below, including 1080p 120, while 6K is limited to 30 minutes. Panasonic is the only manufacturer to test its cameras at up to about 105 degrees Fahrenheit, so most users will likely never experience any problems.&nbsp;</p><p>As with most Panasonic cameras, you can shoot 10-bit video with V-log to boost dynamic range. And it\u2019s easier than ever to monitor V-Log. You can not only choose a standard Rec.709 output, but display your own custom <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/2011/05/what-is-a-look-up-table-lut-anyway\">look-up-table</a> or LUT, too. You can even record those LUTs as your final video output, giving you unlimited \u201clooks\u201d and potentially saving time in post.</p><figure><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II full-frame mirrorless camera review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cb1c1e70-b2f6-11ed-bffd-9b2c9b8134ba\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The main video drawback is the lowish data rates (200 Mbps and below) and the lack of any ProRes or All-I internal recording modes. There\u2019s also no external RAW capture, though you\u2019ll be able to add that later for a $200 fee. You can, however, capture other ProRes codecs to an Atomos Ninja V/V+ or BlackMagic Video Assist recorder.&nbsp;</p><p>And that brings up Panasonic\u2019s upcoming S5 IIx, announced at the same time as the S5 II. It\u2019s priced at $2,200 and is mostly identical in terms of features. However, the extra $200 gets you not only RAW external video included but also ProRes capture to an external SSD via the USB-C port. With a small price difference to get such a useful feature, a lot of people might want to wait for this model.</p><p>Another terrific new capability is the updated in-body stabilization borrowed from the GH6. It\u2019s now much better at smoothing out vertical step motion than the S5, though there\u2019s still some side-to-side sway. It also has a \u201cBoost IS\u201d for handheld video where you don\u2019t need to move, keeping shots locked off like the camera\u2019s on a tripod. Can it replace your gimbal? In some cases, yes, but you'll have to work carefully as it still can't match a gimbal's smoothness.</p><figure><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II full-frame mirrorless camera review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cb5074e1-b2f6-11ed-b56f-384d0df09bee\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Video quality is excellent, with extremely sharp 4K 30p and 4K 60p that\u2019s just a touch less so. Colors are accurate and pleasing straight out of the camera, with natural-looking flesh tones. The 10-bit V-log video delivers a very solid 14+ stops of dynamic range, just slightly below Nikon and Sony models. That gave me plenty of room for extra creativity or to correct over- and underexposed shots.&nbsp;</p><p>The S5 is also good in low light, thanks to Panasonic\u2019s Dual Native ISO system. Don\u2019t expect Sony A7S III-level performance, but the Dual ISO system really keeps noise down at ISOs as high as 12,800 or even 25,600. You\u2019ll of course see noise when you boost shadows at those ISOs, but the grain looks quite natural. Anything below ISO 6400 has very little visible noise. One quirk is that it\u2019s best to use ISO 4000 instead of ISO 3200, as the Dual ISO is set for ISO 640 and ISO 4000.&nbsp;</p><p>As for rolling shutter, the S5 II is middling in this regard. It\u2019s most noticeable in 6K or supersampled 4K modes, but not bad at all with an APS-C crop. I\u2019d rate it as better than the higher-resolution A7 IV and about the same as Canon\u2019s R6 II.</p><p>Finally, Panasonic offers a lot of ways to monitor video not seen on rival cameras, including waveforms and vectorscopes. Those features are very useful to video pros, helping them nail exposure and color accuracy. And as mentioned, audio is very easy to work with thanks to a dedicated hub to adjust settings, along with both line and mic inputs.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Photography</h3><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Most people likely won\u2019t buy the S5 II for photography, but it\u2019s not bad at all in this department. It can handle bursts at up to 7 fps with the mechanical shutter or 30 fps in electronic mode. The buffer is quite impressive, as it allows for 200 shots in RAW before throttling \u2013 a full 6-seconds of uninterrupted 30 fps burst shooting.</p><p>At those speeds the autofocus largely keeps up, though it\u2019s not quite as fast or accurate as the R6 II and A7 IV AF systems. As with video, the photo autofocus isn\u2019t quite as smart or tenacious with subjects as Sony's A7 IV. Still, it\u2019s much better than the contrast-detect AF of the last model and up there with recent Nikon and Fujifilm AF systems.</p><p>Despite the fast electronic burst speeds, the S5 II has limited usage as a sports camera. The rolling shutter would impact shots with fast moving subjects, unless you use it in APS-C mode. That\u2019s a feasible option, but it reduces the resolution by half.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><section><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II sample image gallery\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/a8e69d00-b2f9-11ed-97ee-b75707ea3243\" /></section><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Given how well it handles video, photos are a piece of cake for the image stabilization system. It locks things down so well that I was able to shoot down to a quarter-second or even less and still get sharp images</p><p>Despite the shift to a sensor with phase-detect pixels, image quality hasn\u2019t suffered, with dynamic range just slightly below Sony and Nikon models. JPEGs offer a good balance between noise reduction and sharpness, while delivering natural colors and pleasing skin tones. If you want more control, the RAW photos dial up the dynamic range so you can claw back highlights or dig into shadows.&nbsp;</p><p>As with video, it also excels in low light, with very little noise up to ISO 6400, nothing too objectionable at ISO 12800 and usable images at ISO 25600 if you don\u2019t try to lift the shadows too much. Beyond that, the color grain in particular can get too harsh.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Wrap-up</h3><figure><img alt=\"Panasonic S5 II full-frame mirrorless camera review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cb1c1e70-b2f6-11ed-9fbe-37204dfd7094\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">With the autofocus finally keeping up with rival cameras, Panasonic\u2019s S5 II is an awesome full-frame vlogging and video camera option. Priced at $2,000, it\u2019s also a very strong value proposition, particularly for video shooters.</p><p>Its primary competition is the Sony A7 IV and Canon EOS R6 II. Both of those cameras are better for photography, but the S5 II is much better for video and particularly vlogging, thanks to the built-in monitoring tools and superior stabilization. If you want a better match of photography and video tools, Fujifilm\u2019s 40-megapixel $2,000 X-H2 is the best option \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind stepping down to an APS-C sensor.</p><p>In fact, the S5 II\u2019s greatest rival might be the upcoming S5 IIx. I\u2019d argue that many people paying $2,000 wouldn\u2019t hesitate to spend an extra $200 to get some pretty valuable features like ProRes SSD recording. Either way, it\u2019s Panasonic\u2019s best vlogging camera since the original GH5 and should rise to the top of many content creators\u2019 shopping lists.</p><p></p><p></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-ii-review-the-full-frame-vlogging-camera-youve-been-waiting-for-150028638.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-23 15:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "\u2018Star Trek: Picard,\u2019 cargo cults and the perils of success", "description": "<p><em>The following contains spoilers for Star Trek: Picard, Season Three, Episode Two: \u201cDisengage.\u201d</em></p><p><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> is a 1982 movie that arguably saved Star Trek as a going concern. It was a cheap movie, but writer-director Nicholas Meyer made thriftiness a virtue, building a paranoid submarine thriller out of steely glances and jousting phone calls. Despite having no love of Trek, Meyer painted a broad sweep of an older Jim Kirk, his life, death and rebirth with the help of a son he never knew he had. It\u2019s a sumptuous movie, full of smart dialogue and characterisation, with a drum-tight plot and great acting, not just a great Star Trek film, but a great film, period. And sometimes, I feel that its critical and commercial success was so big that it\u2019s been to Star Trek\u2019s overall detriment.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Whenever the creative well runs dry, Trek runs back to old comforts, and the <em>Next Generation</em> movies were perpetually looking for its own <em>Khan</em>. <em>First Contact</em> flipped the Moby Dick narrative, making Picard the Ahab against the Borg\u2019s white whale. <em>Insurrection</em> borrowed the setting of Khan\u2019s climatic finale, while <em>Nemesis</em> borrowed its plot beats; a wounded ship only saved by the heroic sacrifice of each series\u2019 Tin Man character. <em>Into Darkness</em> then winkingly inverted those same plot beats, with Kirk nobly \u201cdying\u201d in place of his best friend.</p><p><em>Picard\u2019s</em> been telegraphing its intentions from the get-go, dropping every nod to fans about where we\u2019d wind up. The Bennett-era movie callbacks remain en vogue here, and to my memory this is the first use of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_beam\">Blaster Beam</a>, or a soundalike, in a streaming era soundtrack. Much like all of the other nods, we\u2019re watching a cargo cult being assembled in real time, boldly serving us up something we\u2019ve only seen, oooh, four or five times at this point. So: Wounded hero ship facing off against a more powerful enemy? Check. Inside a nebula that\u2019s disrupting normal starship functions? Check. With our lead suddenly presented with the news he has a son he never knew about? <em>Check check check</em>.</p><p>This week, Picard and Riker make it to the Helios to find Beverley in her stasis pod, guarded by her son, Jack. He\u2019s a rakish Englishman who has already spoken <em>two whole words in French</em> while negotiating with a corrupt Fenris Ranger. After being rescued by the Titan, Riker starts hinting about the younger Crusher\u2019s parentage, as if being the world\u2019s most English Frenchman is a genetic trait. It isn\u2019t long before Crusher is outed as an intergalactic con man and fugitive, and Shaw has him sent to the brig. He also, after several hours of allowing her to remain on the bridge giving orders to people, dismisses Seven for indulging two people we keep being told are \u201clegends\u201d and \u201cheroes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s plenty of furrowed brows as Picard initially refuses to consider that he might have a son, and at no point does anyone suggest running a paternity test. You might expect it would be easy enough to whip out a tricorder or hypospray, or even the transporter records, and find the truth. But, you know, that would be too efficient, so we\u2019re left with Picard and Jack facing off in the brig. Now, credit where due, Patrick Stewart and Ed Speelers sell the hell out of this scene, the first that feels in any way real so far.</p><p>All the while, the Titan is menaced by Amanda Plummer\u2019s villain, who we know is evil because she\u2019s smoking on the bridge of her ship, the Shrike, indoors! I wonder if this, too, is another nod to those older films given Plummer\u2019s father faced off against Kirk in <em>The Undiscovered Country</em>. Maybe this is why I\u2019m so out of step with so much of the (positive) critical consensus around this run. I find this raiding of Star Trek\u2019s own text and paratext to be insular and repetitive, with it more interested in placating disaffected fanboys than telling a story with a point of view. If you want strange new worlds, new life forms and new civilizations, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html\">watch the show set 142 years earlier</a>.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Raffi. Last week, she uncovered that some nefarious type had stolen some deep tech from <del>Aperture Science</del> Starfleet. At the end of that episode, a Starfleet recruitment building big enough to fill the donut hole in Apple Park gets Portal-ed into dust, killing (just) 117 people. Now, looking to make amends for her, uh, failure? She\u2019s looking into local crims in order to find out who exactly was responsible for the seemingly-unwarranted attack.</p><p>Now, this is the plot beat I <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-3-paramount-plus-preview-review-080010710.html\">alluded to in my preview</a>, when Raffi, who is in recovery, is forced to do drugs in order to prove she\u2019s not an undercover agent. The portentous music and Michelle Hurd\u2019s acting sells the notion this isn\u2019t a great idea, but Raffi\u2019s committed to the cause. But while she\u2019s incapacitated, her handler comes in to rescue everyone with some good, old-fashioned Mek\u2019leth carnage. I couldn't help but feel a punch in the air when Worf popped up in all his glory, but the tonal jump doesn't sit well with me.&nbsp;</p><p>You could be wondering why the Federation Ambassador to the Klingon Empire is doing covert intelligence work. But, by the end of the <em>Next Generation</em> movies, it was clear that Worf would just show up for a visit whenever the plot required. And even I\u2019m not going to harp on about this too much, because it is never a chore to watch Michael Dorn do his work. As<em> EW\u2019s</em> Darren Franich said <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2016/06/10/star-trek-generations-end-cinema/\">in his definitive Star Trek essay series</a>, \u201cMichael Dorn knew Worf only got cooler when the show made him look goofy.\u201d As goofy as he is here, he\u2019s still Worf, and you just wish that Paramount had greenlit a Worf show three years ago instead.</p><p>I had hoped this episode, for its laggy table-laying, may be looking for a way to attack a well worn but fundamentally strong Star Trek trope. That being if it\u2019s right and proper to hand over a potentially-innocent man to frontier justice, and if not, why not? There\u2019s plenty of angles for the argument given the many shades of gray that most people can now comprehend. After all, the Titan is outside Federation space, and so you can\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t, impose your values on those beyond your worldview. That can be countered by someone saying that natural justice is, or should be a universal virtue. And that these debates must sit side-by-side with the notion that the needs of the many (the 500-plus souls on the USS Titan) outweigh the needs of the few, or the (Jack Crusher) one. You could even have the supposedly \u201cright\u201d argument, the one aping Spock\u2019s famous aphorism, espoused by the character most seen as an asshole, too. But no.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Picard</em> remains bad for all of the same reasons that pretty much every other <em>Khan</em> copy is bad: It has almost nothing to say. In fact, this episode seems to hinge on every person in the narrative suddenly becoming incapable of doing even the basic parts of their jobs. Since when would a security officer not search a prisoner for hidden technology before putting them in the brig? Since when would a ship at Red Alert be taken by surprise when a hostile vessel in front of them starts attacking? And why did nobody have the presence of mind to run a paternity test, which surely at this point in history could be done with the ship\u2019s internal sensors? Not to mention, why didn\u2019t Jack just tell the security guard he\u2019d like to hand himself over rather than knocking him out? Maybe so we could have a few more moments of tension before the Titan chooses to make a break for the nebula and we roll the credits.</p><p>You may think I\u2019m banging on unnecessarily about <em>The Wrath of Khan </em>but I think it\u2019s justified here. If the production team weren\u2019t looking to invite comparisons to a vastly superior project then they were unwise to take so many of its plot beats as its own. I mean, in <em>Wrath of Khan</em>, Kirk has sixty seconds to find a way to even things up between the wounded Enterprise and the Reliant. And he does so with a little bit of theatrics, some ingenuity, and by showing that he was a little cleverer than anybody gave him credit for being. When <em>this version</em> of Picard is placed in the same situation but given <em>a whole hour to come up with something</em>, what does he do? He marks time on the bridge while the younger actors with plausible-looking stunt performers can do the now obligatory punch fight so that the audience at home doesn\u2019t start getting bored.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-2-disengage-review-140016201.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-23 14:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "YouTube lets creators add multi-language voice tracks to their videos", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-musics-redesigned-radio-experience-allows-you-to-create-totally-custom-stations-181729501.html\">YouTube</a> viewers from around the world might start finding more videos with audio in their native language.

Early testers apparently uploaded 3,500 videos in over 40 languages last month, and viewers watched over 2 million hours of dubbed video everyday in January.

MrBeast runs multiple channels in 11 different languages, but in an interview, he said that it would be much easier to maintain just one. It's also probably a plus that anybody clicking on a link shared by someone speaking another language will be able to understand it simply by changing the dubbed audio.&nbsp;</p><p>After switching to their preferred language for the first time, the website will default to it whenever they watch videos with dubs. Viewers will also be able to search for content dubbed in their language, even if the video's primary tongue is different, through translated titles and descriptions.

It\u2019s filled with alien biology and vistas that wouldn't be out of place on distant planets. But while that sounds like the perfect setup for a fun sci-fi romp, I never bought it. And, unfortunately, the actors didn't appear to buy it either. The backgrounds looked like psychedelic screensavers, and, similar to the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels, there was an uncanny disconnect between the live humans and their mostly digital surroundings.</p><p>I found the aesthetic so viscerally ugly, it made me fear for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and for anything else made with ILM's StageCraft technology (AKA \u201cthe volume\u201d). That realization surprised me, since I've mostly enjoyed how that tech helped make <em>The Mandalorian's</em> unique worlds come alive. The volume is a series of enormous LED walls that can display real time footage. Together with interactive lighting, it makes actors seem like they\u2019re actually walking around artificial environments. Another plus?

Its artificiality seems partially intentional, as it's trying to evoke pulp fantasy and even a bit of <em>Star Wars. </em>But somewhere along the line, director Peyton Reed forgot to ground its fantastical visuals with anything resembling human emotion. When Ant-Man, his daughter, or their tiny-tech compatriots, Hank Pym (Michael Douglass) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), enter the Quantum Realm, there's little room for awe and wonder. Sure, they occasionally quip about something weird: buildings that move! An alien intrigued by body holes!

What works so well in <em>Mandalorian </em>is they have a lot of lead time, because they're doing a whole series, to invest and create these environments, and on the schedule we were on, it's not always right for that situation.\"</p><p>Several <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2023/02/marvel-vfx-workers-on-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania.html?utm_source=pocket_saves\">anonymous VFX workers told <em>Vulture</em></a>that Quantumania\u2019s hectic production schedule was one reason its computer generated worlds fall so flat. The higher-profile <em>Black Panther</em> sequel, <em>Wakanda Forever</em>, was a higher priority for Marvel (no surprise when that first movie made over $1.3 billion globally) when it came to VFX work. And there were apparently late-stage changes to <em>Quantumania</em> that led to some rushed work \u2013 though it\u2019s worth noting that isn\u2019t unusual for a major Marvel film.</p><p>\u201cMaking big pivots late in the game has consequences, and there is a constant scramble from the VFX houses to keep up,\u201d a former VFX worker told Engadget. (They requested anonymity due to confidentiality agreements around their work.] \u201cAnd near the end, it's almost always a disaster. Lots of miracles. Lots of clever solutions, not based on heightening the art, but just being able to do a week\u2019s worth of work in 24 hours.\u201d</p><section><img alt=\"(L-R): Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man in Marvel Studios' ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA.

That film goes even further than <em>Ant-Man</em>, since almost every scene involves actors playing CG Na\u2019vi characters, one or two humans and elaborate sets. But I never once doubted the reality of <em>The Way of Water.</em></p><p>You could tell that director James Cameron has actually been thinking about the world of Pandora for over a decade, so he has a strong vision of how the Na'vi are supposed to interact with their animal companions, or how a soulless corporation may view a pristine planet as a way to make more revenue. With Quantumania, there's no clear sense of why that sub-atomic universe is special, or why Kang may want to rule it. We might as well be watching a lesser <em>Star Wars</em> movie.</p><figure><img alt=\"(L-R): Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, Kathryn Newton as Cassandra \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/75555d50-b2ef-11ed-b4bf-58966ff428f0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Marvel</div></figure><p>Perhaps that's why the volume rubbed me the wrong way this time around. When you have a stronger grasp of character and story, as <em>The Mandalorian</em> (mostly) demonstrated, it can help to make the entire experience feel more epic. But if your narrative is dull and unfocused, the volume can easily heighten its flaws. There's room to do something truly special with the idea of a sub-atomic universe, the sort of thing screenwriter Jeff Loveness frequently did on <em>Rick and Morty.</em></p><p>In the end, though, Quantumania feels like an episode of that show stretched out to two hours, and molded to fit the plot machinations of the MCU.

It turns out we found something so unexpected it actually creates problems for science. It calls the whole picture of early galaxy formation into question,\" Leja said. James Webb previously captured images of even older galaxies that formed around 350 million years after the Big Bang. But they're tiny and don't challenge our knowledge of astrophysics.&nbsp;</p><p>For these six galaxies to appear old and massive means they were forming hundreds of stars a year shortly after the Big Bang. In comparison, the Milky Way only forms around one to two new stars every year. Further, these potential galaxies are about 30 times more compact in size than ours despite having as many stars.&nbsp;</p><p>The scientists admit that there's a possibility that the fuzzy red dots they saw are something else, such as faint quasars or supermassive black holes. They could also be smaller in reality compared to the projected size the scientists got from their calculations. The team needs more data and to verify their findings through spectroscopy, but they think they could have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/webb-space-telescope-galaxies-e806176f01487742e9973e99adb24418\">official confirmation sometime next year</a>.&nbsp;</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-ancient-galaxies-theoretically-should-not-exist-102034475.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-23 10:20:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Samsung is readying its own smartphone-to-satellite communication platform", "description": "<p>There was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2023-event-preview-galaxy-s23-160039754.html\">speculation</a> that Samsung could use smartphone-to-satellite technology in its Galaxy S23 much like Apple has for the iPhone 14, but that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-satellite-messaging-android-211037007.html\">didn't happen</a> in the end.

It simulated the tech using its Exynos Modem 5300 platform &quot;to accurately predict satellite locations and minimize frequency offsets caused by Doppler shift,&quot; the company said. That will help pave the way for hybrid terrestrial-NTN networks &quot;in preparation for the arrival of 6G,&quot; said Samsung VP Min Goo Kim.&nbsp;</p><p>At CES 2023, Qualcomm unveiled <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-satellite-messaging-android-211037007.html\">Snapdragon Satellite</a>, technology that would allow smartphones to send messages when no cellular signal is available.

Since Samsung's Galaxy S23 has both chips, it was thought the device may offer satellite communication technology to match Apple's iPhone 14.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Samsung mobile experience VP TM Roh said it wasn't the best moment, as satellite functionality is still fairly limited. &quot;When there is the right timing, infrastructure and the technology is ready, then of course for Samsung Galaxy, for our mobile division, we would also actively consider adopting this feature as well,&quot; he told <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsungs-galaxy-s23-skips-out-on-satellite-connectivity-for-now/\"><em>CNET</em></a> in an interview.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsung-is-readying-its-own-smartphone-to-satellite-communication-platform-092522234.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-23 09:25:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Roland SH-4d is a groovebox disguised as a synthesizer", "description": "<p>A lot of Roland's recent instruments, that aren't just <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roland-replicates-more-classic-synths-with-the-jd-08-and-jx-8-sound-modules-080042484.html\">rehashes</a> of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html\">classic gear</a>, take an &quot;everything and the kitchen sink&quot; approach. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roland-tr-6-s-review-classic-drum-machines-808-909-portable-143001780.html\">Sampling and drum synthesis</a>?

A dedicated <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roland-verselab-mv-1-groovebox-vocalists-hands-on-080016948.html\">vocal effect section</a> and phantom power for running a condenser mic? Would be silly not to. The SH-4d follows the same basic formula, it has basically any feature you could want, and few you wonder who would want them, but sticks it in a box focused synthesis and sound design (mostly).</p><p>Unlike most of Roland's newer fare though, the SH-4d has plenty of hands-on controls. There's a full two octave keyboard, 16-step sequencer buttons, four faders and 32 knobs. It even has motion controls for some reason \u2014 You can actually pick up the synth and tilt it to change parameters. I'm not sure what the appeal of that is, but you know what, I'm just glad to see <a href=\"https://www.roland.com/us/\">Roland</a> adding controls instead of stripping back more.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"bd6c329b49834b35b3fdaa0649d72d8d\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Under the hood is a robust sound engine with 11 oscillator types, ranging from emulations of classic analog sounds from Juno-106 and SH-101, to metallic FM tones, PCM samples and 31 different wavetables. There's a multi-mode filter, an amp envelope, and LFO and a multi-effects engine with 93 different options, including nine reverb types and five choruses. The 128 x 64 LED screen isn't the sharpest, but it's definitely an improvement on the somewhat archaic seeming displays on the Verselab and TR-6S</p><p>Based on the demo clips, it seems like the instrument is leaning heavily into Roland's legacy as a cornerstone of techno, house and other electronic dance music. But it's it will likely be versatile enough to work for other genres as well. As long as you're pairing it with other instruments.</p><p>But the SH-4d doesn't stop at sound design. There's also a five track, 64-step polyphonic sequencer with motion recording and three different playback modes. The first four tracks can control any of the 11 oscillator models, The fifth is a dedicated rhythm track that can play back a selection of 439 different samples and virtual analog waves.&nbsp;</p><p>The sequencer and rhythm section turn the SH-4d into more of a groovebox than a synth, which has kind of been Roland's specialty over these last few year. But its interface definitely screams synthesizer, which is a welcome change from the menu-divey affairs the company has been pumping out recently.&nbsp;</p><p>At nearly four pounds and over a foot wide, not to mention almost eight inches deep, the SH-4d isn't super portable, but it can be powered four AA batteries none the less. You can also power it with a standard USB-C charger like you might use for your phone, which is nice. Plus, at least you know it won't eat up too much desk space. The Roland SH-4d will be arriving sometime in March for $650.</p><div id=\"a11761f05ed146c099622b3298397923\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-roland-sh-4d-is-a-groovebox-disguised-as-a-synthesizer-080026322.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-23 08:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Uber puts a ride tracker on the iPhone lock screen", "description": "<p>Uber has <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2cd8d8eb-701c-4377-94c5-920a8345ffac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Uber&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyY2Q4ZDhlYi03MDFjLTQzNzctOTRjNS05MjBhODM0NWZmYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWJlci5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vd2VyZS1yZWRlc2lnbmluZy10aGUtdWJlci1hcHAtanVzdC1mb3IteW91LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTRlZTdlMDAtNmU5Mi00YTkyLTlhMDUtMWE4YTI4MWE1ZmM3In0&amp;signature=AQAAARijvxjqncpLFLopojABFd7X2pcTHLjEALlIFt3o52Tn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fwere-redesigning-the-uber-app-just-for-you%2F\">rolled out</a> an update for its iPhone app that gives you the capability to see at a glance whether it's time to head out the door and meet the ride you ordered.
