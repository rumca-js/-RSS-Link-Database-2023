Today we take a look at the Pip, a handheld for makers hackers and Retro gamers. This was a kickstarter way back in 2017 and the small company curious chip finally got around to shipping these out to backers in 2022. Powered by a Raspberry pi compute module, a 5MP pi camera and detachable controllers this handheld could have made waves if it was released in time. A viewer was kind enough to send this over so we could take a look at the pip and test it out.
