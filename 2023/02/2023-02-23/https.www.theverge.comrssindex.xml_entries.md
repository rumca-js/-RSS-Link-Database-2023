  <p id="TgWBoI">During Sony’s first State of Play of 2023, we were offered an extended look at Rocksteady’s first game in a handful of years — <em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>. </p>
<p id="is3hC3">In <em>Kill The Justice League</em>, the titular doomed heroes are tasked with saving Metropolis from a Justice League corrupted by Brainiac. Despite the fact you won’t be playing as Batman, <em>Kill The Justice League</em> knows what players want, and that’s to swoop around a dark metropolis — one of the first scenes of gameplay is Harley Quinn grappling through the air. It looks like the villains you’ll get to play as (Harley Quinn, King Shark, Captain Boomerang, and Deadshot) will have their own unique flying mechanics, which looked pretty sick in the featurette. </p>

<p id="g9wgLT">The trailer is chock-full of iconic moments from the original game, making me think that it’s going to do justice to the classic horror title. Here are just a few that I saw: Leon and Ashley dodging catapulted debris on the castle walls; Leon taking on two El Gigante enemies at once; Leon coming face-to-face with Major Jack Krauser; and even a showdown in what appears to be <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Castle/Water_hall">that giant pool-filled hall in the castle</a>. I can’t wait to play it myself.</p>

  <p id="vOK0mv"><em>Before Your Eyes</em>, the critically acclaimed first-person narrative title, is coming to PlayStation VR2 on March 10th, Sony revealed during its PlayStation State of Play presentation on Thursday. We already knew the game was part of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562382/sony-playstation-vr-2-launch-titles-tetris-gran-turismo">just-released headset’s launch window</a>, but now we know exactly when we can play it. </p>
<p id="7S11sp">The game appears to use the PSVR 2’s eye-tracking capabilities to great effect. “Utilize the PlayStation VR2’s advanced eye-tracking technology to control the flow of the story as you relive precious memories of family, first love and the rise of an artistic career, all without the need of a controller,” according to the description <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OhfCk51Mo">for a trailer shown during the show</a>. “The headset’s front-facing camera immerses you in a...</p>

  <p id="VD6Arl">Twitter Spaces, the company’s social audio rooms, no longer lets you use captions if you’re listening on iOS.

<p id="SYtDle">On other platforms, it seems like captions should work but don’t. When listening to a Space on the web, captions don’t show, and while the “CC” closed captions button is present, clicking it on or off doesn’t change anything. On Android, the option to turn on captions is there, but it didn’t work for one <em>Verge</em> staffer.</p>

Google seems to think so. Today, the company is <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/new-content-pages/">announcing some tweaks to the Google TV interface</a>. “Movies” and “Shows” are being dropped from the main navigation bar at the top and will now be found beneath the row of your favorite streaming apps in the “For You” tab. </p>

  <p id="gnako3">Google’s Workspace apps are getting a makeover. Google plans to refresh the design of Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides in the coming weeks to more closely align with its Material Design 3 design system, <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/productivity-collaboration/more-flow-less-work-smart-canvas">the company announced on Thursday</a>.</p>
<p id="Tzf9xY">If you’re familiar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23447929/google-gmail-redesign-integrated-chat-meet-spaces">Gmail’s refreshed look</a>, the new designs take a lot of cues from that. Google appears to be adding a few more darker hues to things like the toolbar and comments to make them stand out from the white page of a document. The “Share” button is also more rounded, a change from the rounded-corner rectangle Google currently uses for the button. </p>
<p id="62zbmp">You can get an idea of what the changes will look like in the image below of Google Docs. </p>

  <p id="o3CJfT">Outside of tech blogging, my background is mainly film, and my main gig is primarily as a video editor and producer. If you, like me, have spent more than 15 years in front of a computer pulling your hair out trying to fix problems, you’ll probably end up accruing a go-to list of problem-solving programs to install on every computer you use. </p>
<p id="Uvab8J">Interestingly, these tend to be free, probably because most of the common problems are universal, and that usually means someone has thought of that already and gotten mad enough to fix it. And if someone on GitHub or an obscure video encoding forum has not solved the issue, there’s some great shareware software out there that won’t break the bank. </p>

<p id="1Wkp6M">The <strong>2TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD</strong> with an included heatsink is selling for a new low price of $159.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop-links.co/cjb1A6xHXMZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> on a one-day deal. That beats its previous low by $10, saving you an outright $110 off its full price. While this is a speedy drive for a desktop PC, you can use it to upgrade the storage of your PlayStation 5, especially since it includes the requisite heatsink. If you haven’t opened up your PS5 and given it a storage boost yet, we can’t recommend this SSD enough because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">it’s very easy to install</a>, and the 667GB of available built-in storage runs out quickly when you install 100GB-plus...</p>

  <p id="HHARh7">Over 40,000 <em>Dota 2</em> accounts have been permanently banned in the last few weeks after they were caught red-handed using third-party software to cheat the game. In a <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3677788723152833273">blog post</a> published on Tuesday, Valve revealed that it had recently patched a known issue used by third-party software to cheat in <em>Dota</em> while simultaneously setting a honeypot trap to catch players using the exploit.</p>
<p id="2FJdtN">According to Valve, the cheating software gave its users an unfair advantage by accessing information used internally by the <em>Dota</em> client that shouldn’t be visible during gameplay. After investigating how it worked, the developer then decided to identify and remove the “bad actors” from the active <em>Dota</em> playerbase. </p>

  <p id="DDUjrV">Spotify’s newest feature is an AI-powered DJ that curates and commentates on an ever-changing personalized playlist. Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/">describes</a> it as an “AI DJ in your pocket” that “knows you and your music taste so well that it can choose what to play for you.”</p>
<p id="V1QvQC">We’ll have to test the feature for ourselves to see how well these claims stand up, but in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok-aNnc0Dko&amp;t">launch trailer</a> and clips shared on social media, the feature seems to rather accurately mimic a radio station presenter, dropping in little bits of trivia and commentary about the artist or track while smoothly transitioning between songs. </p>
<p id="KVoliZ">The playlist is endless, but users can apparently switch genres or artists by hitting the on-screen DJ button. Based on this feedback, the feature should...</p>

  <p id="6XqnMT">In less than a week, some of the world’s biggest mobile players will be crowded into the Fira de Barcelona convention center, ready to show off their latest generation of mobile devices. In previous years, that’s meant everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/25/17044990/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-price-release-date-phone-camera-specs-mwc">flagship smartphone announcements from Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/26/14741886/lg-g6-announced-specs-features-mwc-2017">LG</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business">RIP</a>), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/24/5439928/samsung-gear-2-gear-2-neo-handson">smartwatches</a>, and even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/6/8160909/mobile-world-congress-2015-recap-announcements-vr">launch of the original HTC Vive</a>. </p>
<p id="taSuvg">These days, however, things feel a little different. Despite the “World” in Mobile World Congress, MWC Barcelona feels increasingly focused on Europe. The global smartphone market has never been a cohesive whole, but the US and China feel more than ever like they’re diverging from everywhere else. And that’s left MWC in a weird spot.</p>

  <p id="24eCQi">Snapchat users will soon have a handful of new tools to make content that includes trending songs or sounds.</p>
<p id="2j8I58">First, the company is introducing a sound recommendation system for Lenses, its popular augmented reality (AR) filters. Users will be able to discover which sounds other people are using with the lens they’ve applied and add popular audio to their own photos or videos. The feature is now available to US users and rolling out globally.</p>
<p id="FkMmPR">Snapchat is also adding a feature that automatically syncs uploaded photos and videos to the beat of songs when making a montage. Users can add anywhere from four to 20 photos and videos; the feature could be helpful when making content based on trending audio or challenges.</p>

  <p id="UBp4hm">If you typically access your Hotmail or Outlook account using the Gmail app, there’s a reason you probably haven’t seen any new emails today: Google says it’s investigating an issue it’s having syncing with Microsoft’s servers. According to <a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus/dashboard/incidents/V6iuL1ynvM3yaXGA2zaK">Google’s status page</a>, the company has been working to figure out what’s wrong since around noon ET, and has been in touch with Microsoft about the problem.</p>
<p id="y5mqPR">At first glance it seems like this partial outage would be a pretty niche issue — Outlook has its own app, who’s using the Gmail one? But for many Android phones the Gmail app is the default mail client, and it encourages you to add email address from any service, not just Google’s. If you’ve gone that route, it is worth noting that Outlook itself...</p>

  <p id="pbCbxN">It’s time to dust off your trusty crowbar and see it in a new light, complete with colorful reflections. A PC mod of the original <em>Half-Life</em> from 1998 that adds realtime path-traced ray tracing to the game is now available, and it’s absolutely gorgeous. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsteDE8h6jc">First teased</a> by its creator  <a href="https://github.com/sultim-t">sultim_t</a> (Sultim Tsyrendashiev) over a year ago, the mod pack is <a href="https://github.com/sultim-t/xash-rt/releases">now available to download on GitHub</a> to install and play with the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/"><em>Half-Life</em> on Steam</a>.</p>
