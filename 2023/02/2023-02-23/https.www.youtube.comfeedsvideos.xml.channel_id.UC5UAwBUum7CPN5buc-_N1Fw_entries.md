No 2 ways about it, this is a big device. It has a 17 inch screen, 16:10. It weighs 2.8 kilos, and it's 38 cm wide, 27 cm deep, and 2.7 cm thick.  

The chassis is made of aluminium and has literally no flex, no bend, no creaking. It also resists fingerprints really well, thanks to a soft touch coating on the inside of the laptop.

You're free to open it, and you can access and replace the 2 M.2 SSD slots, the RAM, the wireless card, and the battery as well, which is screwed in and not glued.

The CPU is the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX. All models come with at least 16 gigs of RAM, and an RTX 3070Ti with 8Gigs of vRAM. You also get 250 gigs of PCIe3 SSD, and Wifi 6 + BLuetooth 5.2.

It can go up to 64 Gigs of 4800 Mhz RAM, up to 4TB of PCIe 4 storage, and, either an RTX 3080, or a 3080Ti. And all cards run at their maximum Total Graphics Power allowed by Nvidia,. You also get a 99Wh battery.

On geekbench 6, it gave me scores of 2121 in single core, and 10219 in multi core.

I ran the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark, at high settings, at the native resolution of 2560x1600, and it got me an average of 101 FPS. When cranking all the settings to the max, still at the native resolution, it managed to reach 97 FPS. At 1080p highest details, the Stellaris 17 got 110FPS.

It also gave me an idea about thermals, at 75 ¬∞C under heavy load, which isn't bad at all.

With its 99Wh battery, running in Nvidia on demand mode, with the display at 50% brightness, wifi being used to play youtube videos in a loop in Firefox, the laptop lasted for 8 hours and 12 minutes.

The keyboard uses Cherry MX ultra low profile switches. The key travel is really good, at 1.8 mm, and the click happens at 0.8 mm. Some of the keys aren't using mechanical switches, notably the function keys and the whole numpad, they're using membrane switches instead.

The touchpad is humongous. It's also thankfully centered, and it's covered in glass, so it's really smooth. It feels very precise, and using it with tap to click feels great.

It's a diveboard mechanism, so obviously you can't click everywhere on it, it has to be in the bottom half of the touchpad, and the sound it makes is satisfying and doesn't rattle.

The dislay 16:10, 17 inches, and it goes up to 240hz refresh rate. It is G Sync compatible, to avoid any screen tearing issues. It's decently bright, at 380 nits, and it has full sRGB coverage.


In terms of ports, on the left, you get the usual Kensington Lock, a USB-A 3.2 Gen2x1 port, a microphone input, and a headphone jack. On the right, you get an SD card reader, and 2 USB-A 3.2 Gen1 ports. And on the back, you have a port for the Aquaris external watercooling solution, a USB-C 3.2 Gen2x1 port, an HDMI 2.1 port, a Gigabit ethernet port, and a barrel jack.

Let's finish with the mic, speakers and webcam. The microphone is decent, but nothing to write home about. You'll want to run it at about 25% volume. The speakers get really loud, but they don't distort or sound tinny at all, they have a good amount of bass.

As per the webcam, well it's 1080p, and it can produce good results with decent lighting, but it's still a bit grainy even in natural light. It's just a small notch above the usual potato cam.
