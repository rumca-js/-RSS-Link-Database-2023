[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Somerville Roads Getting More Dangerous?", "description": "<p><span>\n\nIn a local discussion of whether our attempts to reduce traffic\nfatalities were working someone posted:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI've lived in Somerville for over 40 years and have visited even\nlonger. The roads are more dangerous than ever.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWith all the <a href=\"https://www.somervillema.gov/departments/programs/vision-zero-somerville\">Vision\nZero</a> work, and earlier traffic safety progress, this would be\nsurprising and disappointing if it were the case.  Is it?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSomerville is an interesting city to look at because it was mostly\nbuilt out decades ago.  The last large change was bulldozing I-93\nthrough in the late 1960s:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/buldozing-i93-1969-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/buldozing-i93-1969.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis makes fatality rates over time comparable in a way they wouldn't\nbe if you were looking at a city that had expanded, contracted, or\nbeen seriously rebuilt.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI pulled accident date from the national <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars\">Fatality\nAnalysis Reporting System</a> (FARS) which goes back to 1975.  Here's\nwhat I see for the number of fatal crashes annually (<a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/fars/blob/main/somerville-process.py\">code</a>):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-annual-fatal-crashes-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-annual-fatal-crashes.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>blue bars are annual counts; red line is a 10y centered moving average</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOver the last 40y it's gotten about 3x better, though 2019 was a\npretty bad year.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'd also be interested in whether our roads are becoming more\ndangerous for pedestrians specifically.  Is the decrease just due to\nairbags, crash testing, and cars becoming safer for their occupants?\nWhile pedestrian data in FARS only goes back to 1991, we can still\ngraph what we have:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-annual-pedestrian-crashes-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-annual-pedestrian-crashes.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt does look like we're making progress specifically within pedestrian\nsafety as well, though 2019 now sticks out even more.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(I'm being lazy here and charting \"traffic accidents with a fatality\nand involving at least one pedestrian\".  The FARS data does make it\npossible to see whether it was a pedestrian that died, but this\nrequires joining CSVs in a way that's a bit awkward.  In the ones I've\nspot checked the fatality was a pedestrian, which is what you'd\nexpect.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0HNMqvdXZvuwrmX4pTRjc5Jp2HxdJzbvjcd9y1rpnSiWAaxJZ8hsZoPB5m6bKCkYKl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109915410632233894\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/somerville-roads-getting-more-dangerous", "date_published": "2023-02-23 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
