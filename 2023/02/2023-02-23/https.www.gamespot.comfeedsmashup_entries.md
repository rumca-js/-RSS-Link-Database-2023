<p>New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. have minted a deal to produce more Lord of the Rings films. While no details about future projects have been revealed, it is clear that movies will not be remakes or tread over already explored areas of Middle Earth.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/lord-of-the-rings-the-hobbit-movies-new-line-warner-bros-1235268633/">Deadline</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lord-of-the-rings-new-movies-in-the-works-1235332695/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav revealed the news on a company call discussing its Q4 2022 earnings. The deal was broken with Embracer Group, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/movies-based-on-lotrs-gandalf-aragorn-gollum-galadriel-and-more-could-happen/1100-6506600/">obtained the franchise's film rights in August 2022</a>. Warner Bros. and New Line were behind the Peter Jackson-helmed Lord of the Rings trilogy as well as the follow-up Hobbit films.</p><p>A statement from Warner Bros Pictures Group Co-CEOs Michael De Luca and Pam Addy indicate that the films will not explore the territory covered by those films. They said, "But for all the scope and detail lovingly packed into the two trilogies, the vast, complex and dazzling universe dreamed up by J.R.R. Tolkien remains largely unexplored on film. The opportunity to invite fans deeper into the cinematic world of Middle-earth is an honor, and we are excited to partner with Middle-earth Enterprises and Embracer on this adventure."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lord-of-the-rings-movies-in-the-works-wont-be-remakes-or-retread-old-ground/1100-6511794/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Baldur's Gate 3 Just Got A Bit Harder To Run On PC

<p>Baldur's Gate 3's system requirements just got a bit heftier, ahead of the game's August release date.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3640634026230039737">blog post</a> from developer Larian Studios, the game's "graphical fidelity and complexity has improved quite a bit as it's grown throughout Early Access." To better reflect the changes the game has undergone, the developer has changed the minimum system requirements. The post claims that the game may be playable with less advanced hardware than the minimum requirements. However, the game's performance will likely take a hit.</p><p>The minimum requirements are not too hefty, at least as far as new releases go. You'll need at least 8 GB of RAM and 4GB of VRAM to run the game smoothly, with those numbers doubled on the recommended specs. However, the game does require 150 GB of available space, which is plenty.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-just-got-a-bit-harder-to-run-on-pc/1100-6511792/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## All 31 Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies Ranked, Including Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4103792-ant-manandthewaspquantumania.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Marvel Cinematic Universe is the biggest entertainment franchise the world has ever seen, and that's because it's also the most prolific big franchise we've ever had, with 31 movies in 15 years. And now we have a bunch of TV shows, too. But today we're focusing on those movies.</p><p dir="ltr">When we first watched Iron Man all those years ago, few of us could have expected that it would spawn [frantic waving] all this. Even Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige, who was the face of this whole idea from the beginning, would probably be lying to you if he said he expected the MCU to turn into this much of a juggernaut. Hoped? Maybe. Expected? Never. Even after the first Avengers film took superhero movies to new box office heights, it would have been pretty hard to see <em>this</em> coming.</p><p dir="ltr">But here we are. The MCU has been a bit shaky since Avengers: Endgame, even for many of the most die-hard fans, thanks largely to there simply being too much of it, with few of the pieces interconnecting in meaningful ways so far.</p><p dir="ltr">But Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania has just begun Phase 5 of the franchise, and that means it's a new day for the MCU. While the franchise has been gearing up for the Multiverse Saga for a minute now, this new story of Kang the Conqueror is finally taking center stage. But how does this third Ant-Man film stack up against the best movies in the MCU? Let's find out by looking back on every single MCU film and ranking them.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>31. Avengers: Age of Ultron</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102872-avengersageofultron.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Do you like your summer mega-blockbusters to look like an episode of CSI, complete with TV-quality CGI? Then Joss Whedon's Avengers 2 is for you. It's really remarkable that an Avengers movie claims the worst CGI of any MCU film. The visual effects are so bad that Iron Man looks like he flew in from a Spy Kids movie during the big final battle.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>30. Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102858-ant-man3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Quantumania lacks pretty much everything that made the previous two Ant-Man movies work in favor of putting Ant-Man and his family at the center of a Guardians of the Galaxy movie. And there's no authorial stamp from director Peyton Reed here, so we're left with just a piece of Marvel formula that has no substance or meaning.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>29. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102886-shangchi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>I like Destin Daniel Cretton a lot, but <em>not</em> as the director of a Marvel movie. Or at least not of this one, which starts out well but then turns into an ugly CGI-fest that looks like the season finale of a Disney+ show. Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley keep it watchable, at least.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>28. The Incredible Hulk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102865-theincrediblehulk.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Every time I go back to this one, it tries to trick me. That slow-burn first act is seriously compelling stuff, following Bruce Banner as he tries to hide out in Brazil while keeping his greener side under wraps. But then, suddenly, a switch flips. And the film then makes it very clear very quickly that it's not some hidden gem from the early MCU.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>27. Captain Marvel</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102882-captainmarvel.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">I was frustrated with Captain Marvel when it came out because it bore no relevance to the rest of the MCU beyond introducing a character who would play a minor part in Avengers: Endgame, which came out six weeks later. Now, I also find it frustrating because it's an assembly line movie that has no real substance to speak of.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>26. Avengers: Endgame</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102883-avengersendgame.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">When you make a time-travel movie, there's one thing you absolutely must do: set your internal time travel logic, and then stick with it. Endgame talks about time travel rules that other movies have, but loses track of its own within minutes. And it's not any better with its characters or other areas of storytelling--this movie was three hours of naked pandering at the expense of making any freaking sense.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>25. Spider-Man: No Way Home</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102888-spider-mannowayhome.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">No Way Home feels like somebody wrote a Spider-Man movie, and then did a revision every time they signed a cast member from one of the previous Spider-Man movie series. The result is a film that feels like it has a half-dozen different plots that don't really function well together. And since it was probably written to take place <em>after</em> Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, nothing that Strange does makes any sense.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>24. The Avengers</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102868-avengers1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">We all fell under the spell of this crossover even when it came out, but Joss Whedon's faux-literary dialogue and network TV-quality shot composition have really not held up at all in the decade since. The MCU's first real declaration that it was extremely serious about the shared universe thing deserved better.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>23. Thor: The Dark World</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102870-thorthedarkworld2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">TV veteran Alan Taylor did his best with a movie that packs quite a visual punch, but endless retooling (Taylor was the film's second hired director after Patty Jenkins dropped out, and major plot changes occurred in reshoots) ultimately rendered this one an incoherent mess.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>22. Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102881-ant-manandthewasp.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">All the comedy of the first movie but without any kind of coherent plot. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on whether you can put the second part out of your mind. Since I'm the sort of person who actually cares about the big picture, it really bothers me that the story is nonsense. Even Paul Rudd's considerable charms don't help.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>21. Spider-Man: Far From Home</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102884-spider-manfarfromhome%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">It's pretty lucky that every single character from the first movie was snapped by Thanos. It makes it very easy to not deal with the fallout from Endgame. But Jake Gyllenhaal is a great MCU villain, and it would be pretty hard to not enjoy the return of JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson. It's still weird that its big plot twist was that it <em>isn't</em> a multiverse movie immediately before starting a multiverse saga.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Thor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102866-thor1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Remember when they let Kenneth Branagh direct a Marvel movie? It's not great or anything, but it's definitely a Kenneth Branagh movie. Which is to say this whole affair has a whiff of a classy Shakespearean stage production. That's turned it increasingly into a nice little early MCU curiosity because it's so out of step with the entire rest of the franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Captain America: The First Avenger</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102867-captainamerica1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">There's nothing really exceptional about this film, aside from its relentless competence. Its throwback visual style is a nice outlier for the MCU, its plot pretty much stays under control, and every member of the cast--from the core of Chris Evans, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Tommy Lee Jones, and Hugo Weaving on down--is great. And it's a World War II movie. If they tried to make something like this now, it would be worse.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17 (Tie). Guardians of the Galaxy 1 + 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102871-guardiansofthegalaxy1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Is a PG-13 James Gunn movie really a James Gunn movie? There's plenty to like about both of these films, and yes, they're better Star Wars movies than any actual Star Wars flick from the Disney era. But without Gunn's edge, they're just missing something, and the result is two similarly entertaining movies that have the same fatal flaw.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Iron Man 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102864-ironman2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The MCU's first sequel has a reputation for being incoherent, but it's not really any worse on that front than the vast majority of other Marvel movies. Swapping out Terrence Howard for Don Cheadle was a huge step up in terms of entertainment value--Terrence Howard is not funny <em>at all</em>--and Cheadle has a great rapport with RDJ from minute one. And Sam Rockwell's tech CEO with no practical skills is a character who has aged so, so well--it makes the Elon Musk cameo all the more hilarious in hindsight.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102889-doctorstrange2%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Multiverse of Madness is perhaps the film most emblematic of the troubles of the MCU's Phase 4. It takes place directly after Spider-Man: No Way Home but makes only one single reference of any kind to the events of that film. It takes place after WandaVision but has Wanda repeat verbatim the exact same character arc she had on that show. And it has director Sam Raimi doing awesome Sam Raimi things for the middle hour or so of the film--but the rest of it is more of the overtuned CGI nonsense that has been such a drag on the MCU and Disney+'s Star Wars shows.</p><p dir="ltr">That said: the awesome Sam Raimi things might be the peak of the whole MCU. Does that make the entire movie good? No.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Captain America: Civil War</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4103800-captainamericacivilwar.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">It's a generally pleasing action flick that is, for the most part, really well put together. It's also the movie that solidified the MCU formula, and it's tough to not hold a little bit of a grudge for that. But, to be fair, the reason why this movie became the Marvel template is because Civil War hit its spot so effectively.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Thor: Love and Thunder</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102890-thor4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">It is basically unforgivable that they would set up Asgardians of the Galaxy in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, and then just abort it after the opening scene of Love and Thunder. But, like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there are portions of this movie that are quite awesome--the cosmic black-and-white sequence and the part with Russell Crowe's Zeus come immediately to mind. But, also like that Doctor Strange film, the movie is significantly less than the sum of its parts.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Ant-Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102873-ant-man1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Genuinely funny heist comedy in the guise of a low-level superhero flick, the first Ant-Man is a textbook example of how the MCU should handle smaller, standalone movies--by keeping the stakes low and focused, instead of churning out yet another world-threatening baddie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Spider-Man: Homecoming</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102878-spider-manhomecoming.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man's first standalone adventure in the MCU is a relatively low-key high school affair with a villain who's the dad of the girl he's crushing on. It's also really funny and touching in the way that the best high school comedies usually are.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Black Widow</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102885-blackwidow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Cate Shortland put together a solid little Bourne-like spy flick that managed to make me care about a dead character's family drama. The two big CGI action sequences are both awful and unnecessary franchise insertions, but the other 85% of Black Widow's running time is quite good.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Avengers: Infinity War</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4103799-avengersinfinitywar.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">While certainly not free of flaws, Infinity War was the last time we had an MCU film that didn't feel like it was straining the formula from the start or like it had been retrofitted with a new plot in reshoots by different filmmakers (or both). And the Snap continues to be one of the great pop culture moments of the century, because the ending really was that good.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Thor: Ragnarok</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102875-thorragnarok.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Taika Waititi managed to make both a pretty good Thor movie and a pretty good Taika Waititi movie at the same time, and that combination made for an excellent and extremely memorable MCU entry. And it's still the best use of Mark Ruffalo's Hulk in the entire franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Iron Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4103793-ironman1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Before anybody had ever heard of the MCU, and before Marvel had established any kind of formula, and well before we had any sort of major expectations from the biggest movie franchise on Earth, we had a pretty normal superhero movie from the director of Elf. And it was great! Whether the MCU should have permanently modeled its entire sense of humor on Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is another discussion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Eternals</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102887-eternals.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Chloe Zhao made the most aesthetically distinct film in the MCU. That alone makes it better than most of the rest of the franchise. And that cast! Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Barry Keoghan, Ma Dong-seok, and Game of Thrones stars Richard Madden and Kit Harington? It's an incredibly watchable group of actors in a movie utterly unlike anything else in the MCU, and so of course the fans hated it. Their loss.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Iron Man 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102869-ironman3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">We can't help but pine for Shane Black's original vision--where Rebecca Hall was playing the main villain, but Marvel Comics wouldn't allow it because, according to Black, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/iron-man-3-villain-rebecca-hall">"that toy won‚Äôt sell as well if it‚Äôs a female."</a> But Guy Pearce is at least still fun as the bad guy we ended up with, and this re-pairing of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang director Black with Robert Downey Jr. is every bit as clever and energetic as we could have hoped for.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Black Panther</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102879-blackpanther1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Director Ryan Coogler arrived in the MCU with the best version of the Marvel template we've ever seen. While its aesthetics fell firmly within the norms of the franchise, its energy and subject matter did not. And with a seething Michael B. Jordan as the baddie playing against Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa, it was basically impossible not to get sucked in.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Doctor Strange</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102876-doctorstrange1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A mostly self-contained movie with its own unique aesthetic that explores a corner of the MCU--alternate dimensions--that even now has yet to be meaningfully dealth with any further. Now that we're 30+ movies into this franchise, that uniqueness has helped this film age shockingly well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102891-blackpanther2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There are really two movies in this one. There's Ryan Coogler's Black Panther sequel, which is hands-down the best movie in the MCU. That makes up probably 80% of Wakanda Forever. The other movie is every scene involving Martin Freeman or Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and both CGI-heavy battle sequences--these parts of the film would be awful in a vacuum, but they're extra terrible when you mix these scenes in with Coogler's visionary work elsewhere.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4102863-captainamericathewintersoldier.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Basically a Mission: Impossible movie in Marvel clothing, The Winter Soldier is too good for this franchise. How many other one-off performances from prestigious name actors in the MCU are we going to remember as much as we remember Robert Redford in this? Russell Crowe as Zeus is the only competition.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>PlayStation revealed the next batch of free games for PS Plus subscribers during February's State of Play livestream. The PlayStation Plus lineup for March 2023 includes Battlefield 2042, Minecraft Dungeons, and Code Vein. All three games will be available to claim starting March 7. Regardless of which membership tier you subscribe to, you'll be able to add March's games to your library.</p><p>Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of <strong>Battlefield 2042</strong> will be up for grabs. Though the latest entry in EA's long-running FPS series got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2021, consistent updates have been rolled out ever since that have improved the online experience. With Battlefield 2042 coming to PS Plus, you can expect an increase in player counts, so it will be a good time to give it a go.</p><p><strong>Minecraft Dungeons</strong> is essentially Minecraft's version of Diablo, and it's pretty darn good. Played from an isometric perspective, Minecraft Dungeons is all about slashing your way through groups of enemies in search of new loot. Like Diablo, Minecraft Dungeons really hits its stride the more you play and is best enjoyed with friends. This is a great family-friendly cooperative game to play with kids, and it could help you scratch that Diablo itch while waiting for Diablo 4.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-march-2023-revealed/1100-6511790/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>New details have emerged about this year's Call of Duty game. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/activision-s-call-of-duty-game-this-year-is-more-modern-warfare">Bloomberg reports</a> that Call of Duty 2023 will be, as rumored, an "extension" of 2022's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Sledgehammer Games will reportedly lead the development on this title.</p><p>The game, which reportedly will not be called Modern Warfare III, is said to have begun its development as a premium expansion to Modern Warfare II. But it evolved to become a "standalone, full-price release." Details are scant, but Bloomberg said the new game will feature some of the same maps and modes from Modern Warfare II.</p><p>The report went on to say that, in early 2022, Activision delayed a Call of Duty game from Treyarch from 2023 to 2024. This would have left 2023 as the first time in almost 20 years that Activision would not launch a full-on new entry in the Call of Duty series. It was at this time that Activision management told Sledgehammer Games it would be assigned to developing a "premium expansion" for Modern Warfare II to fill the gap.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2023-probably-wont-be-called-modern-warfare-3-report-says/1100-6511781/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Journey To Foundation Lets Players Explore Isaac Asimov's Sci-Fi Universe In VR

<p>Journey to Foundation is looking to give Isaac Asimov's legendary sci-fi book series the video game treatment, and it's coming to PlayStation VR 2 in Autumn 2023.</p><p>A trailer debuting as part of PlayStation's first State of Play for 2023 showed a first-look at what players will be up to in Journey to Foundation, as a narrator warns that the universe's existing interstellar empire will inevitably collapse and that the future of humanity will depend on what happens next. The trailer shows first-person stealth segments, conversations, platforming, and gunfights, as well a unique piece of technology that is able to incapacitate enemies.</p><div>          </div><p>In a PlayStation blog post, developer Archiact dives into the game's story, which will have players stepping into the shoes of Ward, an agent of the Commission of Public Safety tasked with investigating civil unrest in the empire. Eventually Ward will stumble upon a group of defectors who are looking for the mysterious Foundation founded by Hari Seldon, whose use of psychohistory has predicted the fall of the empire and a subsequent dark age that will follow. From there players will team up with the defectors to learn more about the Foundation and Seldon's plan to save humanity, but Archiact seems to tease that it will ultimately be up to players whether or not they go along with Seldon's mission or if they continue to fight for the doomed-to-fail empire.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/journey-to-foundation-lets-players-explore-isaac-asimovs-sci-fi-universe-in-vr/1100-6511782/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sony Pictures has released a new red band trailer for The Machine, a film that adapts comedian Bert Kreischer's real-life story about an encounter with the Russian mafia. For anyone just catching up, Kreischer got famous, in part, for his story about visiting Russia in college, drinking too much vodka, and getting mixed up with the wrong people.</p><p>This real-life story, which included his new Russian pals calling him "The Machine" for his drinking prowess, made Kreischer famous and he's been performing the story on stage as part of his routine for years. The movie takes place 23 years after the story that inspired it, with an aged Kreischer getting tracked down and kidnapped, along with his father played by Mark Hamill, by the Russian mob and brought back to the motherland to pay for his crimes.</p><div>          </div><p>"Together, he and his father must retrace the steps of his younger self (Jimmy Tatro) in the midst of a war between a sociopathic crime family while they attempt to find common ground," reads a line from the film's description.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mark-hamill-and-bert-kreischer-take-on-the-russian-mafia-in-the-machine-trailer/1100-6511779/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>During last year's D23 Expo, Marvel fans were treated to a surprise real-life performance of Rogers: The Musical, which was originally introduced in the first episode of Disney+'s Hawkeye series. The song performed was called "Save this City" which was written by multi-time Tony-nominated songwriting duo Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and is now coming to a Disneyland Resort. </p><p>The musical number loosely reimagines the Avengers' battle with the invading Chitauri at the end of the 2012 film. It was released as a single on the same day as the show's premiere episode.</p><p>Fans took to the song and it blew up Spotify charts, but now Disney has announced it will expand and actually make Rogers: The Musical a short one-act musical. It will be performed for a limited time this summer at Disney California Adventure Park.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hawkeyes-captain-america-musical-is-real-and-coming-to-disneyland-resort/1100-6511771/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The second season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a> added the new Ashika Island map, and there are now plenty of new locations in DMZ to score high-tier loot on both maps.

Head out into the water at this northern point of the map, swim further north to the Coastal Ruins, and dive down to locate a locked duffle bag underwater. This is found on the tac map as the top right portion of the D2 quadrant. You'll need the Drifting Supply Bag key to unlock this duffle, but once opened you'll be able to loot three Ashika masks. These masks can be sold for $25,000 each, so this is one of the easiest ways to get the cash you need to buy expensive upgrades like the three-plate vest and large backpack.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-dmz-best-loot-locations-for-season-2/1100-6511768/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Harry Potter author JK Rowling has been bathed in controversy in recent years, and though the precarious circumstances surrounding the creation of the first book are well-known, they're perhaps even more dire than we thought. As spotted by <a href="https://people.com/movies/jk-rowling-says-ex-husband-jorge-arantes-held-harry-potter-book-manuscript-hostage/">People</a>, in the first episode of a recent podcast, Rowling said that at one point her ex-husband Jorge Arantes stole her manuscript and hid it from her as a "hostage."</p><p dir="ltr">Rowling accused Arantes of being "violent and controlling," as well as searching her person every time she came home. She also claimed that she did not have a key to her own house, and that Arantes would burn, steal, or otherwise destroy the in-progress manuscript of the first Harry Potter book in order to control her.</p><p dir="ltr">She also said that she would photocopy the manuscript bit by bit in secret in order to avoid losing any progress on it. Rowling and Arantes married in October 1992 and divorced in June 1995. Rowling has <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/">previously accused</a> Arantes of domestic violence several times.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowling-feared-ex-husband-would-steal-and-burn-her-harry-potter-manuscript/1100-6511767/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>BioWare's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf/">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> community update dives deep into the creation of the upcoming RPG's skill tree, with BioWare detailing its philosophy behind the system and how the game's various designers help bring it to life in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf's skill tree is designed so that unlocking each new node "feels meaningful" and grants "significant power gains," BioWare states in the <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/02/23/bioware-community-update-all-by-design/">blog</a>. A variety of different nodes in the skill tree are there to provide more than simple stat boosts. Additionally, BioWare doesn't want any node in the skill tree to feel like a largely useless stepping stone to get to a "real" node, instead pushing for each node to be powerful and impactful in its own right.</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare's goal is to make the skill tree easy to navigate and easy to explore, so players can make a plan on how to build their character. That includes making it clear how many skill points players have to work with and making sure the nodes themselves are easy to understand, with clear descriptions or a video showing a node's effects where needed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-skill-tree-detailed-in-latest-community-update/1100-6511766/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Trailer For Sisu Is Essentially John Wick Vs. Nazis

<p>Sisu debuted at the Midnight Madness section of the Toronto International Film Festival back in September last year with Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquiring international distribution rights to the film, while Lionsgate acquired the rights in North America. The title comes from a Finnish concept of having stoic determination, tenacity of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and adamancy. It is held by Finns themselves to express their national character. You might find some similar visuals with the over-the-top violence of John Wick, since Lionsgate is also the studio behind that franchise, as well, who the trailer unabashedly tells you upfront. </p><p>The film takes place in Finnish Lapland during World War II, focusing on a gold digger named Aatami Korpi, played by Jorma Tommila (most notably known for cult classic Rare Exports). As Aatami goes to take the gold he finds to the nearest bank, which will be a lengthy journey by itself, he also has to escape from the Nazi patrol led by a brutal SS officer. Check out the absolutely brutal trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>Sisu had a Finnish release in late January and is finally heading to North America in April. Written and directed by Jalmari Helander, who previously gave us the aforementioned Rare Exports, but also the 2014 action movie Big Game, starring Samuel L. Jackson.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trailer-for-sisu-is-essentially-john-wick-vs-nazis/1100-6511765/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The PlayStation VR 2 has only just launched, but numerous users appear to be experiencing issues with the right Sense controller.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-users-report-controller-issues">Eurogamer</a>, a detailed thread has been shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/119fd6t/widespread_right_sense_issues_thread_cant_press_x/">PSVR subreddit</a> detailing several issues that appear to be occurring with the right Sense controller for the PSVR 2. "Like a lot of folks on here, I can‚Äôt get button presses on my right Sense controller to register in games," explains the poster, mentioning the X and R2 buttons in the head of the thread. The author noted that on the main PS5 menu, there's no issue with the buttons, so it might be a software-specific issue.</p><p dir="ltr">The thread lists a range of ways you can potentially fix the issue, starting with the official PlayStation method from the hardware's troubleshooting page, which is to turn the PS5 off, reset both controllers using a pin, plug the right controller into the console, turn the console on again, and pair the left Sense based on the on-screen directions.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-players-are-reporting-issues-with-their-sense-controllers/1100-6511759/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>HBO surprised some people recently when it canceled Westworld and announced that the existing seasons would shift to non-HBO platforms. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/last-of-us-white-lotus-casey-bloys-hbo-1235527633/">Variety</a>, HBO programming boss Casey Bloys said the higher-ups spent some time thinking about what was the right amount of money to spend on HBO Max original shows. Second, the team considered if every HBO show <em>needed</em> to run on HBO. The answer was no.</p><p>The decision, in the case of Westworld, was to cancel the planned fifth season and shift Seasons 1-4 to free ad-support TV (FAST) channels.</p><p>"These are expensive shows to make. The idea that they're going to sit in a library forever and ever for $15 a month, that's never how TV has operated," Bloys said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-boss-talks-about-westworld-leaving-the-platform-and-moving-to-free-platforms/1100-6511749/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Valve has banned more than 40,000 accounts in Dota 2 that were found to be cheating by releasing a patch that hid specific bits of data only cheaters could read.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, Valve released a <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3677788723152833273">blog post</a> that was quite bluntly called, "Cheaters Will Never Be Welcome In Dota," in which detailed recent steps it took to ban 40,000+ accounts that had been cheating in the game. The accounts that had been cheating were using third-party software that let them "access information used internally by the Dota client that wasn't visible during normal gameplay, giving the cheater an unfair advantage."</p><p dir="ltr">Once Valve understood the specific way that players were cheating, it released a pitch which "created a honeypot: a section of data inside the game client that would never be read during normal gameplay, but that could be read by these exploits." All of the accounts that had been banned at the time the blog was released had read from this "secret" area in the client, so Valve was very confident each ban was deserved.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-bans-more-than-40000-players-in-huge-dota-2-cheater-purge/1100-6511752/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Bethesda has confirmed that Tango Gameworks studio head Shinji Mikami is officially leaving the company. After 12 years at the studio that he helped form, Mikami will exit it later this year. The news of Mikami's departure originally came from an email sent to ZeniMax employees (via <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n52956/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks">TrueAchievements</a>) from Bethesda senior president Todd Vaughn, which thanked the veteran designer for his work at the studio.</p><p>"I am writing today to let you know that studio head Shinji Mikami has decided to leave Tango Gameworks in the coming months," Vaughn wrote. "Mikami-san has been a creative leader and supportive mentor to young developers at Tango for 12 years through his work on the Evil Within franchise, Ghostwire: Tokyo and, of course, Hi-Fi Rush."</p><p>Bethesda confirmed the news on <a href="https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1628751694258479104">Twitter</a>, and added that it wished Mikami well in his future endeavors. Mikami leaves behind a solid body of work at Tango Gameworks, as the studio has developed cult-classic games since its formation more than a decade ago. The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, and Ghostwire: Tokyo have all been well-received, while the surprise-dropped Hi-Fi Rush has received critical acclaim.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shinji-mikami-is-leaving-tango-gameworks/1100-6511743/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you're even a passing fan of the John Wick series, you've probably come across one of Keanu Reeves' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-keanu-reeves-badass-firearm-training-for-joh/1100-6435356/">training videos</a> for the series at some point. The actor fires <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-gets-intense-gun-training-in-new-john/1100-6466179/">hundreds of real rounds</a> with expert teachers to prepare for his brutal action films, and he's applying the same focus, commitment, and sheer will to driving stunts in the upcoming John Wick 4, according to a new featurette.</p><div>          </div><p>"We have all the John Wick swag: cars, new weapons, Jiu-Jitsu," Reeves says in the video. "With Chapter 4, we took it to another level."</p><p>Reeves says in the video that he's done about 12 weeks of training for the movie on top of all of his work on the previous films. This includes training with nunchucks which Reeves describes as "challenging" before the video cuts to him throwing them to the ground in frustration.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-is-too-good-at-driving-in-new-john-wick-4-featurette/1100-6511740/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>There's rarely a movie out of Hollywood that's completely free of some VFX work, but when we're talking about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you can multiply the normal amount of VFX by a hundred or more. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was more CGI than it was real, and critics took notice of the movie's poor visual effects, helping the movie become one of the lowest-rated MCU movies to date. Anonymous VFX industry veterans talked about how the movie ended up the way it did in a new article from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/02/marvel-vfx-workers-on-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania.html">Vulture</a>.</p><p>"[Black Panther] Wakanda Forever took precedence," said one VFX artist who has worked on a number of Marvel Studios movies. "It felt like the higher-up and supervisor roles were shifted around to put that on their plates and there was a smaller team working on Ant-Man."</p><p>As with many other movies, Ant-Man sometimes required VFX artists to create scenes from whole cloth.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-is-the-latest-victim-of-marvels-vfx-problem/1100-6511741/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
