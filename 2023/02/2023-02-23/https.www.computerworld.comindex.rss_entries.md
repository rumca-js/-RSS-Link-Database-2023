<p>The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday from Twitter, the US government and the family of a Jordanian citizen killed in a 2017 terrorist attack, in a case that will decide whether the social media platform can be held liable for the actions of those who use its services.</p><p>Much of the hearing was devoted to a careful parsing of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), the law under which the Tammneh family brought their lawsuit. Their argument, essentially, is that Twitter is liable for providing a platform to terrorists who used it to communicate and plan the attack. Twitter, for its part, argued that it couldn’t be held responsible without a demonstration that it had been informed of a specific attack and failed to do anything about it.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3689009/supreme-court-justices-parse-us-antiterrorism-law-in-twitter-case.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Remember the metaverse?</p><p>Before the recent explosion of hype around artificial intelligence (AI), the metaverse was anointed the Next Big Thing, ready to transform the world, technology, and work in ways never before imagined. Soon we would all live and work together in a virtual world far more interesting, vital, and productive than the drab reality in which we’re stuck.</p><p>It wasn’t just Mark Zuckerberg who led the metaverse charge by changing Facebook’s name to Meta. Microsoft hyped it as well, notably when CEO Satya Nadella said, “<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2021/11/Microsoft-Ignite-2021-Satya-Nadella.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">I can’t overstate how much of a breakthrough this is</a>,” in his keynote speech at Microsoft Ignite two years ago.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688433/as-microsoft-embraces-ai-it-says-sayonara-to-the-metaverse.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
