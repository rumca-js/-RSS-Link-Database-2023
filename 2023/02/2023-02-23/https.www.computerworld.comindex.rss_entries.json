Their argument, essentially, is that Twitter is liable for providing a platform to terrorists who used it to communicate and plan the attack. Twitter, for its part, argued that it couldn\u2019t be held responsible without a demonstration that it had been informed of a specific attack and failed to do anything about it.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3689009/supreme-court-justices-parse-us-antiterrorism-law-in-twitter-case.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3689009/supreme-court-justices-parse-us-antiterrorism-law-in-twitter-case.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-02-23 22:46:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "5 reasons videoconferencing is on the decline (again)", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Videoconferencing and collaboration vendors like Zoom have been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/zoom-to-lay-off-1300-employees-or-about-15percent-of-its-workforce.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reporting a sharp decline in business</a> this year.
