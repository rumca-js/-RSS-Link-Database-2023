The AV tool neatly integrates with other Windows features to offer more comprehensive security. And it&rsquo;s built into Windows and free.</p>
</div>


<p>The common perception is that paid security products from third parties must be more effective than any security built into an operating system like Windows. That may have been true in the past. But over the years, Microsoft has beefed up the security features that come with Windows. Beyond just basic antivirus protection, Windows 10 and 11 both include a healthy lineup of other tools designed to protect your PC, your files, and your online activity from malicious threats.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: Go to our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best antivirus for PC</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in an AV suite, and product recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="windows-security-features">Windows Security: Features</h2>



<p>Known collectively as Windows Security, the built-in defenses start with the Microsoft Defender antivirus tool. Defender automatically resides in memory to offer real-time protection against malware. But you can run a variety of on-demand scans, including a quick scan, a full scan, a custom scan of specific folders and locations, and even an offline scan to hunt for rootkits and other malware that&rsquo;s otherwise difficult to remove.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="Windows Security scan options" class="wp-image-1519373" height="762" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Microsoft-Defender-Review.png" width="1198" /><figcaption>Microsoft Defender provides four different types of scans, including one to ferret out rootkits and other challenging threats.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lance Whitney / Foundry</p></div>



<p>By default, any malicious items are automatically quarantined. Microsoft Security keeps track of all threats via its <em>Protection history</em>. Here, you can view new, quarantined, and cleaned items and also see recommendations on settings you may want to enable or configure to enhance your security.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows Security protection history" class="wp-image-1519406" height="627" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-Microsoft-Defender-Review.png" width="955" /><figcaption>Microsoft Security offers a protection history in which you can see different threats that have been caught and act on them.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lance Whitney / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The customizable settings for Microsoft Security are quite thorough with real-time protection and the latest cloud-delivered protection both enabled. If you run into a suspicious file, a link helps you submit the sample to Microsoft for analysis. A feature called <em>Tamper Protection</em> tries to prevent malicious apps from changing and thereby thwarting the security settings for Microsoft Security. Further, you&rsquo;re able to exclude specific files, folders, and processes that you don&rsquo;t want scanned.</p>



<p>Also part of Microsoft Security is ransomware protection. This protects certain files, folders, and areas of memory from unauthorized access and changes by malicious or suspicious apps. You can view the folders that are automatically protected this way and add additional folders you want secured. To help with data recovery in the event of a successful ransomware attack, Microsoft steers you to its own OneDrive backup and syncing service with a specific option for recovering any compromised files.</p>



<p>Beyond Microsoft Defender, Windows Security ties in with other aspects of the operating system. Under <em>Account protection</em> are links to view your Microsoft account, set up Windows Hello authentication for fingerprint or facial recognition, and enable <em>Dynamic Lock</em> to automatically lock your PC when you leave with your smartphone in hand.</p>



<p>The built-in firewall is automatically enabled for domains, private networks, and public networks. You can easily allow a specific app through for a private or public network. You&rsquo;re also able to access advanced firewall settings through a snap-in module where you can customize existing rules and create new firewall rules.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows Defender Firewall" class="wp-image-1519448" height="631" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-Microsoft-Defender-Review.png" width="967" /><figcaption>The built-in firewall is automatically turned on, and you can add allowed apps and customize its rules.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lance Whitney / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s <em>SmartScreen</em> feature aims to stop potentially malicious, suspicious, or low-reputation apps, websites, and file downloads. However, SmartScreen has a history of false positives to the point that some people end up disabling it, which obviously defeats its purpose. <em>Exploit protection</em> tries to block malware that takes advantage of vulnerabilities to infect your system. Also in the lineup is <em>Device security</em>, which taps into your PC&rsquo;s built-in hardware security defenses to combat malicious code and other threats.</p>



<p>The overall Windows Security dashboard is well designed, offering access to each of the different features. In Windows 10, go to <em>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security</em>, and then <em>Windows Security</em>. In Windows 11, go to <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; security</em>, and then <em>Windows Security</em>. From there, either click the button for <em>Open Windows Security</em> to view and access the different tools, or click a specific tool to view or use it.</p>

<h2 id="windows-security-performance">Windows Security: Performance</h2>



<p>The usual test files from the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/&amp;xcust=2-1-398361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">EICAR testing site</a> prompted security responses from Microsoft Defender, though the results differed slightly by browser.</p>



<p>In Microsoft Edge, clicking each of the test files triggered a warning from SmartScreen that the site was unsafe. The eicar.com, eicar.com.txt file, and the eicar_com.zip file were all prevented from being downloaded as Defender labeled them unsafe. And the eicarcom2.zip file was blocked with a notice that a virus was detected.</p>



<p>In Chrome, I was stopped from trying to save each of the four files because a virus was detected. In Firefox, I was able to save each of the files. But when I tried to run or open them, Microsoft Defender prevented the action, telling me that it found a virus or potentially unwanted software.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/december-2022/microsoft-defender-4.18-221615/&amp;xcust=2-1-398361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AV-Test review from November/December of 2022</a> gave Microsoft Defender grades of 6 out of 6 for protection and usability, and 5 out of 6 for performance. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/malware-protection-test-september-2022/&amp;xcust=2-1-398361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Testing from AV Comparatives in from September and October of 2022</a> awarded the program generally good grades but knocked it down a few points for too many false positives and a low offline detection rate.

<h2 id="windows-security-bottom-line">Windows Security: Bottom line</h2>



<p>Overall, Windows Security offer several benefits. Beyond the Windows Defender antivirus protection there are other solid security features. The settings are easily accessible and customizable. And since the protection is built into Windows, you don&rsquo;t have to install anything. If you need more features, such as a VPN, encrypted cloud backup, or online privacy tools, a third-party program is still the way to go. But for basic protection and then some, Microsoft Security is quite capable.</p>

## Intel Arc A770 vs. Nvidia RTX 3060 vs. AMD Radeon 6600 XT: Fight!

<p>There&rsquo;s a new player in the GPU game and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html">Intel&rsquo;s newly $250 Arc A750</a> just managed to crack our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">best graphics cards</a> thanks to drastic improvements (and a $40 price cut) since its October launch. But the brawl for supremacy in the key $300 to $450 price range is <em>much</em> tighter. With similar performance and stability updates in hand, how does <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">the flagship Intel Arc A770</a> ($329 for 8GB, $349 for 16GB) fare against Nvidia and AMD&rsquo;s battle-hardened contenders?</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s what PCWorld contributor Keith May decided to put to the test in the video below. Keith slapped the latest available drivers on the 16GB Arc A770, the 12GB <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Gaming-12G-P5-3655-KR-Dual-Fan/dp/B091MNBNWT&amp;xcust=2-1-1521916-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming Edition</a>, and the 8GB <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CG64Y3Q&amp;xcust=2-1-1521916-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Strix Radeon RX 6600 XT</a>, then let the benchmarks fly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The results are eye-opening, especially when you consider that the custom third-party EVGA and Asus GPUs go for $400 or more on the street right now despite their lower memory capacities.</p>



<p>All of these cards deliver rock-solid 1080p/Ultra gaming performance across our suite of tests, duking it out across the board, with Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3060 often winding up on the bottom of the heap even though it has the highest street price. The Radeon RX 6600 XT scores some overwhelming wins at 1080p resolution, but the Arc A770 picks up the pace at 1440p and womps on all comers when it comes to ray tracing performance&mdash;yes, Intel even beats Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted RTX 30-series ray tracing chops.</p>

<p>The Arc A770 lags a bit in 1 percent low (read: smoothness) performance, but remains <em>very</em> playable in all tests. It&rsquo;s a huge turnaround for Intel&rsquo;s Arc drivers, which suffered from significant stability issues and wildly inconsistent performance at launch.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need to watch Keith&rsquo;s video to see the full results, but the bottom line? He declares &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little Arc A770 leaves on the table right now performance-wise, and as opposed to even a couple of months ago, I can comfortably recommend it as an option&rdquo;&mdash;especially with its ample 16GB memory capacity.</p>



<p>While there&rsquo;s no clear winner here thanks to the fluctuating price points for the Nvidia and AMD options, what <em>is </em>clear is that after several months of intense software improvements, Intel has now earned its right to sit at this table with the Arc A770. These debut Arc graphics cards have only been available for a few months, but Intel is already squeezing some deliciously fine wine from them.</p>

## Why I switched from PC gaming to console gaming

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The first time I played a video game, it was on a computer. Floppy disks were involved&mdash;the kind that actually flopped&mdash;as was dying of dysentery. I got sucked into working for Interpol not long after, who kept me busy chasing a notorious woman in a red trench coat across the globe.</p>



<p>But eventually I discovered games that didn&rsquo;t require changing disks. You could just pop in a cartridge, sit, and&hellip;play. (Well, until one of the adults hollered that you&rsquo;d been at the TV long enough.) And what magic it was! My cousin had all the classics for his original Nintendo Entertainment System: <em>Duck Hunt</em>, <em>Contra</em>, <em>Paperboy</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, and best of all, <em>Double Dragon</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage left"><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full"><img alt="Contra screenshot (NES)" class="wp-image-1516022" height="240" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Contra.png" width="256" /><figcaption>I spent many hours in <em>Contra</em>. More than I should admit.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Contra.png&amp;xcust=2-1-1516001-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></div>



<p>That marked my first switch from PC to console, thanks to an extended loan of the NES. It was a move that lasted decades, too, with a single exception. (At one point, I got talked into trying <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> multiplayer on my family&rsquo;s feeble PC and its vintage 14.4 baud modem.) Then the pandemic hit and I found myself all but glued to my PC. Work, social Zoom calls, marathon YouTube and Netflix sessions&mdash;I did it all parked at my desk. It became easier to play games on the machine, too, since I had an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription</a>. I was also using gaming to stay in touch with friends.</p>



<p>The worst of the pandemic has passed now, however. My life has changed too&mdash;as has my body. And so, once again, console gaming has lured me back.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>The other side: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507436/why-i-switched-from-console-gaming-to-pc-gaming.html">Why I switched from console gaming to PC gaming</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="i-need-time-away-from-my-pc">I need time away from my PC</h2>



<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, my PC was supremely convenient as an all-purpose machine. Now, it&rsquo;s a little too much. I find myself still always anticipating the ping of work email, personal email, Slack, and Discord. I never really give myself the opportunity to disconnect.</p>



<p>My hip flexors have also become one knotted blob. Forcing myself to leave my seat reminds me to move around more&mdash;play games at the TV, take a phone call in an arm chair, go wild and eat dinner at a dining room table. I&rsquo;m more likely to get in more physical activity, too, like a spot of push-ups or a little dancing down the hallway. Maybe that stretching I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing regularly.</p>



<h2 id="the-games-i-like-are-on-console">The games I like are on console</h2>



<p>While Microsoft makes its games available on both Xbox and PC, Sony is still much slower with its PC ports&mdash;when there&rsquo;s even plans for such a move. I&rsquo;ve been antsy to finally get to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, but with all my time spent on my PC, those games have been stuck in limbo for me.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1516035" height="515" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>I&rsquo;ve yet to start <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and that&rsquo;s an issue I mean to rectify.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For better or worse, most of what I gravitate to usually releases on console first&mdash;and sometimes never crosses over to PC. I also tend to zero in on gameplay and storylines rather than graphical bells and whistles (as much as I like badass graphics cards). If I were more into the diverse indie scene on PC, perhaps I&rsquo;d still stick with gaming on my computer, but that&rsquo;s not where my heart lies.</p>



<h2 id="my-eyes-need-different-focus-distances">My eyes need different focus distances</h2>



<p>I don&rsquo;t know about other people, but sitting at my desk uninterrupted for hours and hours each day for over two years did a number on my vision. (Also, I&rsquo;ve not gotten any younger.) When I started feeling a delay in my ability to switch focus distances, I knew I&rsquo;d been forcing too much close-up work on my eyes.</p>



<p>Sitting on a couch many feet away from a TV&mdash;and having a large screen that makes everything huge and easy to see&mdash;changes up where I train my eyes. And the different scenery also reinforces the need to go outside and actually look off into the distance during a walk.</p>



<h2 id="i-got-tired-of-troubleshooting">I got tired of troubleshooting</h2>



<p>Before someone bursts in with a comment that PC gaming doesn&rsquo;t require that much maintenance&mdash;yes, occasional driver updates and maybe some light troubleshooting isn&rsquo;t too bad&hellip;if you&rsquo;re not otherwise doing that constantly.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Xbox Dashboard System Updates menu (Feb 2023)" class="wp-image-1516752" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023021718312867.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Say what you will about consoles, but their maintenance is dead simple.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>I know I&rsquo;m not a typical person. I use five different PCs for work purposes&mdash;then I still keep tablets and phones on hand for work reference as well. I also have my own personal computers, too. When an <em>Overwatch</em> session with friends would go to a black screen because I had Photoshop open at the same time, I didn&rsquo;t take it nearly as in stride as perhaps a true PC gamer would.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s <em>nice</em> turning on my Xbox One X or PlayStation 4 and having both system updates and games work seamlessly. Plus, I love the modern Xbox controller. I find it extremely comfy. And no one gives me grief for not playing shooters with a mouse and keyboard. (Try doing that on my mushy ergonomic keyboard and mouse and let me know how you like it.)</p>



<h2 id="looking-at-my-console-collection-makes-me-happy">Looking at my console collection makes me happy</h2>



<p>Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. I also recall memories far more easily when looking at physical objects. So, seeing consoles from my youth sitting side by side with more modern systems (plus the boxes for my favorite games) lets me fondly remember my favorite moments with friends and family, whom I don&rsquo;t see nearly as often as when we were young.</p>



<p>My inner Young Alaina still also gets a kick from having enough money to afford all those systems. We made it, girl.</p>

<p>If you use your laptop day in and day out, it&rsquo;s likely a breeding ground for bacteria and other nasty things. From sticky keys to accumulating dust, things can get real gnarly, which is why it&rsquo;s important to clean your laptop on a regular basis. My husband has a compromised immune system, so I try to keep my laptop as clean as possible to help fend off any potential viruses floating around. Whether you&rsquo;re trying to stay healthy or can&rsquo;t stand the sight of those dust bunnies, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to safely clean your own device. Read on to learn more.</p>

<p>This step is self-explanatory, sure, but it still needs to be stated. Make sure you shut down your laptop and unplug it from the wall or power strip. This is to eliminate the possibility of frying your laptop, as you&rsquo;ll be later wiping it down with a damp cloth. Try to avoid zapping yourself, my friend. I&rsquo;ve accidentally zapped myself before and it&rsquo;s the exact opposite of fun.</p>

<p>Ah, the much beloved can of compressed air. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite cleaning tools. The first step in cleaning your laptop is blowing away any loose particles. Personally, I&rsquo;d recommend spraying once a fair distance away from your laptop. This is to ensure that no condensation accumulates in the crevices, as you don&rsquo;t want to be mixing water with electrical bits. If your laptop has sizable vents, point the nozzle at it and blow away. Massive dust bunnies tend to accumulate over time in the vents. <strong>Make sure you use short bursts of air.</strong></p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-how-to-direction how-to-direction">
<p>The next step is wiping down the entire laptop with a damp cloth. I&rsquo;d recommend using a few drops of rubbing alcohol on a damp cloth, as it evaporates quickly. Don&rsquo;t ever apply cleaning products like ammonia or bleach directly onto your laptop. The liquid could possibly seep into the crevices of your machine. Plus, harsh chemicals will definitely damage your machine. I&rsquo;d recommend a few drops of rubbing alcohol on a soft microfiber cloth. This is also a good way to disinfect your keyboard.</p>

<p>Take a cotton swab, dip it in the rubbing alcohol, and clean the spaces in between the keys on your keyboard. This is a great way to clean those hard-to-reach places. Personally, I find the keyboard to be the dirtiest part of the laptop. The oil from your fingertips often leaves smudge marks behind. Crumbs and hair also tend to get wedged in this space as well. </p>
