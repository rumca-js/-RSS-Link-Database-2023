Married at 20, she was coerced by her first husband to write books under his name, as depicted in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/colette-review-keira-knightley-is-on-top-form-in-exhilarating-literary-biopic\">2018 biopic</a> starring Keira Knightley and Dominic West. The Claudine series proved a sensation, rapturously relaying a young girl\u2019s coming-of-age and her search for sexual freedom; the modern French teenager had arrived. Once separated, Colette immersed herself in \u201cpleasures so lightly called physical\u201d, and expressed them in her novellas with poetic intensity and a joyous savoir faire. Simone de Beauvoir called her \u201cthe only great woman writer in France\u201d, but Colette also flourished as a dancer, screenwriter, librettist, journalist and the hands-on owner of a beauty chain. She loved women, married men three times, and, aged 40, gave birth to a daughter. She was awarded four ranks of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, became the first female president of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt, and was the first woman to receive a state funeral in France upon her death in 1954.

Founded by Damon Albarn, an alt-rock star apparently dabbling in pop, and his former flatmate Jamie Hewlett, who supplied the cartoons, it was a project you might have assumed would be a short-lived joke. But nearly a quarter of a century on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gorillaz\">Gorillaz</a> have made as many studio albums as Albarn\u2019s primary band and, in the process, have achieved things <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blur\">Blur</a> haven\u2019t: a string of US Top 10 albums, one of them double-platinum; a Grammy; and entente cordiale with Oasis \u2013 or at least Noel Gallagher, who appeared on 2017\u2019s We Got the Power.</p><p>They\u2019ve also proved oddly prescient. You don\u2019t hear many bands who sound like Blur these days, but we live in an era when pop is fuelled by the kind of cross-genre collaborations that started popping up on Gorillaz\u2019s eponymous debut album and had more or less consumed their output entirely by the release of 2010\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/04/gorillaz-plastic-beach-cd-review\">Plastic Beach</a>. In truth, their current prevalence probably has more to do with trying to game the streaming services\u2019 genre-specific playlists than Gorillaz\u2019s influence, but still. You can see the mark their tracks Feel Good Inc and Dirty Harry left on Gen Z\u2019s nascent musical taste by the fact that Gorillaz are still playing arenas and headlining festivals years after their albums stopped shifting in the kind of quantities they once sold; last year, Billie Eilish said Albarn \u201cchanged my life\u201d when she invited him to sing Feel Good Inc with her at Coachella.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/23/gorillaz-cracker-island-review-smaller-subtler-and-better-for-it\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/23/gorillaz-cracker-island-review-smaller-subtler-and-better-for-it", "date_published": "2023-02-23 12:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The 20 best time-travel movies \u2013 ranked!", "description": "<p>As Adam Driver accidentally winds up 65m years ago, facing not just dinosaurs but an asteroid, we countdown the best films about going backwards, or forwards, through the ages</p><p>Regardless of what anyone says, I believe in my heart that Timecop was greenlit because someone showed a studio executive a picture of Jean-Claude Van Damme and said the word \u201cTimecop\u201d out loud, at which point they had to throw a script together as quickly as possible.

The image of a woman with a man\u2019s hand around her throat. The attendant sexual violence that image suggests. A veil thrown over questions of time and location that lends both prose and plot a gauzy, fever-dream quality. That gauzy quality is likewise aided by a set of strict rules established for each story world, and momentum in Mackintosh\u2019s novels is usually the result of those structures dissolving.

It is narrated by Elodie, a woman of indeterminate age. She is married to a passionless baker, provider of the titular bread \u2013 a man who touches her around four times a year and is usually too drunk to stay hard if they have sex. When she watches his still-strong hands kneading dough each day, one can see why Elodie might be dissatisfied with life. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll throw myself off a bridge or bake myself into a pie, what do you think?\u201d she asks her husband brightly one afternoon. He shrugs. They attend a midsummer festival instead. To some extent, it is the small churn of bucolic domesticity that endows this novel with the uncanny quality also present in Mackintosh\u2019s other books \u2013 this is a world in which women wash clothes at the lavoir, make confession on Sundays, faithfully aid their husbands\u2019 work as butchers or grocers. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Elodie recounts, \u201cnot very often, I found myself tied around the throat with a hot thread of panic at the inevitability of the days.\u201d</p><p>Cursed Bread by Sophie Mackintosh is published by Hamish Hamilton (\u00a314.99).

It\u2019s a sentimental charmer with a plot that twists, turns and pivots</p><p>Don\u2019t be fooled by the breezy, Richard Curtis-like stylings of You &amp; Me. This sentimental charmer, executive-produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/russelltdavies\">Russell T Davies</a>, may look like a romcom, but it\u2019s more David Nicholls\u2019 One Day than Notting Hill. This is a drama about tragedy, and whether hearts can survive the potential horrors that life may throw at them. \u201cAfter the worst, most unimaginable thing has happened to them, do you really think people can be happy again, the way they were before?\u201d asks up-and-coming theatrical star Emma (Jessica Barden). The answer plays itself out over three episodes, which twist, turn and pivot across two-ish timelines and several years.</p><p>At its best, it\u2019s got a touch of Cold Feet to it. Industry\u2019s Harry Lawtey plays Ben, a carefree young man in London whose life is changed for ever when he misses a bus at the exact same time as stranger Jess (Sophia Brown). For the first 20 minutes or so, it plays out like the romcom that it is pretending to be. The meet-cute is intensely cute, and there is plenty of lovely magical thinking going on. Strangers daring to strike up conversations with one another! In London! At a bus stop! (In You &amp; Me, buses are romantic, which suggests the writer has blocked out any memories of dodging a rolling bottle full of something that looks a bit like apple juice on the 76 at 3am.) Ben is a journalist whose mother is a cleaner, yet he can afford a two-bedroom flat in the city that doesn\u2019t have a shower in the kitchen and a fridge/wardrobe combo! Being a parent of small children doesn\u2019t seem to age anyone at all! I like this London, all sun-kissed and optimistic and friendly and affordable.</p><p>You &amp; Me is on ITVX now.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/23/you-and-me-review-a-romcom-disguised-drama-with-a-dark-troubled-heart\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/23/you-and-me-review-a-romcom-disguised-drama-with-a-dark-troubled-heart", "date_published": "2023-02-23 09:00:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Police name off-duty detective injured in Omagh shooting", "description": "<p>DCI John Caldwell, a high-profile PSNI officer, in critical condition in hospital after shooting on Wednesday night</p><p>The senior police officer shot in Omagh on Wednesday evening has been named as DCI John Caldwell, as police said the primary focus of the investigation was on dissident republicans.</p><p>Caldwell is in a critical but stable condition in hospital after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/22/off-duty-police-officer-shot-in-omagh-report\">attack at a sports complex</a> in Omagh.

Weird, I know. I\u2019m assuming analogue chit-chat is dying out, as the rise of AI means we\u2019ll have to get used to talking to computers. Already, many of the face-to-face conversations we are having were initiated via them. For example, I had a young male colleague, a good-looking and confident rascal. Even though, as far as I could see, he was enjoying conspicuous success with his Tinder dating, he bemoaned the march of technology. He said he\u2019d often approach a woman in a bar, only to be told that she was waiting for a Tinder date. \u201cThe game\u2019s over,\u201d he said sadly. Tellingly, in relating this, it strikes me that approaching somebody unbidden to talk to them might now come across as dodgier than meeting a stranger you\u2019ve found on the internet.</p><p>Whether you\u2019re dating or not, the knack of starting conversations is at least as important \u2013 and challenging \u2013 as the art of conversation itself. The talking is the easy bit. It helps no end, of course, if you\u2019re interested in other people, in which case you\u2019ll generally bring yourself and others pleasure by asking them about themselves. If you\u2019re more interested in yourself than anyone else, then that can be straightforward, too \u2013 just rattle on about your own brilliance and either turn a blind eye to any yawning or glazing over, or move on to your next victim.
