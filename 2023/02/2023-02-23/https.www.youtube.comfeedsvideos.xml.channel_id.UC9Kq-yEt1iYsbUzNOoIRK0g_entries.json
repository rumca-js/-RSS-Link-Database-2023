So with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel really had to start this new phase off with a bang. While some may argue that they didn\u2019t succeed in that, one thing is for sure: they kicked it off with some naked MODOK butt.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania definitely raises some questions. Like why did Janet keep such a big secret from everyone for SO LONG into the movie? What\u2019s going on with MODOK\u2019s face? If Kang is the big bad of the next two phases, why did we just watch him get beat up by some bugs? Did anything really change after this movie?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nVelma Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4K_sxI5Ui8\n\nAvatar The Way Of Water Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBPO76TGUQ\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8VR5wMBatQ", "date_published": "2023-02-23 20:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
