It’s already been eight years since Paul Rudd joined the MCU as Ant-Man, and this third movie in the series sees him kicking off Phase 5. So with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel really had to start this new phase off with a bang. While some may argue that they didn’t succeed in that, one thing is for sure: they kicked it off with some naked MODOK butt.

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania definitely raises some questions. Like why did Janet keep such a big secret from everyone for SO LONG into the movie? What’s going on with MODOK’s face? If Kang is the big bad of the next two phases, why did we just watch him get beat up by some bugs? Did anything really change after this movie?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
