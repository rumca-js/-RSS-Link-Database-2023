Drug use, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-homeless-encampment\" target=\"_blank\">homelessness</a>, the entire city of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-police-36-hours\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco</a>. And the fact that our President can barely string two words together, of course. But recently, a highly concerning sign is emerging: the decline of our children. </p><p>Lately, horrific stories of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-bus-florida\" target=\"_blank\">bullying</a> have shed light on what's really going on inside our nation's public schools. One instance was so bad, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adriana-kuch-school-superintendent-blames\" target=\"_blank\">the young girl committed suicide</a>, and the school somehow still refused to take responsibility. Our children are forgetting how to act as humans, perhaps because their parents forgot first. </p><p>A fresh example of this comes from a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chik-fil-a-meltdown\" target=\"_blank\">Chick-fil-a</a> in Pennsylvania. This Chick-fil-a had to ban adolescents under the age of 16 without a parent or guardian because they were behaving so poorly. If you know anything about Chick-fil-a, you know that their employees are some of the kindest people around. It's a bit like being inside Santa's toy shop, except instead of toys, it's chicken. So these kids must've been <em>really</em> misbehaving to piss off the equivalent of Santa's elves. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cYour know a culture is in serious decline when a local Chick-Fil-A has to beg parents to require their children to act in a way that is compatible with the basic decency required in a functioning society. \\n\\nThis reads like a homily on the fall of Western civilization.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Megan Brock (@Megan Brock)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegEBrock/status/1628503028356481026\">1677100352</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a Facebook post, the Chick-fil-a detailed the unacceptable behaviors of these rowdy adolescents:</p><p> <em>\"They are loud, and their conversation often contains a lot of explicit language [...] Food and trash are often thrown around and left on the tables, chairs, and on the floor. Tables and restrooms are vandalized. Decorations are stolen [...] Employees are laughed at, made fun of, and treated rudely.\" </em></p><p>The post went on to explain that the Chick-fil-a is not blaming the parents, they just can't permit kids to \"test boundaries\" in their restaurant. Not having any kids myself, I don't want to be too quick to blame parents. However, I can't see who else is at fault here. Parents are undeniably responsible for teaching their children to behave and treat people respectfully. The parents of some of these troublemakers might be doing that, but they clearly aren't attentive enough to their children's, ahem, \"extracurricular\" activities. </p><p>Overall, it's a sad day when Chick-fil-a has to ban anyone from their holy chicken. On the bright side, the comments on the Facebook post were overwhelmingly positive and supportive of the restaurant's decision. So maybe this isn't the fall of Western civilization. Yet. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chick-fil-a-bans-16", "date_published": "2023-02-23 22:18:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Ron DeSantis wrecks MSNBC over slavery lie, puts the rest of corporate media on notice: \"We're cataloging your lies\"", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33084774&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C2\" /><br /><br /><p>Ron DeSantis is realllllly good at this.</p><p>Quick recap.

Does \u201cas long as it takes\u201d mean until Ukraine recaptures all its original territory in a total defeat of Russian forces? Does it mean until the Putin regime is overthrown, and a puppet government is installed in Moscow? Who knows? Certainly not policy makers in DC.\n</p><p>\n\tWhile the timetable of \u201cas long as it takes\u2019\u201d is a mystery to us all, if the previous year is any indicator the substance of the commitment is easier to speculate. It likely means a perpetual signing of blank checks to Ukrainian leadership with little to no oversight over how the money is being used.\n</p><p>\n\tSince the beginning of the war, Congress has dedicated $113.1 billion in aid packages to Ukraine, including $67.1 billion for defense and $46 billion in non-defense related materials. But once the money is appropriated, there is little oversight into where exactly it ends up.\n</p><p>\n\tAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.dodig.mil/Portals/48/FY2023_JSOP_UKRAINE_RESPONSE.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Strategic Oversight Plan for Ukraine Response report</a> released in January, \"State is overseeing unprecedented levels of security assistance in Ukraine, presenting significant risk of misuse and diversion given the volume and speed of assistance and the wartime operating environment.\"\n</p><p>\n\tPerhaps more concerning than the raw dollar figure the US has committed to Ukraine is the actual ammunition and weaponry. Aside from Washington\u2019s latest high profile commitment to Kyiv, in which it has promised to send <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/25/germany-leopard-tanks-abrams-ukraine/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">31 M1 Abrams tanks</a>, it has already supplied Ukraine with massive amounts of hard materials. According to a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fact sheet</a> published by the State Department on February 3<sup>rd</sup>, this includes:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Over 1,600 Stinger missiles</li>\n<li>Over 8,500 Javelin missiles</li>\n<li>Over 54,000 other anti-armor systems and munitions</li>\n<li>100,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition</li>\n<li>Hundreds of thousands of rounds of various other artillery</li>\n</ul><p>\n\tWhile supplying weapons to the Ukrainian people in their fight against a revisionist power is admirable on its face, and certainly makes sense emotionally, it\u2019s not our elected leaders\u2019 job to make foreign policy decisions based on emotion. Instead, they should employ a more realist decision making process. By examining support of Ukraine through this lens it would be readily apparent that a carte blanche support of Kyiv\u2019s war effort does not come without very real tradeoffs.\n</p><p>\n\tBy definition, the more weapons we provide to Ukraine, the fewer we have the potential to utilize in other more important theaters, namely the Asia-Pacific.\n</p><p>\n\tWhile leadership in Washington has rightfully acknowledged that China is our greatest strategic rival, and the defense of Taiwan is crucial to American interests, policy makers continue to send gobs of money and weapons to Ukraine ignoring the negative consequences this may incur should the US find itself in open conflict with China.\n</p><p>\n\tSenator Josh Hawley (R-MO) acutely outlined this dilemma in a <a href=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-delivers-national-security-speech-china-and-ukraine-time-truth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a> at the Heritage Foundation last week. \u201cFor starters, the more U.S. resources we devote to Europe, the fewer we have available to strengthen deterrence in the Pacific,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cFor some things, like heavy armor units, that may not matter much. But it matters a lot for the capabilities we need to deter China from invading Taiwan.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tHe continued, \u201cBoth Ukraine and Taiwan require many of the same weapons, including things like Javelin and Stinger missiles. And our industrial base is strapped for capacity. That\u2019s because we need to draw on many of the same suppliers for the defense of both Ukraine and Taiwan.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tAs Hawley notes, our industrial base <em>is</em> strapped, but this language is really not strong enough. Thanks to a lack of urgency from the Pentagon and massive consolidation efforts by defense contractors, the US defense industry is drastically unprepared for a conflict with China.\n</p><p>\n\tAccording to a Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/empty-bins-wartime-environment-challenge-us-defense-industrial-base\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, the US would run out of key long-range, precision-guided munitions in less than one week if a battle over Taiwan were to break out. The CSIS study also notes that shipments of Javelin and Stinger missiles and counter-artillery radars and 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine have depleted US stockpiles.\n</p><p>\n\t\u201cThe United States has been slow to replenish its arsenal, and the DoD has only placed a contract on a fraction of the weapons it sent to Ukraine,\u201d the report states.\n</p><p>\n\tAll these weapons systems would be crucial for a defense of Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n</p><p>\n\tUnderscoring China\u2019s keen interest in the Russia-Ukraine war, the day after Biden paraded through the streets of Kyiv, China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, landed in Moscow where he participated in talks with President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n</p><p>\n\tWang, addressing the two countries\u2019 special relationship vowed to work with Russia to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/chinas-top-diplomat-vows-to-firmly-defend-national-territories-with-russia/DF7E47D7-6DCE-432C-B094-E27A16A5A32F.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cfirmly defend respective national territories and national pride.\u201d</a>\n</p><p>\n\tLavrov echoed the sentiment adding, \u201cOur ties have continued to develop dynamically and despite high turbulence in the global arena, we have shown the readiness to speak in defense of each other\u2019s interests.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tThese warm diplomatic sentiments between China and Russia were exchanged just days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the US possessed intelligence that China may be considering supplying lethal arms to Russia. Blinken added on Wednesday that the Biden administration was considering declassifying this intelligence, though no final decision had been made. \n</p><p>\n\tConsidering the prospect of increased Chinese cooperation with Russia, President Zelenskyy declared, \u201cif China allies itself with Russia, there will be a world war.\u201d</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">It is the US, not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield in Ukraine.

More directly, China has supplied the Russian military with commercial drones manufactured by DJI. These drones are then outfitted in Russia for military use.<br /></p><p>\n\tWhether China plans to increase involvement by supplying more lethal aid remains to be seen, but Beijing\u2019s motivation for doing so would be two-fold. It would help ensure that Russia, China\u2019s only major power ally, is not defeated. And given US policy towards Ukraine so far, by helping to extend the conflict China would also be able to bleed the US of critical strategic weapons and political capital. The longer the US is involved with Ukraine, the less resolve the American public will likely have when it comes time to sacrifice for Taiwan.\n</p><p>\n\tBiden loves to frame the Russia-Ukraine war as a battle of democracy vs autocracy. While it may be to an extent, deciding US foreign policy on those grounds is foolish. A hardheaded realism that understands the tradeoffs arming and supporting Ukraine requires is desperately needed.\n</p><p>\n\tTo speak in terms Biden\u2019s liberal sensibilities might resonate with, by blindly continuing carte blanche support of Ukraine, the US is forfeiting its future ability to defend another even more liberal and more democratic ally. However, in the case of Taiwan, unlike Ukraine, the US would not only be defending a liberal democracy, but one that is vital to American interests.\n</p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ukraine-joe-biden-china", "date_published": "2023-02-23 14:52:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Mark Wahlberg knows believing in Jesus isn't popular in Hollywood, but refuses to deny his faith", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33081601&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>It's a trip for 80s kids to see what Mark Wahlberg has become.
