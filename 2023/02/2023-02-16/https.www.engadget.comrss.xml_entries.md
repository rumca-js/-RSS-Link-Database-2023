<p>Microsoft has formally approved a way to run <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> on ARM-based Macs, if not in the way you might hope. In a new <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/options-for-using-windows-11-with-mac-computers-with-apple-m1-and-m2-chips-cd15fd62-9b34-4b78-b0bc-121baa3c568c">support article</a>, the company has &quot;authorized&quot; using Parallels Desktop 18 to run the ARM versions of Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise on M1- and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-review-2023-m2-pro-max-140048268.html">M2-based Macs</a>. If you need Windows for work, you can theoretically use the virtual machine without angering your IT manager.</p><p>As you might guess, there are limitations. You can't run 32-bit ARM apps, in part because Microsoft is deprecating 32-bit software for all ARM Windows builds. Devices won't work unless they have Windows 11 ARM drivers. You can't use anything that depends on another layer of virtualization, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-android-apps-update-available-release-date-191055347.html">Android apps</a>, the Linux sybsystem and Windows Sandbox. Don't expect to run some games, either, as anything that requires at least DirectX 12 or OpenGL 3.3 won't work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's been possible to run Windows 11 in Parallels on ARM Macs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-17-m-1-mac-performance-windows-11-support-040128211.html">since 2021</a>, and it even ran <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/features/i-ran-windows-11-on-an-m1-mac">reasonably well</a>. You needed to use an Insider preview of the OS at the time, though, and Microsoft said at the time that it didn't plan to support new Macs. The sanctioned approach clears up licensing headaches, and Parallels Desktop 18 now lets you download and install Windows 11 with little effort.</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602718/microsoft-windows-11-apple-mac-m1-m2-support-parallels-virtual-machines">explains</a>, it's not certain how Microsoft has changed the licensing — until now, it only licensed ARM versions of Windows directly to PC vendors. We've asked the company for comment. Parallels says you can buy either an individual Windows 11 Pro license or go through your employer's usual purchasing process.</p><p>This won't satisfy users who want native Windows support like they had with Intel-based Macs running Apple's Boot Camp. You won't get the performance or compatibility you would on a PC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">built for Windows on ARM</a>. It may be the closest you get short of a collaboration between Apple and Microsoft, though, and it might do the trick if there's a must-run Windows productivity app.</p>

The company also noted recently that 375 million users hop into the app every day. While that's a far cry from the 2.96 billion monthly and 2 billion daily active users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-billion-meta-q4-2022-earnings-223814979.html"><ins>Facebook has</ins></a>, Snapchat's audience numbers are trending upwards. Snap <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/investor-day-2023"><ins>said</ins></a> at an investor day event that it sees &quot;a path for Snapchat to reach over 1 billion people in the next two to three years.&quot;</p><p>Breaking those figures down a little, most of Snapchat's audience is outside of North America, where it now has more than 150 million monthly active users. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said the app reaches more than three-quarters of 13- to 34-year-olds in more than 20 countries and users post more than 5 billion snaps every day.

## Bipartisan bill would require that social networks have 'clear' content policies

<p>American politicians are split on many aspects of social networks' content moderation policies, but they might find common ground on setting those policies. A bipartisan group of senators led by Brian Schatz and John Thune has introduced the Internet Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act (Internet PACT), a bill that would set &quot;clear&quot; content moderation policies they consistently enforce. The amendment to the Communications Act would require that online services explain their moderation in an &quot;easily accessible&quot; usage policy, and share biannual reports with anonymized statistics for content that has been pulled, downranked or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/demonetizing-problematic-you-tubers-isnt-effective-researchers-say-172829299.html">demonetized</a>. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would also lead development of a voluntary framework to set industry-wide practices.</p><p>The Internet PACT Act would also amend the Communications Decency Act's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-quizzes-facebook-whistleblower-on-section-230-reforms-203605272.html">Section 230</a> to require that &quot;large&quot; platforms pull content within four days if deemed illegal by courts. Those big services would need systems to handle complaints and appeals, and users would need to be notified of any decisions regarding their content within three weeks. Smaller providers would have &quot;more flexibility&quot; in addressing complaints and illegal content, according to the senators.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The bill would also bar companies from using Section 230 as a shield when the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other national regulators engage in civil actions. State attorneys general could enforce federal civil laws when used against online platforms, while the Government Accountability Office (GAO) would have to study the viability of an FTC-run program for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whistleblowers from within online platform companies</a>.</p><p>The measure theoretically addresses longstanding complaints from both sides of Congress. Democrats have argued that social media giants aren't consistent in applying their policies, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-leak-right-wing-turmoil-205039809.html?uuid=R8LzRpsZd5h8MGtD9581">carve out exceptions</a> for accounts that spread hate or misinformation. Republicans, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-panel-subpoenas-the-ceos-from-techs-biggest-companies-over-content-moderation-204641525.html">accused social networks</a> of censoring conservative views while giving creators little chance to respond.</p><p>There's no certainty the Internet PACT Act will become law. The bipartisan support may help, though. Whether or not the proposed Section 230 amendments will satisfy politicians is another matter. Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/section-230-safe-tech-act-democrats-181257063.html">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ajit-pai-fcc-clarify-section-230-194358819.html">Republicans</a> have previously called for large-scale reforms, but the changes here would be relatively limited. They would, however, pressure companies to act quickly on illegal content.</p>

## Disney will slow and spread the releases of its Marvel series

<p>Disney plans to scale back its streaming content as cost-cutting hits the entertainment giant. Marvel Studios will <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-star-wars-tv-shows-movies-slowdown-1235326681/">reportedly</a> see the first and perhaps biggest cuts under CEO Bob Iger’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bob-iger-is-returning-as-disney-ceo-in-a-huge-shakeup-065239929.html">second stint</a> leading the company. Marvel head Kevin Feige <a href="https://ew.com/movies/kevin-feige-marvel-phase-5-exclusive-interview/">echoes</a> the sentiment, saying the company plans to release fewer shows on Disney+ while spacing them out more. According to Iger, Disney wants “the quality on the screen, but we have to look at what they cost us.”</p><p>“The pace at which we’re putting out the Disney+ shows will change so they can each get a chance to shine,” Feige told <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> earlier this week. Disney’s Marvel output over the last couple of years has been staggering. It released three movies and three television series in 2022, which followed the four films and five shows it put out in 2021. The company initially announced five Disney+ series for 2023, but season two of <em>Loki</em> and the new <em>Secret Invasion</em> starring Samuel L. Jackson are reportedly the only two that are still “sure bets” to arrive this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I do think one of the powerful aspects of being at Marvel Studios is having these films and shows hit the zeitgeist,” Feige said. “But we want Marvel Studios and the MCU projects to really stand out and stand above. So, people will see that as we get further into Phase 5 and 6. The pace at which we’re putting out the Disney+ shows will change so they can each get a chance to shine.” When pressed about whether the pacing change would mean spacing them out or releasing fewer shows, he replied, “Both, I think.”</p><figure><img alt="Media image from &#x00201c;The Mandalorian,&#x00201d; featuring the title character holding a blaster while taking cover behind a corner." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/4766b840-ae34-11ed-afb5-101dd334de43" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, Disney eyes Star Wars’ return to the big screen. Although the franchise has been busy on Disney+ with live-action series <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>Andor</em>, <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em>and <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>, the franchise has been missing from theaters since 2019’s <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>. Disney will reportedly unveil new film plans at Star Wars Celebration in April. However, the franchise won’t escape the company’s renewed fiscal responsibility. “Lucasfilm may ramp up, but it will have to abide by the same fiscal discipline as the rest of the company,” a source told <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.</p><p>The cost-cutting will also affect Disney's big-screen animation plans after the division’s struggles in 2022. Pixar’s <em>Lightyear</em> underperformed, while Disney Animation’s <em>Strange World</em> was a box-office disaster. As a result, the company is reportedly considering longer theatrical windows for its future animated features to encourage families to return to theaters. Upcoming animated projects include <em>Elemental</em> and <em>Wish</em>.</p><p>However, industry insiders don’t necessarily foresee the far-ranging cuts as omens of bigger concerns looming for Disney or its streaming service. “You can have ten mediocre shows, or you can have five great shows,” an agency partner told <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. “People will still stay on Disney+.”</p>

<p>Perhaps someone at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiktok/"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> watched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-trailer-for-cnns-hq-trivia-documentary-170021504.html"><ins>recent documentary</ins></a> on the boom and bust of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hq%20trivia/"><ins>HQ Trivia</ins></a>, because it has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-trivia">announced</a> a live trivia challenge with a $500,000 prize pool. TikTok Trivia is open to users in the US aged 18 and older. You can tap a trivia widget in the For You feed, search for the #TikTokTrivia tag or navigate to the <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-trivia">@TikTok</a> account now to register.</p><p>TikTok Trivia will run daily for five days, starting on February 22nd. During each of the first three days, there will be two sessions starting at 8PM and 9PM ET. If you ever played HQ Trivia, you'll know the drill. There will be several rounds of multiple choice questions. You'll need to get them all right to have a chance of winning a share of that session's prize pot. TikTok will also run survival rounds. There's no hard limit on the number of questions during these rounds and the questions will get progressively more difficult. Players who make it to the end will split $100,000.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The questions will mostly be general knowledge, covering topics such as lifestyle, sports, music and beauty. But, if you want to win big, it's a good idea to brush up on John Wick as there will be some questions about Keanu Reeves' hitman movies. TikTok Trivia is part of a promotional campaign for <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>, which will hit theaters next month.</p>

<p>Meta has set its sights on copying a new messaging app: Telegram. Mark Zuckerberg just showed off <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL3p1Y2svcG9zdHMvcGZiaWQwdHBUTTU5QVpua3dVU1dCZkFLZUN2emJDRkJYZWY2ZHl4U29HanFVN05ZYnQ2dUhXTkZERnVGeHlhZGpLQnFNaGwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3MDIzY2YwLWNhNGYtNDYxMi1iOTdhLTc1NmY0YjZjYTljOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATsGkOI7aHRNJIZv4rvblNRoX1WW4lDw-s7a-y5Nc10J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0tpTM59AZnkwUSWBfAKeCvzbCFBXef6dyxSoGjqU7NYbt6uHWNFDFuFxyadjKBqMhl"><ins>“broadcast channels,”</ins></a> a new Instagram feature that brings one-way messaging to the app. The company is testing the feature with a handful of creators, and plans to bring the Telegram-like functionality to Facebook and Messenger as well.</p><p>Broadcast channels allow creators to stream updates to their followers’ inboxes, much like channels on Telegram. Those who join the channels are able to react to messages and vote in polls, but can’t participate in the conversation directly. For example, Mark Zuckerberg shared in his “Meta Channel” that he would use the space to “share news and updates on all the products and tech we’re building at Meta.” In addition to text updates, creators can also share audio clips, photos and other content.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, it seems only Zuckerberg and about a dozen other creators have access to the feature. The initial group includes snowboarder Chloe Kim, Jiu-Jitsu fighter Mackenzie Dern, and meme account Tank Sinatra. The company says that others interested in using the feature can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/broadcast_channel/waitlist/"><ins>sign up</ins></a> to be considered for early access.</p><p>Though Meta describes channels as a “test,” the company seems to be fairly invested in the feature. Additional features, including the ability to add another creator to the chat and to conduct AMAs, are already in the works. Meta also plans to start testing the channels on Facebook and Messenger “in the coming months.”</p>

## FCC proposals require phone companies to help domestic violence survivors

<p>Now that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-safe-connections-act-into-law-095929423.html">Safe Connections Act</a> (SCA) has become law, the Federal Communications Commission is taking steps to help domestic violence survivors leave their partners' phone plans. The agency has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-looks-help-domestic-violence-survivors-access-connectivity">proposed</a> rules that would require carriers separate the line for a survivor within two business days of a request. Another proposal would also have carriers hide contact with abuse hotlines from consumer-facing call and text logs.</p><p>The FCC also hopes to use the Lifeline or Affordable Connectivity Program to support survivors enduring financial hardships for up to six months. Separately, providers are teaming with the National Domestic Violence Hotline to ensure survivors leaving a family plan will get in touch with someone who can offer support from experts on abuse.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The proposals are entering a public comment phase and may be modified when they take effect as required by the SCA. As they are, though, the measures theoretically provide survivors additional safety when leaving abusive relationships. They can quickly exit a plan managed by an abuser, and will be less vulnerable if they call a support line or need financial aid to stay connected. That, in turn, may help them reclaim independence while staying in touch with supportive friends and family members.</p><p><em>If you are experiencing domestic violence and similar abuse, you can contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline by phone at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or by texting &quot;START&quot; to 88788.</em></p><p></p><p></p>

But since doing so also makes it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-stalking-police-reports-190022315.html">easier for stalkers</a> to track others without their consent, the company requires verification with a government ID and biometric info to activate the feature.

Stalking prevention measures, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-update-hidden-airtags-easier-to-locate-092003140.html">emitting a sound</a> when the tracker is following someone who isn’t its owner, can make it easier for thieves to recognize they’re being tracked (and quickly dispose of the accessory). But if you remove those protections to make theft deterrence more effective, creeps will have an easier time stalking their exes or anyone else unlucky enough to be their target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The bottom line is that a good locating device is also a good stalking device,” said Life360 (Tile’s parent company) CEO Chris Hulls in a <a href="https://chrishulls.medium.com/tile-is-taking-a-different-approach-to-the-bluetooth-industrys-theft-and-stalking-problems-bd92d3ae4f3c#e643">Medium blog post</a> on Wednesday. “It is almost impossible to fine-tune alerts in a way that balances the need for accuracy with timeliness. Likewise, it is nearly impossible to make notifications or alert sounds noticeable enough in any practical environment — it is often hard to hear an AirTag beep in a silent room let alone a bar or club where a stalker might be present.”</p><p>Tile’s solution tries to find the sweet spot. The Anti-Theft Mode feature will make the devices invisible to Scan and Secure, the company’s in-app feature that lets you know if any nearby Tiles are following you. But to activate the new Anti-Theft Mode, the Tile owner will have to verify their real identity with a government-issued ID, submit a biometric scan that helps root out fake IDs, agree to let Tile share their information with law enforcement and agree to be subject to a $1 million penalty if convicted in a court of law of using Tile for criminal activity. So although it technically makes the device easier for stalkers to use Tiles silently, it makes the penalty of doing so high enough to (at least in theory) deter them from trying.</p><figure><img alt="A person&#x002019;s left hand holding an Apple AirTag with a thumbs-up emoji laser-engraved onto it." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c8da7ff0-ae21-11ed-bbf6-67742b9971f1" style="height: 984; width: 1750;" /><figcaption>Apple AirTag</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco / Engadget</div></figure><p>Hulls believes the approach is superior to Apple’s solution with AirTag, which emits a sound and notifies iPhone users that one of the trackers is following them. (Android users need to download a separate app to receive similar alerts.) “We did our own limited internal testing (view results <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NvAxBG9bvaygMPpUjda5vQxXzOnzmUjw/view">here</a>) to see how quickly AirTags would trigger an alert when following someone who was not their owner, and the results were disappointing,” said Hulls. The CEO says the company’s studies, using the latest AirTag software, show that tracked participants received their first “an AirTag is moving with you” alert within one to 24 hours of walking or driving — and sometimes not for several days.</p><p>Hull says Tile will “make public, to the greatest extent legally possible, all data about any instances of misuse of Tile devices that have been Anti-Theft enabled. Finally, while I am highly confident that the numbers will prove our thesis true, if we find we are wrong, we will reverse course and publicly acknowledge our mistake.”</p>

## The Ghostwriter typewriter brings generative AI to the printed page

<p>Running from 1992 through 1995, <em>Ghostwriter</em>, the beloved PBS children’s television show, followed a diverse group of friends as they solved mysteries around their Brooklyn neighborhood with the help of their haunted typewriter, a cursed item <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ghostwriter-slave-civil-war_n_2877578">possessed by the trapped soul of a murdered runaway Civil War slave</a>. The <a href="https://arvindsanjeev.com/ghostwriter.html">Ghostwriter typewriter</a> developed by interaction designer, artist and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.lumen.world/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!AZnohoM1nYc7faeTrjLzTpbl0ZOy0G3l49z-W_1H41EUCugFV3yI9YU95tknr1jmbk5MIJHvnpp4plORriDue9E$">Lumen.world</a> CTO, Arvind Sanjeev, on the other hand, comes with none of the paranormal hang-ups of its coincidental namesake. Instead of a spirit bound to this hellish plane of existence, forced to help tweens solve low-stakes conundrums, the deus in Sanjeev’s machina is animated by OpenAI’s GPT-3.</p><p>He first devised this artistic endeavor in 2021 as a, “poetic intervention that allows us to take a moment to breathe and reflect on this new creative relationship we are forming with machines.” Built over the course of weekends and evenings, Ghostwriter interacts with its user through the written word, allowing the two to converse and co-create freely through the physical medium of paper.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I wanted Ghostwriter to evoke warm feelings and make people comfortable playing with it,” Sanjeev told Engadget via email. “I chose the mental model of the typewriter for this reason. It is an artifact from our past, a world where technology was more physical and mindful of people's lives.”</p><p>“People trust typewriters and feel comfortable with them because they know their sole purpose is just to create stories on paper,” he added. “This is contrary to today's technology, black boxes that try to propagate unethical business models based on the attention economy.”</p><div id="4307dfabca3f41068677cd81fa608ce0"></div><p>Ghostwriter began as a vintage electronic Brother AX-325 typewriter (chosen on account of its encodable keypad matrix). Sanjeev selected the GPT-3 model in part due to his familiarity with it through his adjunct faculty position at CIID and in part to its impressive “capability to generate creative content,” he noted. “The easily accessible API convinced me to integrate this into Ghostwriter.”</p><p>Sanjeev stripped out much of the machine’s existing mechanical guts and replaced them with an Arduino controller and Raspberry Pi. The arduino reads what the human user has typed on Ghostwriter’s keyboard, then feeds that input to OpenAI’s GPT-3 API through the onboard Raspberry. The AI does its generative magic, spits out a response and Ghostwriter dutifully prints it back onto the page the person’s perusal.</p><p>“The Ghostwriter's tactile slow-typed responses made people meditatively read each word one after the other, bringing out all the quirks and nuances of the AI through its finer details,” Sanjeev said. <br />“Fast digital interactions that live on a word editor tend to hide things like this unintentionally.”</p><p>Teaching the system to tap the correct keys in response proved one of the project’s greatest challenges. Sanjeev had to first decode the existing electronic keyboard’s matrix — the device that converts a key’s physical press into its corresponding digital signal. “I pressed each key, read its triggered signal-scan lines, mapped it to the corresponding key, and finally made a driver that ran on an Arduino,” he wrote. Users can even influence the AI’s answers using two physical knobs that adjust Ghostwriter’s “creativity” and “response length” parameters.</p><p>Ghostwriter will remain unique for a while longer, unfortunately, though Sanjeev is working to opensource the project so that makers around the world might build their own. “I hope to carve out some time to clean up the code and package everything together soon,” he said.</p><p>“Generative AI is definitely not a fad,” Sanjeev declared, though neither is it a silver bullet for content creation. “It is evidence that we have crossed the tipping point for AI creativity that pioneers of AI thought was impossible,” he continued.</p><p>These tools help shape our ideas and can even inspire new ones, but at the end of the day are still merely tools for our creativity, not replacements. “AI is a glorified brush that a painter can use to tell their stories,” Sanjeev said. “Humanity and life will always be the center of any successful work, regardless of whether it is realized through AI.”</p><figure><img alt="a gif of a small embedded led screen displaying the word " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cda54f70-ae16-11ed-bb7e-eacdb3f82c90" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arvind Sanjeev</div></figure><p>GPT’s ultimate applications will depend on the medium in which it is employed — as an active, hands-on instrument for digital content creation but more as a “library of ideas for inspiration” for makers in the physical space. “The key to unlocking the potential of chatGPT in maker spaces lies in creating meaningful physical interfaces for it,” he said. “The role of an artist or creative using AI becomes that of a bonafide curator who selects the best works from the AI, filters it, and passes it to the next phase of the design process.”</p><p>He expects a similar synergy from knowledge workers as well. Automated text generation systems have been the focus of intense media and industry scrutiny in recent months amidst ChatGPT’s rocketing popularity. The technology has shown itself adept at everything from writing linux code and haiku poetry to Wharton Business School entrance exams and <em>CNet</em> financial explainers. Knowledge workers — lawyers, business analysts and journalists, amidst myriad others — are rightly concerned that such automated systems might be used to replace them, as BuzzFeed recently did to its newsroom.</p><p>However, Sanjeev believes that AI will instead have a less conspicuous role to play, instead trickling down  from its generalist creative uses specializing into specific knowledge fields as it goes. “Just like how cloud computing has become pervasive and powers most of the applications today, AI will also become ubiquitous and recede into the backgrounds of our lives once the hype cycle fades away,” Sanjeev argued.</p><p>The AI revolution should lessen the rigors of such jobs and automate much of the drudgier aspects of the work. “The ability to synthesize vast amounts of niche data catered specifically to domains like software engineering, law, and business is being used to train hyper-specialized AIs for these respective fields,” Sanjeev noted.</p><p>OpenAI itself offers custom training packages for its systems so that customers might more easily spin up their own personalized AI doctors and robolawyers. Who ultimately bears responsibility when something goes wrong — whether it’s an AI doctor pushing quack diagnoses or an AI lawyer getting itself disbarred — remains a significant question with few easy answers.</p>

Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov (played by Nikita Yefremov) created the game during the Cold War, but because he was a government employee, he didn't receive any royalties at the outset.

The ad-supported tier, which will not include Showtime, is going up from $5 to $6 per month.</p><p>Paramount Global will increase the prices when it merges the two services, which is expected to happen early in the third quarter of this year (i.e., around July or August). The price hikes will be effective in the US and some other markets, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602432/paramount-plus-price-increase-showtime-streaming"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. They'll be the first price increases <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-launch-details-224238169.html"><ins>since CBS All Access became Paramount+ two years ago</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are now <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/4fc1fca3-9362-4dd6-89b3-13a49c9e8411"><ins>almost 56 million Paramount+ subscribers</ins></a>.

At his desk, there’s his Ready Room chair from the Enterprise E, and in front of him, a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ressikan_flute">Ressikan Flute</a> and a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kurlan_naiskos">Kurlan Naiskos</a>. Later, his combadge from the D will start to chirrup, and Picard will dig through boxes of isolinear chips and old uniforms to find it. Less than ten minutes in and you can already imagine the Reddit threads and website articles listing every single easter egg lurking in the half-focus. “Why would anyone send a coded message to a more than twenty year-old Enterprise D communicator?” asks Picard. It’s a fair question to ask given the whole thing makes absolutely no sense in the show’s internal logic.</p><p>With a message of distress from his former beau, Picard leaps into action by having a nice sit-down chat with Laris. To be fair, Picard was never a kinetic man of action, and he does need to check in with his new partner’s feelings before running off to rescue his old one. Once he has done that, he leaps into action by going to Ten Forward for a boozy sit-down drink with Riker.</p><p>The scene transition has Picard staring at the Enterprise D painting before we crossfade to an Eaglemoss model of the D on the bar shelf. If there was one thing this show needed, it was more beauty shots of memorabilia lovingly presented on shelves. Although there’s a glimmer of self-deprecation, with the server declaring that “nobody wants the fat ones.” When a sinister figure winds up following Picard and Riker out of the bar, they drop the same Enterprise D model into a glass for one last close-up.</p><p>After a detour to Raffi, undercover on M’Talas Prime (<em>real subtle, </em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558052/"><em>Terry</em></a>), the fanservice goes broader. First up, we’ll get some nods to the ‘80s Trek movies, paying off the <em>Wrath of Khan</em>-aping  “In the 25th Century…” title card. Riker and Picard banter on their way to Spacedock, hatching a plan to hijack the Titan to mount a rescue mission under the nose of its new captain, Shaw. But the Titan has been so completely refitted from the Luna class that it gets an A on its registry as a “Neo Constitution Class.” I’ll admit – this managed to short-circuit my nostalgia glands, since I’m a sucker for Andrew Probert and Richard Taylor’s starship design and <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HTVFUellwNzU2byIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTc2NmFlZDItZmZjOC00MDg2LTkxM2YtMDY1ZTI2ZGYxNDIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAa8cuZ2Stj_Rgk758W2AE7IGpjmDzavahnC9hT1aBjqZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGMQTzYp756o">Jerry Goldsmith’s <em>Motion Picture</em></a> score.

After 40 minutes, Picard has received a distress call and spoken to lots of people about it, and that’s about it. There’s been plenty of callbacks and continuity porn, paraphiliac depictions of old props, but very little forward motion in the narrative. Picard and Riker make it to Beverley’s ship only to find her in a stasis pod, with her son keeping watch. They’re attacked and left stranded with no hope of escape while a big pointy ship with a Romulan-esque design menaces outside.</p><p>Now, remind me. A successful Starfleet Admiral gets a distress call from an old flame, a Doctor no less, who is being threatened by things unknown. When he comes to her aid, he first meets her adult son who instantly gets into a fistfight with the good guys before they realize who he is and what he represents. All the while, our heroes are being menaced by a much more powerful vessel which is looming long in the background. Have we ever seen that in Star Trek before?</p>

## Microsoft explains Bing's bizarre AI chat behavior

<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surprise-event-bing-chatgpt-201414297.html">launched</a> its Bing AI chat product for the Edge browser last week, and it's been in the news ever since — but not always for the right reasons. Our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">initial impressions</a> were strong, as it offered up workout routines, travel itineraries and more without a hitch.&nbsp;</p><p>However, users started noticing that Bing's bot gave incorrect information, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8xNi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2JpbmctY2hhdGJvdC1taWNyb3NvZnQtY2hhdGdwdC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNTY1NWZkMy1iZDU0LTQwNzUtOTllNC0yOTk2ZjA4NjQ0OTkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZtPrwZpyxdW7h0kTrcar7JQ589i-HJ_5TryRHUK-3ri&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F02%2F16%2Ftechnology%2Fbing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html">berated users</a> for wasting its time and even exhibited "<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ad39b/microsoft-bing-ai-unhinged-lying-berating-users">unhinged</a>" behavior. In one bizarre conversation, it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bing/comments/110eagl/the_customer_service_of_the_new_bing_chat_is/">refused</a> to give listings for <em>Avatar: The Way of the Water</em>, insisting the movie hadn't come out yet because it was still 2022. It then called the user "unreasonable and stubborn" (among other things) when they tried to tell Bing it was wrong.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, Microsoft has released a blog post explaining what's been happening and how it's addressing the issues. To start with, the company admitted that it didn't envision Bing's AI being used for "general discovery of the world and for social entertainment."</p><div id="abb2f1deed5d4b069ec3e46992b086c0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bing subreddit has quite a few examples of new Bing chat going out of control. <br /><br />Open ended chat in search might prove to be a bad idea at this time!<br /><br />Captured here as a reminder that there was a time when a major search engine showed this in its results. <a href="https://t.co/LiE2HJCV2z">pic.twitter.com/LiE2HJCV2z</a></p>— Vlad (@vladquant) <a href="https://twitter.com/vladquant/status/1624996869654056960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Those "long, extended chat sessions of 15 or more questions" can send things off the rails. "Bing can become repetitive or be prompted/provoked to give responses that are not necessarily helpful or in line with our designed tone," the company said. That apparently occurs because question after question can cause the bot to "forget" what it was trying to answer in the first place. To fix that, Microsoft may add a tool that lets you reset the search context or start from scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>The other issue is more complex and interesting: "The model at times tries to respond or reflect in the tone in which it is being asked to provide responses that can lead to a style we didn’t intend," Microsoft wrote. It takes a lot of prompting to get that to happen, but the engineers think they might be able to fix it by giving users more control.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite those issues, testers have generally given Bing's AI good marks on citations and references for search, Microsoft said, though it needs to get better with "very timely data like live sports scores." It's also looking to improve factual answers for things like financial reports by boosting grounding data by four times. Finally, they'll be "adding a toggle that gives you more control on the precision vs. creativity of the answer to tailor to your query."</p><p>The Bing team thanked users for the testing to date, saying it "helps us improve the product for everyone." At the same time, they expressed surprise that folks would spend up to two hours in chat sessions. Users will no doubt be just as diligent trying to break any new updates, so we could be in for an interesting ride over the next while.</p>

## PlayStation VR2 review: A great headset that should be cheaper

<p>The PlayStation VR 2 is the virtual reality upgrade console gamers have been waiting for — but is it really worth $550? That depends on how much you need high quality VR.&nbsp;</p><p>The virtual reality landscape looks completely different today than it did in 2016. The original PlayStation VR arrived amid the peak of the VR hype, which kicked off with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-28-oculus-rift-review.html">Oculus Rift </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-16-htc-vive-mini-review-video.html">HTC Vive</a>. While they weren't perfect, wearing any of those devices was like shoving your eyeballs right into the next major leap for computing. And if VR took off, it was only a matter of time until we were all wearing augmented reality glasses. Clearly, that hasn't happened.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e000648228cf440f81d1c644a66d6a70"></div><p>Now that much of the initial excitement around VR has fizzled out, the PlayStation VR2 is more of a curiosity than a must-have gadget. It has all of the specs you'd want from a next-generation headset, but it also costs more than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5 </a>itself. Sony says more than 30 games will be available during the PS VR2's launch window, but who knows how well it'll be supported over the next few years.</p><p>And really, what's the point of a pricey tethered headset when the Meta Quest 2 gets you completely wireless VR (albeit of much lower quality) for $399? No matter how you look at it, the PSVR2 is a tough sell. And yet, I can't help but be impressed by it. The PS VR 2 packs in the best of high-end PC VR, including innovative features like eye tracking, as well as something we've never seen before: Haptics for your head!</p><p>Before we get to that though, let's take a look at the PS VR2 itself. At first glance, it seems like an evolved form of the original, with a design that's more reminiscent of the PS5. Instead of a bulbous Fisher Price-esque toy, the PS VR2 actually looks like something built with artistic ambition. (Get ready to roll your eyes when it's highlighted at MOMA.) Sure, it's still made of plastic, but at least it's <em>good </em>plastic, the same stuff used for the PS5's exterior shell and the DualSense controllers.</p><figure><img alt="PlayStation VR2 side profile while worn" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20bbd566-adb5-11ed-9ef9-c52bf6b1bc73" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I also didn't mind the plastic much since the PS VR2's internal hardware is such a massive upgrade. It features dual 2K OLED screens, which effectively deliver a 4K image. The field of view has also been bumped up to 110 degrees, putting it on-par with most other high-end VR headsets. While the displays still offer 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rates, in my experience everything just looks smoother thanks to the PS5's additional horsepower.</p><p>Up front, you'll find four sensors that track the headset and its new Sense controllers. Thanks to these "inside out" sensors, which are also found on the Meta Quest and many other headsets, the PS VR2 doesn't require a PlayStation camera to track its movement like before. Along the top, there's a button to extend the front half of the headset, as well as a dial to adjust the pupillary distance. It does so by physically moving the lenses to match the distance between your eyes, something that was sorely missing from Sony's first headset.</p><figure><img alt="PlayStation VR2 looking from the rear" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20aae570-adb5-11ed-bbef-2461cbe02b5b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>At the bottom of the PS VR2 there's a small microphone, power button and selection button. To get audio, you'll have to plug in the bundled earbuds along the back of the headset. There's nothing stopping you from using your own headphones or earbuds, but the cable situation would likely be a mess.</p><p>As for securing the PS VR2 to your head, I was happy to find that Sony didn't really change much from the incredibly comfortable first model. The PS VR2 features plush cushioning for your forehead, as well as a thicker cushion that sits behind your skull. Clicking the dial on the rear extends the arms of the headset, and like before, you secure it by twisting the dial. Together with its impeccably balanced design and light weight, the PS VR2 is a dream to wear. I only wish the headset flipped up like those forgotten Windows Mixed Reality devices – that would have made it far easier to slip on and off.</p><p>Still, I'm happy that Sony listened to the many criticisms of the Move wand controllers on the original PS VR. The new Sense controllers are actually purpose built for virtual reality – they're practically a carbon copy of Meta's Quest controllers, with a large tracking ring, analog sticks, two face buttons, triggers and grip buttons. Both remotes have haptic feedback, PlayStation buttons, and they also split the sharing and option buttons found on the DualSense. Overall they're a huge step up, though it would be nice if they were easier to put on when you're stuck in VR. It's hard to tell which controller is which, and their elaborate design makes it tough to get your fingers in the right places.</p><figure><img alt="PlayStation VR2 Sense controller" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20bcbfc0-adb5-11ed-b31f-a2070168c4d8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Every time I was frustrated with those controllers, though, I took a breath and appreciated what Sony got right. The setup process for the PS VR2, for example, is vastly simpler than the previous model. Now all you need to do is plug in a single USB-C cable into the front of your PS5 to get the headset going. You're still dealing with a nearly 15-foot cable, but at least it doesn't involve an additional breakout box and camera.</p><p>After pairing my Sense controllers with my PS5, I stepped through the familiar process of scanning my space and measuring the floor by lowering my controllers down. The PS VR2 did an impressive job of recognizing the safe play space I had in my basement, but I also appreciated being able to tweak specific sections to my liking. As with every other VR headset, you can choose to play games while sitting or standing up. I enjoyed both positions, but intensive games like <em>Horizon VR: Call of the Mountain</em> benefit from having more room. It's easier to feel like a post-apocalyptic warrior when you're actually breaking a sweat.</p><section><img alt="Playing Horizon VR on the PlayStation VR2" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20bce6d0-adb5-11ed-936b-8258bc291a1c" /></section><p><em>Horizon VR</em> ended up being the perfect game to show off everything the new headset could do. From the start, the PS VR2's screens astounded me with rich color and a wonderful level of contrast. You can chalk that up to the power of OLED displays. I'm no stranger to the elaborately detailed environments of the <em>Horizon</em> games, but scaling cliff sides and peering down mountains in VR is another matter entirely. <em>Horizon VR</em> taps into the headset's eye tracking sensors for choosing menu options, and it also uses that feature for foveated rendering, which concentrates the PS5's power on the things you're looking at.</p><p>As I ogled the game's robotic wildlife, I was also surprised to find the PS VR2 rumbling around my head. I forgot that Sony was actually bringing haptics to the headset, and my first experience with that practically had me jumping out of my seat. Now I've tested tons of VR headsets, many with far better screens than the PS VR2. But none of them shook me to my core in the same way. Headset haptics could be abused down the line, but right now many developers are trying to use it tastefully.</p><p>The opening scenes of <em>Jurassic World Aftermath</em>, for example, hit a lot differently with a vibrating headset. Within the first few minutes, you encounter a pterodactyl attack, plane crash and a hungry T-Rex. And every time a dinosaur roared, it vibrated through my skull. You can, of course, turn off headset haptics if you want. But personally, I can't wait to see how new games take advantage of it. It's almost like feeling the DualSense controllers for the first time – we've all experienced haptics before, but Sony is doing it in entirely new ways.</p><figure><img alt="Playing Horizon VR on the PlayStation VR2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20bbd567-adb5-11ed-bb3f-93e019c44019" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The company's tracking technology also feels more mature than what I've seen from the Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro. It rarely runs into hiccups, something I saw frequently with the first PS VR. The new inside out tracking system handled fast-paced games like <em>Rez Infinite</em> without any issues, and it also proved to be great with titles that required fine movement, like <em>Tentacular</em>. That game puts you in the role of a giant tentacle monster tasked with odd jobs like demolishing buildings or collecting enormous shipping containers. Having tentacle arms is tough – trying to manage them with glitchy motion tracking would be even tougher.</p><p>Sony knows how to make a good controller, so it's no surprise that the new Sense VR devices both feel great, even for lengthy play sessions. They typically lasted for around four hours, so I'd recommend investing in the $50 charging bay to keep the topped up. Otherwise, you'll have to remember to plug them into USB-C cables.</p><p>When you're not gaming, the PS VR2 also makes for a great personal cinema, something that could be useful if you're forced to share a living room TV. The headset makes video appear as if you're a few feet away from a 100-inch screen, so it's far more immersive than most televisions. I was able to kick back and comfortably enjoy some YouTube videos, Netflix shows and Blu-rays. This wouldn't be my first choice for binge watching anything (it's tough to eat or drink while plugged into VR) but it's great if you don't have space for a projector screen.</p><figure><img alt="PlayStation VR2 overheard view" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20aae571-adb5-11ed-9f7e-e1b54f987f5c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As much as I enjoyed my time with the PS VR2, playing many of these games felt like being thrown back in time. Seriously, I'll play <em>Rez Infinite </em>at every given opportunity, and it looks dramatically better on the new headset. But fundamentally, it's the same game that was released back in 2016 on the PS4 (itself a remake of the original 2001 title). And really, that's the story of many games coming to the PS VR2. <em>Tentacular</em> is a blast, but it arrived on the Quest 2 last year, and the <em>Jurassic World</em> game is even older. Perhaps upcoming VR releases, like <em>Grand Turismo </em>7 and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, will make a better case for Sony's new headset. Right now, though, it feels like it's arriving several years too late.</p><p>And then there's the price. Asking gamers to spend $550 on an accessory just feels like punishment after they shelled out almost the same amount on the PS5 itself. The original PS VR cost $500 if you bought the camera and controller bundle, but its base price was $400 if you already had those accessories. If Sony actually wanted to push VR adoption to new heights, rather than extract every cent of profit possible, the PS VR2 should have been $400 or less. It's particularly tough to stomach now with the $400 Meta Quest 2 around (and don't forget it used to be $300 before Meta bumped its price up). But hey, at least the PS VR2 feels like a better deal than the $1,500 Meta Quest Pro.</p><figure><img alt="PlayStation VR2 headset and controllers" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/20aae572-adb5-11ed-b7dc-9a0c143efcab" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I'm sure the PlayStation VR2 will come down in price eventually, but it seems like Sony is bungling what should be an important launch. Right now, it feels more like the PlayStation Vita than any other Sony product — an innovative device that the company just doesn't know how to handle. I'm also hoping Sony considers PC compatibility eventually, as that could help to justify its higher price. (I won't be surprised if third-party drivers arrive soon, though pairing the controllers may be an issue.)</p><p>If you're a PS5 owner that's been dying to see what PC VR enthusiasts have been enjoying for the past few years, the PSVR2 is exactly what you've been waiting for. Everyone else should just sit tight until the price drops and more new games arrive. And if the VR industry continues its current downward trajectory, that discount may happen sooner than you think.</p>

## Plex's latest feature lets you skip movie and TV show credits
 - [https://www.engadget.com/plexs-skip-credits-feature-124554033.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/plexs-skip-credits-feature-124554033.html?src=rss)

<p>Plex now has the capability to skip intros <em>and</em> credits, so you don't have to sit through them if you don't want to. The streaming media service has introduced its new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/let-the-next-episode-roll/">&quot;Skip Credits&quot; feature</a>, a couple of years after a similar feature debuted for intros, and it shows up as a button at the bottom right corner of the screen. It appears the moment credits start rolling, allowing you to play the next episode in a series or to automatically jump to a mid- or post-credit scene in a movie with a single click.&nbsp;</p><p>This new credit detection feature is available throughout <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-04-plex-free-streaming-service-movies-tv-shows.html">Plex's entire free streaming</a> catalogue, giving it a viewing experience similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-24-netflix-post-play-feature-that-smoothly-jumps-to-the-next-epis.html">Netflix's</a> in that regard. But you can also enable it for your personal collection, so long as you have Plex Pass subscription, which will set you back $5 a month or $40 a year. The company said it developed its own Skip Credits technology by training a machine learning algorithm to be able to detect markers like text and dark frames.

## The Morning After: Elon Musk reportedly had his own tweets boosted out of jealousy

<p>If you've been using Twitter's For You feed this week, you might’ve noticed the algorithmic feed showed a lot of Elon Musk's tweets and replies. According to <em>Platformer</em>, which interviewed Twitter employees, engineers tweaked the social network to benefit their CEO. Elon's cousin and Twitter employee James Musk sent an urgent message on the company's Slack on Monday morning. He called the situation &quot;high urgency&quot; and asked everyone who can write code to help.</p><p>What had happened? President Biden's Super Bowl tweet about rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles got more engagement than Musk's. Apparently, the president's tweet generated almost 29 million impressions, whereas Musk's generated only 9.1 million before he deleted it.</p><p>The fix they came up with, <em>Platformer </em>says, was code that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-artificially-boost-elon-musk-tweets-053602807.html https://www.engadget.com/...">artificially boosted</a> Musk's tweets by a factor of 1,000. Musk acknowledged the change in his own way, by <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1625368108461613057?uuid=YkdYlgVHlAtmoVvm3705"><ins>posting the &quot;forced to drink milk&quot; meme</ins></a>. He also asked people to stay tuned while Twitter adjusted the &quot;algorithm.&quot; According to the report, Musk's tweets are still artificially boosted, it seems, just not quite as much.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Tesla fired New York workers 'in retaliation for union activity,' complaint alleges

<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-workers-seeking-unionize-new-york-131506705.html">reported</a> that Tesla workers in the company's Buffalo, New York Autopilot facility had sent a letter to CEO Elon Musk stating their attention to unionize. Now, organizers at the same location are accusing the company of illegally terminating employees &quot;in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity,&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-16/tesla-tsla-fires-unionizing-workers-after-labor-campaign-complaint-alleges"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>In a filing with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Workers United union accused Tesla of attempting to discourage its organizing activities. It has asked for a federal court injunction to &quot;prevent irreparable destruction of employee rights resulting from Tesla’s unlawful conduct.&quot; Several of the employees let go had been involved in labor discussion, and one was the member of an organizing committee.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This is a form of collective retaliation... designed to terrify everyone about potential consequences of them organizing, as well as to attempt to cull the herd,&quot; Workers United organizer Jaz Brisack told <em>Bloomberg</em>. (Engadget has contacted Tesla for comment, but doesn't anticipate a reply given the company no longer has a dedicated press office.)</p><p>Employees involved in the campaign are in charge of labeling data for Tesla's Autopilot technology. The group is asking for better pay, job security and a work environment that reduces production pressures. The group previously said that Tesla engages in keystroke monitoring to see how long they spend on tasks, and shut down an internal chatroom used for airing grievances.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the earlier report, Tesla issued a directive to &quot;protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of all Tesla business information.&quot; However, one employee said the terminations are galvanizing, rather than intimidating workers. &quot;It's pretty clear the message they're sending,&quot; said Sara Constatino. &quot;And it's really I think backfiring on them.&quot; The NLRB will now investigate the claims and could prosecute them before a judge if it finds merit.&nbsp;</p>

## IK Multimedia ToneX Pedal puts AI-powered guitar rig modeling at your feet

<p>IK Multimedia has been in the guitar rig emulation game for a long time. It released the first version of AmpliTube way back in 2002. And while the company has branched out quite a bit since then into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uno-synth-pro-review-ik-multimedia-shows-its-serious-about-hardware-120008688.html">synths</a>, microphones and studio monitors, it hasn't given up on the world of guitar just yet. In September it released <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c77776cd-956c-41ab-9a68-eadfbcc0ac19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=IK+Multimedia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzc3NzZjZC05NTZjLTQxYWItOWE2OC1lYWRmYmNjMGFjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWttdWx0aW1lZGlhLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90b25leC8_cGtleT10b25leC1zdy1tYXgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBiNGQ3NjJjLWFjZGUtNGJmMi1iNTBhLWY3YmI5OGJkNTQ5ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcdiUm1HU7xei7hli1UoClD59AandUqxhNExj9EDUBkf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikmultimedia.com%2Fproducts%2Ftonex%2F%3Fpkey%3Dtonex-sw-max">Amplitude ToneX</a>, an AI-powered update to its long-running modeling software. And now it's combining that cutting edge software with its line of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ik-multimedia-amplitube-x-gear-pedals-073045987.html">AmpliTube effects pedals</a> to make a play at the increasingly popular market for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-uafx-guitar-amp-emulator-pedals-review-120006860.html">hardware amp emulators</a>.</p><p>The ToneX Pedal, at least physically, appears to be nearly identical to the other members of the AmpliTube pedal family. Though, rather than just offer a selection of delay effects, it can play host to entire rigs — from amplifies, cabs and even effects pedals. Users can capture and recreate their own gear if they want, great if you've got a lot of heavy (and expensive) vintage gear that you don't want to risk at your next gig at the local punk rock bar. Just make a digital emulation, save it to the pedal and plug that straight into the venue's PA. Of course, what will be of more interest to most is the library of over 1,000 Tone Models that are included with the ToneX Max software, and the over 6,000 user generated models on ToneNet.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The pedal can store up to 150 presets at a time that model everything from modern metal rigs to individual pedals. What's more, if you've got a collection of impulse responses (IRs) you've collected, you can load them on the pedal as well to customize your selection of cabinets, and the pedal even has mic simulation built in, so you can plug straight into your DAW without having to sacrifice "room tone".&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, the ToneX Pedal has a noise gate, EQ and compressor circuits, as well as five reverbs borrowed from the AmpliTube <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c77776cd-956c-41ab-9a68-eadfbcc0ac19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=IK+Multimedia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzc3NzZjZC05NTZjLTQxYWItOWE2OC1lYWRmYmNjMGFjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWttdWx0aW1lZGlhLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy94c3BhY2UvP3BrZXk9eHNwYWNlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYjRkNzYyYy1hY2RlLTRiZjItYjUwYS1mN2JiOThiZDU0OWUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWnwLNEd6x2Ct7aViysM5qi2k-p6gby4eWMFVnulRPtR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikmultimedia.com%2Fproducts%2Fxspace%2F%3Fpkey%3Dxspace">X-Space</a> pedal. Plus it integrates with AmpliTube 5 on your computer, and can even be used as an audio interface for directly capturing guitar tracks, and it has MIDI in and out to make sure everything syncs up right.

## City of Oakland declares state of emergency in wake of ransomware attack

<p>The city government of Oakland, California was <a href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2023/city-of-oakland-targeted-by-ransomware-attack-core-services-not-affected">hit by a ransomware attack</a> on February 8th, and its departments can still feel the security breach's ramifications. While the local government didn't give out details about the incident, such as how much money the bad actors are demanding, it said in an announcement that the city had to take its network offline to contain the attack. That has rendered many of Oakland's non-emergency services inaccessible, such as websites that would allow residents to pay parking fines or taxes online. The city's systems meant for processing reports and issuing permits or licenses are offline, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>While Oakland previously assured residents that 911 dispatch and fire emergency services weren't affected by the breach, its police department warned people that the attack has delayed response times. It's now encouraging people to file reports online for non-emergency complaints. Oakland also had to close some of its buildings and is now asking people to email government offices' service counters before coming to visit.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="77409ee7aa7848d9b1000c15d626f00c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Oakland's recent ransomware attack has delayed response times. <br /><br />If you don’t have an emergency, please consider the following to report incidents:<br /><br />•OPD Online Reporting: <a href="https://t.co/7svLaOGpJY">https://t.co/7svLaOGpJY</a><br /><br />Follow the link for more details:<a href="https://t.co/BWbP3XFANQ">https://t.co/BWbP3XFANQ</a><a href="https://t.co/DyD8IrgATs">pic.twitter.com/DyD8IrgATs</a></p>— Oakland Police Dept.

Doing so allows them to expedite the purchase of equipment and materials needed to get government services running as usual, as well as to deploy emergency workers if needed. Although details surrounding the attack remain unclear, the city's Information Technology Department is currently working with law enforcement and a leading forensics firm to investigate the scope and severity of the issue. &quot;This continues to be an ongoing investigation with multiple local, state, and federal agencies involved,&quot; Oakland said in an announcement, along with the promise to keep the public updated if it has more details to share.</p>

## Google relies on human employees to improve Bard chatbot's responses

<p>In a video ad Google posted on Twitter, its yet-to-be-launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">AI chatboard Bard</a> confidently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">spouted misinformation</a> about the James Webb Space Telescope. &quot;JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system,&quot; the chatbot replied, which is patently false. (It was the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope that captured images of exoplanets for the first time.) Now, the tech giant is looking to improve Bard's accuracy, and according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/google-asks-employees-to-rewrite-bards-incorrect-responses-to-queries.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, it's asking employees for help.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's VP for search, Prabhakar Raghavan, reportedly sent an email to staff members, asking them to rewrite Bard responses on topics they know well. The chatbot &quot;learns best by example,&quot; Raghavan said, and training it with factual answers will help improve its accuracy. Raghavan also included a list of &quot;dos&quot; and &quot;don'ts&quot; when it comes to fixing Bard's responses, based on the email seen by <em>CNBC</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Responses should be in first person POV, should be unopinionated and neutral, and they should have a polite, casual and approachable tone. Employees are also instructed to &quot;avoid making presumptions based on race, nationality, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, political ideology, location, or similar categories.&quot; They're asked not to describe Bard as a person, imply that it has emotions or claim that it has human-like experiences. Plus, they're instructed to thumbs down any responses the chatbot might give containing &quot;legal, medical, financial advice&quot; or are hateful and abusive.</p><p>Raghavan's memo came after Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/google-ceo-some-of-companys-top-products-were-not-first-to-market.html">emailed employees</a>, asking them to spend a few hours each week testing the AI chatbot. Google employees reportedly criticized Pichai for a &quot;rushed&quot; and &quot;botched&quot; Bard rollout. The CEO is now giving staffers the chance to &quot;help shape [the chatbot] and contribute&quot; by testing the company's new product. He also reminded everyone that some of Google's &quot;most successful products were not first to market&quot; and that they &quot;gained momentum because they solved important user needs and were built on deep technical insights.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>People have been anticipating Google's response to ChatGPT ever since the OpenAI chatbot arrived late last year. The Microsoft-backed technology has gained tremendous popularity over the past few months, enough to rattle Alphabet and its investors. Google tried to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/google-best-yet-to-come-ai-journey-faces-potential-disruption-openai-chatgpt/">assuage investors' concerns</a> during its quarterly earnings call in early February by talking about its own chatbot and by touching on its work developing an AI-powered Search to compete with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">next-gen Bing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
