As long as everyone in the media and the news entertainment clickbait complex all skews the in the same political direction, cancel culture will always be with us. But without Twitter employees putting their thumb on the scale over who gets canceled and whose tweets calling for someone to get canceled are amplified, there will be a lot less of it.</p><p>Look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-cancelled-twitter\" target=\"_blank\">regular target of \"cancelation\" Chris Pratt</a>. Prior to Elon buying Twitter, all it took was <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-james-gunn-thor\" target=\"_self\">Pratt showing up in the Thor trailer</a> for \"Twitter\" to \"demand\" Pratt be canceled. Or, when the actor <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-pratt-pilloried-daughter-classy-faith-based-statements\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">would post something about his family</a>. You see, the knock on Pratt (by idiots) is that he likes Jesus, America, and hunting. And because he uses his platform to make millions of people happy and NOT attack Trump supporters, leftists hate him. Yet a few movie trailers and a few more Instagram posts about how much he loves his wife later, no one has tried \"canceling\" him after Elon took over.</p><p>It's not just a lack of Cancelling Chris. Japanese Twitter users noticed after a reporter complained <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-trending-topics-japan\" target=\"_self\">she had no one left at Twitter to call anymore to make sure her \"news\" articles trended</a>, the bird app was becoming more pleasant:</p><blockquote><em>Users appear to consider the new trending list as more authentic than the politics-infused list allegedly curated by Twitter, which is a fair assumption. Japanese users have compared this list to previous days where almost all trending topics were political in nature. The user who posted the list called the new trends \u201cpeaceful\u201d and joked about how the curation team must have spend their time \u201csorting out topics like this every day\u201d.</em></blockquote><p>It turns out that when Twitter employees don't have their finger on the scale, Twitter users don't care about the political topics those Twitter employees want them to be outraged over. Without Twitter's thumb on the scale amplifying outrage tweets over the tweets of people criticizing the outrage, lazy journalismers have less to write about.</p><p><span></span><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
