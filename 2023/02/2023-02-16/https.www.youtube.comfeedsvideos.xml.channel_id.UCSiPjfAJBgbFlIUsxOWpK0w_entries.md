Flowers x When I was Your Man?! It’s the mashup we have all been hoping for! Sara and Moira absolutely crushed it with this arrangement and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Ben Rose have this much fun in the drum booth (which is definitely not a vocal booth that we just stuffed the drum set into whaaaa?). There are so many amazing little moments woven into the song and the video, I’m not sure it’s possible to pick a favorite one!

LYRICS
I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I

I should have bought you flowers
I can buy myself flowers
And held your hand
Write my name in the sand
Given you all of my hours
Talk to myself for hours
When I had the chance
Say things you don't understand
Take you to every party
I can take myself dancing
All you wanted to do was dance
And I can hold my own hand

Oh I can love me better
Now she don't need a man

Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I

I should have bought you flowers
I can buy myself flowers
And held your hand
Write my name in the sand
Given you all of my hours
Talk to myself for hours
When I had the chance
Say things you don't understand
Take you to every party
I can take myself dancing
All you wanted to do was dance
And I can hold my own hand

Oh I can love me better
Now she don't need a man

Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby

I should have bought you flowers
I can buy myself flowers
And held your hand
Write my name in the sand
Given you all of my hours
Talk to myself for hours
When I had the chance
Say things you don't understand
Take you to every party
I can take myself dancing
All you wanted to do was dance
And I can hold my own hand

Oh I can love me better than you can
