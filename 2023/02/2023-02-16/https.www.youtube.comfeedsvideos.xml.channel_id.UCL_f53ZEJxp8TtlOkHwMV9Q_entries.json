Due to the attacks on 9/11, she enlisted in the Army National Guard. In 2004, she gave up an easy re-election campaign and volunteered to deploy to Iraq with the 29th Brigade Combat Team where she served in a medical unit. After returning home in 2006, Tulsi worked in the U.S. Senate as a legislative aide to the late Senator Danny Akaka, who was Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. She then volunteered for a second Middle East deployment as a Platoon Leader.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand the true cost of war, Tulsi ran for United States Congress at age 31, vowing to honor the lives and sacrifice of her brothers and sisters in uniform. She prevailed in a difficult election and went on to serve in Congress for eight years as a member of the Armed Services, Homeland Security, and Foreign Affairs Committees. Foregoing a run for re-election to Congress, she ran as a Presidential candidate in the Democratic Party in 2020. Tulsi puts country before party and approaches every issue, domestic and foreign, based on ensuring the safety, security, and freedom of the American people.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\n- Sponsors - \n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nBirch Gold Group: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Tulsi Gabbard:\n\nWebsite: https://www.tulsigabbard.com/podcast/ \nSubstack: https://tulsi.substack.com/ \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/tulsigabbard \nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tulsi-gabbard-show/id1549623127 \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:10) Intro\n(3:45) Starting out as a Democrat\n(7:16) The Socialist tradition of Canada\n(9:10) 911, enlisting, and the National Guard\n(13:10) Fighting terrorism in Iraq\n(15:20) Corporate government collusion\n(18:00) Women in the armed forces\n(24:11) Equity is not equality\n(24:45) The issue of women as POWs\n(27:55) On the edge of global conflict\n(32:20) Following Russia\u2019s war\n(35:43) What does western victory look like?\n(40:26) The Treaty of Versailles, learning from history\n(44:07) We are fighting a proxy war\n(45:50) Biden blocking diplomacy?\n(48:04) The military-industrial complex\n(49:44) Republicans and crony capitalism\n(53:02) The freshman class, pressure to corrupt\n(56:46) Funding and frustration\n(1:03:37) The DNC: checking boxes and walking away\n(1:10:01) Hillary Clinton: a record of war\n(1:16:46) Positives in the Republican Party\n(1:18:35) There is still promise in the system\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N0vQ4Tq3ew", "date_published": "2023-02-16 16:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
