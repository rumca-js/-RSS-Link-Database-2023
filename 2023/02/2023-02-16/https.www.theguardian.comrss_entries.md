<p>Local governments cannot ban police from enforcing certain gun laws in ruling that could have national ramifications</p><p>An Oregon court dealt a blow to the state’s “second amendment sanctuary” movement, deciding on Wednesday that local governments cannot ban police from enforcing certain gun laws in a ruling that could hold national ramifications for anti-gun control efforts.</p><p>At the center of the lawsuit was a 2020 measure passed in Columbia county, a conservative area in the Democratic state, that argued state and federal gun laws did not apply in the county and banned local officials from enforcing the regulations. The rural region was one of some 1,200 in the US, from Virginia to New Mexico to Florida, to pass a second amendment sanctuary resolution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/16/oregon-second-amendment-sanctuary-decision">Continue reading...</a>

Chart-toppers The Lathums were booked to play pre-match while England’s strongest man, Paul Smith, attempted to set a world record at half-time. But they only really care about one thing in this town, and there can be no escaping that last year Warrington’s players failed to match the fanfare the club often generates off the field.</p><p>How Daryl Powell and his players took an emphatic first step towards putting that right here, though. It is only the opening night and as such, it’s difficult to read anything too conclusive into what Warrington’s prospects may look like. But one thing is for certain: their supporters will expect, if not demand, more than what they got last year, when they limped to an 11th-place finish in Powell’s first season in charge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/16/george-williams-masterclass-gets-warrington-off-to-winning-start-against-leeds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Prue Leith and her Tory MP son hold profoundly opposing views on legalised euthanasia. They tackle them in a sensitive, fascinating show that’s full of nuance and respect</p><p>There has been a line of celebrity parent-child “road trips” creeping on to our screens. Bradley Walsh occasionally takes some time off from The Chase in order to travel with his son on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/30/bradley-barney-walsh-breaking-dad-itv">Breaking Dad</a>.

Now Prue Leith and her son, the Conservative MP Danny Kruger, are taking up that mantle with Prue and Danny’s Death Road Trip (Channel 4). That sounds like a lovely tour of near-death experiences, doesn’t it? Will Kruger be taking his mother skydiving? Will Leith gamely attempt to lasso a bull at the rodeo? “This film is about assisted death and whether we should legalise it in Britain,” Leith explains. Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in the Bake Off tent any more.</p><p>This is a thoughtful and nuanced film about the assisted dying debate, and it finds a great way to tell the story and examine both sides, by way of a mother and son who have diametrically opposed opinions on the issue. Leith is in favour of legalising assisted dying in Britain and campaigns for it, having seen the slow and painful death of her older brother David. “I would rather die like most dogs die,” she says, calmly. Her son, meanwhile, chairs an all-party parliamentary group, Dying Well, which campaigns to oppose euthanasia, arguing that it is impossible to legalise assisted dying without opening up the process to coercion and abuse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/16/prue-and-dannys-death-road-trip-review-the-lovely-tale-of-a-bake-off-judge-and-her-sons-debate-about-dying">Continue reading...</a>

In Shirley, Robbie Scott accomplishes this for several women, although particularly his unnamed narrator. Scott writes her in the first person, a potentially fraught move as it assumes an air of authority that, if done badly, would leave him more exposed to criticisms about assumptions and cliches.</p><p>But I have none. Because he has created a woman who feels so familiar it seems that if Scott has not, in fact, been perched outside my window, then he has been paying close attention to the women around him. This quiet curiosity into domesticity is rare and rewards the reader with a deep understanding of the oddities of these particular characters in this precise time and place.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/17/shirley-by-ronnie-scott-review-finally-a-male-author-who-brilliantly-writes-women">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luke Shaw had said that this would show Manchester United where they are, just how real their revival is, and Barcelona felt much the same way. The answer may not be conclusive yet, and they’ll have to wait a week to see whether or not they are even in the Europa League proper, but on Thursday night at least it was clear: somewhere good. When Ronald Araújo leaped at the far post to head the final chance, it was the 35th attempt on goal of what had turned out to be an open, enjoyable and unexpectedly wild night. Four of them went in and it was a lot of fun.</p><p>Marcos Alonso scored the first, then Marcus Rashford the second on a night where he scared an entire stadium every time he set off, before a Jules Koundé own goal seemed likely to send United into the second leg with the lead. For a while, in fact, it looked like it might put them through, full stop. Barcelona looked beaten. But then they were born again, Raphinha’s cross turning into a shot and this stadium turning into a mad house, the final minutes belonging more to Barcelona.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/16/barcelona-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With rights now in the public domain, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey turns beloved children’s characters into killers</p><p>In the new film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, AA Milne’s beloved storybook bear embarks upon a murderous rampage, driven to homicidal madness by Christopher Robin’s abandonment for adulthood.</p><p>As explained by a prologue in crude stick-figure animation, a cold winter in the Hundred Acre Wood left Pooh and the rest of the gang with no choice but to cannibalize melancholic donkey Eeyore for survival, which marked a nightmarish surrender of all civility for a return to their basest beastly natures. A warped Pooh and Piglet, the latter wielding the savage force of 30 to 50 feral hogs, loose their unslakable hunger for carnage on a cadre of young hotties unaware that their weekend getaway to the woods is about to uphold horror-movie tradition in grisly fashion. As a buxom influencer snaps a series of bikini selfies in the cabin’s hot tub, Piglet creeps up behind her with a chloroform rag, then Pooh drives a car directly over the incapacitated woman’s skull until the pressure makes her eyeball pop out.

<p>Scotland’s first minister has been a dominant political figure. But her resignation does not mean that independence is dead</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon" title="">Nicola Sturgeon’s</a> resignation is a massive political event. We shall return to that. But it is also something more, and this too is massive. Her resignation is a warning. The warning is best summed up in 10 plain words spoken by Scotland’s first minister in her surprise <a href="https://www.snp.org/nicola-sturgeon-to-the-people-of-scotland-thank-you-from-the-bottom-of-my-heart/" title="">announcement</a> in Edinburgh on Wednesday: “I am a human being as well as a politician.”</p><p>Politicians do not ask for pity, love or praise. Too often, however, they get only cynicism, abuse and even, in another word carefully chosen by Ms Sturgeon this week, brutality. This is particularly true of women politicians, who still have to cope with intolerable attentions and pressures that men are often spared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/16/the-guardian-view-on-nicola-sturgeon-a-warning-at-the-end-of-the-road">Continue reading...</a>

It wasn’t that the first minister’s departure was unexpected. Though the precise timing was a shock, she has been visibly flagging for months, and her popularity has been waning even among SNP diehards. “She’s lost the room,” one loyalist told me recently. When Jacinda Ardern – a politician Sturgeon greatly admires – stepped down as the prime minister of New Zealand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-resigns-as-prime-minister-of-new-zealand">with the words</a>: “We give all that we can for as long as we can. And then it’s time,” I imagined Sturgeon thinking: “That’s the way to do it.”</p><p>Nor am I blind to the chequered nature of the first minister’s legacy. It has been disappointing to watch a woman who came to power with such noble aspirations fail to deliver on a succession of pledges, such as closing the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-judge-me-education-record-1497298">educational attainment gap</a>, and become mired in a succession of controversies, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/04/nicola-sturgeon-rejects-cronyism-accusation-over-ferries-contract">the ferry fiasco</a> and the <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/23157103.probe-snps-missing-600-000-ongoing/">“missing” £600,000</a> of SNP funds.</p><p>Dani Garavelli is a freelance journalist and columnist for the Herald</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Psychologists call it ‘vicarious trauma’ – the result of witnessing too much misery, even if you’re not experiencing it first hand. And it can affect anyone, from war correspondents to legal professionals and interpreters</p><p>If I had been told that my dream career could end up affecting my mental health, I might have thought twice about pursuing it. Or perhaps I wouldn’t have. After all, trauma is not new in journalism – “if it bleeds, it leads” is the adage.</p><p>But while crime and war correspondents know the risks they run, I fell into covering harrowing stories accidentally. I spent more than a decade on and off in the BBC newsroom, mostly in the user-generated content (UGC) hub team, dealing directly with the audience – finding case studies and trends, and tackling disinformation early by verifying stories before they were broadcast. Sometimes it was the best job ever, when the stories we covered could change people’s lives. Other times, the job meant scouring through racist and xenophobic missives, and exposure to pornography and graphic images of human remains. I would weep and feel hopeless about the world we inhabit, as we found ourselves mapping the geographies of murder, deconstructing images of beheadings, or cross-referencing atrocities on social media videos and open-source intelligence from far-flung places.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/16/whats-it-like-when-your-job-involves-wading-through-others-suffering-i-was-left-weeping-and-hopeless">Continue reading...</a>

We get to see defiant social media posts about being newly single, sweet posts about new sparks and of course – people soft and hard launching new relationships.</p><p>Often Instagram related, “soft launching” a new relationship means that you post a picture that shows you’re with a new someone, but with no identifying features. It’s a photo of two wine glasses and someone else’s arm in the frame. It’s a blurry, dark photo taken in bed, as if you’ve started dating someone who is also in witness protection. A “hard launch” is explicit. It’s the couple kissing, or a full-face photo (tagged) and some love heart emojis. Or perhaps a water emoji.

<p>Star who shot to global fame in the 1960s in One Million Years BC and whose later roles showed her aptitude for comedy</p><p>Raquel Welch, who has died aged 82, had only three lines as Loana in the 1966 film fantasy One Million Years BC but attained sex-symbol status from the role, in which she was dressed in a fur-lined bikini. The image made its imprint in popular culture and the publicity poster sold millions. The feminist critic Camille Paglia described the American actor’s depiction as “a lioness – fierce, passionate and dangerously physical”.</p><p>The tale of cavepeople coexisting with dinosaurs was Welch’s breakthrough film – and the beginning of a largely unsuccessful battle she waged to be taken seriously as an actor. When she arrived on set, she told the director, Don Chaffey, she had been thinking about her scene. She recalled his response as: “Thinking? What do you mean you’ve been thinking? Just run from this rock to that rock – that’s all we need from you.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/16/raquel-welch-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Striker might have made a difference in Dortmund if eligible and must be on the bench on Saturday given team’s struggle for goals</p><p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is not part of Chelsea’s future.

Space had to be made to fit in three of Chelsea’s new signings, but leaving Aubameyang out was a big call. Other options were available. Carney Chukwuemeka probably would not have made a fuss if dropped. Christian Pulisic is a long-term absentee.

## Right Dishonourable Friend review – nepo baby MP lands in Lancashire in heartfelt comedy

<p><strong>The Vaults, London<br /></strong>Phoebe Batteson-Brown is archly comic as the clueless Perdita but it’s the subplot about a queer teenager and the hypocrisy of politics that has real depth to it</p><p>This surprisingly heartfelt political comedy is really a much deeper play in disguise. It’s about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/22/nepo-babies-what-are-they-and-why-is-gen-z-only-just-discovering-them">nepo baby</a> and Londoner Perdita – daughter of the former home secretary and the new MP for the fictional Lancashire town of Ardenton. Many broad and slightly predictable jokes about the north/south divide ensue. But there’s also real passion and purpose here, which reveals itself in a subplot about the worrying lack of shelter and support for the LGBTQ+ community in the north. Both strands have potential. But with the play in its current form, the heartfelt stuff undermines the comedy, the laughs undercutting the passion.<br /><br />It’s the comedy that wins through in the opening exchanges, particularly in the scenes between a clueless Perdita (an archly comic Phoebe Batteson-Brown) and her enjoyably eccentric constituents. There’s a touch of Victoria Wood about Rachael Hilton – a talented comedian who imbues a parade of quirky local characters with a wonderfully gruff sort of charm. The best of the bunch is “Big Chelle”, who is grimly determined to install a tanning bar in her strip club and has absolutely no time for Perdita’s fancy politics (“What’s that got to do with my titty bar?”).</p><p>It’s all fairly good fun and directed with vigour and a bit of a twinkle from Kayla Feldman. About halfway through the play, heavier plot developments land when queer teenager Alex (Hilton) comes to Perdita’s surgery looking for help and protection. The scenes between communications manager Dan (Eoin McKenna) and an anxious and frightened Alex have real tenderness and depth to them. They’re nuggets of earnestness in an otherwise fairly lighthearted affair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/16/right-dishonourable-friend-review-the-vaults-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The award-winning author’s story of a young Sami girl in Sweden explores prejudice and dark secrets</p><p>Based on real events, Ann-Helén Laestadius’s debut novel for adults highlights the discrimination <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/10/indigenous-sami-reindeer-herders-sweden-green-transition">Sweden’s ethnic minority Sami</a> have suffered over the years for their determination to pursue a traditional lifestyle as reindeer herders. In the course of her research, Laestadius, of mixed Sami heritage herself, consulted more than 100 police reports of killed and maimed reindeer, none of which resulted in prosecution.</p><p>Nine-year-old Elsa lives in a village just inside the Arctic Circle. Her family belongs to a collective founded on firm ties of kinship, Sami ancestry being recorded in prized archives. Life is structured around the cycles of animal husbandry, but the reindeer are far more than just a source of meat and pride. The title is pointed; when non-Sami hunters begin torturing and mutilating the precious animals, the local police force refuse to register the crimes as anything more than theft. They have more pressing matters to investigate, but for the Sami such attacks threaten their very existence.</p><p>Stolen by Ann-Helén Laestadius, translated by Rachel Willson-Broyles, is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

<p>Post-pandemic, companies that boomed by helping us stay at home are struggling to stay afloat. Their loss is my gain</p><p>There’s a pathetic but satisfying thing that occurs when you stop using an online service you’re used to frequenting. This was Facebook a few years ago, when plummeting engagement whipped the social media platform into a frenzy of desperate invitations and prompts. It’s Fresh Direct when you fill your basket with groceries and – I can’t recommend this enough, if you’re looking for the tiny high that comes from withholding – don’t check out, triggering a bunch of wheedling automated messages, begging you to come back.</p><p>This week, in my life, it’s Uber Eats. For the past couple of years I’ve ordered from them once a week and now I’ve stopped, causing the food delivery service to issue a flurry of semi-hysterical special offers.

<p>Pre-loved homeware is fun to find, kinder for the environment – and can save you a small fortune. From carrying a measuring tape to discovering websites way beyond eBay, here is everything you need to know</p><p>There are few downsides to secondhand furniture and homeware, especially in a cost of living crisis. They keep things in use and out of landfill, while reducing the need for cheap and trend-led fast furniture, which doesn’t tend to last as long, devours precious resources and is often hard to recycle. In the UK, we discard 22m furniture items a year, according to a 2019 <a href="https://www.nlwa.gov.uk/news/22-million-damaged-furniture-items-and-11000-bust-bicycles-thrown-away-each-year">report</a> by the North London Waste Authority, while demand for new furniture has risen. The home improvements rush at the start of the pandemic in 2020 saw the household goods market <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/may2020#:~:text=In%20the%20three%20months%20to,and%20the%20production%20of%20statistics.">leap by 42%</a>.</p><p>Well-chosen secondhand stuff looks better, too. “Adding vintage pieces can bring depth, history and a unique touch to any interior that cannot be replicated with mass-produced items,” says Siobhan Murphy, an <a href="https://www.interiorcurve.co.uk/">interior designer</a> who is a fan of maximalism. “They can also provide a contrast to modern elements, creating an eclectic and layered look.” As well as supporting small businesses, the local economy and charity shops, buying used furnishings can save you money, and even make you a profit when you sell them on. “These items have been around for decades, and with a bit of love and polish, they can go on for another 100 years,” says Estelle Bilson, <a href="https://70shousemanchester.com/">a 70s enthusiast</a>, vintage dealer, TV presenter and author of the forthcoming book 70s House: A bold homage to the most daring decade in design. As an added bonus, no self-assembly is required – not that there isn’t a place for Ikea, of which Bilson is a fan. “Vintage Ikea is very sought-after and ‘spendy’ right now, so it’s come full circle,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/16/the-secondhand-home-15-ways-to-find-the-vintage-furniture-of-your-dreams">Continue reading...</a>

## The Twelve review – even Sam Neill can’t save this legal melodrama

<p>The Jurassic Park star delivers a seasoned performance in this Australian show following a murder jury. Shame it’s full of soapy subplots and histrionic plotting</p><p>Television is rarely short of a good legal drama, but The Twelve (ITVX) starts with an intriguing premise that promises to set it apart from the rest. An Australian adaptation of the Belgian series De Twaalf, it poses this question: what if the focus wasn’t the crime or the suspect, or even the lawyers battling it out in court, but the jurors? These men and women, complete with a full-spectrum variety of human flaws, must make one of the biggest decisions of their lives. While it should be based on the evidence set in front of them, The Twelve suggests that the jurors’ messy emotions, relationships and troubles have a considerable impact on the verdict.</p><p>Naturally, the case over which this jury has to deliberate is a juicy, complicated, all-consuming one that will last for weeks. An artist called Kate Lawson (Kate Mulvany) is accused of having murdered Claire Spears, her 14-year-old niece. The case has become a salacious media scandal, and the trial controversial, because there is no body. Even Claire’s parents disagree over whether or not Kate should be in the dock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/16/the-twelve-review-sam-neill-itv-legal-melodrama">Continue reading...</a>

## The Big Con by Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington review – how consultancy firms cash in

<p>From Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy to Britain’s Covid contracts, the private firms taking over public life</p><p>When Puerto Rico started bankruptcy proceedings in 2016, the US island territory became McKinsey’s newest client. The company was hired to advise a federally appointed oversight board and, according to a report in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/mckinsey-in-puerto-rico.html">New York magazine</a>, set about creating an “aspirational vision” for Puerto Rico, appointing a 31-year-old Harvard graduate as the project’s senior full-time consultant. A 2016 Columbia graduate assisted with financial calculations and job cuts (euphemistically termed “rightsizing measures”), and a recent Yale graduate handled hurricane damage assessment. Ultimately, McKinsey advised on a “schema” for the island’s ailing economy that included privatising public enterprises and removing labour protections.</p><p>The firm’s work in Puerto Rico is one of many stories in Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington’s new book, a brisk and approachable guide to the consulting industry and its discontents. Management consultants are frequently used by corporate executives or governments to provide a veneer of authority – and a convenient scapegoat – for controversial “reforms”. Their role in public life has increased: as one Conservative minister put it in 2020, Whitehall has been “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/29/whitehall-infantilised-by-reliance-on-consultants-minister-claims">infantilised</a>” by its reliance on management consultants. Mazzucato and Collington’s argument is an elaboration of this point. They claim that consultancies have weakened businesses and hollowed out state capacity. “The more governments and businesses outsource,” they write, “the less they know how to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/16/the-big-con-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-rosie-collington-review-how-consultancy-firms-cash-in">Continue reading...</a>

## When asylum seekers are attacked, don’t be surprised: the system ensures that will happen | Daniel Trilling

<p>The violence in Knowsley is symptomatic of a dysfunctional approach that makes vulnerable refugees even more vulnerable</p><p>Friends of Firsat Dag, a 25-year-old Kurdish asylum seeker, said he came to the UK to escape violence. Instead, he was stabbed to death in a park on his way home from a night out. It wasn’t an isolated incident. In the weeks surrounding his murder, gangs followed refugee children to and from school – one five-year-old boy was attacked with a baseball bat, according to an anti-racist campaign group – while hundreds of local residents held angry protests at the housing of asylum seekers in their deprived neighbourhood.</p><p>This is exactly the kind of violent escalation that many must fear happening after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/10/far-right-demonstrators-clash-with-police-at-liverpool-hotel-housing-asylum-seekers">riot in Knowsley</a> last Friday. In fact, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/15/immigration.race">Dag’s murder</a> took place more than 20 years ago, in Glasgow in the summer of 2001. Then, as now, inflammatory political rhetoric played a part: in the early 2000s, Britain was in the grips of a tabloid-driven moral panic over asylum. Far-right groups were also trying to whip up anti-refugee sentiment, holding demonstrations in other parts of the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/16/asylum-seekers-attacked-uk-violence-knowsley-refugees">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My boyfriend was not keen to rent a scooter on the Amalfi coast, but I insisted it would be romantic, sexy and a little bit dangerous. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>It was August 2010, the Amalfi coast. My then-boyfriend and I had decided to go on holiday to Sorrento in the south of Italy, and predictably it was 40C, which (even more predictably) did not agree with his complexion. I remained adamant that this was an extremely agreeable temperature, and a pleasant change from the English weather, by which (being half Italian) I am perpetually offended.</p><p>I was even more bullish about the idea that it would be romantic – sexy, and a little bit dangerous – to rent a Vespa and whiz down the coast to Positano and Amalfi, where we would eat pistachio gelatos and drink minuscule coffees in architecturally striking piazzas. “Absolutely not,” said my boyfriend, explaining that he had never ridden a scooter. “We are 100% renting a car,” he insisted. I refused to budge. Like Jennifer Coolidge’s Tanya in The White Lotus, I was set on the Vespa trip, and no amount of pleading about “the world’s deadliest roads” was about to change that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/16/my-most-romantic-moment-a-vespa-breakdown-on-one-of-the-worlds-deadliest-roads">Continue reading...</a>

## No coach, no agent, no ego: the incredible story of the ‘Lionel Messi of cliff diving’

<p>Gary Hunt is an enigma. He trains with the intensity of a modern athlete, but relaxes like a sportsman of a bygone era. He is fiercely competitive but unbelievably laid-back. How did he become the greatest cliff diver of all time?<br /></p><p>In early May 2009, 12 men arrived in La Rochelle on the west coast of France, carrying a few pairs of Speedos in their luggage. They had not come to swim but, as they liked to put it, to “fly”. Their sport, which involves diving from cliffs, buildings or bridges, always comes with an atmosphere of nervous excitement, but this time the stakes were higher than ever before. Cliff diving had long been at the obscure end of extreme sports, a pursuit for thrill-seekers with day jobs. Now, the energy drink company Red Bull was launching what it called a “cliff diving world series”, with eight events scheduled across the summer that would attract hundreds of thousands of spectators. Here was a chance at fame and, if not fortune, for the very best of the divers, a modest living.</p><p>In traditional pool diving, the highest event is the 10-metre platform, and even Olympic divers can find the height unsettling. In La Rochelle, the organisers had affixed a short platform to the ramparts of the medieval Saint Nicolas Tower, 26 metres above the frigid sea – as high as an eight-storey building. In their three seconds of flight, the divers would reach speeds of more than 50mph. At that speed, a head-first entry is too dangerous. They would need to break the water with their feet, trying to make as little splash as possible. In each of their three competitive jumps, the divers could take off facing forwards, backwards or, most terrifyingly, from a handstand position. As they fell, they would do as many twists and somersaults as they dared in order to impress the judges before hitting the sea. Make a mistake and it was like you’d “run full speed into a wall”, as the Colombian Orlando Duque, the favourite to win the new series, explained at the time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/16/no-coach-no-agent-no-ego-lionel-messi-of-cliff-diving-gary-hunt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer and filmmaker talks about parenting with Daniel Day-Lewis, directing Peter Dinklage and Anne Hathaway in her surreal new romcom, and gathering material in a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting</p><p>What do you do with a storyline requiring two US states with different marriage laws, reachable in a single journey without resort to roads? The obvious answer, for a writer as versatile as <a href="https://rebecca-miller.com/">Rebecca Miller</a>, would be to work it into a novel or short story. But no, it was a film she wanted to make. “I realised that I needed two states on a river where they had different laws. It was like a crazy puzzle that I was trying to figure out,” she says. Her solution was a tugboat which could chug between New York and Delaware. This led to a riot of further possibilities: what if one of the characters was an eccentric female tugboat captain suffering from erotomania, who fixates on a creatively blocked opera composer with a therapist wife who would really rather be a nun?</p><p>The result, She Came to Me, which premieres in Berlin on 16 February, is one of the wackiest romcoms ever to lay claim on the genre: an intergenerational story of love overcoming every obstacle that modern domestic life can throw in its path. “When I read it I thought it was a creatively risky, golden-hearted script full of incredibly drawn, nuanced characters – a somewhat rare find. I felt very clearly how much I wanted the film to exist,” says Anne Hathaway, who plays the cleanfreak therapist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/16/rebecca-miller-theres-an-abyss-between-you-and-your-kids-theyre-speaking-a-different-language">Continue reading...</a>
