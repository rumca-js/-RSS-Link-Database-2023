<p id="Egp6Hs">The new emoji come from <a href="https://emojipedia.org/emoji-15.0/">Unicode version 15.0</a>, introduced in September. Some notable icons include a shaking face emoji, a pushing hand that could totally be used as an “imma stop you right there,” and a Khanda emblem representing Sikhism.</p>
<p id="aw8Jxk">International keyboards are getting updates, too, including autocorrect being enabled by default for the Korean keyboard and predictive text support for Ukrainian.</p>

  <p id="QC2ool">Earlier on Thursday, comments from Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot had indicated E3 2023 may not take place after all, but the president of ReedPop, the company organizing the event this year, assures <em>The Verge</em> that planning is still moving forward.</p>
<p id="caOELm">According <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-says-it-will-attend-e3-2023-if-it-happens/">to <em>VGC</em></a>, during Thursday’s Ubisoft earnings call, Guillemot had said that “if E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a lot of things to show.” That, to me, was somewhat surprising to read: the show was confirmed to return in person in Los Angeles in 2023 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23197645/e3-2023-pax-organizers-in-person-la-convention-center">last year</a>, but after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023"><em>IGN’s</em> recent report</a> that Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/30/23578780/e3-2023-microsoft-xbox-sony-playstation-nintendo-attend">are all skipping the event</a>, it didn’t feel outside the realm of possibility that the show may not go on after all.</p>

  <p id="IolBzo">Apple’s new iOS and iPadOS 16.4 betas will let Safari web apps on your homescreen send you push notifications, according to <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/">a new post on the WebKit blog</a>. </p>
<p id="Y8Bm4m">As far back as the first iPhone, you’ve been able to add a shortcut to websites to your homescreen represented as app-like icons, but the web apps haven’t been able to send you notifications or show notification badges. With iOS and iPadOS 16.4, however, that will change.</p>
<p id="bkTqrE">Here’s how the push notifications will work, according to the blog post by Brady Eidson and Jen Simmons — though it sounds a lot like how they work with native apps already:</p>

However, the monthly membership will remain at $30 with a 12-month commitment.</p>

  <p id="6IpiuT">The <em>Tetris</em> movie that’s been in the works for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/30/6872435/tetris-the-movie-is-really-real-from-mortal-kombat-film-studio">almost a decade</a> is actually happening, and Apple has finally unveiled an official trailer ahead of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23582236/apples-movie-about-tetris-is-set-to-debut-at-sxsw-in-march">SXSW premiere</a>. This upcoming Apple Original Films “blockbuster” (sorry) is based on a true story, starring Taron Egerton as Henk Rogers, a Dutch entrepreneur who becomes so enamored with the titular game that he travels to the Soviet Union during the end of the Cold War in order secure its distribution rights.</p>
<p id="GoYQhV">There, he encounters the game’s inventor, Alexey Pajitnov (portrayed by <em>A Good Man</em>’s Nikita Efremov), and villainous KGB agents, all while navigating the increasing tensions between the Soviet government and the West. It’s certainly a different approach from previous films we’ve seen...</p>

<p id="eCnm35">To entice players, TikTok is offering a $500,000 cash prize pool that’s split between winners. Users must be 18 years old and in the US to participate in the multiple-choice trivia rounds, which will be livestreamed on the official <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok">@TikTok account</a>.

  <p id="cWJQGL">A while back, there was a little debate over whether to say “please” and “thank you” to smart speakers. Amazon Alexa added a mode that rewarded children who were polite to their devices, attempting to avoid, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43897516">as the BBC put it</a>, a generation of children who “grew up accustomed to barking orders” at machines. This whole phenomenon bothered me — I felt like it needlessly blurred the lines between real people who you can actually hurt with rudeness and machines that are incapable of caring. At the time, though, I felt like kind of a jerk about it.

But it doesn’t stop there: Samsung provides even more camera settings for those who want maximum control — if you know where to look. </p>
<p id="GTazQi">Samsung offers an app called Camera Assistant for recent Galaxy phones that goes <em>deep</em> into camera settings. You can disable automatic switching between lenses in low light and adjust whether the phone takes a picture as soon as you put your finger on the shutter or when you take it off.

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XPAM2M">About a year ago, <em>Fortnite</em> introduced a new way to play, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001300/fortnite-zero-build-mode">a mode that eschewed its building gameplay</a> for something more like a regular shooter. Now that style of building has appeared in the most unlikely of places: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/10/23393221/wild-hearts-hunting-ea-games-omega-force-interview"><em>Wild Hearts</em></a>, a new take on the hunting genre that <em>Monster Hunter</em> has firmly established.</p>
<p id="mBCKWZ"><em>Wild Hearts</em> — which is developed by <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> studio Omega Force and published by EA — is, at its core, a riff on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a>. Like that game, it takes place in a vast wilderness that’s not an open world, per se, but rather a series of connected spaces. In this case, they’re large islands, each with its own ecosystem and, naturally, different creatures to hunt and battle. There’s also a sprawling human city where you...</p>

  <p id="2DJgIa">The price of Paramount Plus is about to go up. In an earnings call on Thursday, Paramount chief financial officer Naveen Chopra announced that the price of Paramount Plus’ essential plan would increase from $4.99 to $5.99 per month, while the premium plan will go from $9.99 to $11.99 per month. </p>

  <p id="7FTlWY">Route planning can be easy if it’s in your neighborhood but a pain when you’re planning for a weekend hike or a run when traveling overseas. But if you’re a Strava user, the fitness platform is rolling out a new route-planning feature that might help.

  <p id="wWuizN">Sony’s new PlayStation VR2 headset is designed to work exclusively with a PS5, but will it ever work on PCs? That’s a big question that I can’t answer just yet, and one that even Sony is dodging right now. While the original PSVR got unofficial support for PC, the PSVR2 could be just as complicated to get working with SteamVR without help from Sony.</p>
<p id="V0ICsO">“The PSVR2 is created for use with the PS5 console,” says Sony PR representative Beca Truong in a statement to <em>The Verge. </em>We asked whether Sony would ever officially support the PSVR2 on PC, but the company failed to answer.</p>
