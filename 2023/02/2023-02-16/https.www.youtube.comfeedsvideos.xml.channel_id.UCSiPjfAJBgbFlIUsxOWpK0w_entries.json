Sara and Moira absolutely crushed it with this arrangement and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen Ben Rose have this much fun in the drum booth (which is definitely not a vocal booth that we just stuffed the drum set into whaaaa?). There are so many amazing little moments woven into the song and the video, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to pick a favorite one!\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Th94Ql \nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA mashup of Miley Cyrus' \"Flowers\" & Bruno Mars' \"When I Was Your Man\" by Magaziine, Sara Niemietz & Moira Mack.\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nVocals/Arrangement: Sara Niemietz & Moira Mack\nSynth: Jack Conte, Swatkins\nGuitar: Brian Green\nBass: Nick Campbell\nDrums: Ben Rose\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer: Tim Sonnefeld\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\nProducer: Ben Rose\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nDirector: Dom Fera\nDP: Austin Hughes\nCamera Operators: James Hull, Ryan Blewett\nBackline Tech: Alex Minney \nVideo Editor/Colorist: Athena Wheaton\n\nRecorded at The Village Studios in Los Angeles.\n\n#mileycyrus #brunomars #mashup #saraniemietz #moiramack #magaziine #synthpop \n\nLYRICS\nI didn't wanna leave you\nI didn't wanna lie\nStarted to cry but then remembered I\n\nI should have bought you flowers\nI can buy myself flowers\nAnd held your hand\nWrite my name in the sand\nGiven you all of my hours\nTalk to myself for hours\nWhen I had the chance\nSay things you don't understand\nTake you to every party\nI can take myself dancing\nAll you wanted to do was dance\nAnd I can hold my own hand\n\nOh I can love me better\nNow she don't need a man\n\nCan love me better\nI can love me better, baby\nCan love me better\nI can love me better, baby\n\nSame bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now\nOur song on the radio but it don't sound the same\nWhen our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down\n'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name\n\nIt all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)\nI didn't wanna leave you\nI didn't wanna lie\nStarted to cry but then remembered I\n\nI should have bought you flowers\nI can buy myself flowers\nAnd held your hand\nWrite my name in the sand\nGiven you all of my hours\nTalk to myself for hours\nWhen I had the chance\nSay things you don't understand\nTake you to every party\nI can take myself dancing\nAll you wanted to do was dance\nAnd I can hold my own hand\n\nOh I can love me better\nNow she don't need a man\n\nCan love me better\nI can love me better, baby\nCan love me better\nI can love me better, baby\nCan love me better\nI can love me better, baby\nCan love me better\nI can love me better, baby\n\nI should have bought you flowers\nI can buy myself flowers\nAnd held your hand\nWrite my name in the sand\nGiven you all of my hours\nTalk to myself for hours\nWhen I had the chance\nSay things you don't understand\nTake you to every party\nI can take myself dancing\nAll you wanted to do was dance\nAnd I can hold my own hand\n\nOh I can love me better than you can", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FESkz64l7VM", "date_published": "2023-02-16 16:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
