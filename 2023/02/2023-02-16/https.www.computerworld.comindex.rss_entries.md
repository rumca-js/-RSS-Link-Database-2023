<p>Generative AI like <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3682143/chatgpt-finally-an-ai-chatbot-worth-talking-to.html">ChatGPT is currently all the rage</a>, and it’s amazing how good this platform already is, given its infancy. The speed at which it is spreading is unprecedented, and far exceeds the speed of past tech advances. I expect it to supplement (and maybe replace) the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that largely replaced the Command Line interface, which replaced computer cards for data entry and programing. </p><p>Researchers have already advanced the date of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Singularity</a> from the 2040s or 2050s to around 2030. And even that date may also be too conservative, given that generative AI appears to be going vertical in both demand and adoption. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688356/to-get-the-most-from-generative-ai-somethings-got-to-change.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>It's funny how much a popular narrative can differ from reality once you start bringing cold, hard data into the equation.</p><p>Over the past couple years, Samsung has worked hard to improve its reputation as a reliable provider of software updates in the Android arena. And to be sure, it's made some meaningful strides along the way.</p><p>But when you go beyond the broad impressions and objectively <em>measure</em> the company's commitment to timely Android operating system rollouts — well, the story gets a teensy bit more complicated.</p><p>That's precisely why I started doing these Android Upgrade Report Cards way back in the platform's prehistoric ages. From the get-go, we've seen some wild variance in how well different device-makers support their products after you've finished paying for 'em — and as an average phone-owner, there's no great way to know what's gonna happens six months or a year after you shell out your dollars for a top-of-the-line phone.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3687640/android-13-upgrade-report-card.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
