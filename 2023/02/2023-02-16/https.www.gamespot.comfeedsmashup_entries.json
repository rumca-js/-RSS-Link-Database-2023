The entire collection is available to order now from SteelSeries, Bungie, and KontrolFreek. Each product comes with a code for the Destiny 2 Viral Celebration emote and/or Luminescent Precision emblem.</p><p>We wouldn't be surprised to see the Destiny 2: Lightfall collection sell out quickly, so if you're interested in any of the items, we'd recommend buying them soon.</p><p><strong>Shop Destiny 2: Lightfall collection at: </strong><a href=\"https://steelseries.com/destiny-2-lightfall-collection\">SteelSeries</a> | <a href=\"https://bungiestore.com/merchandise/steel-series\">Bungie Store</a> | <a href=\"https://www.kontrolfreek.com/pages/destiny-2-lightfall\">KontrolFreek</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arctis 7+ Wireless Headset</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4100507-arctis_7__destiny2_lightfall_pdp_img_buy_01.png__1850x800_crop-scale_optimize_subsampling-2%281%29.png\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$180</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Destiny 2-themed Arctis 7+ has an eye-catching galactic color scheme with the game's emblem printed in the center of the earcups. In addition to offering a standout look, the Arctis 7+ is top-notch in the performance and comfort departments. It has universal compatibility and connects wirelessly via a USB-C dongle to PC, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and mobile phones with USB-C. Xbox owners have to use a wired connection with the included (detachable) 3.5mm cable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Out of the box, the Arctis 7+ provides stellar sound, but PC users can take full control of their audio experience with SteelSeries' Sonar Audio Software Suite. You'll be able to take advantage of a new custom preset created by Destiny 2 sound designers. The headset comes with a voucher for the emblem and emote.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-7-plus-destiny-2-lightfall-edition\">See at SteelSeries</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aerox 5 Wireless Mouse</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4100509-aerox5mouse.png\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$150</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Lightfall edition of the Aerox 5 wireless gaming mouse features the same color scheme as the headset, so the two would pair nicely together.

Along with being lightweight, the Aerox 5 offers up to 180 hours of battery life. If the mouse happens to die while playing, you can charge it for just 15 minutes to get 40 hours of juice.

The QCK Prism XL Destiny 2: Lightfall Edition is an oversized mouse pad (35.4 x 11.8 x .15 inches) that has enough room for your keyboard, mouse, a headset, and more. It has a gorgeous look, with the Destiny 2 logo prominently featured in the center and the swirling hues of space around it. The Prism is built with micro-woven cloth and has two-tone RGB backlighting along the perimeter.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-prism-xl-destiny-2-lightfall-edition\">See at SteelSeries</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>KontrolFreek Performance Thumbsticks</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4100513-performancethumbsticks.png\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$20-$30</strong></p><p>The collection is rounded out by new performance thumbsticks from KontrolFreek. These caps easily pop atop the analog sticks of an Xbox or PlayStation (PS5 or PS4) controller. The corrugated, textured feel is designed to promote better grip and improved accuracy. Each set comes with a mid-rise left stick and a high-rise right stick.</p><p>The precision thumbsticks costs $20 per pair, but big Destiny fans may want to splurge for the $30 collector's version that comes with a Traveler case. The thumbsticks only come with a voucher for the emblem, so you'll need to pick up one of the other accessories to get the emote.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-accessories/destiny-2-lightfall-performance-thumbsticks-strand-edition?console-compatibility=xbox\">See at SteelSeries</a> </div></div><p> </p><div><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-accessories/destiny-2-lightfall-performance-thumbsticks-collectors-edition?console-compatibility=playstation\">See at SteelSeries (Collector&#039;s)</a> </div></div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/steelseries-reveals-stylish-destiny-2-lightfall-gaming-accessories/2900-4648/", "date_published": "2023-02-16 16:53:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Get 5 Beloved Bethesda Games For Only $15", "description": "<p>Bethesda has published some of the best modern RPGs and shooters, and right now you can get PC versions of a bunch of the studio's hits for cheap.

Despite only being in Early Access for now, Dreamlight Valley has maintained a pretty consistent update cycle, with each new drop bringing quality-of-life improvements, additional materials and recipes, more beloved characters, and a fresh Star Path (see: Battle Pass) filled with themed cosmetics and more.</p><p>It's those limited-time Star Paths that keep many players busiest, though, asking them to complete tasks around the valley to earn special redeemable tokens. These tokens can then be used to unlock unique cosmetics from within the Star Path's reward track. And though you can unlock some of the rewards in the free version of a Star Path, you'll need to purchase the premium version for 2,500 moonstones to be able to unlock everything. Keep in mind, however, that you're able to earn a significant portion of this investment back if you fully complete the reward track.</p><p>Most of the previous Star Paths have focused heavily on just a few specific properties (<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/disney-dream-light-valley-all-pixar-fest-star-path-rewards/2900-4307/\">Pixar Star Path</a>) or highly-specific themes (<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/disney-dreamlight-valley-all-festive-star-path-rewards/2900-4494/\">Festive Star Path</a>), but Gameloft is going bigger on heartwarming nostalgia than ever with its newest offering. The brand-new Centennial Path celebrates an entire century of magic and wonders for fans to embrace. It's a pretty big moment in Disney history, so you may want to dive headfirst into this one.</p><p>If you're a Disney enthusiast, you'll no doubt find tons to love about the new stuff you can unlock in the Centennial Star Path. Of course, you'll have to put some work in to get it all, but that's half of the fun! If you'd like to see what you can unlock before devoting yourself to the experience, we've got you covered in this gallery. Take look below to see every reward you're able to earn in the current Star Path.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img

worlds of Destiny 2, as Bungie is aiming for the next chapter in the ongoing war between the Light and the Darkness to evolve sandbox in meaningful ways. While previous Destiny 2 expansions had a predictable cadence of content with each release, Lightfall marks a new chapter in the Destiny 2 experience--one that intends to fine-tune what works, remove elements that feel dated, and adopt a more experimental approach, with each new slice of content delivered through the seasonal model.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This penultimate chapter in the long-running saga that began in 2014 has plenty of traditional content to offer, but beneath the new subclass powers, worlds to explore, and new activities to take part in, the core experience is getting an overhaul that's redefining Destiny 2 for the road ahead. Leading up to The Final Shape, Bungie's goals are to make Destiny 2 more challenging, rewarding, and imaginative, and Lightfall is the first step in a long journey towards those goals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After sitting down with Bungie for a Lightfall preview and an early look at the studio's latest vidoc charting the year ahead, we\u2019ve got a closer look at some of the big changes coming to Destiny 2 once the new expansion launches.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Season of Defiance, Season of the Deep, and Season 22 will shake up the seasonal grind</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099679-lightfall_standard_key_art_16-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Like previous expansions, Lightfall's story will continue through multiple seasons until the launch of The Final Shape. However, Season of Defiance will also see \"substantial iterations\" to the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-lightfall-launches-destiny-2-is-shaking-up-its-seasonal-model/1100-6511458/\">game's seasonal model</a>, according to game director Joe Blackburn.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Progression systems are being designed to be less complex, meaning fewer currencies to earn, the retirement of Umbral energies, and better base rewards for seasonal activities. On top of these changes, players can expect fewer vendor upgrades and a simplified approach to progression systems and currencies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once Season of Defiance ends, players can look forward to Season of the Deep and Season 22, which will not feature a vendor upgrade paradigm according to Blackburn. However, this doesn't mean that vendors are being done away with entirely, Blackburn stated. Instead Bungie is looking to create more varied and experimental frameworks that slowly build an array of systems for players to show their investment into seasonal content.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lightfall is a war story that you've stepped into</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099680-lightfall_gameplay_large_4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>In Season of Defiance, the theme is war. As Calus readies an invasion for humanity's last remaining stronghold, players will find themselves pulled into the high-stakes struggle against his Shadow Legion of Cabal troops. \"Lightfall should feel like you have stepped into the middle of an active war,\" Bungie said, as the studio is aiming to make players feel like the tip of a spear pointed in the direction of the Witness and their armies. Don't expect to be on the defensive, as players will fight back alongside their allies from across the cosmos. The odds might be stacked against humanity, but our species plans to go down swinging as the universe runs out of time.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Witness is here to finish what the Collapse started</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099681-lightfall_cinematics_2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Bungie has been teasing the arrival of The Witness for years now, offering glimpses of a central villain in the Light and Darkness saga who is on a collision course with The Traveler. The Witch Queen's campaign was the first time that we got to see this enigmatic antagonist, and come Lightfall, The Witness will finally catch up with The Traveler and finish what the Collapse started. Bungie describes The Witness as a \"drastically different\" villain when compared to Destiny's other big bads--a reserved but powerful force of nature who is the greatest test that humanity will ever face.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Strand is unlike any other subclass we've experienced so far</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099682-lightfall_gameplay_large_1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-strand-before-lightfall-launches/1100-6511205/\">Strand is a Darkness power</a> that is built to subvert expectations. Bungie knew that it wanted to bring another Darkness subclass to Destiny 2, and with everyone anticipating some form of poison powerset, the studio decided to instead surprise its community with abilities that tap into the cosmic web of life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What makes Strand unique is that it didn't come from The Traveler or the Pyramid ships, but is instead a power that Guardians unlock within themselves. Its core theme is focused on pulling on the threads of life and manipulating them, allowing for exciting power fantasies that'll tie into the new buildcrafting features being introduced in Lightfall.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Tormentors are a new enemy type that'll wreck you</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099683-lightfall_tormentor_compressed_1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Destiny 2 has no shortage of dangerous enemies to tangle with, from cunning Fallen to lethal Hive lightbearers, but Tormentors are a new breed of terror that you'll have to watch out for in Lightfall. These hulking brutes move fast and hit hard with Void energy powers, but they're also able to close gaps by pulling you into their range, suspending you in midair, and draining the life from your body.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"We want the Tormentors to be the most scary unit that you've ever fought in the Destiny universe,\" Bungie said, adding that the studio created unique animations and sounds for Tormentors that drive home just how powerful they really are. You'll want to stay alert whenever you spot a Tormentor in a Shadow Legion platoon, as this new enemy can easily disrupt your momentum.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Destiny 2 will continue beyond The Final Shape</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099684-lightfall_gameplay_large_11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">At its current trajectory, The Final Shape expansion will kickstart Destiny 2's tenth year of sci-fi action and activity. The final chapter in the Light and Darkness saga, The Final Shape will conclude a storyline that began on a deserted stretch of road outside of an abandoned Earth space facility, but it won't be the end of Destiny. \"This universe is about more than the conflict between The Traveler [and The Witness],\" Bungie says. \"We want to show you new things to discover in the universe.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Lightfall is seen as the \"catalyst\" for the future of Destiny, as it'll push the game to places that it has never been before. Bungie is of course keeping quiet on what other dangers lurk outside of the Solar system, but the studio is gearing up to keep the Destiny universe alive well after the current saga has concluded.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Loadouts will offer deeper and more flexible customization options</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099685-lightfall_gameplay_large_5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">For years, Destiny 2 players have had to rely on third-party apps such as the Destiny Inventory Manager if they wanted to quickly switch up their loadouts. Once Lightfall begins, Destiny 2 will have an internal loadout manager that Bungie has designed to be quick, intuitive, and built around the idea of having activity-specific builds for players to swap between. If you have enough space in your character inventory, you'll be able to pull items directly from your vault to use in your loadouts, and this system will also allow for armor mods to be factored into specific loadouts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Visually, loadouts are inspired by Destiny 2's transmog system, so if you've ever spent time working on your Guardian fashion game, then you'll feel right at home when you start working on your Nightfall, raid, and PvP builds.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Guardian Ranks will push you to explore all of Destiny</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4099686-lightfall_gameplay_compressed_3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Lightfall represents a concerted effort by Bungie to simplify its various systems to a point where the game can be inviting to newcomers, but it's also focusing on new ideas that will push rookie guardians and veterans alike to explore everything that Destiny 2 has to offer. Guardian Ranks is essentially that middle-ground between content that motivates players to experiment with what Destiny 2 has to offer and the path that shows just how far seasoned players have come since they started their journey in Destiny.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There'll be 11 of these Guardian Ranks to earn, and climbing the ranks will involve completing challenges and tasks across Destiny's multiple activities. This system also ties into the new loadout slots that'll be available to players, as the seasonal artifact will function much differently from Lightfall onwards. The higher your Guardian Rank, the better your perks, and reaching the highest ranks will require experienced players to give their Kinderguardian brethren a helping hand in various activities.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once Lightfall launches, experienced players will be given a Guardian Rank corresponding to their progress, reflecting their status and experience within the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The next chapter in Destiny 2\u2019s story begins on February 28, and will continue throughout the year until 2024\u2019s release of The Final Shape.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-lightfall-season-of-defiance-and-beyond/2900-4645/", "date_published": "2023-02-16 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "We Saw a Destiny 2 Lightfall Live Demo.

It's highly likely that you\u2019ll try a few different things to get rid of them, but it doesn\u2019t matter how much you slash, bonk, or shoot at them; they\u2019re not going anywhere.</p><p>It\u2019s rare to come across an obstacle you can\u2019t just force your way through in Wild Hearts, but the game does like to make sure you actually utilize the wide range of absurd karakuri you can conjure. That\u2019s what you need to do here, but you need a specific karakuri to get the job done.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to get rid of Wild Hearts vines</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">To destroy Wild Hearts vines, you\u2019re going to need to use fire. Unless you\u2019re modding to add Molotov cocktails to your arsenal, you\u2019ll need to get your hands on the torch karakuri in order to gain this ability. The torch is a simple device that you place on the ground, and then upon approaching it your character will attack through the flames to imbue their weapon with flames.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-hearts-how-to-get-rid-of-vines/1100-6511506/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-hearts-how-to-get-rid-of-vines/1100-6511506/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-16 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Wild Hearts Review - Build Me Up", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You only need to glance at Wild Hearts for a moment to see the similarities it shares with Capcom's Monster Hunter series. Both games are about exploring large, open areas--either alone or with other players--to find and defeat giant monsters, then harvesting and using their parts to craft better weapons and armor. Developer Omega Force has explored the genre before with the Toukiden series, and those two games represent perhaps the best examples of the monster-hunting genre outside of Capcom's own influential best-sellers. With Wild Hearts, Omega Force hasn't just set out to create a simple imitation, though. Sure, it has plenty of familiar elements, but the novel Karakuri system gives the game a unique identity that sets it apart from its contemporaries.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the fiction of Wild Hearts, Karakuri is an ancient technology used by hunters to conjure impressive pieces of technology out of thin air. In action, it's a fast-paced crafting system that serves multiple functions, opening up your available options both in and out of combat. You start with what are known as Basic Karakuri, the first of which lets you produce a wooden crate that launches you into the air when you climb on top of it. You can stack up to three of these crates at once to generate extra height, which proves useful when exploring the environment but really comes into its own when fighting Wild Hearts' various monsters, known as Kemono. You can launch from these crates and transition into a devastating downward strike, or utilize the added elevation to quickly avoid an area-of-effect attack that spews out a pool of lava or poisonous clouds. Most Karakuri serve a dual purpose such as this, whether it's a springboard that proves useful in dodging attacks and propelling you toward Kemono, or a glider that allows you to traverse large gaps and position yourself above monsters for an aerial barrage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Erecting these Karakuri is quick and simple, so it doesn't take long before you're integrating the various devices into each combat encounter. Constructing a crate, springboard, or torch in the heat of battle eventually becomes second nature, and being able to do so is just as essential to each battle as knowing how to use your specific weapon of choice. Later on, you also unlock various Fusion Karakuri, which use different combinations of Basic Karakuri to create larger, more elaborate contraptions. Stacking nine crates together in three rows, for instance, produces a rock-solid wall that can block incoming projectiles or halt a charging Kemono in its tracks, launching the beast into the air before leaving it in a vulnerable heap on the ground. You can also summon gigantic bouncing hammers, powerful bombs, and blinding firework cannons that can knock flying enemies out of the sky.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-16 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Wild Hearts Tips And Tricks: Hunt Monsters With A Head Start", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019ve got some <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-hearts/\">Wild Hearts</a> tips and tricks right here for you to make sure you can come away from more kemono fights a little less in pieces.

There are eight different weapons in the game, each with its own style, and you\u2019ll want to try them all out to get the full experience. You can never be sure which weapon you\u2019ll land on, even if you\u2019re a Monster Hunter veteran who\u2019s set in their ways. The only trouble is that you actually need to put a bit of work into the game to be able to use every weapon class. To make sure you don\u2019t waste any time getting your hands on them all, we\u2019ve gone ahead and put together a little guide on how to unlock Wild Hearts weapons, and even written a little bit about what each one does.</p><p><em><strong>This guide contains some story spoilers.</strong></em></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to unlock Wild Hearts weapons</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Wild Hearts weapons are the second star of the show, the first being the incredible kemono you\u2019ll be fighting against. While there are definitely some familiar feelings when using something like the Karakuri katana or the Nozomu, at least for Monster Hunter veterans, some of the weapons here are incredibly refreshing takes on familiar things.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, when you kick off Wild Hearts, you\u2019ll only have the Karakuri katana to start off with. You\u2019ll be stuck with that until you\u2019ve progressed through the tutorial and gotten beaten up by the cold-hearted wolf you meet. Shortly after this, you\u2019ll stumble across someone who needs help, and you\u2019ll immediately have to hunt a weird-looking squirrel called a Ragetail.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you\u2019ve beaten the Ragetail, you\u2019ll be able to go back and find out that the person you saved is a blacksmith. If you set up a forge for her, she\u2019ll then be able to create and upgrade the Karakuri katana, nodachi, bow, maul, and bladed wagasa.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019ll notice that there are three weapon types that are still blanked out. To unlock these, you\u2019ll need to progress through the main story until after you\u2019ve beaten a monster called the Earthbreaker. After this, you\u2019ll have a festival to attend, and once that\u2019s all done you can head back to your trusty blacksmith and be able to craft the hand cannon, claw blade, and Karakuri staff.</p><p> Here's the full range of Wild Hearts weapons and how they each perform.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Karakuri Katana</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099980-4098655-wild-hearts-weapons-karakuri-blade.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This is your standard weapon, and it\u2019s a jack-of-all-trades. It attacks quite quickly, is capable of some very fast attacks as you move through the combos, and it can transform using your Karakuri energy to hit more and have a wider range as well. This is a great weapon for basically everyone, but if you\u2019re looking for something more specialized, then you\u2019ll want to move away from this.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nodachi</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099981-4098656-wild-hearts-weapons-nodachi.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Nodachi is just a giant slab of metal pretending to be a sword. This thing hits hard, but incredibly slowly, and that\u2019s not going to be for everyone. You can perform a mix of upward slices and horizontal ones, and can even charge your attacks to unleash powerful iai attacks. It\u2019s a lot of fun seeing a single massive number, but it can make getting out of the way of some attacks a lot harder.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bow</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099982-4098657-wild-hearts-weapons-bow.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This might be one of the coolest takes on a bow we\u2019ve seen. You can fire the weapon horizontally or vertically, each of which has a different purpose. Horizontal arrows don\u2019t do much damage, but can be detonated with vertical arrows. You\u2019ll generally want to cover a monster in horizontal arrows before blowing them up, and you can kill a monster in two or three vertical arrows in the early game if you\u2019re patient. You can also charge the bow through two different levels. The charged modes change the way you fire, generally allowing for more speed with horizontal shots and more power and penetration for vertical ones.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Maul</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099983-4098658-wild-hearts-weapons-maul.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Here we have the other heavy close-range weapon, the maul. This thing is basically a gigantic hammer that you\u2019re going to be using to bonk monsters on the head. Despite being quite heavy, it has a little mobility thanks to some jumping attacks, and you can hold your special attack down to swing it round and round, and it'll get longer as you do so.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bladed Wagasa</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099984-4098659-wild-hearts-weapons-bladed-wagasa.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This weapon is wild. As you attack with this weapon, you\u2019ll build up a meter that ups your attack power. It\u2019s absurdly fast, but you can also use it to launch yourself into the air for aerial combos too. Not only that, but it can parry monster attacks. It can be tough timing these, which makes this weapon one that\u2019s especially suited to those who love learning monster move sets, but it always feels cool.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hand Cannon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099985-4098660-wild-hearts-weapons-hand-cannon.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If you love ranged combat but think bows are weird, you\u2019re wrong, but you\u2019ll still be catered to here. The hand cannon is a massive firearm that you can use to attack from afar, but you\u2019ll need to keep a careful eye on where you\u2019re standing to make the most of it. You also need to manage a heat gauge as well, so this is a good one for hunters who like to take a more considered approach.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Claw Blade</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099986-4098662-wild-hearts-weapons-claw-blade.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If the only thing you look for in a weapon is mobility, then the claw blade is here for you. This incredibly light melee weapon can be attached to enemies to allow you to circle around them, pull yourself in, or retreat in an instant. It\u2019s not got an especially high attack power, but it feels immense to unleash a 30-hit combo with it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Karakuri Staff</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4099987-4098663-wild-hearts-weapons-karakuri-staff.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Karakuri staff is by far the most intriguing Wild Hearts weapon, but it\u2019s also probably the hardest one to use. This thing has five different forms to master, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. You can turn it into a staff, a pair of bladed tonfa, a giant shuriken, a glaive, and unleash massive attacks with a monstrously large sword. Mastering the transformations and using specific timing is essential to get the most out of this weapon, but you\u2019ll nearly always look cool using it.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wild-hearts-weapons-list-how-to-unlock-all-weapons-and-which-are-best/2900-4646/", "date_published": "2023-02-16 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Xbox Game Pass Adds Valheim In March", "description": "<p>The Norse mythology game <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/valheim/\">Valheim</a> is coming to Xbox Game Pass--this much was confirmed back in 2022.

The Guerrilla- and Firesprite-developed title is a successful virtual reality game thanks to the tech housed in the PSVR 2, and the PSVR 2's capabilities are best showcased by the game. Admittedly, the barrier to entry for experiencing it all is very high: You'll need to own a PS5, purchase the $550 headset, and then get the $60 game on top. But those who do will be treated to a game that's an impressive technical showpiece and an enjoyable Horizon game in its own right.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Call of the Mountain takes place in the same vibrant setting that you're used to exploring as Aloy. However, for this game, the protagonist is Ryas, a member of the Shadow Carja who has been imprisoned for questionable actions. Ryas is busted out of prison and sent on a perilous journey to figure out why the machine animals of Horizon's worlds are acting out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is a familiar narrative beat for a Horizon game, and a lot of the story is carried by Ryas. Ryas' brother went missing while also trying to solve this particular mystery, so he has a personal stake in going out of his way to help those around him in order to figure out what's going on, even if the people he's working withtreat him like an outsider. My interest in Call of the Mountain was primarily in seeing how it utilized the new hardware, so it caught me by surprise when I found myself invested in Ryas as a character. The game does a great job of slowly unpacking his story and showing that there may have been more to his history than it initially seems.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-new-heights/1900-6418028/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-new-heights/1900-6418028/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-16 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "PlayStation VR 2 Review - Running In Place", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">While the original PlayStation VR was an admirable first effort for Sony, it was also an awkward piece of hardware. It launched when consumer-focused headsets were in their nascency, which is probably why Sony could get away with a jerry-rigged chimera of old and new technology. The headset looked slick and was comfortable, but its displays left a lot to be desired, the setup was frustrating, and it used controllers that were a generation older than the PS4. PSVR felt like a solution hurriedly thrown together to make the most of an emerging trend.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Its successor, the PlayStation VR 2, is the opposite in almost every way. It's a thoughtfully designed piece of hardware that is powerful and delivers a user-friendly, plug-and-play experience that is almost entirely frictionless. The technology powering it is modern, making it a worthy companion to the PlayStation 5, and its Sense controllers are designed specifically for gaming in VR spaces. The PSVR 2 is undoubtedly a major step forward for PlayStation's virtual reality ambitions and one of the best headsets on the market, but in the ever-shifting landscape of virtual reality, its price and current value proposition leave it in an awkward position once again.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Out of the box, the PSVR 2 looks and feels like a premium piece of technology. The matte-white-on-deep-black PlayStation color scheme is replicated here to great effect, and the form factor swaps the sharpness of the PS5 for rounded corners and curved bands that make the whole unit pleasing to look at, as well as put on and take off. The Sense controllers are similarly elegant in design, comfortably filling my hands and allowing my fingers and thumbs to rest on the buttons and triggers very naturally. The original PSVR was lauded as being the most comfortable headset on the market, and PSVR 2 can also claim that accolade, as it is even more comfortable to wear. It may feel a little heavy for those who are used to the lighter Meta Quest 2, but the weight feels well-distributed, so I didn't have the neck-fatigue issues that I feared may crop up during longer sessions.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-review-running-in-place/1100-6511528/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-review-running-in-place/1100-6511528/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-16 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Sky: Children Of The Light Is Celebrating Days Of Love Until The End Of The Month", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/sky-children-of-the-light/\"> Sky: Children of the Light</a>'s Valentine's event Days of Love is back, with new cute items, and the chance to collect old items from previous years' events.
