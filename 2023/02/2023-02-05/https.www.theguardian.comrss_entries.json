Reject hate. Learn about things you don\u2019t understand,\u201d begins Benefits vocalist Kingsley Hall amid a wall of noise. Describing themselves as an \u201cissues-based music collective\u201d from Teesside, the quartet is essentially a vehicle for Hall\u2019s polemic. He dissects the state of the nation with a particular focus on the drift toward nationalism and populism over the last decade. During the day, the frontman-cum-punk poet divides his time between a factory job and caring for his young daughter. There are few such characters in pop music in 2023, which may be why his unsigned, unmanaged band is gaining traction. He\u2019s also an oddly magnetic performer. With his severe crop, black hoodie and shorts, he\u2019s like an angry skinhead with balletic dance moves.</p><p>Hall is flanked by synth players Robbie and Hugh Major while former Mogwai live drummer Cat Myers beats out rhythms. Their mix of electronica and narrative is slightly comparable to Sleaford Mods but Benefits are more uncompromising and brutal. At times, it\u2019s hard to work out whether they\u2019re hardcore punk, performance art, avant-industrial noise or an angry man ranting. In fact, they can be all these things, sometimes within a single song. Hall\u2019s voice is paramount, so it\u2019s a shame that this venue\u2019s acoustics make many of his words unintelligible.

The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 revealed that thousands of people in Britain were living in flats which were wrapped in unsafe cladding. Five-and-a-half years later, only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/29/gove-admits-faulty-guidance-partly-to-blame-for-grenfell-fire\">7%</a> of dangerous homes have been fixed.

The effects of this are psychological as well as financial: one survey found that <a href=\"https://extra.shu.ac.uk/ppp-online/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/understanding-impacts-UK-cladding-scandal.pdf\">90% of people</a> affected by the cladding crisis said their mental health had deteriorated; 23% reported having suicidal feelings or a desire to self-harm.</p><p>Ministers long refused to acknowledge that slashing red tape played a role in this scandal. Their evasion was partly founded on hostility to regulations and loyalty to an industry whose leaders are among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/11/property-developers-gave-tories-891000-in-first-quarter-of-2021\">key donors</a> to the Conservative party. So a recent admission from the secretary of state for levelling up and housing, Michael Gove, that lax regulations were partly to blame for Grenfell, was a welcome shift in tone. The rulebook was \u201cfaulty and ambiguous\u201d, allowing the industry to \u201cput people in danger in order to make a profit\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-gove-we-are-to-blame-on-grenfell-5khwd60wk\">he said</a>.

But what does its relocation mean for the local Sami reindeer herders?</p><p>In the far north of Sweden, 125 miles above the Arctic Circle, sits the church of Kiruna, once voted the most beautiful old building in the country. The cosy terracotta-coloured church, with its fairytale rooftop points, is designed to resemble a hut of the indigenous Sami people. It opened in 1912, with almost no religious symbols, and is described by the vicar, Lena Tj\u00e4rnberg, as \u201cthe living room of the community\u201d. But if Kiruna church is to stay the same, it must go.</p><p>In 2026, the entire 600-tonne wooden building will be loaded on to trailers and moved to a new spot near the local graveyard. It\u2019s just one large \u2013 and technically tricky \u2013 piece of a project to <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/architecture/kiruna-swedish-town-relocating-white-arkitekter-04-08-2021/\">move Kiruna to a new home</a>, three kilometres (1.9 miles) east of the old town. Billed as the world\u2019s most radical relocation project, Kiruna is moving because subsidence from the local iron ore mine is threatening to swallow the town. Cracks have already appeared in the hospital; a school is no longer safe for its pupils.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/05/why-a-swedish-town-is-on-the-move-one-building-at-a-time-kirkuna-arctic-circle\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/05/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-sausages-and-beans-and-panna-cotta-with-blood-orange", "title": "Nigel Slater\u2019s recipes for sausages and beans, and panna cotta with blood orange", "date_published": "2023-02-05 10:30:18+00:00", "description": "<p>A hearty meal of baked sausages with a mash of beans and spinach, followed by an elegant set cream with winter fruits</p><p>It was the sort of winter night when only sausages would do, and I came home with both my favourite butcher\u2019s variety and a packet of plump Italian ones \u2013 coarse textured and seasoned with fennel seeds and dried chilli.

The four-hour documentary, co-produced by Channel 4 and HBO, is a brutally frank and explicit account of two abusive relationships that the King of Pop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson\">Michael Jackson</a>, had with children: one with Wade Robson describes how the boy was just seven when the entertainer first raped him, and an earlier one with James Safechuck, who was all of 10 years old when it began.

Maybe we could help prevent young children from falling prey to this most scarring, crippling of crimes. Of course the fact that the child molester in this case was one of the world\u2019s most famous men meant that a lot of people would watch. Setting fire to Jackson\u2019s reputation, already charred around the edges by multiple allegations and payments of hush money, was not the primary goal of the documentary.

And given that the Golden State accounts for some 81% of all US wine production (which, incidentally, makes it the fourth-largest wine producer in the world after Italy, France and Spain), that\u2019s not at all surprising. But wine is made in every state in the union, and there is much of interest to be found there, especially in the four states (Washington State, Oregon, New York state and Virginia) which account for the lion\u2019s share of the fifth of US production not taken up by California. The wines of New York State, for example, could not be more different from their peers on the other side of the continent, with Forge Cellars\u2019 startling dry riesling, with its flash of fine-steel-blade acidity and burst of apple and pear, one of the best versions of this variety you\u2019ll find anywhere.</p><p><strong>Domaine Drouhin Arthur Chardonnay Dundee Hills Willamette Valley 2020 (\u00a327, <a href=\"http://hic-winemerchants.com/\">hic-winemerchants.com</a>) </strong>With its long, cold winters, and short summers, The Finger Lakes region is very much a cool-climate zone, with the moderating effect of the titular lakes the crucial factor in making wine production viable at all. Seneca Lake seems to be a particularly good site, home to both the Forge Cellars Riesling and another of my favourite New York Rieslings, made by Hermann J Wiener. Forge is also notable for being the work of a leading French winemaker, the Rh\u00f4ne Valley maestro Louis Barruol, which links it to one of my favourite wines from a recent tasting of Chardonnays from another exciting US winemaking state, Oregon.
