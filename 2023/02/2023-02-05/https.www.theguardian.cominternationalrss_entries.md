<p>Home invaders order a family to sacrifice one of their own to save humanity in the director’s effectively bleak thriller</p><p>An idyllic family vacation is interrupted by four strangers, each armed with an elaborate, medieval-looking weapon. The four demand entry into the rustic holiday home of Eric (Jonathan Groff), Andrew (Ben Aldridge) and their adopted daughter Wen (Kristen Cui). Having clocked the machetes and scythes, Eric and Andrew resist. But since one of the strangers is played by human battering ram Dave Bautista, it’s only a matter of time before they gain entry. And so director M Night Shyamalan sets the scene for a home invasion thriller with a difference: Eric, Andrew and Wen must, they are told, sacrifice one member of their small family in order to save the rest of humanity. But should they trust the motives of four individuals who seem to be undergoing a form of collective psychosis?</p><p>Adapted from a novel by Paul Tremblay, <em>Knock at the Cabin</em> is initially slightly exposition-heavy – Bautista spends a great deal of time patiently explaining the plot. To his credit, he’s a gravely persuasive presence. But as the film’s bleak momentum builds, so does a tsunami swell of existential dread. It’s Shyamalan’s most contained and efficient picture in a while.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/05/knock-at-the-cabin-review-m-night-shyamalan-the-holiday-from-hell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Tapete)<br />This home-recorded album from the Australian singer-songwriter is at once premonitory and healing – and very much a family affair</p><p>The veteran US critic Robert Christgau once called Robert Forster and <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2006/05/09/grant-mclennan-19582006/">Grant McLennan</a> of the Go-Betweens the greatest songwriting partnership working (it was the 1980s at the time). But the Australian band never made it big. McLennan is no longer with us.</p><p>Forster, meanwhile, has a body of work attesting to his continued wry excellence, his songs replete with clear-eyed craft and emotional heft. But <em><a href="https://robertforster.bandcamp.com/album/the-candle-and-the-flame">The Candle and the Flame</a></em>, his eighth solo work, has added resonance. Mid-pandemic, Forster’s partner, Karin Bäumler, was diagnosed with cancer. Forster’s songs pre-date that diagnosis, and the chemo and the surgery. But as is the way of songwriting – witness the foreshadowing of Nick Cave’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/10/nick-cave-skeleton-tree">Skeleton Key</a></em> (2016), for instance – Forster’s songs examined healing, his love for Bäumler, and unexpected happenings “round the bend”. Forster was almost too embarrassed to reveal one song: She’s a Fighter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/05/robert-forster-the-candle-and-the-flame-review-bittersweet-songs-with-added-resonance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three years on, the reality of the split with the EU has changed minds.

Earlier remain gains were driven by abstainers and those too young to vote in 2016 breaking against Brexit and by demographic changes which have slowly pulled the electorate in a pro-EU direction. The vast majority of leave and remain voters have hitherto stood by the choices they made in June 2016. That is now changing, and it is Brexiters who are reconsidering. One in five leave voters now say they would vote to rejoin the EU, while remain switching has stayed much lower. The scales of opinion are being tipped against Brexit by growing doubts among its original supporters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/05/yes-the-mood-has-shifted-against-brexit-but-the-road-back-to-brussels-is-long-and-hard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On a trip away from his native Italy, young photographer Mario Carnicelli found a carefree side to life in Harlem after the riots</p><p><a href="http://www.mariocarnicelli.com/">Mario Carnicelli</a> won a photography competition in his native Italy in 1966 and the prize was a trip to America to take pictures there. He was 29 and he knew the US only through films and music. Travelling between Chicago, Detroit, Dallas and New York, Carnicelli was struck both by the continued segregation of society and the ways that was being challenged. The civil rights movement was at its height – the Selma to Montgomery march had taken place the previous year, shortly after the <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/malcolm-x-assassinated">assassination of Malcolm X</a> – and Carnicelli became focused on the ambitions and struggles of Black Americans.</p><p>His pictures were not published at the time, and after a subsequent decade working as a photojournalist Carnicelli gave up that career to open a camera shop in Florence.

<p>Ukraine fights off fresh assault on Bakhmut; Olaf Scholz says western-supplied weapons will not be used to attack Russian territory</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Ukraine announced it had fought off a fresh Russian assault on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut</strong> on Saturday, as it endured renewed shelling in the Donetsk region. In his evening address, Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged that the situation was getting tougher. Russia, he said, was “throwing more and more of its forces at breaking down our defence. It is very difficult now in Bakhmut, Vugledar, Lyman and other areas”, referring to the frontline cities in the east of the country.</p><p><strong>The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Zelenskiy has agreed that weapons supplied by the west will not be used to attack Russian territory.</strong> “There is a consensus on this point,” Scholz told Bild am Sonntag. Scholz rejected Vladimir Putin’s comparison of the intervention of the west with Russia’s struggle during the second world war as “absurd”. “We have carefully weighed each delivery of weapons, in close coordination with our allies, starting with America,” he said, adding that such a consensus-based approach “avoids an escalation”.</p><p><strong>Portugal has become the latest country to say it will send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine</strong>, the prime minister, António Costa, said. An inventory has been done of its stocks, with Lisbon asking Germany for parts to help repair them so they can be deployed to Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy spoke to UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on Saturday.</strong> The president said he had thanked Sunak for the training of Ukrainian troops so they will be able to use British Challenger tanks.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian president has revoked the citizenship of several former influential politicians</strong>, in what he said was another step to “cleanse” the country of pro-Russian influences. Zelenskiy would not list the names, but said they had dual Russian citizenship. According to Ukrainian state media, the list includes several top politicians from the office of Viktor Yanukovych, who served as Ukraine’s pro-Russian president from 2010 until he was removed from office in 2014.</p><p><strong>The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, has authorised the country to begin using seized Russian money to aid Ukraine</strong>, according to US media. The money would come from assets confiscated from Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev after his April indictment for alleged sanctions evasions, he added.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has introduced emergency energy shutdowns in Odesa after a “technological accident” at a high-voltage electricity substation</strong>, which has previously been damaged by Russian attacks. Half a million people are without power and officials have warned repairs could take weeks. The government said it would appeal to Turkey for help and ordered the energy ministry’s stocks of high-power generators to be sent to the city.</p><p><strong>Germany has collected evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, the country’s prosecutor general said</strong> in a newspaper interview published on Saturday, adding that he saw a need for a judicial process at international level. He said the amount of evidence was in the “three-digit” range.</p><p><strong>More than 18.1m border crossings have taken place out of Ukraine</strong> since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022, according to data from the UN.</p><p><strong>The bodies of killed British volunteers Christopher Parry and Andrew Bagshaw have been returned by Russian troops in a prisoner exchange.</strong> They were both killed in Ukraine last month. A total of 116 Ukrainian troops have come home after being captured, with 63 being sent back to Russia.</p><p><strong>The number of Russian soldiers around the southern city of Mariupol has increased by about 10,000 to 15,000</strong>, according to an adviser to the city’s mayor. Petro Andriushchenko wrote on Telegram that it means the total amount of troops is now about 30,000. They are stationed in villages in the district.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-347-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
