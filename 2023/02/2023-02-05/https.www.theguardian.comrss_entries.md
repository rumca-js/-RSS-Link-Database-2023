<p><strong>Middlesbrough Empire<br /></strong>This noisy, visceral ‘issues-based collective’ from Teesside, led by charismatic polemicist Kingsley Hall and featuring ex-Mogwai drummer Cat Myers, are ones to watch</p><p>“Ignore cartoon fascists. Reject hate. Learn about things you don’t understand,” begins Benefits vocalist Kingsley Hall amid a wall of noise. Describing themselves as an “issues-based music collective” from Teesside, the quartet is essentially a vehicle for Hall’s polemic. He dissects the state of the nation with a particular focus on the drift toward nationalism and populism over the last decade. During the day, the frontman-cum-punk poet divides his time between a factory job and caring for his young daughter. There are few such characters in pop music in 2023, which may be why his unsigned, unmanaged band is gaining traction. He’s also an oddly magnetic performer. With his severe crop, black hoodie and shorts, he’s like an angry skinhead with balletic dance moves.</p><p>Hall is flanked by synth players Robbie and Hugh Major while former Mogwai live drummer Cat Myers beats out rhythms. Their mix of electronica and narrative is slightly comparable to Sleaford Mods but Benefits are more uncompromising and brutal. At times, it’s hard to work out whether they’re hardcore punk, performance art, avant-industrial noise or an angry man ranting. In fact, they can be all these things, sometimes within a single song. Hall’s voice is paramount, so it’s a shame that this venue’s acoustics make many of his words unintelligible. The best: “The Red Arrows screaming past as the homeless pile up/But where is my puffed out chest? Why don’t I feel like all the rest?”, juxtapose imagery to paint a compelling snapshot of a divided country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/05/benefits-review-brutal-punk-sincerity-rages-against-britains-dying-light">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the cladding scandal: tough talk must be matched with substance | Editorial

<p>Michael Gove’s admission of failures is welcome, but leaseholders need certainty they won’t be on the hook for any fire defects</p><p>For those who bought flats in tower blocks built with flammable materials, the dream of home ownership has become a nightmare. The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 revealed that thousands of people in Britain were living in flats which were wrapped in unsafe cladding. Five-and-a-half years later, only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/29/gove-admits-faulty-guidance-partly-to-blame-for-grenfell-fire">7%</a> of dangerous homes have been fixed. Leaseholders have been stung with bills of <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/first-time-buyer-says-208000-cladding-bill-is-almost-more-than-price-she-paid-for-her-entire-flat-1149381">more than £200,000</a> for defects they had no hand in creating. The effects of this are psychological as well as financial: one survey found that <a href="https://extra.shu.ac.uk/ppp-online/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/understanding-impacts-UK-cladding-scandal.pdf">90% of people</a> affected by the cladding crisis said their mental health had deteriorated; 23% reported having suicidal feelings or a desire to self-harm.</p><p>Ministers long refused to acknowledge that slashing red tape played a role in this scandal. Their evasion was partly founded on hostility to regulations and loyalty to an industry whose leaders are among the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/11/property-developers-gave-tories-891000-in-first-quarter-of-2021">key donors</a> to the Conservative party. So a recent admission from the secretary of state for levelling up and housing, Michael Gove, that lax regulations were partly to blame for Grenfell, was a welcome shift in tone. The rulebook was “faulty and ambiguous”, allowing the industry to “put people in danger in order to make a profit”, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-gove-we-are-to-blame-on-grenfell-5khwd60wk">he said</a>. For those who campaigned tirelessly to make homes safer, this was confirmation that the ideology of deregulation helped to create this scandal, and that its beneficiaries should be on the hook for fixing it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-cladding-scandal-tough-talk-must-be-matched-with-substance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Books and documentaries can not only tell us what happened in the Soviet Union and why – but why it matters</p><p>“Eras have their surfaces,” writes the German historian <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/taxonomy/term/26538">Karl Schlögel</a>. “They can be smooth or rough. They can vanish or dissolve. They can be felt. What wrapping paper was and what it meant is something one only begins to understand now that it has disappeared … in the flood of plastic bags.”</p><p>Even when it focuses on ordinary people rather than grand statesmen, we tend to think of history as a narrative of wars and laws, replete with stark facts: 13 million unemployed, 40 million dead in a famine. But it is also how people experienced these things, and how they felt about them, and about the myriad places and objects and habits that constitute what Prof Schlögel calls a “lifeworld” in his forthcoming book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691183749/the-soviet-century">The Soviet Century: Archaeology of a Lost World</a>. It is a kind of montage of coarse wrapping paper, dusty museums and Lilac eau de parfum. It nods as well to what is missing – the lost sounds of the early morning ring at the door, announcing your house was about to be searched; the turn of a key in a cell’s lock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-history-of-feelings-a-serious-subject">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Nicholas Falk </strong>recommends the German model of devolving financial powers to cities and regions.

Ask a German, 25 January</a>). In Good Cities, Better Lives, published in 2013, Prof Sir Peter Hall and I drew on case studies of the resurgence of Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Dortmund, Kassel and Freiburg to explain how German cities had powered ahead. There were eight factors: municipal leadership, highly connected cities, a knowledge-based economy, engineering excellence, regional finance, urban pride, a climate of innovation and intelligent spatial planning.</p><p>On a second visit I was impressed by how the devolution of power, thanks to the principle of subsidiarity, enabled key local actors in business, universities and local authorities to collaborate on a spatial plan. Leipzig lost 90% of its manufacturing jobs after reunification. Yet it not only attracted BMW’s giant car plant and engineering centre but also converted the largest spinning mill in the world into hundreds of art studios and galleries.

<p><strong>Linbury theatre, London <br /></strong>The American choreographer showcases three works with the Royal Ballet, the newest of which examines the idealism and corporeality of womanhood</p><p>The Royal Ballet now has three works by American choreographer <a href="https://www.pamtanowitzdance.org/">Pam Tanowitz</a>; catch them all on this programme. Formal geometries are so present in Tanowitz’s dance composition that you can almost see lines stretching between walls or graphed on the floor. There are many echoes of both classical and modern canonical dance works – which doesn’t feel derivative, though it can feel insiderish. And music – astringent, bracing – powers some of the steps, and much of the mood.</p><p>The new piece comes first. Created for corps de ballet dancers, Secret Things opens with the figure of a woman caught between iconic ideal and flawed corporeality. In a tunic of sunshine yellow, shins shimmering with gold and pointe shoes tipped with cobalt blue, she is at once a work of Apollonian statuary, all poise and proportion, and a coltish creature who is still discovering her body: sometimes she’ll flop, or find herself blocked by her own foot. That dynamic – all of a piece with <a href="https://www.annaclyne.com/">Anna Clyne</a>’s accompanying string quartet, entitled Breathing Statues – underpins the work as it multiplies its geometries and motifs to encompass eight dancers. Yet for all its fascination, Secret Things feels arch and academic, still more study than piece.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/everyone-keeps-me-new-pam-tanowitz-details">Linbury theatre, London</a>, until 16 February</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/05/secret-thingseveryone-keeps-me-review-new-pam-tanowitz-work-feels-more-study-than-piece">Continue reading...</a>

He showed on both black and white models, who went barefoot because he could not afford to shoe them, brief dresses assembled of plaques of metal or Rhodoid, an organic plastic, linked flexibly by wire ties. Paris fulminated.

<p> It’s easy to get people riled up and panicked about kids, about a changing culture and about lost innocence. That’s exactly what the right is doing</p><p>You could be forgiven for losing track of all the lurid and inventive ways that Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor with presidential ambitions, has attacked education in his state. Last year he signed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1089221657/dont-say-gay-florida-desantis">Don’t Say Gay bill</a>, a nasty little law that bans classroom discussion of sexuality or gender identity issues – effectively forcing children and teachers alike to stay silent about their families and lives, under the threat of lawsuits. The bill caused confusion and controversy, frightening gay students and teachers, leading to preemptive compliance in some sectors and defiant disobedience in others – and, not coincidentally, drawing quite a bit of culture-war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/24/opinion/desantis-florida-culture-w.html">attention to DeSantis himself</a>.</p><p>Since then, the Florida governor has repeated the playbook in increasingly ambitious fashion. Last April, DeSantis signed the exhaustingly titled “Stop Woke Act,” which restricts lessons on racial inequality in public schools. The bill <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/florida-schools-directed-cover-remove-classroom-books-vetted/story?id=96884323">prohibits the teaching</a> of material that could cause a student to “feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress,” due to US racial history – the implication being that these are not appropriate responses to an encounter with this history, or that protection from such emotions is more important than a confrontation with the facts.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/schools-and-universities-are-ground-zero-for-americas-culture-war">Continue reading...</a>

They dominated at Nottingham Forest but succumbed to Brennan Johnson’s first-half strike and an inspired Keylor Navas debut.</p><p>For all the positive words from the Leeds head coach in recent weeks, they lack the ruthlessness that is required in the Premier League, which explains why they are outside the relegation zone only on goal difference.

<p>From the diversity of the top brass to Sgt Catherine Cawood’s model of best practice, the BBC drama should be essential viewing for senior officers</p><ul><li>Dal Babu is a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police</li></ul><p>I’m not usually a fan of police dramas. After 30 years working for the Metropolitan police, in a career that spanned working in firearms, hostage situations, murders, riots and domestic violence, I’m usually frustrated with how inaccurate TV portrayals are of policing (I know, this is sad). But then Happy Valley has come along again, and instead of resisting, I decided to watch it.</p><p>What have I learned? Aside from the fact that unrealistic police procedures still abound on television (mobile phone data analysis missed; a survivor of a kidnapping and sexual assault joining the force and being allowed to work in the area in which the offences recently occurred), what struck me most was that the writer, Sally Wainwright, and the BBC commissioners have grasped something the police still haven’t: that diversity matters. I was the only person of colour out of 300 new officers when I joined the force in 1983, and you could count on one hand the number of Black and Asian chief superintendents even when I retired in 2013.</p><p>Dal Babu is a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/happy-valley-policing-bbc-metropolitan-police-catherine-cawood-sarah-lancashire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A game flickered here in brief instants, and maybe it was something real and maybe it wasn’t. Maybe Chelsea were always destined to win this, to produce the moments of quality when it mattered, to wear down and wear out a Tottenham team still running around trying to work out whether they’re any good or not. Maybe they were simply keeping their opponents at arm’s length, measuring their efforts ahead of a spring that brings big tests on all four fronts.</p><p>They won and ultimately there can be few complaints about that. They took an early lead through Jess Carter, responded well to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/29/tottenham-hotspur-london-city-womens-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Beth England’s </a>equaliser and kept up the pressure during the second half. Lauren James produced the moment of the game with a stirring solo goal. And yet. Even before Tottenham’s late consolation from Nikola Karczewska there were passages that did not feel like a foretaste of inevitable Chelsea dominance, moments when Tottenham attacked with pace and an entirely different kind of battle felt possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/05/tottenham-chelsea-womens-super-league-match-report-wsl">Continue reading...</a>

They first collaborated on Dickson’s 2016 solo album <em>Ft</em>, where every track was steered by a different star, from Yoko Ono to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H3w9BTzUBc">Crystal Waters</a>. McAlmont took the wheel on Like Josephine Baker, a satisfyingly solid mirrorball stomper shadowed by a little sadness, like all the best disco. The duo’s first full-length project stays close to the club, proving Dickson’s canny ear for foot-twitching rhythms accompanied by exuberant Bollywood strings.</p><p>However, on songs such as Hurricanes the spiky drums and candied orchestration submerge McAlmont, leaving him politely fighting for attention down in the mix. It’s mostly fine – Happy Ending, Otherwise and The Fever are fun – but that succulent voice, lighter than a fly on a feather, needs more space, more time. When Dickson grants him room to roam on glorious, affecting single The Skin I’m In, McAlmont interrogates key lines such as “Black lives matter” with the falsetto ferocity that fans of his symphonic-pop classic Yes will remember all too well. More of this next time, please.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/05/hifi-sean-david-mcalmont-happy-ending-review-a-dream-voice-thats-lost-in-the-mix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British photographer reflects on trying to capture the mystery of the Radio 4 staple in his classic photobook, now expanded and updated</p><p>Though the shipping forecast is still broadcast daily on BBC Radio 4, the strange resonance of what Seamus Heaney called “that strong gale-warning voice” may not, in an age of digital information overload, cast quite the same spell it once did on the collective imagination. It nevertheless remains a constant for many listeners, reassuring in its steadiness even as it gives notice of unruly swells and approaching storms in those faraway-sounding hinterlands of Dogger, Viking and German Bight.</p><p>“It occupies a deeply rooted place in our culture,” says Mark Power, whose book <em><a href="https://www.markpower.co.uk/the-shipping-forecast-2022">The Shipping Forecast</a></em><a href="https://www.markpower.co.uk/the-shipping-forecast-2022"> </a>comprises photographs from the 31 sea areas that are enumerated in the daily radio litany. “For many of us there is an essential mystery to the shipping forecast that perhaps comes from hearing it in the background as a child, but not really understanding it. And, even as we grow older, it’s difficult for most of us to understand it, because we’re not depending on it the way sailors or trawler crews depend on it.”</p><p>Shannon, Thursday 4 April 1996.

## Rokia Koné review – Malian star’s ragged, diva-ish charm is unstoppable

<p><strong>Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow <br /></strong>Former Les Amazones d’Afrique singer and Jackknife Lee collaborator Koné fuses psychedelia and electro-house with her beautiful, Bambara-sung words</p><p>It was as a member of West African feminist supergroup Les Amazones d’Afrique that Rokia Koné’s name and extraordinary voice first began to ring out far beyond the borders of her native Mali. Among those captivated was Garret ‘Jacknife’ Lee, the Irish producer best known for his work with U2 and Taylor Swift. He collaborated remotely from California with Koné during lockdown on her debut album Bamanan – 10 electronica-dipped, gossamer groovy songs of joy, pain and fury sung in Bambara, the most widely spoken language in Mali.</p><p>Lee was originally billed to appear with Koné at this Celtic Connections date but had to pull out due to a scheduling conflict. Accustomed to performing in Bamako’s clubs for hours on end, Koné has more than enough star power and stamina to enchant a crowd without him. Sashaying around the stage in a flowing white dress, flanked by guitarist Thierry Fournel and keys player and beatmaker Manu Lechat plus a pair of perma-dancing female backing vocalists, her ragged vocals rip through the dry ice-clouded air during dreamy opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_fllqSht3c">Bi Ye Tulonba Ye</a> with a tremendous power and presence verging on the unnerving. Even without a microphone she’d probably still be the loudest thing in the room.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/05/rokia-kone-review-malian-stars-ragged-diva-ish-charm-is-unstoppable">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We decided to ‘work from home’ in a tiny studio apartment in the heart of the beautiful Italian city. Would we live to tell the tale?</p><p>One evening, three days after we moved into a studio apartment in Venice for a month, my husband got sick. He vomited all night, until we fell into an exhausted sleep around 5.30am, only to be woken by the church bells next door at 7am, then forced up by the dog whining for breakfast. We wearily started work, cheek by jowl in a tiny space. A few hours later, as my husband started his third speakerphone call of the morning, my noise-cancelling headphones died. Was our dream trip proving to be the stupidest idea ever?</p><p>We had wanted an adventure to mark our newly empty nest when our younger son headed off to university last autumn. I had a clear idea: the pictures of Venice that circulated in lockdown (silent, clear waters, heart-swellingly beautiful) had filled me with longing. We both work remotely anyway, and the 40m deep dive pool a short drive away sealed the deal for my free-diving-mad husband.

<p><strong>V&amp;A, London<br /></strong>The UK’s forthcoming Donatello exhibition will capture the Florentine artist’s revolutionary genius for perspective, male beauty and, above all, empathy</p><p>A startling figure has arrived in Britain: a man with a gathering frown, sleepless thoughts and a graze of stubble. His eyes are downcast, his domed forehead lowered. You would recognise him anywhere in the streets of his native Italy: the pensive intellectual, dark-eyed and ascetic, with a tousled black beard. Except that he is from the 15th century, and cast in gleaming gilded bronze.</p><p>The original commission was for a medieval reliquary – an object to contain the remains of a saint, in this case the skull of San Rossore, a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity and was martyred for his faith. But the sculptor, <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello">Donatello</a>, exceeded every rule and convention. Not only did he imagine the saint as a once-living being, not an icon, but he created this staggering portrait of a real modern man in the active moment of thinking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/05/donatello-sculpting-the-renaissance-v-and-a-london-victoria-and-albert-museum-a-once-in-a-lifetime-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Puss, voiced by Antonio Banderas, must beat Goldilocks, Jack Horner and co to the magic star that will restore his nine lives in this lively animation</p><p>This <em>Shrek</em> spin-off is a breezily entertaining DreamWorks animation that harnesses the familiar appeal of the self-aggrandising feline (Antonio Banderas), while also adopting a distinctive and original graphic visual style. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado both worked on the <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> films, and it’s perhaps this, plus the striking stylised action sequences of <em>Spider-Man:</em> <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em>, that informs the bold, peppy approach to Puss’s gravity-defying derring-do.</p><p>The plot is basic: down to his final life, Puss sees an opportunity to restore the full nine with a magic wishing star. He’s not the only one seeking it: Goldilocks and her ursine crime syndicate are on his trail, as is the monstrous “Big” Jack Horner. And then there’s Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and wannabe emotional support animal Perrito the chihuahua (Harvey Guillén). It helps that the writing is as sharp as Puss’s claws.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/05/puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-review-dreamworks-antonio-banderas-shrek-spin-off">Continue reading...</a>

## Writer Robert Douglas-Fairhurst: ‘The less the body works, the more you appreciate any bit that still does’

<p>The professor of English literature on the shock of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the books he turned to, and the more unexpected ways his life has been transformed</p><p>In his new book, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst likens his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in 2017 to the opening of a trapdoor on which he unfortunately happened to be standing “like Wile E Coyote” at the precise moment when the lever operating it was pulled. On that day, a neurologist briskly explained to him that his recent MRI scan had revealed the existence of lesions on his spine and brain that were almost certainly the result of MS, and in that moment – whoosh! – down he plummeted. “There was,” he writes, “a creak of wood, the sharp click of a sliding bolt, and then nothing but the sensation of rushing air.” His symptoms – the struggle to get out of a hot bath; the feeling, after a long walk, that his legs could no longer carry him – had hitherto been more bothersome than distressing or painful. But now he began to see them as part of a sinister jigsaw: a fiendish puzzle that would, he soon gathered, forever remain unsolvable.</p><p>Still, he wasn’t about to give up: then, or now. In his lovely, book-lined room in <a href="https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-robert-douglas-fairhurst/">Magdalen College, Oxford</a> – open a window, and you may hear the sound of a deer coughing in the mist – Douglas-Fairhurst, a fiftysomething professor of English whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/22/the-story-of-alice-robert-douglas-fairhurst-lewis-carroll-alice-liddell">studies of Lewis Carroll</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/02/the-turning-point-by-robert-douglas-fairhurst-review-sparklingly-informative">Charles Dickens</a> have won literary prizes, and who has acted as the historical consultant on, among other productions, the TV series <em>Dickensian</em> and the <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81277950">Enola Holmes</a> </em>films, gamely waves an ankle at me. “Feel my knee!” he instructs. “Go on!

<p><strong>Hope Mill theatre, Manchester<br /></strong>This improbable mashup of Philip Sidney’s Arcadia and the pioneering LA rock band has plenty of rhythm but little dramatic jeopardy</p><p>Sir Philip Sidney’s 1590 work <em>Arcadia</em>, having been picked up and picked over by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, is still furnishing the stuff of drama in the 21st century. Back in 2015, Tony-winning playwright Jeff Whitty turned this four-centuries-old pastoral romance into a jukebox musical featuring the hits of the all-female US group <a href="https://www.gogos.com/">the Go-Go’s</a> (the title is taken from one of the band’s 1984 singles), a coupling almost as improbable as the convoluted plot. After a successful premiere at the 2015 Oregon Shakespeare festival, and some shortening and sharpening from adapter James Magruder, <em>Head Over Heels</em> opened on Broadway in July 2018, where it ran for five months. Now, it makes<a href="https://hopemilltheatre.co.uk/event/head-over-heels/"> its UK debut</a>, directed and choreographed by Tom Jackson Greaves (responsible for the terrific <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/31/whistle-down-the-wind-watermill-newbury-tom-jackson-greaves-review-outstanding-production-andrew-lloyd-webber-musical">Whistle Down the Wind</a></em> at Newbury’s the Watermill last year).</p><p>The action offers many standard Renaissance romance features, including gender confusions, parental oppression, death and resurrection, but the plot lacks drive. A conservative, patriarchal Duke (Fed Zanni) visits the Delphic oracle and then tries to evade its prophecies, which, if they are fulfilled, will result in his kingdom losing its traditional “beat” (here, the music of the Go-Go’s, delivered by a stupendous live band under Arlene McNaught’s musical direction). Although a variety of intersecting love interests lead to satisfying resolutions, in terms of partnerings, realisations of sexualities and acceptance of gender fluidity, we are never in any real doubt that all will end well. Characters, while delivered with tremendous oomph by the all-singing, all-dancing cast of eight plus four-strong chorus, never face any real jeopardy – physical, psychological or emotional.</p><p><a href="https://hopemilltheatre.co.uk/event/head-over-heels/">At Hope Mill theatre, Manchester, until 4 March</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/05/head-over-heels-review-hope-mill-theatre-manchester-go-gos-philip-sidney-arcadia-musical-jeff-whitty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Attlee was a gifted manager, who showed it possible for modest politicians to be successful if they have decent ideas</p><p>Winston Churchill once described Clement Attlee as a modest man with much to be modest about – and up to a point he was right. Attlee was in many ways the epitome of bourgeois respectability: he was privately educated, had a house in the London suburbs and liked nothing better than to occupy his spare time by cracking the Times crossword or catching up on the cricket scores.</p><p>Yet in 1945, the British public chose the modest man over the wartime hero, and Attlee showed over the next six years that a politician does not have to be charismatic to be effective. A modest man turned out to be one of the few UK prime ministers of the 20th century who actually changed Britain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/05/boring-can-be-good-how-modest-clement-attlees-unflashy-ideas-changed-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Facing financial ruin, Christian Lewis, a former paratrooper, set out on a six-year, 11,000-mile trek around our entire coastline. It changed his life in more ways than he could possibly imagine</p><p>Christian Lewis is sitting in the kitchen of a family home that is not his own, having only met the owners once before, near St Peter Port, Guernsey. He needed a reliable internet connection to do this interview and the family, who have followed his journey on social media, offered him their place. This, says Lewis over Zoom, is “not the first time things like this have happened”. That’s putting it mildly.</p><p>The Lewis I speak to today is a man totally transformed from the 37-year-old who first set out to walk the entire coastline of the UK back in August 2017. Then, he was living in Swansea and was too afraid even to answer his front door. “It really was as if there was a Russian spy at the door… It was ridiculous. I’d hide behind the cupboards,” he says. A former paratrooper, Lewis had struggled on his return to “civvy street”, trudging from one cash-in-hand job to another, his mental health spiralling, while also being a single parent to his daughter, Caitlin. “I fell behind on bills, debts, God knows what else… I didn’t want to leave the house.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/05/life-on-the-edge-meet-the-man-who-walked-around-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aspiring architects are using using social media, AI and digital technology to showcase their fantastical creations to the full</p><p>“Something big is happening,” says Hamza Shaikh. “Architecture is entering a new age.” The ways in which buildings are imagined and communicated are, he argues, being transformed by a combination of social media and the ever-evolving techniques of digital drawing, to which artificial intelligence is adding new capabilities. And indeed, if it is not yet clear how blocks of flats or schools or shopping centres near you might be changed by this revolution, the energy and invention behind it are undeniable.</p><p>There is also, as Shaikh justifiably claims, a social transformation. If, in the past, aspiring architects had to claw their way up a profession that favoured those with connections and money, now anyone from anywhere can make a name for themselves, if they have the talent, determination and access to technology. They do this not by realising completed buildings, but through compelling images of imaginary architecture. They don’t all use the most advanced techniques all the time – some work by hand, some (Shaikh included) with hybrids of manual and digital – but all use the internet to spread their work and exchange ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/05/blueprints-for-a-dream-virtual-architecture-drawing-attention-architecture-in-the-age-of-social-media-hamza-shaikh-vanishing-points-roca-london-gallery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Subsidence from the world’s biggest iron ore mine threatens to swallow up the Arctic town of Kiruna. But what does its relocation mean for the local Sami reindeer herders?</p><p>In the far north of Sweden, 125 miles above the Arctic Circle, sits the church of Kiruna, once voted the most beautiful old building in the country. The cosy terracotta-coloured church, with its fairytale rooftop points, is designed to resemble a hut of the indigenous Sami people. It opened in 1912, with almost no religious symbols, and is described by the vicar, Lena Tjärnberg, as “the living room of the community”. But if Kiruna church is to stay the same, it must go.</p><p>In 2026, the entire 600-tonne wooden building will be loaded on to trailers and moved to a new spot near the local graveyard. It’s just one large – and technically tricky – piece of a project to <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/kiruna-swedish-town-relocating-white-arkitekter-04-08-2021/">move Kiruna to a new home</a>, three kilometres (1.9 miles) east of the old town. Billed as the world’s most radical relocation project, Kiruna is moving because subsidence from the local iron ore mine is threatening to swallow the town. Cracks have already appeared in the hospital; a school is no longer safe for its pupils.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/05/why-a-swedish-town-is-on-the-move-one-building-at-a-time-kirkuna-arctic-circle">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Court; Harold Pinter theatre, London</strong><br />Travis Alabanza and friends joyously return drag to its radical roots, while Aidan Turner and Jenna Coleman keep it brief in Sam Steiner’s social media allegory</p><p>Anyone who thinks theatre costumes are incidental decorations should go to <strong><a href="https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/sound-of-the-underground">Sound of the Underground</a></strong>. Anyone who thinks that drag performances are only about frocks should join them.</p><p><a href="https://travisalabanza.co.uk/">Travis Alabanza</a>’s new show, created with <a href="http://www.debbiehannan.com/">Debbie Hannan</a>, brings queer culture to the Royal Court in a glorious, multiforked parade of talent. It sets out to rescue performers from the jostling commercialism of RuPaul, the villain of the evening, and from being wheeled on to strut predictably at hen parties. It aims to celebrate the individual work – song, movement, the making up of a persona in front of an audience – that used to take place in sticky basements. It discusses difficulties, from verbal abuse to low pay. It teases the Court’s audience and parodies its stage: a bucket is sent around for money; a glossy kitchen-sink scene, styled with a “Cos-style aesthetic”, has actors snapping and pausing portentously while they make tea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/05/sound-of-the-underground-royal-court-review-travis-alabanza-lemons-lemons-lemons-play-harold-pinter-aidan-turner-jenna-coleman">Continue reading...</a>

## Let’s hear it for the dying virtue of modesty | David Mitchell

<p>From self-help books to Oscar campaigns, lots of people are telling us that self-promotion is good. Resist the boasters!</p><p>By nature, I am not a modest man. Maybe you find that easy to believe. If so, I apologise. If not, I’m ashamed to say I think that’s good. And I’m rightly ashamed to say it because saying things that are good about yourself, I was brought up to believe, is a shameful thing to do. Not very shameful, but slightly shameful. Like a crafty piss behind a wheelie bin. Rude.</p><p>I may be outwardly shy and non-confrontational but sometimes, inside, I well up with a megalomaniacal self-belief that I want to scream from the rooftops. Sometimes, as is characteristic of many professional performers, my confidence collapses and I’m inclined to tedious, consolation-seeking self-pity. But then I think up some adequate joke and my brain is immediately telling me: “There you go, Mr Amazing, you did it again!” When something I’ve done has gone well, I want everyone to know. I itch to get the knowledge of it into all of their heads. Fortunately for anyone who meets me, I understand that it is not permitted for me simply to tell them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/lets-hear-it-for-the-dying-virtue-of-modesty">Continue reading...</a>

## Simona Tabasco: ‘Lucia in The White Lotus is hungry for life’

<p>When the second season of The White Lotus opened its doors, one megawatt actor seemed to bloom before our eyes. Here, Simona Tabasco talks about coping with international adulation and why she’d still love to work on a farm</p><p>Maybe one day I’ll be a tour guide at the Vatican,” ponders Simona Tabasco, relaying an eclectic list of interests with a megawatt smile and absolute earnestness over our Zoom call. “Or work on a farm, because I love animals. Or perhaps I might go into styling, because fashion is a big passion of mine. I’d also like to be a DJ, because I love electronic music and maybe, also, um, a rock star?” Unfortunately, the world’s smallest country and the agriculture sector will have to wait, because the Italian actor is currently enjoying the most high-profile moment of her career as the breakout star of Mike White’s second season of <em>The White Lotus</em>.</p><p>For those who have yet to watch the award-winning black-comedy drama, <em>The White Lotus</em> follows the sordid and salacious private lives of several disgustingly rich Americans who are vacay-ing at the titular five-star resort in Taormina, Sicily. Joining an outstanding ensemble cast led by Jennifer Coolidge and F Murray Abraham, Tabasco plays Lucia Greco, a local sex worker who is hired by one of the arrivals (<em>The Sopranos</em>’ Michael Imperioli) to spend the week at his beck and call. When things don’t go to plan, she ends up working her way around the rooms of the salubrious hotspot with her best friend, Mia (played by Beatrice Grannò), in tow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/05/simona-tabasco-lucia-in-the-white-lotus-is-hungry-for-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steps to change an unfair landscape include ending right to buy, taxing residential property at today’s prices and building vital social housing</p><p>“Housing policy is killing British civilisation,” said my interlocutor. “Right to buy has been a social catastrophe, making today’s generation pay for the earlier generation’s bonanza of buying their council house on the cheap – the stock has collapsed because the homes were not replaced. There is too little or no <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingpurchaseaffordabilitygreatbritain/2021">affordable housing</a> or rents in great parts of the country where young people can start or bring up a family.</p><p>“It is already hitting the <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/birth-rate">birthrate</a>. Forget building a quarter of a million houses a year rising to 300,000: it is not going to happen with the new planning rules that enthrone the nimbys.

## Sarah Parish: ‘I do get cast as a lot of killers​, a lot of tough women​’

<p>The actor from Industry, W1A and Mistresses on her return to the theatre, her habit of breaking bones and seeing her husband as Prince Andrew</p><p>Sarah Parish is known for her TV roles, often playing formidable, sometimes chilling, women. In recent times, she has been the titular antihero of ITV’s <em>Bancroft</em>, as well as making smaller, eye-catching turns in <em>W1A</em>, <em>Industry</em> and the Netflix hit <em>Stay Close</em>. Next up, after a long break, Parish returns to the theatre, starring in <em>Trouble in Butetown</em> at the Donmar Warehouse as Gwyneth, the landlady of an illegal boarding house in Cardiff during the second world war. Parish is married to the actor James Murray and they have a daughter.</p><p><em><strong>Trouble in Butetown</strong></em><strong> is a new play by </strong><strong>Nigerian-British</strong><strong> playwright </strong><strong>Diana Nneka Atuona</strong><strong>. Why did you want to do it?<br /></strong>Well, I’ve got a real thing about new writing. I’m asked to do plays quite a lot and I don’t really have a desire to do stage work that is done over and over again. It’s just something that has never floated my boat. But new writing and creating characters that have never been seen or heard before, I find that really fascinating. And when you get to my age, there’s still lots of parts there, but they are maybe not as challenging. So to go on stage and go: “Oh, thank God, this is really stretching me”, that’s what you need as an actor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/05/actor-sarah-parish-i-do-get-cast-as-a-lot-of-killers">Continue reading...</a>

I hold in my hand a drill, a screw and a wall plug. My son has brought his own toy tool set with him, too, and has been sawing the bed, the floor and my legs to help. If he were really trying to ape my technique he would have brought a toy phone, for I have prepared for this task by watching YouTube. Specifically, videos designed for people who, like me, have spent their lives avoiding basic DIY as if it were illegal.</p><p>These YouTubers are real men. Manly men. Men who, thankfully, speak to me about basic DIY in that affectionate tone you might use if you found an unaccompanied child weeping in a shopping centre. ‘Let’s get this wall drilled, shall we?’ they chuckle, as I dab my face with a rapidly dampening sleeve, ‘Come on now, no tears, we’ll get this all sorted out together!’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/05/putting-up-a-shelf-how-hard-can-that-be">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The psychotherapist’s seven case studies show the role of longing in women’s lives and the two-way connection between analyst and patient</p><p>Sigmund Freud famously asked “What does a woman want?” and the question has been posed repeatedly across every medium ever since. Now Maxine Mei-Fung Chung re-examines it in the context of 21st-century women’s lives in her new book, a distillation of 15 years’ work as a psychotherapist.</p><p>Memoirs lifting the lid on the therapeutic process from the analyst’s perspective have become popular in recent years, with Lori Gottlieb’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone-9781911617044">Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</a></em> and Philippa Perry’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/couch-fiction-9780241461785">Couch Fiction</a></em> the outstanding examples, demystifying with candour and humour a profession that is still regarded with suspicion by some, humanising the perception of the therapist and providing a useful counterpoint to more familiar narratives of mental illness written by those on the couch. <em>What Women Want</em> is firmly in this tradition, but it is most obviously aimed at the readership that flocked to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/lisa-taddeo-three-women-i-wanted-explore-desire-not-sex">Lisa Taddeo</a>’s 2019 hit<a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/three-women-9781526611642"> </a><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/three-women-9781526611642">Three Women</a></em>. Where Taddeo approached her subjects as an investigative journalist, embedding and living alongside them for extended periods, Chung’s studies are more analytical, informed by the necessary boundaries imposed by her role and her professional detachment – although, as she explores throughout the book, cool objectivity is not always possible or desirable in a therapist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/05/what-women-want-by-maxine-mei-fung-chung-review-the-depths-of-desire-power-love-growth">Continue reading...</a>

He died two days later <a href="https://www.inquest.org.uk/alex-malcolm-concludes">of his injuries</a>. His murderer, Marvyn Iheanacho, had been released from prison on licence just six months earlier, after serving a sentence for assaulting a woman.</p><p>Alex’s murder was preventable. Iheanacho was under the supervision of the probation service and should have been earmarked as high risk. Yet Alex’s mother, Liliya Breha, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/02/no-warning-of-killers-violent-history-mother-tells-inquest">unaware</a> of his past convictions, his licence conditions and the fact that he posed a serious risk to women and children. An inquest jury later found that probation service failings contributed to Alex’s killing. His mother said at the time: “I would really like to say that Alex didn’t have to die for system failures to be identified… I now hope changes will be made.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/what-will-it-take-to-stop-the-and-of-women-by-men-on-probation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shows such as Milf Manor have pushed the reality TV format to the absolute brink. But what does the return of the Milf tell us about women and sexuality?</p><p><em>Milf Manor</em> is the house that Freud built. Eight women aged between 40 and 60 arrived at this beachside villa in Mexico to film a dating show, somehow missing the twist: the lineup of young men they’d be in the villa with would include… their sons. The show premiered in the US last week, and I have screamed hoarsely through every video I can find, shouting, “I HATE IT I HATE IT OK ONE MORE CLIP I HATE IT!” into my arm.</p><p>You know how <em>Big Brother</em> and its fellow reality shows used to claim they were sociological experiments in order to obscure the fact they were actually fabulously exploitative telly? Well – this is the opposite. <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/18/milf-manor-dating-show-tlc">Milf Manor</a></em> calls itself a dating show – a cross between <em>Love Island</em> and the porn history your spam folder warns you about – but, in fact, it really is that sociological experiment.

<p>The director of disturbing documentary Leaving Neverland, which featured two of the singer’s young victims, says the forthcoming film about the star sends out an unacceptable message</p><p>It has been four years since the first public screening of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/06/leaving-neverland-review-michael-jackson-documentary">Leaving Neverland</a></em> to a shocked, tearful American audience in a packed 266-seat venue at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundance-2019">2019 Sundance film festival</a>. The four-hour documentary, co-produced by Channel 4 and HBO, is a brutally frank and explicit account of two abusive relationships that the King of Pop, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson">Michael Jackson</a>, had with children: one with Wade Robson describes how the boy was just seven when the entertainer first raped him, and an earlier one with James Safechuck, who was all of 10 years old when it began. The film’s spine consists of searingly candid interviews with Robson and Safechuck and their mothers. The <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/25/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland">Guardian</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/25/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland"> reported</a>: “After the film ended, an ashen-faced crowd rose to their feet to applaud Wade and James, who arrived on stage, both visibly moved by the response.”</p><p>What had motivated me – and Robson and Safechuck even more so – to embark on making <em>Leaving Neverland</em> was not just the opportunity to expose Jackson by having his victims speak on camera for the first time. Here was an opportunity to bring to the widest possible audience an insight into how children fall victim to any sexual abuser, the psychology of the predator and, above all, the grooming process. Maybe we could help prevent young children from falling prey to this most scarring, crippling of crimes. Of course the fact that the child molester in this case was one of the world’s most famous men meant that a lot of people would watch. Setting fire to Jackson’s reputation, already charred around the edges by multiple allegations and payments of hush money, was not the primary goal of the documentary. But it seemed like a necessary collateral impact: if you know that your idol has abused children, should that not make celebrating his personality a little more problematic, to say the least?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/this-new-michael-jackson-biopic-will-glorify-a-man-who-abused-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A circus donkey embarks on a long, lonely journey, meeting human kindness and cruelty, in this strangely beautiful Oscar contender</p><p>By far the most intriguing category at the 95th<sup> </sup>Academy Awards is that of best international feature. While German director Edward Berger’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/15/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-review-extraordinarily-potent-german-first-world-war-drama">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></em> seems an obvious pack leader (it’s up for nine awards – including best picture), there’s buzz around Colm Bairéad’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/14/the-quiet-girl-review-colm-bairead-catherine-clinch-exquisite-irish-language-drama">The Quiet Girl</a></em> (the first Irish feature to be nominated in this category), and enthusiastic support for Santiago Mitre’s historical drama <em>Argentina, 1985</em>. But the dark horse – or rather donkey – is <em>EO</em>, the strangely wonderful Polish entry from veteran director Jerzy Skolimowski, inspired by Robert Bresson’s 1966 French masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2418-sight-sound-poll-2012-au-hasard-balthazar">Au hasard Balthazar</a></em><em>.</em></p><p>“This film was made out of our love for animals and nature,” says a closing intertitle, reassuring viewers that “the animals’ wellbeing on set was always our first priority”. That’s good to know, because the world through which the titular donkey travels includes its fair share of violent encounters with bestial humans. There are the football hooligans who beat him because they believe his braying lost them a game; there’s the furrier who snaps caged foxes’ necks and gets a hoof in the face for his troubles; there’s the illegal flesh-trader who sells EO for salami; and the donkey’s unexpected friend who confesses that he’s eaten “hundreds of kilograms of meat”, <em>including</em> donkey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/05/eo-review-circus-donkey-drama-veteran-polish-director-jerzy-skolimowski-strangely-beautiful-oscar-contender">Continue reading...</a>

She then built another career working with survivors of domestic violence, before setting up a climate emergency centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.</p><p>The 100 days that she spent in prison last year do not seem to have been as shocking an interruption to her life as one might have expected. “You have to remember that I chose to do the actions that led to prison.

<p>Three years on, Bregret hits home in Britain.

<p>Away from the tourist hotspots, this popular Aegean island still has plenty of magic</p><p>Lunchtime in Apollona, a small village situated in the khaki-tinged hinterland of Rhodes, and all is quiet – save for one terrace set on a small side road above the houses. Here, a mix of locals and visitors sit around wooden tables, on which half-drunk carafes of wine, platters of roasted meats and feta-freckled salads are placed next to bowls of homemade bread. Between the tables, a stout man in an apron bustles around, explaining dishes, telling stories and pouring the wine he sources from friends’ vineyards on the island. This is Giannis, owner and creator of the taverna, <a href="http://www.paraga-apollona.gr/en/restaurant.php">Paraga</a>, and a man consumed by a passion for the rich foodie heritage of Rhodes.</p><p>Lunch begins with three types of bread and an aubergine dip thick with sesame and yoghurt. Many of Paraga’s recipes have been handed down through the generations. Our main course, a rich beef stifado, has been cooked in clay since the morning, giving Giannis a wonderfully theatrical moment of gently cracking open the ceramic pot to reveal an unctuous stew, served alongside succulent, stock-soaked potatoes. We eat gluttonously, gazing out over the lush green hills, holm oaks and Italian cypress popping up between the silvery-grey olive groves and spindly vineyard lines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/05/rhodes-greece-finding-peace-on-the-greek-island">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Published in the UK for the first time, the Empire of Pain author’s tireless investigation of human trafficking from China to the US reveals the desperation of the migrants and the woman at the heart of it</p><p>In 1993, a cargo ship called the Golden Venture ran aground on a sandbar off the Rockaway Peninsula in New York. The ship, which had set off four months earlier from Bangkok, had stopped in Kenya and rounded the Cape of Good Hope to reach America. It carried a desperate cargo: 286 undocumented people from Fuzhou in China, who had made the voyage in the clothes they stood up in, without any kind of adequate sanitation on board, and little food or water. With the ship stranded offshore, most of the migrants, stick-thin and delirious, jumped into the freezing sea – it was 2am – to try to reach the promised land, the lights of Coney Island visible across the bay. Ten people drowned, the rest were picked up by the quickly scrambled authorities on the beach to be held in various prisons, some for four years, while they sought asylum. About half were eventually deported.</p><p>The <em>New Yorker</em> investigative journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/16/patrick-radden-keefe-empire-of-pain-opioids-sacklers-scorpions">Patrick Radden Keefe</a> used that tragedy as the embarkation point for his landmark “deep dive” into the criminal underworld that brought – and brings – vast numbers of Chinese people to the US. The going rate at the time of the Golden Venture tragedy was about $18,000, paid to people smugglers or “snakeheads”. At the heart of this trade was a woman, Sister Ping (real name Cheng Chui Ping), who ran a shop, the Tak Shun variety store, in Manhattan’s Chinatown. Sister Ping, who had grown up during the Cultural Revolution and first come to New York to work as a nanny, was responsible for bringing at least 3,000 people from Fuzhou to America, making herself a fortune of $40m. When she was eventually apprehended by the FBI in the millennium year, she was described as perhaps “the most successful alien smuggler of all time”. It was Sister Ping who, a rival gang leader and FBI informant alleged, commissioned the Golden Venture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/05/the-snakehead-review-by-patrick-radden-keefe-review-through-hell-and-high-water">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The forced installation of costly prepayment meters must be stopped. Give low-income consumers a proper safety net instead</p><p>The poverty premium was a term coined decades ago to describe the grim reality that people living on the edge often end up paying some of the highest prices for essential goods and services. And nowhere is that gap more evident than in the energy market, where low-income households are far more likely to be on the prepayment meters that mean they end up with <a href="https://www.nea.org.uk/publications/uk-fuel-poverty-monitor-2021-22/">higher energy costs</a> than their more affluent neighbours: a longstanding injustice that has never been addressed by government. Last week, an undercover <em>Times</em> investigation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/02/energy-regulator-launches-british-gas-investigation-over-prepayment-meters">revealed the appalling practices</a> being used by British Gas to forcibly install these meters in the homes of vulnerable people.</p><p>No vulnerable household should be forced to move on to a prepayment meter. These meters cause two kinds of detriment to low-income households. Energy costs more per unit than paying by direct debit, in part because of the relatively high daily standing charge. Additionally, any debt a customer owes an energy company is added as a surcharge on the per-unit cost, pushing up the effective per-unit outlay even further. If a customer cannot pay, their energy is cut off. But the daily standing charge continues to accrue and their power won’t be turned back on until this accrued charge is paid off. And this at a time when the global energy sector is raking in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64489147">record profits</a> as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/the-observer-view-on-the-shameful-premium-that-the-poorest-pay-for-their-energy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What was life really like in the Soviet capital? The Observer found out</p><p>On the eve of the Moscow Olympics, the <em>Observer Magazine</em> (5 July 1980) visited ‘the city Margaret Thatcher doesn’t want our athletes to see’ to discover what Moscow life was really like. ‘It is easy to conclude that all Russians going impassively about their business must be some sort of automatons,’ the dossier mused. ‘The clues to the hearts of these disciplined and watched-over people are rare, and consequently startling and precious when one discovers them.’</p><p>Writers peered behind that facade through reports, interviews and chance encounters, accompanied by ‘endless toasts to greater understanding’. Fresh from a seven-encore recital, the Bolshoi’s star bass Yevgeni Nesterenko held court in his riverfront pad, offering vodka, snacks and anecdotes. A trip accompanying a local reporter to a bread plant that had exceeded its target production quota expanded into an exploration of the workings and editorial policy of the Moscow press.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/05/a-visit-to-moscow-on-the-eve-of-the-olympics-1980">Continue reading...</a>

A nugget of liquorice, covered in flavoured chocolate and sometimes further armoured with a crisp candy shell.

I’ve tried counselling, but counsellors seem overwhelmed by the sheer scale of my problem and have nothing useful to say.</em></p><p><em>I started a new job a few weeks ago. A male colleague made sexual advances towards me. I tolerated this because I assumed he was a lonely older gay man and I felt sorry for him. Subsequently, I discovered he was in fact a married straight man and his cohort had been secretly filming my reaction to his advances and then sharing this around the office.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/05/why-wont-men-stop-bullying-me">Continue reading...</a>

## American wine isn’t all about California

<p>The Golden State accounts for four out of every five bottles of wine that comes out of the US – but that doesn’t always make it the best</p><p><strong>Forge Cellars Dry Riesling Finger Lakes, New York, USA 2018 (£24.99, or £17.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, <a href="http://majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>When people talk about wine from the United States, what they generally mean is wine from California. And given that the Golden State accounts for some 81% of all US wine production (which, incidentally, makes it the fourth-largest wine producer in the world after Italy, France and Spain), that’s not at all surprising. But wine is made in every state in the union, and there is much of interest to be found there, especially in the four states (Washington State, Oregon, New York state and Virginia) which account for the lion’s share of the fifth of US production not taken up by California. The wines of New York State, for example, could not be more different from their peers on the other side of the continent, with Forge Cellars’ startling dry riesling, with its flash of fine-steel-blade acidity and burst of apple and pear, one of the best versions of this variety you’ll find anywhere.</p><p><strong>Domaine Drouhin Arthur Chardonnay Dundee Hills Willamette Valley 2020 (£27, <a href="http://hic-winemerchants.com/">hic-winemerchants.com</a>) </strong>With its long, cold winters, and short summers, The Finger Lakes region is very much a cool-climate zone, with the moderating effect of the titular lakes the crucial factor in making wine production viable at all. Seneca Lake seems to be a particularly good site, home to both the Forge Cellars Riesling and another of my favourite New York Rieslings, made by Hermann J Wiener. Forge is also notable for being the work of a leading French winemaker, the Rhône Valley maestro Louis Barruol, which links it to one of my favourite wines from a recent tasting of Chardonnays from another exciting US winemaking state, Oregon. Made by the US outpost of one of Burgundy’s most famous names, the Drouhin family, who started out in the maritime climate of the Pacific NorthWest in the 1980s, the stylish, creamy, luminous and perfectly balanced Arthur Chardonnay is a stylistic cousin to the great Chardonnays the Drouhins make back home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/05/american-wine-isnt-all-about-california">Continue reading...</a>
