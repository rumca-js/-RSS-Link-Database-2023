  <p id="HwoUC2">Elon Musk says Twitter will let bots providing “good content” access the Twitter API for free. As noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1622082025166442505?s=20&amp;t=XMiz3fSEEt9UKwVcx1C4zw">post on Twitter</a>, Musk announced that the platform will enable a “light, write-only” API for eligible bots — a partial reversal of his policy that puts API access behind a paywall.</p>
<p id="SCMSHR">After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562947/twitter-third-party-client-tweetbot-twitterific-ban-rules">shutting down third-party clients</a>, like Tweetbot and Twitterrific, Twitter announced last week that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/2/23582615/twitter-removing-free-api-developer-apps-price-announcement">developers will need to sign up for a “paid basic tier”</a> to access Twitter’s API starting on February 9th. At the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621259936524300289?s=20&amp;t=sZg1ZZlNZrzeOAuIeKkIhw">Musk justified</a> the move by saying that the free API is “being abused” by bot scammers and spammers, adding that an around $100 per month subscription “with ID verification” can “clean things up greatly.” </p>

  <p id="fpmtbI">Apple’s exploring the possibility of launching a more expensive iPhone “Ultra” above the iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-02-05/is-an-iphone-ultra-or-iphone-fold-coming-from-apple-ceo-remarks-offer-clues-ldrhx53a">according to Apple tracker Mark Gurman</a>. The high-end device could arrive as soon as 2024 with the iPhone 16 lineup.</p>
<p id="CIWvCc">Last September, Gurman predicted that an “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/25/23371160/iphone-15-ultra-replace-pro-max-apple-rumors-usb-c">Ultra” model could replace the Pro Max branding</a> with this year’s iPhone 15, but his latest theory suggests that Apple wants to establish a more powerful — and more expensive — tier of iPhones. That means the device could have an even higher price tag than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23351948/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a>, which starts at $1,099.</p>
<p id="IlS0wJ">During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/2/23583244/apple-iphone-14-q1-2023-earnings-pro-shortage-mac">Apple’s earnings call last week</a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook didn’t rule out the possibility of a future price increase on iPhones. He instead indicated that customers...</p>

<p>The newest SmartThings hub can also charge your smartphone and find your keys — plus it’s a Matter controller and Thread border router. But there’s no support for Z-Wave, and too many features are only for Galaxy phones.</p>
