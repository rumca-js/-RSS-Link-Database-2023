<p>Parliament’s first sitting week begins after a summer of debate about the Indigenous voice, gas, Medicare and capitalism. Follow the day’s news live</p><p>At the same time, <strong>Tony Burke</strong> was speaking to <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> on ABC radio RN about the referendum machineries legislation which has to go through the parliament to enable the voice vote.</p><p><strong>Burke:</strong></p><p>So the machinery, there’s two different bits that have to go through the parliament. The first is updating the referendum laws themselves. That’s been introduced to the parliament. There’s a committee that’s looking at it now. And so it’s sort of sitting in the House of Representatives issued report in the next couple of weeks and, and then the mission that part of it will go through, then you deal with the second bill a bit later in the year. So in the probably the second quarter of the year. And that’s the bill that has the question, and the specific word for word changes that would go into the constitution, that one has to be passed by an absolute majority of each house of the parliament. And once that’s happened, then the deadlines as to when the vote will happen are all locked in.</p><p>I gotta say, I can’t think of any referendum proposal where there has been more process than this.</p><p>Let’s go back to first principles. What is the Voice? The Voice is constitutional recognition of our First Nations people to ensure they have a say. I think it’s a pretty good thing for people to have a say in matters that affect them. It’s one of the ways that we can ensure we improve not only our nation, but also the aspirations and opportunities for our First Nations peoples. I was really pleased to see, while I was away, that all First Ministers, Liberal and Labor, have backed in the Voice. It shows what you can do when you take the politics out of it.</p><p>I think the Voice will have a say in matters that affect First Nations people. But I think the point here is - why are some people so concerned about that?</p><p>Well, do you think people having a say is a problem, Michael? (the host)</p><p>That’s the implication in your question. I mean, we have years of disadvantage, years of... ..so many broken hopes. And we can be so much stronger as a nation. We can become much more unified. And the First Ministers, Premiers and Chief Ministers have demonstrated that. We want to walk down this path together. It’s not about “gotcha” moments. It’s not about tricky questions and answers. It’s about the nation coming together and saying, “Yes, we will take the outstretched hand which is the Uluru Statement from the Heart.” “We will recognise our First Nations people. We will give them a say. And we will work through the detail of that together.” And that’s a good thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/06/australia-politics-live-parliament-voice-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-question-time-budget-cost-of-living-power-gas-prices-vic-nsw-qld">Continue reading...</a>

LGBTI+ people are still regarded as criminals, and women over there still really face strict restrictions of their rights. And that’s notwithstanding the progressions that have been made as well. It just sat really uncomfortably when it was announced.</p><p>Those decisions then become the athletes. The athletes become the face of those decisions, and it’s really challenging when you don’t have full transparency over why these decisions are made and what has actually gone into the thought process behind this.</p><p>It’s putting a lot of pressure on the players. So I think it would be welcomed if they would sit down and have the discussions with the players so they can fully understand and ask questions as to why this needs to happen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/05/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-referendum-megan-davis-us-china-balloon-incident-womens-world-cup-saudi-sponsorship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Doctors, paramedics and nurses explain the stress and anxiety of working in a system that has reached breaking point</p><p>“Frustration with the system was why I went off in the end,” said Conor Calby, 26, a paramedic and Unison rep in southwest England, who was recently off work for a month with burnout. “I felt like I couldn’t do my job and was letting patients down. After a difficult few years it was challenging.”</p><p>While he usually manages to keep a distinct divide between work and home life, burnout eroded that line. He also lost his sleep pattern and appetite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/05/why-so-many-nhs-staff-are-off-sick-with-burnout">Continue reading...</a>
