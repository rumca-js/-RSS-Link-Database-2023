In general I'm a big advocate of child-proofing.  The less they can
get hurt with or mess up, the more you can relax, let your guard down,
go longer without looking over to see how they're doing, and focus on
other things.  On the other hand, some things (cords, trash cans) are
difficult or inconvenient to remove from otherwise pretty
child-proofed areas.  With these we've had good success teaching
simple boundaries, even with young kids.

With all three kids one of the first rules we taught was "cords are
no".  I would be very careful to teach a clear
and <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/predictable-parenting">consistent</a> boundary: just
having your hand near a cord, brushing a cord while you were clearly
going for something else, looking intently at cords, those were all
fine.  It was only reaching out to grab one that got a firm "cords are
no" and separating them from the cord.

I don't have notes on when we started this with Lily or Anna, but with
Nora it was just about when she turned 13m.  Pretty quickly she got
~90% of the way there: I could let her play on the floor near my very
cordy <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/news/jammer">music setup</a> and she would leave them
alone, though if she was bored and the only things around were cords
she might still go for them.  By 15m (~7w after starting to teach) I
rarely needed to intervene.

Cords: no.</i>

Similarly, when she was ~14m she had been carrying things over to the
bathtub and dropping them in.  While not a safety issue, this isn't
good for things that should stay dry.  I decided to work with her on
stopping: following her closely, and then when she was about to drop
something in stopping her and firmly saying "no".  I only had to do
this twice before she went from doing this several times a day to
almost never.  A few more naturally spaced repetitions when she tried
again a few weeks or months later and the boundary is clear.  I still
wouldn't hand her phone if the tub was full, but this isn't something
she does anymore.

Other things we've taught this way with the older two have included
<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/street-training">street safety</a>, not putting random
things in the trash, not taking things out of the trash, not putting
plastic bags on your head, "not food" for small objects, and staying
out of our housemate's room.  When I started drafting this post at 15m
Nora was mostly not ready for these, though we had started working on
streets and trash cans.  At 19m she's good at not going into the
street except we have to be careful at corners, she leaves the trash
alone, and a "not food" on any individual small food-ambiguous object
(ex: dry beans, food that fell on the floor a while ago and was
missed) works well.  Haven't started on plastic bags yet: we still
keep those out of her environment.  It seems to generally go best to
introduce these one by one, and to have a clear idea in your head of
the boundary you're teaching.

</p>

Unfortunately, this post makes crummy parenting advice because I think
we may have atypically rule-oriented kids that this is an unusually
good fit for.  If this seems like something that might work for you
and your kid, perhaps try it with a single rule, give it a few weeks
of careful enforcement, and drop it for now if it seems like they're
not getting it?
