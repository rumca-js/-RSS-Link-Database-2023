Follow the day\u2019s news live</p><p>At the same time, <strong>Tony Burke</strong> was speaking to <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> on ABC radio RN about the referendum machineries legislation which has to go through the parliament to enable the voice vote.</p><p><strong>Burke:</strong></p><p>So the machinery, there\u2019s two different bits that have to go through the parliament. The first is updating the referendum laws themselves. That\u2019s been introduced to the parliament. There\u2019s a committee that\u2019s looking at it now. And so it\u2019s sort of sitting in the House of Representatives issued report in the next couple of weeks and, and then the mission that part of it will go through, then you deal with the second bill a bit later in the year. So in the probably the second quarter of the year. And that\u2019s the bill that has the question, and the specific word for word changes that would go into the constitution, that one has to be passed by an absolute majority of each house of the parliament. And once that\u2019s happened, then the deadlines as to when the vote will happen are all locked in.</p><p>I gotta say, I can\u2019t think of any referendum proposal where there has been more process than this.</p><p>Let\u2019s go back to first principles. What is the Voice? The Voice is constitutional recognition of our First Nations people to ensure they have a say. I think it\u2019s a pretty good thing for people to have a say in matters that affect them. It\u2019s one of the ways that we can ensure we improve not only our nation, but also the aspirations and opportunities for our First Nations peoples. I was really pleased to see, while I was away, that all First Ministers, Liberal and Labor, have backed in the Voice. It shows what you can do when you take the politics out of it.</p><p>I think the Voice will have a say in matters that affect First Nations people. But I think the point here is - why are some people so concerned about that?</p><p>Well, do you think people having a say is a problem, Michael? (the host)</p><p>That\u2019s the implication in your question. I mean, we have years of disadvantage, years of... ..so many broken hopes. And we can be so much stronger as a nation. We can become much more unified. And the First Ministers, Premiers and Chief Ministers have demonstrated that. We want to walk down this path together. It\u2019s not about \u201cgotcha\u201d moments. It\u2019s not about tricky questions and answers. It\u2019s about the nation coming together and saying, \u201cYes, we will take the outstretched hand which is the Uluru Statement from the Heart.\u201d \u201cWe will recognise our First Nations people. We will give them a say. And we will work through the detail of that together.\u201d And that\u2019s a good thing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/06/australia-politics-live-parliament-voice-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-question-time-budget-cost-of-living-power-gas-prices-vic-nsw-qld\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/06/all-pokies-in-nsw-to-go-cashless-to-tackle-problem-gambling-under-new-coalition-plan", "title": "All pokies in NSW to go cashless to tackle problem gambling under new Coalition plan", "date_published": "2023-02-05 20:13:58+00:00", "description": "<p>Premier Dominic Perrottet has been under pressure to announce gambling industry reform as election looms</p><ul><li><strong>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></strong></li></ul><p>Every poker machine in New South Wales will be cashless within five years under an ambitious plan to overhaul the gaming industry.</p><p>The contentious package passed a snap meeting of state cabinet on Sunday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/06/all-pokies-in-nsw-to-go-cashless-to-tackle-problem-gambling-under-new-coalition-plan\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/05/us-candy-pioneer-bob-born-dies", "title": "Rest in Peeps: US candy pioneer Bob Born dies at 98", "date_published": "2023-02-05 18:50:06+00:00", "description": "<p>Pennsylvania confectioner worked out how to mass produce marshmallow Easter treat that now sells billions each year</p><p>Bob Born, the man who turned Peeps candy into an American phenomenon, has died.

to the ABC this morning about the recently announced sponsorship of Fifa\u2019s women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand by the Saudi\u2019s.</p><p>Players have been expressing shock and frustration over the potential sponsorship deal, saying they have largely been left out over the decision to take the money.</p><p>When you look at the surface, you can see that it is a blatant disregard of their human rights treatment when you look at the country itself. LGBTI+ people are still regarded as criminals, and women over there still really face strict restrictions of their rights. And that\u2019s notwithstanding the progressions that have been made as well. It just sat really uncomfortably when it was announced.</p><p>Those decisions then become the athletes. The athletes become the face of those decisions, and it\u2019s really challenging when you don\u2019t have full transparency over why these decisions are made and what has actually gone into the thought process behind this.</p><p>It\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on the players. So I think it would be welcomed if they would sit down and have the discussions with the players so they can fully understand and ask questions as to why this needs to happen.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/05/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-referendum-megan-davis-us-china-balloon-incident-womens-world-cup-saudi-sponsorship\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/05/why-so-many-nhs-staff-are-off-sick-with-burnout", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s soul destroying\u2019: why so many NHS staff are off sick with burnout", "date_published": "2023-02-05 07:00:15+00:00", "description": "<p>Doctors, paramedics and nurses explain the stress and anxiety of working in a system that has reached breaking point</p><p>\u201cFrustration with the system was why I went off in the end,\u201d said Conor Calby, 26, a paramedic and Unison rep in southwest England, who was recently off work for a month with burnout. \u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t do my job and was letting patients down.
