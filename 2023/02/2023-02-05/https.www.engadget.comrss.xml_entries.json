According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/rivian-ceo-tells-staff-ev-maker-is-developing-an-electric-bike?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, CEO RJ Scaringe told Rivian employees of the project during a company-wide meeting the automaker held on Friday. He said the startup had a \u201csmall group\u201d of engineers working on a bike.</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em> couldn\u2019t confirm if Scaringe was referring to an electric motorcycle or bicycle, but the outlet notes Rivian has patents for cycling components and designs. In the past, Scaringe has said Rivian wants to expand into the micromobility market eventually. Rivian did not immediately respond to Engadget\u2019s comment request.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The news that Rivian could be working on an e-bike comes in the same week that the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rivian-layoffs-184047174.html\"><ins>announced layoffs</ins></a> that would affect six percent of its workforce. The cuts represent the second major restructuring Rivian has undertaken in less than a year. The company said the move was an effort to refocus itself on scaling production of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html\">R1T</a> and R1S EVs and, in turn, put Rivian on the path to long-term profitability. On Friday, Scaringe reportedly told employees Rivian had spread itself thin by trying to do too much at once.</p><p>Attempting to expand into the e-bike market when the company has yet to make a profit might not make much sense, but there\u2019s a compelling reason for Rivian to pursue that strategy. Even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/electric-bicycle-scooter-market-popularity-sales-coronavirus-2020-150041480.html\"><ins>before the pandemic</ins></a>, the cycling market was growing thanks to the popularity of e-bikes. In fact, electric bikes have consistently outsold electric cars and trucks. It\u2019s no surprise since they\u2019re significantly cheaper to produce and thereby cost less for consumers to buy. A bike then could be what Rivian needs to become profitable sooner.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazons-2022-kindle-drops-to-a-record-low-of-75-211908974.html?src=rss", "title": "Amazon\u2019s 2022 Kindle drops to a record low of $75", "date_published": "2023-02-05 21:19:08+00:00", "description": "<p>If one of your goals for 2023 is to read more, a new <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlTV1c1ODNKP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWpuLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjZTJkODY1Mi05MmIxLTQ4N2QtYWUwZC02OWY4YzUwN2E0MDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYW_URjstt3ViL7e-EtnJGAMJabvekjHaYevI7tw0KT0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09SWW583J\">Kindle</a> might inspire you to stick to that intention.

The new Kindle features a 300 ppi e-ink screen, making its display as dense as the one on the more expensive Kindle Paperwhite. Amazon also doubled the amount of storage to 16GB, added USB-C charging and made the Kindle\u2019s frame lighter. Oh, and the new model also features up to six weeks of battery life, another upgrade over its predecessor. Unless you\u2019re specifically looking for an e-reader with a larger display, most people are better off buying the entry-level Kindle over its more expensive siblings.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spacex-will-attempt-starship-orbital-test-in-march-says-elon-musk-195410384.html?src=rss", "title": "SpaceX will attempt Starship orbital test in March, says Elon Musk", "date_published": "2023-02-05 19:54:10+00:00", "description": "<p>SpaceX could attempt to complete Starship\u2019s long-awaited orbital test flight as early as next month, according to Elon Musk.
