The question is, how is AI going to reshape the Web?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All computer interaction will be mediated with an agent helping them,&rdquo; Nadella claims. And he said it will begin with search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft executives said search has remained fundamentally the same as twenty years ago. It works well for factual queries, but stumbles when asked to make recommendations. Microsoft plans to have a new Bing search and Bing browser use chat technology to answer questions posed by users. Corporate vice president Yusuf Mehdi said that Bing will incorporate a powerful new GPT model called Prometheus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Bing home page chat\" class=\"wp-image-1505937\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230207_102633.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing&rsquo;s home page will now accommodate 1,000-character entries, and list both a traditional list of search results as well as an AI-powered conversational list of results down the right-hand column of the page. Microsoft will also implement a chat experience, where it will provide a list of recommendations or responses within a chat interface, too. Mehdi showed the chat model working for television recommendations, a travel itinerary, and a 90s trivial game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The new Bing is live today in limited preview,&rdquo; Mehdi said, and will expand to &ldquo;millions of people in the coming weeks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft has also implemented mitigation layers that will add filters, parsing queries to identify and defend against queries that will be may be potentially harmful, such as a potential attack on a real-world location.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Bing AI chat\" class=\"wp-image-1505938\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230207_101905.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AI chat is also being implemented inside a new version of the Microsoft Edge browser as a sidebar experience.

In January, <em>The Information</em>&nbsp;reported that an AI-powered Bing could be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446692/report-microsoft-is-making-bing-its-next-ai-app.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released as early as March</a>, with ChatGPT or a related technology powering Office, too. This was shortly before Microsoft&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481398/chatgpt-may-charge-42-mo-for-a-paid-tier-as-microsoft-invests-again.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">invested an undisclosed amount of money into OpenAI</a>, though reportedly the figure totals $10 billion over a ten-year period. Microsoft had already invested $1 billion into OpenAI before that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief executive Satya Nadella had previously told investors that Microsoft planned to lead in the &ldquo;age of AI,&rdquo; and deploy GPT technology across its product line. Leaks of what Microsoft referred to as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1503274/microsoft-may-be-readying-bings-ai-chatbot.html\">the new Bing</a>&rdquo; appeared to in the wild for a short time earlier this month.

You&rsquo;ve got just seven days to try out most of them &mdash; it&rsquo;s literally impossible for one gamer to get through them all. But in the spirit of exploration, we&rsquo;ve combed through the absolutely massive list of demos and picked out a few that you might want to try.

But with a cute-as-a-button art style and ten different player characters to try, it might just be the next big hit. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168260/Pirates_Of_Pangea__Land__Sea_Survival/&amp;xcust=2-1-1505634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pirates of Pangea</a> </em></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Pirates of Pangea screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-1505807\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ss_cff5026694693bd7c2706aa6c21c8cf4302ec934.1920x1080.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Pangea Game Studios</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that bit in the last <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> movie where they throw a ship in a bottle into the ocean and it turns full size? That&rsquo;s kind of the vibe here. Build your ship, explore the magic-infused ocean, craft for new supplies, fight on land and sea, and unfold a mystery in the Bermuda Triangle. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140100/Whisker_Squadron_Survivor/&amp;xcust=2-1-1505634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Whisker Squadron: Survivor</a></em></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Whisker Squadron Survivor screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-1505812\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ss_5a9444fd5bf4c7542517d89524b382f0808bbc6a.1920x1080.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Flippfly LLC</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This game isn&rsquo;t trying to hide its <em>Starfox</em> inspiration, with a bunch of anthropomorphic cats piloting spaceships through a Windows Media Player visualizer. The Death Star trench you run through is endless, as are the enemies that populate it, so prepare for some roguelite runs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1482600/Dark_Tree/&amp;xcust=2-1-1505634-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Tree</a></em></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dark Tree screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-1505817\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ss_eec8eeffef8591fa3abfec6cb64a73769d752ead.1920x1080.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">A17 Studio</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a long wait for <em><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431277/hades-ii-will-resurrect-one-of-the-best-roguelikes-ever.html\">Hades II</a></em>, so in the meantime give this one a try. <em>Dark Tree</em> has some gorgeous (and dark) 2D artwork fleshing out its world and story, with a bit of <em>Diablo</em>-style combat.

It&rsquo;s designed to run on less powerful computers, requiring a scant 8GB of storage (versus the usual 20GB for Windows 11) and just 2GB of RAM to run well. Somebody even got Tiny11 to run on just <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/stripped-down-windows-11-os-runs-on-200-mb-of-ram&amp;xcust=2-1-1505699-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">200MB of RAM</a>! That&rsquo;s absolutely wild. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the ASMR-esque video below (the speaker has such a calming voice), you&rsquo;ll be taken through the various features Tiny11 offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiny11 is the brainchild of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@NTDEV&amp;xcust=2-1-1505699-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">NTDev</a>, who often experiments with the Windows operating system. For Tiny11 to work properly, NTDev had to cut out a ton of bloatware. According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/tiny-11-lets-you-run-windows-11-on-underpowered-machines/&amp;xcust=2-1-1505699-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC Gamer&rsquo;s Hope Corrigan</a>, Tiny11 sucks up about 6.34GB of space while the rest is dominated by rather rudimentary apps like Notepad and Paint. There&rsquo;s no Microsoft Edge either, which is a huge plus in my book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this project is definitely cool to use, you should really be aware of the potential risks. There&rsquo;s no official support for Tiny11. That means it won&rsquo;t automatically update and, due to Tiny11&rsquo;s lightweight build, you&rsquo;re just not going to have a ton of features at your disposal. A lot of non-core Windows 11 functions were stripped from this build, so things might get weird if you start poking around in the darkest corners of the operating system. That said, it&rsquo;s still a fun thing for those who want a stripped-down OS with minimal footprint! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download Tiny11 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://archive.org/details/tiny-11_202302&amp;xcust=2-1-1505699-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

That fact can&rsquo;t be denied when you see the numbers, particularly in 3DMark&rsquo;s respective DX12 synthetic benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile 3DMark benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505397\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-10.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These tests aren&rsquo;t playable games in the real world, but they simulate the kind of workloads your GPU get hit with when you&rsquo;re playing AAA titles. And when you isolate the GPU performance, the new RTX 4090&rsquo;s gains hit well over 60 percent compared to the 3080 Ti. In both Time Spy and Time Spy Extreme, which test at 1440p and 4K respectively, the 4090 snagged a roughly 65 percent lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see similar results in Port Royal, which tests general ray-tracing performance at 1440p. Even in the new Speed Way benchmark, which adds in the evaluation of newer ray-tracing features at 1440p, the 4090 pushes out a nearly 70 percent increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It almost seems unreal&mdash;and in a way it is. Real-world benchmarks for the GeForce RTX 4090 have more nuance in how certain frame rates are achieved (as you&rsquo;ll see in a moment). But this snapshot of performance remains striking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dlss-3-is-still-incredible\">DLSS 3 is still incredible</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Benchmarks in shipped games are where the rubber hits the road&mdash;even when the test is a built-in feature. They give a better glimpse into what to expect across a landscape where some games support technologies that can bump up your frame rates, are optimized for certain hardware, or even run a little cludgier on PC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Quake II RTX benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505423\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/13_Quake_II_RTX_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

Whether rasterized or ray-tracing performance, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Take for example 2019&rsquo;s <em>Quake II RTX</em>, a path-traced version of the venerable 90s title. The amount of ray-tracing in this edition punishes graphics cards, as seen by the RTX 3080 Ti&rsquo;s 29 fps at 4K&mdash;barely playable by modern standards. The RTX 4090 pushes that frame rate up by over 60 percent, putting it far closer to the preference for 60 fps baseline.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Dirt 5 benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505419\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/9_Dirt_5_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Gears Tactics benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505420\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10_Gears_Tactics_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Strange Brigade benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505412\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8B_Strange_Brigade.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

At 4K, we got a 55 percent increase in <em>Dirt 5</em>, 51 percent in <em>Gears Tactics</em>, and 44 percent in <em>Strange Brigade</em>. Not shabby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where things get interesting is when Nvidia&rsquo;s frame rate&ndash;boosting tech comes into play. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399042/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-nvidia-dlss-20.html\">DLSS 2.0</a> already helps counteract the demands of ray-tracing, as you can see in games like <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>&mdash;while the 3080 Ti at 4K offered a comfortable 74 fps with both ray-tracing and DLSS Balanced mode on, the GeForce RTX 4090 gets you to a silky smooth 120 fps.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505413\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8A_Shadows_Of_The_Tomb_Raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But DLSS 3, oh my&mdash;this upgraded tech has a <em>magical</em> effect on frame rates. Its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">new frame generation technology</a>, which leans on AI technology to generate frames that get interspersed with GPU-rendered frames, dramatically amps up performance. A glance at <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Psycho settings and with ray-tracing illustrates this clearly, even at 4K.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505414\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/15_CyberPunk_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Without frame generation, the performance improvement already sits at a massive 57 percent. (And in practical terms, a more playable 48 fps.) But with it on? The jump shoots up by nearly <em>200 percent</em> to 89 fps. DLSS 3 does have a caveat&mdash;namely, the potential introduction of latency into gameplay, especially if you forgot to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">flip on Nvidia Reflex</a> at the same time&mdash;but this tech is still no less exciting now than it was last fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it may end up more thrilling on laptops. Smaller, thinner laptops will also host the beefy RTX 4090 and 4080, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450228/asus-drool-worthy-gaming-laptops-pack-extreme-specs-into-small-spaces.html\">Asus Zephyrus M16</a>. Often a downsize of the chassis affects performance, but DLSS 3 could shrink the difference between a dainty 14-inch and gigantic 17-inch laptop in games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"content-creation-gets-a-boost-too\">Content creation gets a boost, too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone buys a high-end laptop with the intention of gaming&mdash;sure, maybe during off-hours, but in the day? Time to rip through some work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some production tasks are better completed using the CPU (like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504711/\">Core i9-13980HK</a> our review sample was paired with), others benefit from pushing the load onto the graphics chip. And in such scenarios, the RTX 4090 offers a nice bump in performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Blender Benchmark (Barbershop)\" class=\"wp-image-1505463\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blender_speed.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Handbrake benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505434\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6_Handbrake_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><em>Shorter</em> bars indicate better performance.

In Blender, a program where rendering is thought to be faster on the GPU than CPU, speed improved by as much 31 percent. Meanwhile, in our homebrew Handbrake encoding test, converting a 4K video formatted as a QuickTime file (.mov) to the more compact H.265 format was 25 percent faster.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Premiere Pro benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505426\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5_Puget_Premiere-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

It&rsquo;s a strange outcome that bears investigation, but at least in principle, the RTX 4090 makes a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"better-efficiency-more-laptop-diversity\">Better efficiency, more laptop diversity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus Zephyrus G14 2023\" class=\"wp-image-1505439\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/asus-zephyrus-g14-2023.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld / Asus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that long ago, size mattered for performance. You simply couldn&rsquo;t expect eye-popping results from thin, light laptops. They were great as travel companions when completing basic productivity tasks, but heavy work? Forget it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the GeForce RTX 4090 demonstrates just how much more efficient Nvidia&rsquo;s Lovelace architecture is. It outperforms its 3080 Ti predecessor with the same amount of available power&mdash;and doesn&rsquo;t even use all the juice. Our preliminary findings suggest that the RTX 4090 undercuts the 3080 Ti&rsquo;s power draw by 20W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That likely plays a factor in the astonishingly small laptops the RTX 4090 is slated to appear in, like the ever-popular <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2023-series/&amp;xcust=2-1-1504852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asus Zephyrus G14</a>. Even constrained by a smaller chassis&rsquo; design limitations, this spread of Nvidia&rsquo;s flagship mobile GPU only bodes well. If an RTX 4090 will fit in a laptop weighing under four pounds, just think of all the ultra-thin productivity laptops the inevitable 4070 and 4060 could squeeze into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 we used for testing is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/core-black-msi-gt-series-titan-gt77hx-13vi-042us/p/N82E16834156421&amp;xcust=2-1-1504852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">available to preorder for $5,299</a>&mdash;squeezing every ounce of possible performance out of the latest, greatest technology doesn&rsquo;t come cheap.

This GPU is a juggernaut backed by impressive technology&mdash;and that bodes well for the laptops coming our way. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/zgptkZkT9to&amp;xcust=2-1-1504852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Our YouTube video</a> dives deep into the details, but for the key points (as tested on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/core-black-msi-gt-series-titan-gt77hx-13vi-042us/p/N82E16834156421&amp;xcust=2-1-1504852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">monstrous MSI Titan GT77</a>&nbsp;with the Core i9-13980HX and an Nvidia RTX 4090), read on.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Interested in how the equally brand-new Intel Core i9-13980HX stacks up?

That fact can&rsquo;t be denied when you see the numbers, particularly in 3DMark&rsquo;s respective DX12 synthetic benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile 3DMark benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505397\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-10.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These tests aren&rsquo;t playable games in the real world, but they simulate the kind of workloads your GPU get hit with when you&rsquo;re playing AAA titles. And when you isolate the GPU performance, the new RTX 4090&rsquo;s gains hit well over 60 percent compared to the 3080 Ti. In both Time Spy and Time Spy Extreme, which test at 1440p and 4K respectively, the 4090 snagged a roughly 65 percent lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see similar results in Port Royal, which tests general ray-tracing performance at 1440p. Even in the new Speed Way benchmark, which adds in the evaluation of newer ray-tracing features at 1440p, the 4090 pushes out a nearly 70 percent increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It almost seems unreal&mdash;and in a way it is. Real-world benchmarks for the GeForce RTX 4090 have more nuance in how certain frame rates are achieved (as you&rsquo;ll see in a moment). But this snapshot of performance remains striking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dlss-3-is-still-incredible\">DLSS 3 is still incredible</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Benchmarks in shipped games are where the rubber hits the road&mdash;even when the test is a built-in feature. They give a better glimpse into what to expect across a landscape where some games support technologies that can bump up your frame rates, are optimized for certain hardware, or even run a little cludgier on PC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Quake II RTX benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505423\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/13_Quake_II_RTX_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture that our real-world gaming benchmarks paint of the RTX 4090 is that of a GPU that clobbers previous frame rate expectations. Whether rasterized or ray-tracing performance, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Take for example 2019&rsquo;s <em>Quake II RTX</em>, a path-traced version of the venerable 90s title. The amount of ray-tracing in this edition punishes graphics cards, as seen by the RTX 3080 Ti&rsquo;s 29 fps at 4K&mdash;barely playable by modern standards. The RTX 4090 pushes that frame rate up by over 60 percent, putting it far closer to the preference for 60 fps baseline.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Dirt 5 benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505419\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/9_Dirt_5_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Gears Tactics benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505420\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10_Gears_Tactics_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Strange Brigade benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505412\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8B_Strange_Brigade.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in several games where we simply cranked up the graphics settings to Ultra and let the test fly, you&rsquo;ll see substantial (though slightly lower) percentage uplifts. At 4K, we got a 55 percent increase in <em>Dirt 5</em>, 51 percent in <em>Gears Tactics</em>, and 44 percent in <em>Strange Brigade</em>. Not shabby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where things get interesting is when Nvidia&rsquo;s frame rate&ndash;boosting tech comes into play. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399042/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-nvidia-dlss-20.html\">DLSS 2.0</a> already helps counteract the demands of ray-tracing, as you can see in games like <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>&mdash;while the 3080 Ti at 4K offered a comfortable 74 fps with both ray-tracing and DLSS Balanced mode on, the GeForce RTX 4090 gets you to a silky smooth 120 fps.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505413\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8A_Shadows_Of_The_Tomb_Raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But DLSS 3, oh my&mdash;this upgraded tech has a <em>magical</em> effect on frame rates. Its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">new frame generation technology</a>, which leans on AI technology to generate frames that get interspersed with GPU-rendered frames, dramatically amps up performance. A glance at <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Psycho settings and with ray-tracing illustrates this clearly, even at 4K.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505414\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/15_CyberPunk_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right click (on PC) or long press (on phone) to open the image full-sized in a new window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Without frame generation, the performance improvement already sits at a massive 57 percent. (And in practical terms, a more playable 48 fps.) But with it on? The jump shoots up by nearly <em>200 percent</em> to 89 fps. DLSS 3 does have a caveat&mdash;namely, the potential introduction of latency into gameplay, especially if you forgot to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">flip on Nvidia Reflex</a> at the same time&mdash;but this tech is still no less exciting now than it was last fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it may end up more thrilling on laptops. Smaller, thinner laptops will also host the beefy RTX 4090 and 4080, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450228/asus-drool-worthy-gaming-laptops-pack-extreme-specs-into-small-spaces.html\">Asus Zephyrus M16</a>. Often a downsize of the chassis affects performance, but DLSS 3 could shrink the difference between a dainty 14-inch and gigantic 17-inch laptop in games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"content-creation-gets-a-boost-too\">Content creation gets a boost, too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone buys a high-end laptop with the intention of gaming&mdash;sure, maybe during off-hours, but in the day? Time to rip through some work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some production tasks are better completed using the CPU (like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504711/\">Core i9-13980HK</a> our review sample was paired with), others benefit from pushing the load onto the graphics chip. And in such scenarios, the RTX 4090 offers a nice bump in performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Blender Benchmark (Barbershop)\" class=\"wp-image-1505463\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blender_speed.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Handbrake benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505434\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6_Handbrake_GPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><em>Shorter</em> bars indicate better performance.

In Blender, a program where rendering is thought to be faster on the GPU than CPU, speed improved by as much 31 percent. Meanwhile, in our homebrew Handbrake encoding test, converting a 4K video formatted as a QuickTime file (.mov) to the more compact H.265 format was 25 percent faster.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia RTX 4090 mobile Premiere Pro benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1505426\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5_Puget_Premiere-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

It&rsquo;s a strange outcome that bears investigation, but at least in principle, the RTX 4090 makes a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"better-efficiency-more-laptop-diversity\">Better efficiency, more laptop diversity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus Zephyrus G14 2023\" class=\"wp-image-1505439\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/asus-zephyrus-g14-2023.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld / Asus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that long ago, size mattered for performance. You simply couldn&rsquo;t expect eye-popping results from thin, light laptops. They were great as travel companions when completing basic productivity tasks, but heavy work? Forget it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the GeForce RTX 4090 demonstrates just how much more efficient Nvidia&rsquo;s Lovelace architecture is. It outperforms its 3080 Ti predecessor with the same amount of available power&mdash;and doesn&rsquo;t even use all the juice. Our preliminary findings suggest that the RTX 4090 undercuts the 3080 Ti&rsquo;s power draw by 20W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That likely plays a factor in the astonishingly small laptops the RTX 4090 is slated to appear in, like the ever-popular <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2023-series/&amp;xcust=2-1-1504852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asus Zephyrus G14</a>. Even constrained by a smaller chassis&rsquo; design limitations, this spread of Nvidia&rsquo;s flagship mobile GPU only bodes well. If an RTX 4090 will fit in a laptop weighing under four pounds, just think of all the ultra-thin productivity laptops the inevitable 4070 and 4060 could squeeze into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 we used for testing is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/core-black-msi-gt-series-titan-gt77hx-13vi-042us/p/N82E16834156421&amp;xcust=2-1-1504852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">available to preorder for $5,299</a>&mdash;squeezing every ounce of possible performance out of the latest, greatest technology doesn&rsquo;t come cheap.

Samsung&rsquo;s first major release of the year was actually announced way back in August, but it now has a date and a price. The Odyssey OLED G8, a 34-inch ultrawide that&rsquo;s not quite as bombastic as the top-of-the-line G9, is now available to order. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for the doozie: It costs $1,499.99. That&rsquo;s not very surprising, considering the premium that Samsung tends to put on its displays. But it&rsquo;s also a solid 50 percent more expensive than Dell&rsquo;s latest offering, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376879/alienwares-new-oled-monitor-drops-the-price-and-the-g-sync.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alienware AW3423DWF</a>, which launched at $1,100 and has dipped under the $1K mark on sale. Samsung has a fantastic reputation in the TV space, but Dell&rsquo;s Ultrasharp and Alienware lines are just as respected on the PC side of things. It&rsquo;s a battle of the brands. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 rear \" class=\"wp-image-1505616\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2022-Odyssey-OLED-G8-product3-1200x800-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Both monitors feature the same size and 3440&times;1440 resolution. They also have OLED panels featuring quantum dot technology and so should offer similar (if not identical) picture quality and performance. Both are certified for HDR 400 True Black (OLED panels can make that claim because they technically have zero light coming from a pixel displaying black) and are compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. They each have rear RGB lighting effects and an identical 1800R curve &mdash; gentle, but typical at this size. The Samsung screen is a hair faster at 175Hz versus the Dell&rsquo;s 165Hz and it claims a slightly shorter .03ms response time. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Odyseey G8 USB connection\" class=\"wp-image-1505618\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/32.webp?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are the differences? Most immediately, the Samsung monitor has USB-C powers. While Dell relies on HDMI and DisplayPort 2 plus a few USB-A ports for accessories, the Samsung screen can handle USB-C connections with 65 watts of power delivery. That makes it a much better choice for connecting a laptop with an all-in-one cable, though using the smaller Mini-DisplayPort and MicroHDMI standards for gaming desktops and consoles might be kind of annoying. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung gaming hub\" class=\"wp-image-1505620\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/30.webp?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also packing a lot of the same software features as Samsung&rsquo;s TVs: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, built-in streaming apps on the company&rsquo;s Tizen TV operating system, and the &ldquo;Gaming Hub&rdquo; package that includes access to services like Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now. The screen integrates with various smart home features using Alexa. I won&rsquo;t argue the aesthetic qualities of either monitor &mdash; the Dell is black and the Samsung is white, whaddya want? &mdash; but the Samsung screen and stand are a solid five pounds lighter despite the extra smart TV hardware. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re sold on the new design, it&rsquo;s up for order <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/34-g85sb-oled-ultra-wqhd-0-03ms-175hz-curved-smart-gaming-monitor-ls34bg850snxza/?nrtv_cid=f8b646eded85cf5deae8a57ba580cdeb7ca4f1711e801d502470fa40ac8897d1&amp;cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv--042720--future-16655753&amp;utm_source=future&amp;utm_medium=narrativ&amp;utm_campaign=16655753&amp;utm_content=&amp;nrtv_as_src=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1505540-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">on Samsung&rsquo;s website right now</a>.

Instead of licensing AI models from OpenAI, as Microsoft has, Google developed its own, called LAMDA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google is rolling out Bard with a small disclaimer at the bottom of the search box, according to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/&amp;xcust=2-1-1504752-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> where it showed off the interface: &ldquo;Bard may give inaccurate or inappropriate information,&rdquo; it says in part.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Bard\" class=\"wp-image-1504613\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Untitled-design-10-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Bard simply answers in what&rsquo;s sometimes known as &ldquo;the voice of God&rdquo;: an opinion  apparently unsupported by sources.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Pushed by OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, AI chatbots have emerged from relative obscurity (remember <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/420242/the-internet-turns-tay-microsofts-millennial-ai-chatbot-into-a-racist-bigot.html\">Microsoft Tay</a>?) to genuine smart assistants capable of a variety of tasks. Though there are still concerns about plagiarism and an AI&rsquo;s ability to sometimes generate false information, students and developers have begun using it to perform a variety of tasks, from coding to writing essays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"where-is-an-ais-information-coming-from\">Where is an AI&rsquo;s information coming from?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The big problem with not citing sources? Not only do you not know where a search engine like Google&rsquo;s Bard actually sourced the information from, you have no easy way of checking it for accuracy, yourself. Nor do you have any idea where these new chatbots are actually finding their answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, search engines have avoided the issue by acting like traditional journalists: saying little itself, and instead directing queries to a list of links where users can find the answer and context that they&rsquo;re searching for. Over time, however, both Google and Microsoft have acknowledged that there&rsquo;s no need to send a user to Wikipedia for a simple factual search on the capital of California. Instead, the search engine can answer &ldquo;Sacramento&rdquo; and save a click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, however, Google has begun providing &ldquo;snippets,&rdquo; the key information it thinks users are searching for, only adding the link for additional context. What was immediately apparent was that Bard doesn&rsquo;t do even that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will that change? Maybe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard&rsquo;s responses meet a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/01/lamda-towards-safe-grounded-and-high.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1504752-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">high bar for quality, safety and groundedness</a>&nbsp;in real-world information,&rdquo; Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai wrote in Bard&rsquo;s announcement post. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited for this phase of testing to help us continue to learn and improve Bard&rsquo;s quality and speed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bing-is-barely-more-transparent-than-bard\">Bing is barely more transparent than Bard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft quietly asked reporters to visit its Redmond, Washington headquarters today to unveil what almost certainly is its own AI response. Based upon leaks, Microsoft plans to add AI to Office and search, as well as various tools. It can do so with a $1 billion investment in OpenAI that it recently expanded upon, with a license to use either the GPT-3 or the more powerful GPT-4 language model in its applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this &ldquo;new Bing,&rdquo; as it apparently is known, cites its sources. At the bottom of the short response, the leaked images show a series of sites that generated the response.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">This morning I was experiencing the CHAT feature of Microsoft Bing search and then a few moments later disappeared it. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/kSA7RMPmLy&amp;xcust=2-1-1504752-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/kSA7RMPmLy</a></p>&mdash; Nazmul hossain (@Nazmul60863192) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Nazmul60863192/status/1621383142174248960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1504752-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div><figcaption>The right-hand image shows the new Bing, and it how it shows some of its sources&hellip;barely.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that Bing still doesn&rsquo;t provide any further hints on where it got its information from.

No civilized wins here; 13th-gen&rsquo;s lead over 12th-gen is substantial. In our Cinebench R23, Blender, and V-Ray rendering tests, we saw between a 32 and 40 percent improvement, with the highest jump in Cinebench R23&rsquo;s multithreaded test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story&rsquo;s similar (though not as dramatic) in Handbrake, where we feed a large 4K mov file into the program and crunch it down into a more compact H.265 file. With the Core i9-13980HK, the encode finishes about 25 percent faster.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Handbrake 1.6.1 benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504732\" height=\"654\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4_Handbrake_CPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Shorter bars indicate better performance.

Lightly threaded work sees lower double-digit increases, which transform into far greater jumps as you enter heavily threaded territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only lingering question about the 13980HK is how it&rsquo;ll fare against the looming specter of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html\">Ryzen 9 7945HX</a>: AMD&rsquo;s best on mobile is set to launch soon as well, and it too should be a bruising chip. Expect some drama in the coming showdown between the two flagship mobile parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Not all production work benefits, though<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we turned an eye to other kinds of content creation tasks&mdash;namely those done in Adobe&rsquo;s Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Lightroom applications&mdash;our experience with the 13980HX veered off into puzzling territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On desktop, our benchmark results showed Raptor Lake with a clear lead over Alder Lake, with modest but tangible gains ranging from 8 to 17 percent. But at the time of our testing, this new 13th-gen laptop part&rsquo;s test results technically came in <em>under</em> that of the 12900HX.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX PugetBench Premiere Pro benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504741\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5_Puget_Premiere.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX PugetBench Photoshop benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504736\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6_Puget_Photoshop.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX PugetBench Lightroom benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504737\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7_Puget_Lightroom.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

But that&rsquo;s still a strange outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complicating matters is that our tests simulated regular use, in that the GPU was active as well. You could say that these benchmarks don&rsquo;t show a clear, isolated picture of the 13980HX&rsquo;s performance compared to the 12900HX, and that wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to say. However in the real world, most people don&rsquo;t lean solely on the CPU, and these results possibly highlight a possible scenario that a content creator could run into during these early days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did we make a mistake in our testing? Is there a driver issue? Or is the software just not yet optimized? The answer is unclear, and we&rsquo;ll need to do some follow-up investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Games get an uplift too<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike desktops, getting an exact read on the laptop CPU performance in games is a little tricky. You&rsquo;ll rarely find two notebooks with different generation processors but the same GPU&mdash;much less from the same maker <em>and</em> product line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such was the case with the laptops we had for benchmarking. They were similar, but not the same. One was a last-generation MSI Titan GT77 laptop with a 12th-gen Core i9-12900HX and an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti. The other? A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/core-black-msi-gt-series-titan-gt77hx-13vi-042us/p/N82E16834156421&amp;xcust=2-1-1504711-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">current MSI Titan GT77</a> with the Core i9-13980HX and an Nvidia RTX 4090.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these apples-to-oranges configurations, our gaming benchmarks largely reflect the performance gains of the Nvidia RTX 4090 over the RTX 3080 Ti. Yet we did have one title among our benchmark tests that offered a clue about the 13980HX&rsquo;s influence on CPU-bound games: <em>Counter-Strike Global Offensive</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Counter Strike Global Offensive benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504747\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7_CS_GO.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can&rsquo;t bank on <em>CSGO</em>&rsquo;s 23 percent in all situations with a CPU-bound game, this test result at least offers some idea of the 13980HX&rsquo;s influence on gaming performance&mdash;a useful tidbit for folks that care about such details, especially when picking a laptop configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don&rsquo;t buy this chip for everyday tasks<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you follow processor news and launches regularly, you probably already know that a CPU like the 13980HX is overkill for programs like Microsoft Office apps and web browsing. Ridiculous overkill, actually, for the overwhelming majority of people.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Procyon Office benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504738\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8_Procyon_Office_365.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Longer bars indicate better performance.

And generally, more cores equal more power for them. But that&rsquo;s not the workload reflected in the kind of Office benchmarks we are currently able to run. (Our special Excel eSports benchmark created for us by competitor Jason Moore is unfortunately still broken.) Procyon zeros in on more typical productivity work, and while the Core i9-13980HX outperforms its predecessor, a 14 percent overall improvement isn&rsquo;t real justification for a CPU with a recommended price of $668. (You&rsquo;d never pay for a laptop chip independently of course, but that figure gives an idea of its relative value.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Google Chrome browser performance benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1504731\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/9_Browser_CPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

No civilized wins here; 13th-gen&rsquo;s lead over 12th-gen is substantial. In our Cinebench R23, Blender, and V-Ray rendering tests, we saw between a 32 and 40 percent improvement, with the highest jump in Cinebench R23&rsquo;s multithreaded test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story&rsquo;s similar (though not as dramatic) in Handbrake, where we feed a large 4K mov file into the program and crunch it down into a more compact H.265 file. With the Core i9-13980HK, the encode finishes about 25 percent faster.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Handbrake 1.6.1 benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504732\" height=\"654\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4_Handbrake_CPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Shorter bars indicate better performance.

Lightly threaded work sees lower double-digit increases, which transform into far greater jumps as you enter heavily threaded territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only lingering question about the 13980HK is how it&rsquo;ll fare against the looming specter of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html\">Ryzen 9 7945HX</a>: AMD&rsquo;s best on mobile is set to launch soon as well, and it too should be a bruising chip. Expect some drama in the coming showdown between the two flagship mobile parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Not all production work benefits, though<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we turned an eye to other kinds of content creation tasks&mdash;namely those done in Adobe&rsquo;s Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Lightroom applications&mdash;our experience with the 13980HX veered off into puzzling territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On desktop, our benchmark results showed Raptor Lake with a clear lead over Alder Lake, with modest but tangible gains ranging from 8 to 17 percent. But at the time of our testing, this new 13th-gen laptop part&rsquo;s test results technically came in <em>under</em> that of the 12900HX.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX PugetBench Premiere Pro benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504741\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5_Puget_Premiere.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX PugetBench Photoshop benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504736\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6_Puget_Photoshop.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX PugetBench Lightroom benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504737\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7_Puget_Lightroom.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right-click on desktop (or long-press on mobile) to view image full-size in another window.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to take this at face value, the reasonable characterization of these results is that they fall within margin of error&mdash;that is, you get the same performance in Adobe apps on 13th-gen as 12th-gen. But that&rsquo;s still a strange outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complicating matters is that our tests simulated regular use, in that the GPU was active as well. You could say that these benchmarks don&rsquo;t show a clear, isolated picture of the 13980HX&rsquo;s performance compared to the 12900HX, and that wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to say. However in the real world, most people don&rsquo;t lean solely on the CPU, and these results possibly highlight a possible scenario that a content creator could run into during these early days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did we make a mistake in our testing? Is there a driver issue? Or is the software just not yet optimized? The answer is unclear, and we&rsquo;ll need to do some follow-up investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Games get an uplift too<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike desktops, getting an exact read on the laptop CPU performance in games is a little tricky. You&rsquo;ll rarely find two notebooks with different generation processors but the same GPU&mdash;much less from the same maker <em>and</em> product line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such was the case with the laptops we had for benchmarking. They were similar, but not the same. One was a last-generation MSI Titan GT77 laptop with a 12th-gen Core i9-12900HX and an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti. The other? A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/core-black-msi-gt-series-titan-gt77hx-13vi-042us/p/N82E16834156421&amp;xcust=2-1-1504711-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">current MSI Titan GT77</a> with the Core i9-13980HX and an Nvidia RTX 4090.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these apples-to-oranges configurations, our gaming benchmarks largely reflect the performance gains of the Nvidia RTX 4090 over the RTX 3080 Ti. Yet we did have one title among our benchmark tests that offered a clue about the 13980HX&rsquo;s influence on CPU-bound games: <em>Counter-Strike Global Offensive</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Counter Strike Global Offensive benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504747\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7_CS_GO.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Gordon Mah Ung / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can&rsquo;t bank on <em>CSGO</em>&rsquo;s 23 percent in all situations with a CPU-bound game, this test result at least offers some idea of the 13980HX&rsquo;s influence on gaming performance&mdash;a useful tidbit for folks that care about such details, especially when picking a laptop configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don&rsquo;t buy this chip for everyday tasks<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you follow processor news and launches regularly, you probably already know that a CPU like the 13980HX is overkill for programs like Microsoft Office apps and web browsing. Ridiculous overkill, actually, for the overwhelming majority of people.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Procyon Office benchmark\" class=\"wp-image-1504738\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8_Procyon_Office_365.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Longer bars indicate better performance.

And generally, more cores equal more power for them. But that&rsquo;s not the workload reflected in the kind of Office benchmarks we are currently able to run. (Our special Excel eSports benchmark created for us by competitor Jason Moore is unfortunately still broken.) Procyon zeros in on more typical productivity work, and while the Core i9-13980HX outperforms its predecessor, a 14 percent overall improvement isn&rsquo;t real justification for a CPU with a recommended price of $668. (You&rsquo;d never pay for a laptop chip independently of course, but that figure gives an idea of its relative value.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Core i9-13980HX Google Chrome browser performance benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1504731\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/9_Browser_CPU.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance.

Yep, there&rsquo;s an improvement. But again, you&rsquo;re not buying this chip for a 25 percent improvement in web app performance. It&rsquo;s a bonus, not a feature. We recommend shopping accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more 13th-gen laptops hitting the streets very soon.

It&rsquo;s no easy feat to lead with a superlative like that and back it up. FastestVPN strives to be a top VPN and at least on the surface, it makes a persuasive case for itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is based in the Cayman Islands, which bodes well for privacy and security. The service also offers a solid premium feature set, with 10 simultaneous connections, P2P optimized servers, no logs, and stated promises to unblock region locks on most of the top streaming platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198369/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\">best VPNs</a> roundup.

Upon first opening the application in Windows, you&rsquo;ll find a list of countries you can connect to in the main screen, making it easy to get started right away. Off to the right you&rsquo;ll find the FastestVPN trademark lightning-bolt button to connect, along with basic info about the connection (IP address and server location). In the top-right you&rsquo;ll have three buttons for the home screen, account info, and settings.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485626\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"815\" /><figcaption><p>FastestVPN provides three protocol options and an auto option, which chooses the best of the three for your tasks.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">FastestVPN</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The settings screen is similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen in previous versions of the app. Here you can switch your VPN protocol between IKEv2, TCP, UDP, and Auto. The Auto protocol option is new and when chosen will theoretically give you the best protocol among the other three according to your given tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below the VPN protocol options are checkboxes for things such as an <em>Internet kill switch</em> as well as options to <em>Launch at start</em>up, <em>Redial automatically if connection drops</em>, and <em>Auto connect after launch</em>&mdash;all standard fare for most modern VPN applications. The kill switch is a nice feature though and isn&rsquo;t provided by all VPN services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for servers, it&rsquo;s a little unclear how many servers FastestVPN actually has. It claims &ldquo;Servers Available in 39+ Countries and 55+ Locations,&rdquo; but we found that what servers are actually available will depend somewhat on the device and application you are using. Additionally, it has a limited number of streaming-specific servers and D-VPN (Double VPN) servers that bounce your connection through more than one server to provide double encryption.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485627\" height=\"631\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Supported-Devices.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"840\" /><figcaption><p>FastestVPN has app support for a ton of devices.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">FastestVPN</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN has done a great job providing app support for a ton of devices. These range from the standards such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android, to others such as Linux, Roku, and Amazon Firestick, among others. It even has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, one area that seems to be missing from all of FastestVPN&rsquo;s apps is information regarding each specific server&rsquo;s load or latency figures. This is useful if you&rsquo;re looking to connect to the fastest server in a given location, and frankly it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity in the application design. Regardless, the applications are straightforward and easy to use across all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other quirk we noticed was a problem with the Windows application when installing. It seems that it may not have the proper certification with Microsoft, which causes Windows Defender to flag the application and present an error message that halts the installation process. This is easy enough to bypass, but may be confusing at first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN also provides a few bonus features such as helpful 24/7 chat and email support, a free password manager, and up to 2TB of cloud storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"fastestvpn-performance\">FastestVPN: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our performance tests we compared the base speed of our internet to that of different server locations across the world to see how our internet speed connected to a VPN compares to our base internet speed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last time around we saw FastestVPN hitting 45 percent of the base speed in our tests averaged across all locations. At the time, that was a huge bump from the 30 percent base speeds in our initial review of the service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around we didn&rsquo;t see quite the same jump, but we did notice a slight improvement of up to 49.5 percent of the base download speed when connected to FastestVPN&rsquo;s servers. Furthermore, we saw an admirable 68 percent of the base upload speed. These are solid numbers and FastestVPN&rsquo;s recent upgrade to 10Gbps+ speed servers is obviously making a difference for its users.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485628\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Streaming-Servers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1021\" /><figcaption><p>FastestVPN has specific servers to use to unblock streaming sites.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">FastestVPN</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN does an alright job at getting around region locks and geo-restricted content. Using its normal servers was rather hit or miss when trying to access sites such as Netflix and Disney+. Some servers were able to bypass the region locks while many others were actively blocked and the streaming sites wouldn&rsquo;t load properly. That being said, FastestVPN (at the time of writing) has seven streaming-specific servers, which all worked just fine in our tests. The only issue here is that if you want to access content from countries other than these streaming-server locations, you may be out of luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"fastestvpn-security-and-privacy\">FastestVPN: Security and privacy</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"FastestVPN\" class=\"wp-image-1485629\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Security-Features.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>FastestVPN security features.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sam Singleton</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN&rsquo;s official business location is the Cayman Islands. This might sound kind of sketchy at first glance, but the company says that this was on purpose in order to avoid any laws requiring them to keep browsing records on its customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s privacy policy states that it does not log any information about its customers. The only thing the company keeps, it says, is the email address you use to sign up for the service. Users will just have to take the service for its word that there truly is a no-log policy, however, as FastestVPN has not gone through an independent audit to back up these claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service uses the industry standard AES 256-bit encryption and comes with IPv6 and DNS leak protection. Our DNS leak tests proved that there were no IP or DNS leaks while using the VPN. This is important as IP and DNS data leaks can allow for outside parties to know your true location and watch your activity while online.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"fastestvpn-final-thoughts\">FastestVPN: Final thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FastestVPN has improved upon its service since the last time we tested it, but there are some areas that still need improvement. It&rsquo;s obvious that it doesn&rsquo;t have the same resources as some of the largest VPN services, but nonetheless it&rsquo;s still able to make the core VPN features work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite what is stated in its name, it may not be the fastest VPN, nor does it have the most robust feature set. But that&rsquo;s not the main draw anyways.
