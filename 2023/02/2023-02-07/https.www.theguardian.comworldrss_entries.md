<p>US president believes he has an economic success story to tell although polls indicate voters are skeptical</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed">Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email</a></strong></li></ul><p>Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us for our coverage of Joe Biden’s annual State of the Union address. At 9 pm eastern time, the president will take the stage before Congress, supreme court justices, cabinet secretaries and guests from across the country to make the case that things are looking up for the United States. But as the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-gambino">Lauren Gambino</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joan-greve">Joan E Greve</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/07/biden-sotu-what-to-expect">reported earlier today</a>, many Americans hold gloomy impressions about the state of the nation – just look at the mere 21% who have a positive view of economic conditions. Looming over Biden’s speech is the big question the president has yet to answer: will he run for a second term in 2024? Don’t expect an answer tonight, but it’s possible he’ll give hints of which way he’s leaning.</p><p>But first, a rundown of what happened today so far:</p><p><strong>Federal Reserve </strong>boss <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/07/fed-jerome-powell-interest-rates-inflation">said the central bank</a> may have to keep raising interest rates to fight inflation, a decision with effects that will ripple across the country and into Americans’ bank accounts.</p><p><strong>Dozens of George Santos’ constituents</strong> traveled to the Capitol from suburban New York City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/07/george-santos-constituents-call-for-resignation-us-capitol">to demand he resign</a> for lying his way into Congress.</p><p><strong>Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/06/us-debt-ceiling-kevin-mccarthy-joe-biden">has reiterated his demand</a> that Biden agree to cut spending in exchange for increasing the debt ceiling, a vital piece of business Congress must agree to do in the coming months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/feb/07/joe-biden-state-of-the-union-us-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

I think that is self- evident. And the inflation challenge in our economy, which is making some of these interest rate rises necessary, is the government’s major focus.</p><p>And that’s why, you know, we’re showing spending restraint, we’re providing cost-of-living relief, we’re dealing with these issues in the supply chain, including in the workforce, because ... high inflation and rising interest rates [are] the defining challenge in the economy right now.
