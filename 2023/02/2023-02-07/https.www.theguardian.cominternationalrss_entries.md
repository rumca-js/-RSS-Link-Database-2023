## Sheffield United’s Sharp and Berge strike late to end Wrexham’s Cup dream

<p>Sheffield United scored two dramatic injury-time goals to end Wrexham’s fairytale run in this season’s FA Cup and set up a fifth-round meeting with Tottenham, leaving the non-league side crestfallen and wondering what might have been on a dramatic night at Bramall Lane.<br /><br />Having converted a glut of pressure into the opening goal when Anel Ahmedhodzic fired home shortly after half-time, the Blades looked well-placed to book their place in the next round. But the drama was just beginning – and after Wrexham striker Paul Mullin brought the score level from the penalty spot, he then missed a second spot-kick seven minutes later which would have put Phil Parkinson’s side in front.<br /><br />And just as the tie looked to be heading to extra time, Billy Sharp put the hosts ahead for the second time before Sander Berge scored a third in injury time. It was a harsh scoreline for Wrexham, who more than played their part in a thrilling tie, but arguably the right outcome.</p><p>Phil Parkinson opted to make seven changes from the side who came so close to knocking the Blades out at the Racecourse Ground. He did, however, retain the 5-3-2 formation which has served his side so well in league and cup this season and it served as a solid foundation to frustrate their Championship opponents in the early exchanges here.<br /><br />The hosts controlled the majority of possession and enjoyed the more threatening moments in attack but in truth, there was little in the way of a clear-cut opportunity for Sheffield United inside the opening half-hour. They were certainly outplaying Wrexham, but the visitors were well-drilled, organised and impressive whenever called upon to work defensively.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/07/sheffield-united-wrexham-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So many warnings about a toxic culture have gone unheeded. Policing is based on trust – as things stand, it can’t survive</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/07/david-carrick-jailed-life-rapes-met-police-officer">sentencing of David Carrick</a> and the dreadful details we have heard of what he did and how his victims suffered forms part of a long line of awful events that strike at the heart of policing today. I wish I could say that I was surprised but I cannot. Aside from him being an abhorrent individual, the reason he got away with his crimes runs deep in a culture that has been in need of reform for a long time. And those at the top know this.</p><p>I have throughout my policing career extolled the virtues of the UK policing model, but in the latter stages of that career, I became increasingly concerned at the inability of the service to adapt and ensure that it responded as society changed. You can change the rules in which a force operates, you can change legislation, add new laws, appoint new chiefs, change discipline arrangements, but in essence, there has been little or no success in changing policing culture, identifying the good bits, dealing with the bad.</p><p>Steve White is a former chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales and former acting police and crime commissioner for Durham</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/07/david-carrick-police-reform-met">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Both blame us for the breakdown – never themselves – and want to try again, but that just speaks to their massive self-delusion  </p><p>Liz Truss is now eluded by two major types of growth: economic and personal. The past few days have seen the former prime minister break <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/04/liz-truss-expected-political-comeback-sunday">her welcome silence </a>with what her allies call a series of “interventions”. The one intervention that doesn’t seem to have happened is the type where they sit you down and give you the hard truths about your behaviour.

We live in an era where people who have got all the way to the highest office in the land now hilariously claim structural discrimination against the fact that, after varying amounts of time, they just weren’t good enough. When both of these chancers left office, they had not simply passed their best-before date – they had sailed beyond the use-by date and moved formally into the realms of biohazard. Yet instead of bucking the f up and accepting this, they have turned into the political equivalent of “incels” – involuntarily rejected by the people who determine whether or not you get to be prime minister, and bleating about it in self-reflection-free style on every available forum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/07/britain-liz-truss-boris-johnson-blame">Continue reading...</a>
