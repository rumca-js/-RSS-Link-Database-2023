## Fortnite Slurp Juice Unvaulted: Where To Get It And How It Works

<p>When you drop into a match of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> for a battle royale showdown, you can be almost certain that you'll encounter some enemy squads to overcome. Of course, taking them down and scoring that sweet victory royale means that you'll likely take some damage along the way and need to use one of the many items around the island to heal up. However, Epic has unvaulted one fan-favorite healing item--Slurp Juice--that should quickly become a hot commodity, so we'll tell you where to find it and why you should pick it up.</p><h2>Where to find Slurp Juice in Fortnite and how it works</h2><p>Slurp Juice can be found on the ground or in chests and supply drops. It takes two seconds to consume and replenishes one health point per 0.5 seconds up to a total of 75. If you have full health, it will heal shields instead. Only one can be active at a time, so an additional slurp won't have any effect until you've finished healing the initial 75 health or shields.</p><p>Due to how quickly you can consume Slurp Juice, it can be immensely helpful in almost any situation. For one, it's fantastic for helping you recover health or shields over time during safe periods, allowing for a fairly hands-off healing experience while you loot or move to new areas. But perhaps best of all, it can be used right before or during a fight so that you'll gradually recover from any shots you take. It may not seem like much, but having that extra bit of health or shields ticking upward at all times to offset some of the damage could make or break a showdown.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-slurp-juice-unvaulted-where-to-get-it-and-how-it-works/1100-6511198/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman/">Hitman</a> Freelancer mode, which adds a new roguelite structure to the many huge levels this trilogy has produced since 2016, has been an unquestionable delight. But it doesn't always explain itself well, often saving tutorial prompts for <em>after</em> you've already tried something.</p><p dir="ltr">For most of the new features that's fine, but it's left lots of folks in the dark on how to deal with these new safes that regularly appear on each map. There's an icon on your mini-map telling you where the safe is, and it lights up when you use Agent 47's hitman vision--but when you actually approach the thing it just tells you that you need three codes to open it, with no guidance for where one would get these codes.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two ways to open these safes: by finding those codes and opening it the normal way, or by using explosives to blow them open. We'll walk you through the more clandestine way first.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-freelancer-safe-codes-how-to-open-safes-in-any-level/1100-6511288/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">What was buried in 2013's The Last of Us was not forgotten--not entirely anyway.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> is now over four years old and heading into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/">Season 16</a>, which is quite the feat given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/">the live-service game bubble looks ready to burst</a>. Going into Season 16, Respawn is shifting its priorities for the game in order to ensure the Apex Legends team isn't just adding new content for the sake of it. The team wants to avoid adding so much that they design the battle royale into an inescapable corner and their only choice is to sunset the game and then create Apex Legends 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think what's fundamental to the philosophy that [design director] Evan [Nikolich's] been talking about is that our goal is that we don't want to be just putting out content for the sake of putting out content," game director Steve Ferreira told GameSpot in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-grew-a-beautiful-garden-with-apex-legends-but-its-time-to-pull-out-the-weeds-in-year-5/1100-6511272/">interview discussing the four-year history of Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"One, we want to have an impact on the game, but two, we want to make sure that we haven't forgotten the game holistically. [We don't want to] slowly put the game into a state where the only option for us to do the next thing we want to do is to refactor the whole thing and shut the live game down and then launch Apex Legends 2. That's our anti-vision."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-doesnt-want-to-make-an-apex-legends-2-thats-our-anti-vision/1100-6511276/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>This War of Mine has been added to the New York Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. The storytelling-forward strategy game will be displayed at the ongoing exhibit Never Alone: Video Games and Other Interactive Design. The conflict simulation will join games like Tetris and Flower, as well as less game-like forms of interactive design like the zine Everything Is Going To Be Okay and the @ symbol. <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5453">The exhibition</a> is on display until July 23, 2022.</p><p>The MoMA first added 14 video games into their collection back in 2012. Since then, the museum has steadily added more video games. Now, the permanent collection includes just under 40 games. These games are under the umbrella of its Architecture and Design collection.</p><p>Paul Galloway, Collection Specialist for the Department of Architecture and Design at MoMA and co-curator of the exhibition, said about This War of Mine: “There is often a kind of a conversation about games as fun, games as a diversion, but I think that there’s an increasing range of games that ask more of the players. When I played This War of Mine it made me sad, it made me afraid, it made me very tense, and in the end, it left me with a very changed understanding of what it is to be playing in a war space.”</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-war-of-mine-joins-permanent-video-game-collection-at-museum-of-modern-art/1100-6511282/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> has had a turbulent evolution. Year 1 was largely spent establishing how the game fits within the battle royale space, Year 2 was hugely transformative in terms of storytelling and meta, and Year 3 was a love letter to the legacy of Titanfall. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/">Apex Legends Season 16</a> kicks off just after the conclusion of the battle royale's fourth year, which was the game's roughest year to date as the gameplay and meta worryingly stagnated, the ongoing narrative diverged into several uninteresting storylines that haven't gone anywhere meaningful, and an unrewarding Collection Event left players feeling unhappy. Going into Year 5, Respawn needs to cultivate and improve upon what it's created, not just maintain its heading and simply add more of the same to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The Apex Legends team seems to agree, seeing as Season 16 is the first season for Apex Legends where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">we aren't getting a new playable legend</a> and the team has already confirmed the front half won't be all that story-heavy. We're getting less new stuff up front to create room for the Apex Legends team to shift priorities going into Year 5. The first of these changes are sweeping, long-awaited adjustments to the existing cast of playable legends, but Respawn is also using Year 5 to address one of the most glaring issues Apex Legends has struggled with: its unapproachable nature in regards to new players.</p><p dir="ltr">After talking to the team about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-is-an-ideal-on-ramp-for-new-players/1100-6511254/">Apex Legends Season 16 is an ideal on-ramp for new players</a>, I met with game director Steve Ferreira and design director Evan Nikolich to discuss what Respawn has learned over the past four years of Apex Legends, as well as how those four years are informing what's to come in Year 5 and beyond.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-grew-a-beautiful-garden-with-apex-legends-but-its-time-to-pull-out-the-weeds-in-year-5/1100-6511272/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As it does every three months, Nintendo has updated its list of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">best-selling Nintendo Switch games</a>, and it was another strong period for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p><p>Already the best-selling Switch game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe climbed further up and has now sold 52 million copies as of December 31, 2022.

## WoW: Dragonflight Sold Less Than Shadowlands, But There Is A Silver Lining

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Dragonflight, the latest expansion for Blizzard's longrunning MMORPG, sold less at launch than the game's previous expansion, Shadowlands. But lower initial sales doesn't mean WoW is on the way out. In fact, it's outperforming the previous expansion in a key metric.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed in Activision Blizzard's <a href="https://investor.activision.com/node/35836/pdf">fourth quarter 2022 financial results</a>, early Dragonflight sales "have not reached the level of the previous expansion." It's hard to know exactly what that means since Blizzard has rarely in recent times revealed specific sales or player subscription numbers. However, Blizzard was quick to trumpet the success of Shadowlands when it sold 3.7 million copies on its first day back in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-the-fastest-selling-pc-game-ever-activision-claims/1100-6485230/">making it the fastest selling PC game of all-time</a> for a brief period <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-has-already-broken-records-on-pc-steam-and-twitch/">prior to the release of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">At the very least, it seems clear Dragonflight on launch day failed to reach Shadowlands' day-one numbers. That makes it the first time day-one sales of a new WoW expansion have not surpassed its predecessor since 2012's Mists of Pandaria. That news isn't entirely surprising. Despite strong sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-wow-next-expansion-blizzard-must-learn-from-shadowlands-mistakes/1100-6501490/">Shadowlands was a wildly unpopular expansion</a>, and the last few years have seen Blizzard mired in controversy revolving around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lawsuits-and-investigations-timeline-of-events/1100-6494785/">sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-sold-less-than-shadowlands-but-there-is-a-silver-lining/1100-6511270/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Justin Roiland Was Reportedly Not Very Involved With Rick & Morty

<p dir="ltr">As the fallout of domestic violence allegations against Justin Roiland continues, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/justin-roiland-animation-empire-implosion-rick-and-morty-1235319366/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has published an article citing multiple sources suggesting that "other than voice work, [Roiland] has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name."</p><p dir="ltr">The article goes on to say that many of Roiland's former colleagues say they "haven't heard from him in years, and when they have, it's been unpleasant." Since Roiland was charged on January 12 with felony domestic violence in Orange County, California--which includes one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud, and/or deceit--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adult-swim-cuts-ties-with-justin-roiland-rick-and-morty-will-continue/1100-6510833/">Adult Swim</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justin-roiland-resigns-from-squanch-games-amid-domestic-violence-allegations/1100-6510838/">Squanch Games</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hulu-fires-justin-roiland-from-solar-opposites-and-koala-man-following-felony-accusations/1100-6510860/">Hulu</a> have all cut ties with him. Roiland pled not guilty and the court will reconvene on April 27.</p><p dir="ltr">But in the meantime, The Hollywood Article presents a more in-depth look at the working environment that had developed around Roiland's shows--and perhaps why he was ultimately not so involved day-to-day with other co-workers. For example, a few sources speak to the fundamentally different interests and approaches to storytelling at Rick and Morty between co-creators Dan Harmon and Roiland. One unnamed source says "Dan is all on the page and mathematical about story breaking, and these guys that Justin hired were like, 'Look, I drew a turd with eyes, let's do a story about that.'"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justin-roiland-was-reportedly-not-very-involved-with-rick-morty/1100-6511269/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The Chaos Update is coming to Vampire Survivors soon. Developer Poncle has announced the version 1.3.0 patch will release this Thursday, February 9, for the game, introducing a new challenge stage, two relics, and three achievements.</p><p dir="ltr">The challenge stage is called Bat Country, so be prepared to eradicate thousands of the winged creatures. Meanwhile, one of the two new relics is Chaos Malachite, which will morph the skeleton character Mortaccio upon reaching level 80. Check out the update trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">There definitely seems to be quite a few Sonic the Hedgehog references with this free patch for Vampire Survivors.

<p>Nintendo plans to raise its employees' base pay by 10% this year in the wake of inflation. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-trims-annual-profit-outlook-firmer-yen-2023-02-07/?rpc=401&amp;">Reuters</a> reported that Nintendo plans to raise salaries even as it reduced its profit expectation for the year. Nintendo previously cut its operating profit forecast from a projected 582 billion yen to 480 billion yen ($3.6 billion).</p><p>Nintendo also amended its projected software and hardware sales. It projects that the Switch will sell 18 million units this year, as opposed to the prior forecast of 19 million. Similarly, it dropped the software sales forecast from 210 million units to 205 million. Nintendo re-affirmed that it does not currently have plan to raise prices for its consoles or games.</p><p>As inflation continues to hit the global market, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida urged companies to pay more to offset the rising cost of living. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, "It's important for our long-term growth to secure our workforce." He declined to comment when asked about a Switch successor.

<p>Mechanical keyboard company Drop has announced a new keyboard from its The Lord of the Rings line, and this one is pure evil. The "Black Speech keyboard," as it's called, is focused around the evil Sauron. As Drop said in a press release, this new keyboard helps fulfill the dark lord's wishes to make Black Speech the unifying language of Mordor, or something like that.</p><p>The keyboard features keycaps for Black Speech characters, so you can actually type things out in the fictional language created by J.R.R. Tolkien (or switch the caps to standard letters). Additionally, the keyboard itself is emblazoned with all manner of accents like the Eye of Sauron, the Shards of Narsil, and a Nazgul. Across the spacebar is the famous inscription from The One Ring.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://drop.com/buy/drop-the-lord-of-the-rings-black-speech-keyboard">Buy the Black Speech keyboard </a> </div><p>Drop's new Black Speech keyboard was made in partnership with Middle-earth Enterprises, the company that controls the rights to the popular fantasy series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-lord-of-the-rings-keyboard-uses-saurons-black-speech-from-middle-earth/1100-6511264/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>At the start of your wizarding journey in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> you will be presented with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-which-house-pick-differences-guide/1100-6511220/">sorting hat at Hogwarts</a>, which determines which house you will be placed into. In the game, the Sorting Hat asks very limited questions and ultimately lets you choose which house to be placed into. However, for fans that want to be placed into a house and given a wand based on their personality, you can link your WB Games Account with a Wizarding World account, to have your in-game house and wand determined by the official quiz. This will require you to get setup ahead of time, here's how.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to use the official Wizarding World Sorting Hat quiz in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4096014-sortinghatscreen.png"><img alt="You will have the option to pick a different house in-game if you want to." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4096014-sortinghatscreen.png" /></a><figcaption>You will have the option to pick a different house in-game if you want to.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">First you will need to go to the <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/legacyconnect">Wizarding World website</a> and create a legacy account.

Here you will answer a series of questions that are meant to determine what kind of person you are and which house you best belong to. Once you have your result you will want to navigate to the Discover Your Wand quiz. There is also a Patronus quiz available, but that does not carry over into Hogwarts Legacy like the Sorting House and Discover Your Wand quizzes do.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wand quiz is similar to the Sorting House, asking for some physical attributes before asking questions like what personality trait you pride yourself most on or if you would go to the Ocean, a Castle, or Forest, if given the choice.

That new continent is Rowen, where players will step into a war between two barbarian tribes, the Preigelli and the Liebertane. Players will have to pick a side and wage war against those who have chosen the opposing faction. In March, the war between the two factions will intensify with the release of the Tulubik Battlefield, the game's 96-player PvP mode.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">If waging war against fellow players doesn't sound appealing, a trip to a relaxing hot spring might be preferable.

Rather than an all-out civil war, players are put on two teams and armed with massive, squeaky rubber duck hammers. Players will want to protect their teammate who gets the "duck toy" buff and escort them to the finish line, while also trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-ark-anniversary-update-takes-players-to-a-hot-spring-and-a-new-continent/1100-6511261/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/">Apex Legends Season 16</a> is called Reverly and it kicks off on February 14. In a surprising twist, Revelry is the first season of Respawn's battle royale game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">not add a new playable character</a> to the roster. Instead, the new season makes huge changes to the ability kits of the <em>entire </em>existing crop of 23 legends, making each of their skill sets and specialties easier to digest for first-time players. In that same vein, Season 16 also introduces a new weapon (the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-is-finally-getting-a-new-gun/1100-6511170/">Nemesis</a>), a team deathmatch game mode, and a more extensive onboarding process for new players--all of which are also aimed at making the experience of playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> more approachable and easier to grasp.</p><p dir="ltr">Following a preview of everything to come in the new season, I spoke with design director Evan Nikolich, lead weapon designer Eric Canavese, and lead legend designer Devan McGuire about this wonderfully fresh direction. We discussed why making a rival to the meta-dominating R-301 and Flatline isn't as straightforward as buffing or changing one of the other existing assault rifles, how the team arrived at the five new character classes--Assault, Skirmisher, Support, Controller, and Recon--and why the team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-sunsets-arenas-adds-tdm-playlists-to-apex-legends/1100-6511167/">sunsetting Apex Legends' sweatiest game mode, Arenas</a>, and adding a brand-new Mixtape playlist and TDM mode in its place.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It seems like Season 16 is introducing a lot of cool gameplay changes--both in how players utilize individual characters, the approachability of the game as a whole for new players, and what modes are available to play. How will the narrative and storytelling also evolve this season, if at all?</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-is-an-ideal-on-ramp-for-new-players/1100-6511254/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

February makes switch back to four freebies, but we wouldn't expect this to become the norm.</p><p>It seems likely that an exception to the rule was made because of the looming launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-is-nerfing-resilience/1100-6510807/">Destiny 2: Lightfall</a>, a brand-new major expansion that arrives on February 28.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> throws a lot at you as you play the game, and some things may be easier than others to pick up on. So it can often be easy to forget a few things here and there. But don't worry because we've got your back with 11 tips and tricks that'll make your wizarding adventures a bit easier no matter what difficulty you're playing on. From how to easily spot collectibles to keeping your Galleon balance healthy, here's how to get a running start at Hogwarts.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Listen for the chime when using Revelio</h2><p>Reveilo is a spell you get early in-game--think of it like magic Detective Vision--and it'll quickly become your best friend. What makes this spell stand out from the others is that it'll reveal everything that's nearby you. Lootable items will be gold, enemies will be red, and puzzle items will appear blue. Even collectibles may briefly reveal themselves visually, but the chime you may hear when pinging your immediate area is location-based, so follow the noise to often find hidden items like Guide Pages, gear, or puzzles to solve.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch your step</h2><p dir="ltr">Yes, even though you are a wizard who can make something appear out of nothing, that doesn't mean a large cliff can't hurt you. Although the game does a good job of setting up invisible walls in specific areas to avoid this, some areas still allow you to fall from a great distance. If you're going to take a shortcut, make sure you have the potions to heal yourself.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-tips-11-ways-to-succeed-at-magic-school/1100-6511256/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Throughout your adventures in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, you'll encounter locked doors you can't enter and locked chests you can't open. Although these doors may be inaccessible then, they won't always be. More often than not it's well worth your time and effort to unlock these doors and chests because they all contain loot that can be used in-game. Here's everything you'll need to know about opening locked doors and chests in Hogwarts Legacy</p><h2 dir="ltr">When can I open locked doors?</h2><p dir="ltr">To open a locked door, you'll have to first play through a bit of the main story. Specifically, you'll have to play through roughly the first 20 main quests. When you're able to play <strong>The Caretaker's Lunar Lament</strong> quest, you'll be rewarded with the <strong>Alohomora</strong> (lockpicking) spell. This will grant you the ability to unlock Level 1 doors and chests.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to open higher-level locked doors</h2><p dir="ltr">When you first learn Alohomora, you'll only be able to pick Level 1 locks. If you want to open level 2 and 3 locks, you'll have to find as many as 30 Demiguise Statues around the game world. This will level up your spell, allowing you to unlock higher-level doors. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-how-to-unlock-doors-and-chests/1100-6511253/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of the most talked-about advancements to technology in recent years has been AI and ChatGPT specifically. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has shared his thoughts on the technology, and he doesn't believe it's going to help any other developer make a GTA-killer anytime soon.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-think-artificial-intelligence-will-ever-make-a-better-grand-theft-auto">Speaking to IGN</a>, Zelnick said it's a "very exciting era" for "new tools" that game developers can use to make games more efficiently. And while something like ChatGPT might have some level of applicability to game development, it won't help one of Rockstar's competitors dethrone GTA so easily.</p><p>"It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Since 1976, the Rocky franchise has been quintessential American mythmaking. The tale of a washed-up, down-on-his-luck boxer, who had a one-in-a-million shot to become champion of the world, won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And although the subsequent five sequels were nowhere near as critically acclaimed, they cemented the Rocky Balboa character in pop culture, as an All-American hero that would beat up the bullies and take on the Soviet Union single-handedly. It was cheesy, jingoistic, and ridiculous, but in a way that audiences loved, especially in the 1980s.</p><p dir="ltr">After six Rocky movies (the last of which was a prolonged, redemptive apology for the fifth movie), most moviegoers thought the Rocky franchise was finished. But in 2015, we got Creed, which starred Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Sylvester Stallone returned as Rocky, who coaches his best friend's son. Creed was a massive success; even four decades on, the Rocky formula still captures people's imaginations.</p><p dir="ltr">Creed II followed in 2018, pitting Adonis against Viktor Drago, the son of Rocky IV antagonist Ivan Drago. And this year, we have Creed III--an opportunity for Donnie to define himself apart from Rocky, and perhaps take this franchise in a new direction.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/creed-iii-latest-trailer-cast-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-rocky-franchise-movie/1100-6511249/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you haven't picked up the excellent Dead Space remake yet, Amazon's new promotion is certainly worth checking out. The retailer is hosting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A19T7R0NMJ6SUE?tag=gamespot-promos-20"><strong>buy one, get one for 50% off deal</strong></a> that features a select batch of video games, including <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGVTBWJP?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Dead Space</a></strong> for PS5 and Xbox Series X. You simply add two eligible items to your cart, and the lower-priced product will adjust to 50% off its advertised price.</p><p>Though the list of games isn't extensive, there are some intriguing options. You could keep your survival-horror fun going by pairing Dead Space with <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RHS5C2?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The Callisto Protocol</a></strong>, a game that was inspired by the Dead Space franchise. The Callisto Protocol received mixed reviews when it launched in December, but securing a copy for $35 is a nice deal.</p><p>Similarly, the recently released Square Enix role-playing game <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NBBW4LS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Forspoken</a></strong> is up for grabs. Once again, Forspoken garnered a wide range of critical responses, but the 50% off deal might be appealing to those who are curious to try it while limiting their investment.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-dead-space-get-another-new-release-for-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6511245/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Bayonetta Origins: Cereza And The Lost Demon Is A Dramatic Departure From Bayonetta

<p dir="ltr">Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon was a surprising inclusion in last year's The Game Awards--a Bayonetta spin-off that eschewed the series' leather-clad heroine and her gothic-inspired combat chops in favor of a bright action-adventure game. However surprised you were to see the game debut, though, it's even more surprising to play it. While Bayonetta Origins ties thematically and chronologically to Bayonetta, the experience of playing it is so wholly different as to be almost unrecognizable. Judging by my hands-on time with the game, this looks to be a sweet-natured, relaxed affair.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, the game Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon reminds me of the most is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. That 2013 game from a pre-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed-it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year/1100-6498845/">Game Awards winning Josef Fares</a> centered around a pair of siblings navigating a fraught forest with asymmetrical abilities. Even the premise of the two games is remarkably similar. In Brothers, you were on a journey to find a magical cure for your father, while in Bayonetta Origins, you're looking to help your ailing mother.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fares is now known for his co-op games, Brothers was single-player, and you controlled the two characters independently with the dual sticks. That's the case in Bayonetta Origins as well: The left stick controls Cereza, while the right stick controls Cheshire, a demon that has taken up residence within her stuffed cat. In theory, and thanks to the Switch's detachable Joy-Con controllers, you could hand one off to a friend and play cooperatively, but it's obviously meant to be a single-player experience.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-is-a-dramatic-departure-from-bayonetta/1100-6511209/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Here's What You Need To Know About Strand Before Lightfall Launches

<p>Destiny 2: Lightfall, which launches February 28, brings players another Darkness subclass called Strand that's all about telekinesis. Before swinging into Lightfall, we have the essential information players need about new abilities, mechanics, customizing Strand, and the grind for subclass upgrades. We had the opportunity to learn more about Strand during a group interview with Destiny 2's combat systems design lead Kevin Yanes and gameplay feature lead Eric Smith, and the studio has also released a new trailer and blog, as outlined below.</p><h2>Tangles and Grapples</h2><p>Firstly, the crux of this new Darkness subclass is that the Guardian weaves Strand to unravel enemies, and that action creates a Tangle. Smith explains, "any Strand-debuffed enemy that you defeat is going to turn into a Tangle when you kill them." Players can shoot at Tangles to damage nearby enemies or throw Tangles at targets. Also, Tangles are multipurpose, not only serving as a way to damage enemies, but also doubling as an anchor point when using the new grappling hook system.</p><figure style="width: 1652px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1655/16554081/4095230-grappletangles_destiny2_lightfall.jpg"><img alt="A Guardian grappling onto Tangles in the air." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1655/16554081/4095230-grappletangles_destiny2_lightfall.jpg" /></a><figcaption>A Guardian grappling onto Tangles in the air.</figcaption></figure><p>Grappling is a new movement mechanic--available to all Strand subclasses--that lets players latch onto a surface or create an anchor point in the air, first pulling then propelling them, like swinging from paracasual vines. Although this ability uses the grenade button, players can hook onto grapple Tangles to save their grenade energy. Smith says, "I think in the Lightfall campaign specifically, [the level design] was definitely affected by grapple or grapple Tangles scattered throughout Neomuna. Grapple Tangles are like normal tangles, but they're more ethereal, so you can't pick up and throw them for an explosive, but you can still grapple to them for free," making it easier chain grapples, adding "there are sections of Lightfall where we're grappling to moving objects, vehicles to kind of pull ourselves around the environment."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-strand-before-lightfall-launches/1100-6511205/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Velan Studios has announced Hot Wheels: Rift Rally for iOS, PS5, and PS4, a mixed reality racing game where players can remotely control a car through a race track set up inside their very home. If that sounds familiar to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-live-home-circuit/">Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</a> game, that's no accident, as Velan Studios was the developer behind it.</p><p>For Rift Rally, the studio will be using the technology that helped it bring Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit to life a few years ago, but with a Hot Wheels spin. The game package includes the Chameleon RC car, which can digitally transform into one of 22 core vehicles and more than 140 vehicle variations such as the Twin Mill, Bone Shaker, Mach Speeder, and Gotta Go, while the core gameplay will focus on custom tracks, multiplayer, and new cross-platform features.</p><p>Similar to Mario Kart Live's RC kart, the Rift Rally car comes equipped with a 1080p onboard camera and a battery life of around two hours. The RC car has working headlights, brake lights, engine belts, and fans, and when active, the camera feeds back a live version of your racing area that has been designed to look like a Hot Wheels track. In Campaign mode, players can set up Rift Gates to create a mixed reality track and explore different challenge maps, each one having multiple challenges to complete. In Stunt mode, players drive while chaining together drifts, wheelies, and burnouts to hit high scores and earn rewards.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-live-creators-are-taking-on-hot-wheels-next/1100-6511231/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nintendo has revealed its financial results for the previous nine months, ending on December 31, 2022, and while revenue did experience a dip across the board, the Switch reached a new milestone. Net sales were down 2% year-on-year to $9.4 billion, while mobile and IP-related income dipped by 2.3%, earning Nintendo $295 million from that section.</p><p>Nintendo sold 5.22 million base Switch console units during this period versus 11.79 million during the same period the previous year, a 55.7% drop year-on-year <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/">according to its briefing</a>. In comparison, sales of the Switch OLED model increased by 92.5% year-on-year, going from 3.99 million units sold the year before to 7.69 million units sold in 2022. As for the Switch Lite, it saw a 37% drop year-on-year, selling just 2 million units during this nine-month period. Combined, this accounts for 14.91 million Switch consoles sold during this window.</p><p>For the future, the company is being cautious <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sales-pass-114-million-but-company-expects-to-sell-fewer-units-this-fiscal-year/1100-6508983/">and has adjusted its expectations for 2023</a> after hardware sales did not perform as expected during the holiday season. Nintendo is estimating that it'll sell 18 million Switch consoles (down from 19 million) and 205 million game copies (down from 210 million) during its full fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 2023.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sales-are-on-the-decline-but-the-console-has-hit-a-new-record/1100-6511233/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted that the company could potentially develop a high-end version of the iPhone in the future. In an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-02-05/is-an-iphone-ultra-or-iphone-fold-coming-from-apple-ceo-remarks-offer-clues-ldrhx53a">Bloomberg</a>) addressing holiday results, Cook responded to a query about the rising cost of iPhones and if Apple could sustain its business model.</p><p>"I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category," Cook said, while adding that upscaled iPhones made sense. How different a proposed Ultra--similar to Apple's label for its high-spec smartwatch--model of the iPhone could be when compared to the current top-tier Pro Max smartphone is unclear, but it'll likely offer better cameras, more storage capacity, and other futureproofed ideas for a considerable price.</p><p>The iPhone 14 Pro Max for example, can cost up to $1,600 for the version that has 1TB of storage space, a massive increase when compared to Apple's iPhone X with 256GB of storage that was released in 2017 for $1,150. High-spec smartphones aren't uncommon, with Apple's biggest rival Samsung having its own Ultra line of hardware that offers a substantial amount of extra hardware when compared to standard phones from the brand.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-ultra-iphone-model-might-be-coming/1100-6511232/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the most acclaimed Star Wars games ever, but many felt that it still had some room for improvement, especially in its exploration elements. In a recent interview, a key creative working on the game said that developer Respawn is adding fast travel and rideable mounts to the game in order to cut down on backtracking.</p><p dir="ltr">“We will feature both fast travel and rideable creatures to help players quickly get from point A to B, and back to A,” director Stig Asmussen <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-will-feature-both-fast-travel-and-rideable-creatures/">told Play Magazine</a>. “The fast travel is point to point, and the rideable creatures offer a way to quickly negotiate between points and explore what is in between.”</p><p dir="ltr">Fallen Order was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/ge2ax0/still_no_fast_travel/">criticized</a> at the time for its lack of fast travel and the amount of backtracking required to fully explore its levels. Many pointed to the game's map as a significant barrier, as they found it difficult to figure out where to go next. Since we know that Respawn is planning to make larger, more involved worlds in Jedi: Survivor, it's a change that will likely do a lot of good in the long run.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-adds-fast-travel-and-rideable-creatures/1100-6511214/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, much like the novels and movies, has four Houses for you to choose from: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Naturally, you'll want to select the one that you truly prefer. Still, you might want to know if there are clear distinctions among the options. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you choose the right House and learn about their key differences.</p><h2>The Sorting Ceremony in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><p>You'll get to choose a House in Hogwarts Legacy early in the campaign. This occurs after a lengthy introductory chapter, which eventually leads you to the Sorting Ceremony that's underway. Once the Sorting Hat is placed on your character's head, you'll be able to make your selection based on a trait that most represents you (i.e., Daring for Gryffindor, Ambition for Slytherin, Curiosity for Ravenclaw, and Loyalty for Hufflepuff).</p><p>Do note that this can also be influenced by completing a <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/legacyconnect">Wizarding World quiz</a> and linking your WB Games account, though you can still make the necessary changes based on your preference.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-which-house-pick-differences-guide/1100-6511220/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A battle pass isn't the only live-service staple Blizzard is implementing into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>.

So far, the studio has only revealed one item: a Doomfist skin inspired by One Punch Man protagonist Saitama. The blog post stated the studio plans on revealing additional items leading up to the collaboration's release on March 7, with one of the cosmetics being a Legendary skin players can earn through a series of themed challenges.</p><p>Though this isn't the first time an established character entered Overwatch as a skin for one of its heroes--Orisa, Widowmaker, Torbjorn, Doomfish, Zarya, and Roadhog have all received skins based off of other Blizzard properties--this collaboration marks the first time Blizzard has recruited licensed characters from outside the company. However, while it might be a first for the studio, the move is not entirely unexpected.
