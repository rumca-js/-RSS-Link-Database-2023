<p>For one night only, Disney’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html"><ins>breakout Star Wars series</ins></a> is coming to cable TV. Ahead of the premiere of the third season of <em>The Mandalorian</em> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mandalorian-season-3-arrives-on-march-1st-063057873.html"><ins>March 1st</ins></a>, Disney <a href="https://abc.com/shows/coming-to-disney-plus/news/disney-plus-updates/watch-the-mandalorian-broadcast-tv-premiere-on-abc-freefrom-fx-and-stream-on-disney-plus"><ins>announced today</ins></a> it would air the show’s debut episode, “Chapter 1: The Mandalorian,” on February 24th. If you somehow haven’t seen the series before, you can catch the episode that started it all on ABC, Freeform or FX. All three stations will air the 41-minute debut at 8PM ET/PT.</p><p>If you’ve managed to avoid spoilers for <em>The Mandalorian </em>until now, first of all, great job; it couldn’t have been easy. Second, we won’t ruin the surprise, but the debut episode is a great taste of what made the first season of the series feel so special. It has a bit of everything that people came to love about <em>The Mandalorian</em>, including witty dialogue, fun action set pieces and, of course, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-mandalorian-baby-yoda-gifs-return-to-giphy.html"><ins>certain cute alien</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn’t the first time Disney has brought a Disney+ exclusive to TV. The company previously aired two episodes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-bringing-andor-to-tv-and-hulu-193448433.html"><em><ins>Andor</ins></em></a> on ABC, Freeform and FX when it seemed that series was struggling to find an audience. Considering the company recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-streaming-services-earnings-055415800.html"><ins>lost $1.5 billion</ins></a> on its streaming services, bringing <em>The Mandalorian </em>to broadcast TV makes a lot of sense as an effort to attract subscribers to Disney+.</p>

## Microsoft's new Bing and Edge hands-on: Surprisingly well-integrated AI

<p>The age of generative AI is upon us, and this week alone Google and Microsoft made major announcements around their respective products for the masses. While Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">unveiled an &quot;experimental conversational AI service&quot; called Bard yesterday</a>, Microsoft had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ai-news-event-live-feed-updates-liveblog-chatgpt-openai-170049702.html">fuller slate of news</a> to share at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surprise-event-bing-chatgpt-201414297.html">event in Redmond, WA today</a>. Through a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is adding more advanced AI conversation models to power updates to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">Bing</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-ai-copilot-184033427.html">Edge</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company's keynote today happened at breakneck pace, with demos whizzing by so quickly there was barely enough time to make sense of the updates. Thankfully, I was able to briefly check out a full demo here with Dena Saunders from Bing Engineering. It was nice to see everything at a more comprehensible pace, but it was unfortunately restricted to a set of scripted examples. I'll be getting access to the preview through my own whitelisted accounts in a bit so I will be updating this post with my personal impressions, but for now, I can break down at least what the updates look like on a demo computer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In general, there are four new areas of change coming to Bing (and we'll get to Edge later): Search, Answers, Chat and Create. The first update is the new search box. Instead of your typical long, one-line bar, there is now a box more similar to those on Twitter or Facebook that prompts you to ask Bing anything. The character limit is now 1,000. The idea is to make the process of looking for answers something more conversational — similar to Google's approach for years now.&nbsp;</p><p>When you submit your query, results are now displayed a bit differently. On the left is a column with your typical &quot;answers&quot; just like how you see it on Bing now. On the right, however, is a box that explains how the system found those answers. I initially thought this was similar to what Google does in its &quot;About this search&quot; panels, but I was wrong. This box is a home for the AI and fills up with text that appears in real time, complete with animation and a &quot;Stop responding&quot; button in case you don't have the patience to see the AI's explanation.&nbsp;</p><p>The third and fourth parts are the more interesting updates. Chat, for example, is a new way you can get solutions to the problems you're looking to solve. You can access the Chat page from the Bing results page by tapping the Chat button above the answers or by scrolling up (swiping down on touchscreens).&nbsp;</p><p><em>This story is developing, please refresh for updates.</em></p>

<p>You can add <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/zoom/"><ins>Zoom</ins></a> to the long list of major tech companies that have laid off employees in recent times. It's letting go around 1,300 employees, which equates to 15 percent of the workforce.</p><p>In <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-from-eric-yuan-ceo-of-zoom/"><ins>a note to staff</ins></a>, CEO Eric Yuan indicated that the company expanded its headcount too quickly after Zoom's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-for-home-130020632.html">pandemic-driven boom</a> — it tripled in size in the space of two years. &quot;We didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities,&quot; Yuan wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>He noted that even though many folks have returned to the office, people and companies are still relying on Zoom. That said, Yuan said that amid a rocky economic climate, &quot;we need to take a hard — yet important — look inward to reset ourselves so we can weather the economic environment, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom’s long-term vision.&quot;</p><p>Yuan said he was taking accountability for the layoffs. He's reducing his salary for the upcoming fiscal year by 98 percent and the executive team will forego 20 percent of their base salaries. All will forfeit their corporate bonuses for fiscal year 2023 (i.e., the 2022 calendar year).</p><p>Zoom employees in the US who are being let go will receive up to 16 weeks' salary and healthcare coverage, their earned fiscal year 2023 bonus, stock option vesting for six months and help to find a new job. The company said laid-off workers outside the US will get similar support based on local laws.</p><p>Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Dell and Spotify are among the other major tech companies that have this year announced sweeping layoffs or plans to let go more staff than they originally planned. We're keeping a running tally of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-layoffs-183005204.html"><ins>the big tech layoffs of 2023</ins></a>, which is becoming an increasingly sobering list.</p>

<p>Microsoft's use of AI on the web will extend beyond <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">smarter Bing searches</a>. The company is <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/">updating</a> its Edge browser with an &quot;AI-powered copilot&quot; that assists with everyday tasks. Integration with the new Bing can help you get the key takeaways from a document, compare content and even draft posts (such as on LinkedIn) with a specific tone.</p><p>Both Bing and the updated Edge are based around a new AI model, Prometheus, built with the help of OpenAI. While it draws some lessons from the popular ChatGPT conversational AI, it's billed as more powerful and optimized for search. Microsoft also claims it's a &quot;responsible&quot; platform where protections against abuse and errors exist at every level.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

## Microsoft’s next-gen Bing uses a ‘much more powerful’ language model than ChatGPT

<p>Microsoft's oft-forgotten search engine is about to get a new lease on life. As expected, the tech giant announced on Tuesday that it is partnering with OpenAI to enhance Bing with the company's AI technology. However, Microsoft also had a surprise up its sleeve: the next release of Bing will feature a new next-generation large language model the company claims is &quot;much more powerful&quot; than ChatGPT and designed specifically to excel at search. The new Bing offers a chat function and an expanded search bar that allows you to input up to a thousand characters.</p><p>Underpinning the search engine is a new proprietary technology Microsoft is calling the Prometheus Model. Among the benefits of Prometheus are more relevant search results, according to the company. Microsoft claims the model will also make using Bing safer and allow the company to update search results more quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Bing's new " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/681984f0-a718-11ed-b9b7-796d069328e5" style="height: 1080; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>In one demo Microsoft showed off during the event, Yusuf Mehdi, the company's consumer chief marketing officer, asked Bing to compare the most influential Mexican artists and their most well-known paintings. Bing displayed its response in a new side panel that featured annotations and weblinks. Later, Mehdi asked the search engine to compare three pet vacuums while listing the pros and cons of each model. Mehdi said Bing can also help with questions where there might not be a precise answer. That said, in instances where Bing doesn't know the answer to a query, the search engine will still try to point you to useful information. Microsoft is also adding a button to allow users to share feedback on the search engine's new functionality. &quot;I think of this as Search with your own personal helper,&quot; Mehdi said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

## Microsoft will wipe free Teams business users' data if they don't upgrade to a paid tier

<p>Now that Microsoft has launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-premium-openai-artificial-intelligence-152658424.html">Teams Premium</a> service, it's shaking up the free offering for work — and not everyone will be happy.

Anything you haven't saved by then will be gone, including shared files you haven't downloaded.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Microsoft for comment. This won't affect personal use, but it could prove to be a headache for small firms that previously relied on the free Teams to coordinate. They'll either have to start paying or they'll lose access to past discussions, not to mention deal with the headache of recreating their channel setups. This won't necessarily lead customers to switch to alternatives <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-canvas-share-resources-huddles-120003868.html">like Slack</a>, particularly if they're heavily invested in Microsoft's ecosystem. It might, however, prompt outfits to reevaluate their plans if they can't justify many paid services.</p>

## Former Coinbase employee pleads guilty to insider trading charges

<p>A former product manager at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/coinbase/"><ins>Coinbase</ins></a> has pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in what's believed to be the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/insider-trading-crypto-asset-charges-203603211.html"><ins>crypto-related insider trading case</ins></a> in the US. Ishan Wahi initially pleaded not guilty last year.</p><p>Federal prosecutors claim that, on at least 14 occasions, Wahi shared confidential information with his brother Nikhil Wahi and friend Sammer Ramani about cryptocurrencies that Coinbase was planning to let its users trade so the pair could buy them in advance. Once Coinbase announced that it would list the tokens, their values rose. Nikhil Wahi and Ramani are said to have then sold the assets to make a profit. The scheme allegedly generated north of $1.5 million in ill-gotten gains.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ramani has not been apprehended. Nikhil Wahi pleaded guilty to a wire fraud conspiracy charge in September and was last month sentenced to 10 months in prison. Ishan Wahi faces a prison sentence of between 36 and 47 months as part of his plea deal, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-coinbase-manager-pleads-guilty-144602987.html"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. He'll be sentenced in May.</p><p>Along with the criminal charges, Wahi faced a civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission. He asked a judge this week to dismiss the suit, having claimed that the cryptocurrency tokens in question are not securities, meaning they would not be subject to SEC regulation.</p>

## Can TikTok convince the US it’s not a national security threat?

<p>TikTok is, once again, facing an uncertain future. The company has spent the last two years quietly negotiating with US government officials in order to avoid an outright ban. But that process has now stalled, and calls for a ban have only intensified.</p><p>Next month, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-ceo-congress-shou-zi-chew-privacy-security-china-201928160.html">testify</a> at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, his first Congressional appearance. Many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-house-tiktok-ban-bill-anti-social-ccp-act-205120387.html">lawmakers</a> have called for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-michael-bennet-tiktok-apple-google-ban-005604950.html">more sweeping</a> ban, and will likely quiz Chew about TikTok’s alleged risks to national security, and its parent company’s Chinese ownership.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok has long denied that it’s a threat, and downplays its ties to China. But now the company is also trying a new tactic to prove it has nothing to hide: its Transparency and Accountability Center. The company first introduced the idea <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-tiktok-us-transparency-center-spying-security-threat.html">in 2020</a>, but the actual facility didn’t open until recently due to COVID-related delays. Last week, the company took a handful of reporters on a tour of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tikttok-strike-system-transparency-140033358.html">the center</a> as part of a new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8yNi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3Rpa3Rvay1ieXRlZGFuY2UtZGF0YS1zZWN1cml0eS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMjkzZTAxZS0yZDNjLTQ2ZmYtODcyYS04YTFkZTNkMjY1Y2MifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUjpkcLCymErg4vlwEyV7hurtDI0uAZv-beJE2nlLXUv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F01%2F26%2Ftechnology%2Ftiktok-bytedance-data-security.html">charm offensive</a> as it tries to fend off regulators and the looming prospect of more bans in the United States.</p><figure><img alt="An interior shot of TikTok's Transparency and Accountability Center, a windowless office with rooms dedicated to the app's algorithm and content moderation systems." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/81e04420-a67b-11ed-af0d-26f75decb27c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell / Engadget</div></figure><p>The first thing you notice when you walk in is that, despite being  dedicated to “transparency,” there are no windows in the space, which is housed in an office park near TikTok’s Culver City US HQ. Instead, visitors are greeted with neon-lit signs and big, interactive displays dedicated to explaining various aspects of the app.</p><p>The company hopes visitors will walk away with a better understanding of how the app operates and, perhaps, less suspicion. “We really do understand the critique that big media, big tech, plays as it relates to how algorithms work, how moderation policies work and the data flows of the systems,” says TikTok COO Vanessa Pappas. “A lot of these are unprecedented levels of transparency that we're providing.”</p><p>What you’ll actually learn by touring the center, though, largely depends on how much you already know about TikTok when you walk in the door. It’s primarily dedicated to explaining the app’s content moderation policies, and how it handles recommendations, both of which have been heavily scrutinized.</p><p>There are two interactive exhibits: a “moderation station,” where visitors can play the role of a TikTok content moderator, and another room that’s meant to “demystify” the app’s vaunted recommendation algorithm.</p><p>In the moderation room, you can watch sample videos — presented in an interface similar to what TikTok’s actual content moderators see — and try your hand at judging which ones violate the app’s rules. Meanwhile, the room next door is dedicated to “the algorithm.” It’s more of an illustrated FAQ that offers fairly broad explanations to high-level questions about how the app recommends content. The content is more detailed than TikTok’s extremely vague <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-will-explain-recommendations-algorithm-for-you-page-130016909.html">in-app</a> explanations, but that’s not saying much. For example, under the heading “What information does TikTok use to create personalized experiences?” it explains that users’ interactions with content are tracked to inform the underlying recommendation model. That might be useful info if you know nothing about how algorithms work, but it doesn’t tell you very much about TikTok.</p><p>Each explanation is also accompanied by a visualization and a snippet of “simulated code” — the company tightly controls who can view the app’s actual source code — to illustrate what’s happening at various stages of the recommendations process. But again, this felt like it was more designed for people who know nothing about TikTok rather than those who are trying to understand the nuances of its algorithm. There is a space at the transparency center, a server room behind a neon "LATC" sign, where auditors can enter and — after heavy security — dig into TikTok's actual source code. But the vast majority of visitors to the center will never make into that room.</p><p>Overall, I can see how the tour might be a worthwhile exercise for lawmakers, who too often show they know <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb25ncmVzcy10ZWNoLXJlZ3VsYXRpb24uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzI5M2UwMWUtMmQzYy00NmZmLTg3MmEtOGExZGUzZDI2NWNjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQkg8hT_1zqLq28lXzylQcdJ48ESNntZfCntjgJnWVmM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2Fbusiness%2Fcongress-tech-regulation.html">shockingly little</a> about how the internet works. But it also feels a bit performative, and I can’t help but remember Facebook’s infamous “war room” tour, when it invited reporters to visit a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-18-facebooks-war-room-ad.html">conference room</a> dedicated to safeguarding elections only to shut it down <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/facebook-wont-use-its-war-room-for-future-elections-report-says.html">a month</a> later.</p><p>To be clear, TikTok does intend for the transparency center to be a permanent fixture. And the company plans to open more of them in other locations around the world. But while these facilities may help Boomer lawmakers and regulators understand what TikTok is, I’m not sure they will be able to dispel the perception that there's something <em>else</em>, something more secretive, going on within the company. It’s one thing to illustrate how TikTok’s algorithm works at a high level, but it’s another to prove that something <em>isn’t</em> happening.</p><figure><img alt="A neon " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ce48d020-a67b-11ed-ae7b-7e491378d438" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s notable, then, that TikTok’s Transparency Center doesn’t address some of the biggest concerns that have been raised about TikToK: its relationship with parent company Bytedance and whether the Chinese government could somehow take advantage of the relationship to advance its interests. “If you fundamentally distrust the autocratic Chinese government, and how it uses its relationship with large Chinese-based corporations to extend its influence around the world, then all the promises TikTok can pile up are not going to completely allay your anxiety about TikTok,” Paul Barrett, the deputy director of NYU's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, told Engadget.</p><p>TikTok does, however, have a plan to address government concerns that it could be a national security threat. The company has been locked in negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for more than two years over its future in the US. And it struck a deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-user-data-us-200500287.html">with Oracle</a> last year to safeguard US user data as part of this effort, known as “Project Texas,” to reassure US officials.</p><p>Until now, TikTok has been fairly tight-lipped about Project Texas and its dealings with CFIUS.  But now that those talks have stalled — despite TikTok claiming it’s addressed every concern raised by regulators — the company has been cautiously sharing<a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/project-texas-details-tiktoks-plan-remain-operational-united-states"> more details</a> about its arrangements with Oracle.</p><p>Reporters who attended the tour were given an overview of the plan, but were asked not to directly quote the executives who described it.</p><p>Central to the plan is a new US subsidiary called TikTok US Data Security (USDS), which will have an independent board of CFIUS-approved directors with national security and cybersecurity backgrounds. On the TikTok side, there will be two executives running the US subsidiary, who will report to the board.</p><figure><img alt="Interactive displays that are part of the " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/1a4960a0-a67e-11ed-b9e7-8b6720311677" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TikTok</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, all US user data will be housed within Oracle’s Cloud infrastructure with strict controls to prevent unauthorized access and to keep most data from leaving. (Some data about what US users are doing will inevitably have to leave in order to, for example, allow people to interact with content and users from other countries.) Oracle will also review TikTok’s entire source code, as will a separate, outside auditor. Future app updates will also be inspected by Oracle, which will take over responsibility for sending updates to the app stores. Oracle will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oracle-tiktok-algorithms-content-moderation-review-171742979.html">also monitor</a> TikTok’s recommendation algorithm and content moderation systems. The US government, via CFIUS, will continue to have visibility and oversight into what USDS is doing on an ongoing basis.</p><p>TikTok says they are confident these steps address every issue that’s been raised about what TikTok could <em>potentially</em> be doing. Executives also point out that the company has already dedicated an astonishing amount of money — $1.5 billion — and resources to Project Texas. If all that’s good enough for CFIUS, they say, it should be good enough for Congress.</p><p>Whether lawmakers will be satisfied with any scenario that allows TikTok to operate in the United States without being fully divested from ByteDance, though, remains to be seen. “They [TikTok] can make all of these arrangements, and put in place all these safeguards, almost to infinity,” Barrett says. “And it's not clear to me that that would satisfy China hawks in the United States.”</p><p>That’s partly because TikTok is a convenient punching bag for lawmakers who want to appear tough on China. But there are also legitimate reasons to be concerned about TikTok. ByteDance recently fired <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-employees-us-user-data-journalists-210339650.html">four employees</a> who accessed the personal data of an American journalist who had reported on the company. TikTok also has a history of taking, at best, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">heavy handed</a> approach to content moderation that some have equated with censorship favorable to the Chinese government.</p><p>According to TikTok, Project Texas will ensure neither scenario can happen again. But the fact that it already has will undoubtedly lead to further questions about just how deep the company’s commitment to transparency and accountability really is.</p>

<p>Microsoft's set to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surprise-event-bing-chatgpt-201414297.html">an AI-related announcement today at 1pm ET</a>, but it will not be streaming the keynote to the public. Not to worry, though, we're here at the event in Redmond and will be liveblogging all the news the company is sharing today. After Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">unveiled its ChatGPT rival Bard yesterday</a>, Microsoft revealed it had been planning today's event all along, without disclosing many details beyond telling us to expect information about &quot;exciting projects.&quot; Thanks to a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1622689308829429760">tweet from OpenAI's Sam Altman</a>, though, we can at least guess that generative AI is on the agenda, if not the star of the show. We'll be starting this liveblog around 12:30pm ET, with myself (Cherlynn Low) on text and our head of video Brian Oh taking pictures. See you soon!</p><div id="f2aed2fc6167415e9d00d2b54d50eea2"></div><p></p>

## Razer's Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops are available tomorrow

<p>You didn't have to wait too long to get Razer's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-16-and-blade-18-hands-on-all-out-mobile-powerhouses-ces-2023-180043229.html">largest Blade systems</a> to date. The company has revealed that the new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=358591a8-2981-451c-a839-e645b5522820&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer+Online+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNTg1OTFhOC0yOTgxLTQ1MWMtYTgzOS1lNjQ1YjU1MjI4MjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL3Nob3AvcGMvZ2FtaW5nLWxhcHRvcHMvMTYtaW5jaC1sYXB0b3BzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZWY3OTllZi0wMzgwLTQwYmMtYWRkOC0yMGExZGU4MTFlMTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfjkLygP192gmco1smfYw6fCuef8BYgCVaIfzESKQpFQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fshop%2Fpc%2Fgaming-laptops%2F16-inch-laptops">Blade 16</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=358591a8-2981-451c-a839-e645b5522820&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer+Online+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNTg1OTFhOC0yOTgxLTQ1MWMtYTgzOS1lNjQ1YjU1MjI4MjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL3Nob3AvcGMvZ2FtaW5nLWxhcHRvcHMvMTgtaW5jaC1sYXB0b3BzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZWY3OTllZi0wMzgwLTQwYmMtYWRkOC0yMGExZGU4MTFlMTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUavSX-l9IgpC_KiVMi2oMs_tt2-11OsPN4V2KXiPNG4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fshop%2Fpc%2Fgaming-laptops%2F18-inch-laptops">Blade 18</a> gaming laptops will be available tomorrow, February 8th. The 16- and 18-inch systems respectively start at $2,700 and $2,900, although the configurations launching this week are strictly high-end models with RTX 4080 or 4090 graphics — you'll have to spend at least $3,600 ($3,800 for the 18-inch model) to get something quickly. The 'entry' variants with RTX 4060 or 4070 GPUs will be available February 22nd.</p><p>Each portable has its own set of tricks. The new Blade 16 has a unique dual-mode mini-LED display that can switch between a media-friendly 4K 120Hz picture and a gaming-oriented FHD+ (1,920 x 1,200) 240Hz image. The Blade 18, meanwhile, is a giant desktop replacement with a six-speaker spatial audio setup. Both use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-13th-gen-laptop-cpu-24-cores-140050825.html">13th-gen Intel Core i9 HX</a> processors, and their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-laptop-gpu-price-release-date-165006688.html">RTX 40 series mobile graphics</a> run at full power — a peak 175W for the RTX 4080 and 4090. You won't do much gaming on battery, then, but this could save you from buying a tower PC for demanding games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, Razer is updating its Synapse software to enable CPU overclocking on the Blade 16 and Blade 18. You can modify the core voltage, the maximum wattage for boost power and even the time that boost is allowed to run. Don't expect the results you'd get from overclocking a desktop (you're working within the limits of a laptop chassis), but this may help you squeeze some extra frames per second out of your machine.</p>

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/safesearch/">SafeSearch</a> switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18.</p><p>You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23589012/google-safesearch-blur-explicit-images-online-safety">blur violent images</a> as well).

The company says that if a user has a supported computer, they'll have the option to require biometric authentication before filling a saved password into a form. Google noted that folks can also use the feature to &quot;securely reveal, copy or edit passwords&quot; they have saved in the password manager without having to punch in their main password first.</p><p>The company says it's bolstering privacy protections in the Google app for iOS too.

The OnePlus Pad revolves around an 11.6-inch display with an unusual 7:5 aspect ratio and a speedy 144Hz refresh rate — this might be your pick if you're a gamer or avid reader. The design also stands out with an easier-to-grip "2.5D" edge and a central camera hump you're less likely to cover with your fingers.</p><p>Some technical details aren't available as we write this, but the OnePlus Pad will be reasonably quick thanks to MediaTek's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mediatek-dimensity-9200-phone-soc-080033338.html">Dimensity 9000</a> chip and up to 12GB of RAM. Battery life might be healthy, too. The 9,510mAh power pack reportedly offers up to 14.5 hours of video playback, and 67W SuperVOOC fast charging can top up the tablet in 80 minutes. Dolby Atmos, meanwhile, promises cinematic audio.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You won't have to hunt for accessories, either. The OnePlus Pad will ship with a pen (the Stylo) and a magnetic keyboard. The software will be familiar, although there are some appreciated touches if you also have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-10-pro-review-specs-price-camera-comparison-143032415.html">OnePlus phone</a>. The Pad can easily use a handset as a cellular data hotspot, for instance.</p><p>Don't expect to buy one right away. Release dates and pricing for the OnePlus Pad will be available in the "coming weeks," the company says. As such, it's too early to say if this represents a good value compared to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-8-review-in-a-class-of-its-own-132946024.html">Galaxy Tabs</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html">iPads</a> that dominate the higher-end tablet space.</p><figure><img alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46b25870-a649-11ed-9cb5-09c346af6560" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>Not that OnePlus is leaning solely on a tablet. The company has introduced the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, the expected sequel to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-buds-pro-anc-price-release-date-120008143.html">2021 wireless earbuds</a>. They're some of the first earbuds to support Android 13's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-spatial-audio-pixel-7-pixel-6-123543544.html">official spatial audio</a> implementation with compatible content, such as Disney+ and YouTube videos. If you have a OnePlus 11, you can expect Dolby Atmos support with head tracking.</p><p>Regardless of how you listen, audio quality is also a focus — complete with an unusual collaboration. OnePlus claims a studio-like sound thanks to dual drivers (with an 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter) developed with help from Dynaudio, and LHDC 4.0 Bluetooth audio that's close to wired fidelity. And if the usual custom equalizers aren't enough to fine-tune the characteristics, composer Hans Zimmer has created his own EQ, Soundscape, to emphasize the brighter tones and wider soundstages of movie soundtracks. Improved active noise cancellation (particularly for human voices) and lower-latency Bluetooth 5.3 LE are also available, and a 10-minute charge is enough to deliver 10 hours of listening (39 hours total with the case).</p><p>The Buds Pro 2 will be available in the US on February 16th for $179 (£179 in the UK). It's evident OnePlus is hoping to match or undercut competing products like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-170044941.html">Pixel Buds Pro</a> and <a href="https://search.engadget.com/click/_ylt=AwriirmPROFjOnYOgzp8BWVH;_ylu=Y29sbwNiZjEEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Nj/RV=2/RE=1675736335/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.engadget.com%2fairpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html/RK=2/RS=PUSiRwgDEmnvY6k1.MBD8aYqITs-">second-gen AirPods Pro</a>.</p><p>And yes, it wouldn't be a OnePlus announcement without teasing future hardware. The brand is hinting at plans to unveil both its first mechanical keyboard, the OnePlus Featuring Keyboard 81 Pro (a team-up with Keychron. below) and the OnePlus 11 Concept, a still-mysterious prototype phone with "imaginative" design and "industry-first" features. You won't hear more about these in earnest until Mobile World Congress in late February.</p><figure><img alt="OnePlus Featuring Keyboard 81 Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/fadfda90-a6fb-11ed-bbee-f022ecfe3fdf" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p></p>

## Bayonetta Origins hands-on: A charming tale of a witch and her demon cat

<p>Even though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bayonetta-3-review-130024141.html"><em>Bayonetta 3</em></a> just came out last fall, there’s already another entry in the franchise due out in March starring everyone’s favorite gun-toting witch. However, for its next release – <em>Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</em> – instead of a continuation of the story, PlatinumGames has created a prequel featuring a charming new art style and gameplay twists that shed light on a younger version of Cereza, before she became the over-the-top enchantress we know today.</p><p>After a short explanation of Bayonetta’s lineage, the game introduces its first major twist when it asks you to control both Cereza and her stuffed cat Cheshire, who serves as a vessel for a recently summoned demon. That’s because instead of switching between each character independently, you’re meant to control both at the same time, with the left Joy-Con responsible for maneuvering Cereza while the right Joy-Con is dedicated to directing her cat. (Don’t worry, you can also play the game with the Switch’s Pro Controller if you prefer.) So on top of the game throwing various puzzles or hack-and-slash encounters your way, you often have to do battle with your own mind as you try to get both sides of your brain on the same page.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="In Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, you control Cereza and her cat Chesire independently using via the Switch's left and right Joy-Con (or the left and right sides of a Pro controller)." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/55a33850-a6f2-11ed-bffb-fb4ce4e650c3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>For me, this setup drew immediate parallels to one of my favorite games from 2013, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-07-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons-review-do-not-separate.html"><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.</em></a> (Sorry youngins for the somewhat dated reference, but if you haven’t played Brothers, you should really give it a go.) Granted, <em>Brothers </em>is much more of a true puzzle platformer, but even after playing it for less than an hour, <em>Bayonetta Origins</em> delivered the same sort of deeply satisfying solo co-op vibes. Also, while Nintendo claims the title is meant to be a single-player experience, I get the sense that this might be just as fun/frustrating (maybe even more so) when played with a friend, with each person getting a single Joy-con.</p><p>Additionally, while the game’s controls are relatively simple and straightforward (due in part to its split controller layout), there’s a surprising amount of depth when it comes to combat and traversing obstacles. Typically, Cheshire serves as the muscle when battling forest spirits or other monsters, while Bayonetta relies on her witch powers to lock down and control enemies. That said, the two can work together, with Cheshire able to shrink down and serve as a grappling hook, allowing the pair to jump gaps and chasms. So despite the game’s slower pace compared to previous entries, getting your left and right hands to work together is still very rewarding. I also have to admit it’s just really cute seeing Cereza snuggle up with a demonic patchwork plushy, who despite its hatred of cuddling, needs to be close to the witch in order to survive.</p><figure><img alt="In Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, you'll need to rely on Cereza's spells to lock down and manipulate opponents while her demon cat Cheshire handles melee combat. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/b5e39200-a6f2-11ed-bf6f-cb068b8c72c8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Another departure from other Bayonetta titles is the game’s art style, which has ditched its anime-inspired origins for a more storybook aesthetic – and it looks absolutely fantastic. When combined with a younger version of Cereza that’s still figuring out her place in the world, the game feels more like a new-age fairy tale than the eccentric action-packed circus we’ve seen in earlier games.</p><p>And while I only had a short time with <em>Bayonetta Origins</em>, perhaps my biggest surprise was how quickly I became engrossed in the game. That’s because while the bombastic nature of previous entries in the franchise is more my style, Cereza’s latest adventure offers a very charming and downright wholesome take on the series. So for all of the Bayonetta fans who might have been put off by this installment’s design or visuals, you might want to rethink that stance and give <em>Cereza and the Demon</em> a chance when it officially comes out on March 17th.</p><figure><img alt="The demon trapped inside Cereza's stuffed cat does not enjoy being cuddled.

## ‘Hot Wheels: Rift Rally’ is another mixed reality racer from the makers of ‘Mario Kart Live’

<p><em>Hot Wheels: Rift Rally</em> is a new mixed reality game from Velan Studios, the creators of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-010006266.html"><em>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</em></a>. Like Nintendo’s 2020 title, you control a real RC car while your screen shows an augmented view from its cockpit. It will be available in March for PS5 / PS4 and iOS.</p><p>The game bundle includes one toy car, which you can drive in two modes: Campaign and Stunt. In Campaign, you set up gates around your room, which you drive the car through to complete the different maps (each includes unique challenges). Meanwhile, Stunt mode skips the gates, letting you drive wherever you want while performing digitally enhanced drifts, wheelies and burnouts to beat your high scores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It supports a solo campaign and multiplayer. When playing with a friend, they can bring their car for competitive racing or (on PlayStation only) play co-op using a single toy vehicle as the action switches between controllers.</p><figure><img alt="A toy RC car driving under a &#x00201c;gate&#x00201d; in a person&#x002019;s living room.

It includes “endless options” for digital customization, including performance mods that change how the car moves across your space; for example, adding an acceleration boost in-game will make the toy car drive faster. In addition, you can play various mini-games, puzzles and challenges to unlock new vehicles and mods.</p><p>Although the software is free to download, you’ll need to buy at least a $130 Standard Edition, which gets you the Chameleon car, four Rift gates and a charging cable. A $150 Collector’s Edition swaps in a “special edition” Chameleon while adding a (non-playable) McLaren Senna Hot Wheels die-cast toy. <em>Hot Wheels: Rift Rally</em> launches on March 14 and is available for <a href="https://www.riftrally.com/">pre-order</a> starting today.</p><div id="d6ff6b619cdb4d2a91cb988559157f52"></div><p></p>

## OnePlus 11 review: A back-to-basics flagship phone

<p>Last year’s OnePlus 10 Pro is set to be replaced by the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d8d4d385-7f93-4537-83d1-d5fb47d219ec&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OnePlus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkOGQ0ZDM4NS03ZjkzLTQ1MzctODNkMS1kNWZiNDdkMjE5ZWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25lcGx1cy5jb20vdXMvb25lcGx1cy0xMSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWIxOGU4MzMtNTRkNS00MTMxLWFmMTktODBiOWQxZTc3OTViIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAefle-07yH-3-lu0btYBoyou8H0RVWh8bKF_8Z1GDWYZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-11">OnePlus 11</a>. There won’t be a OnePlus 11 Pro, and there wasn’t a regular OnePlus 10. Things could be more straightforward, but what are you going to do? Barring any spinoffs, this is OnePlus’ flagship phone, the focus of all its attention, development budget and everything else. Leaks meant we knew what the OnePlus 11 would look like long before it was officially unveiled. It has everything we loved about OnePlus in the past: a powerful, high-end processor, a vivid screen and (after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">a brief diversion</a>) a competitive price tag ($699).</p><p>The OnePlus 11 launches the same week as a trio of phones from Samsung, the dominant Android phone player. The 2023 Galaxy S series has phones that are both bigger and smaller, pricier and cheaper, than OnePlus’ newest phone. Fortunately, this new flagship has one trick to stand out from Samsung’s new lineup: incredibly fast 100-watt charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="109598f7844d442aadcf38f1dbcfad42"></div><h2>Design</h2><figure><img alt="OnePlus 11 smartphone lying on a bamboo table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ed5d1f93-a624-11ed-b6d9-7c0e2e000a42" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>OnePlus has made some changes to the design.

This apparently led to a unibody slab with a stainless steel camera array. There are some fine details in the camera glass which gives it a little bit of a watch aesthetic, but it’s basically just another giant camera pop-out. The metal bezel protrudes slightly more than the glass, which should help avoid scratches. Initially, I thought it was a little too big and ostentatious, but it’s roughly equivalent to the unit on the iPhone 14 Pro – and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">Pixel 7 Pro</a>’s Cyclops camera bar is arguably even flashier.</p><p>The OnePlus 11 also answered the pleas of the OnePlus faithful by reintroducing its Alert Slider. If you haven’t seen it on previous phones, it’s a metal slider just above the power button on the right edge that swaps between silent, ring and vibrate modes. OnePlus claimed in previous years that the removal was due to space demands inside the phones and that the slider would make a return, so the company has at least fulfilled that promise to its fans. For the rest of us, I’m not sure we need it. Then again, I’m the kind of person that keeps my phone on silent pretty much all the time.</p><p>The phone comes in glossy gray-green (Eternal Green) and sparkling black (Titan Black) color options. I thought the black finish would have a gritty, 3D-printed feel to it, but it’s closer to slate – somehow smooth and grippy at the same time. I don’t understand the physics of it either. Meanwhile, the green version is a lot like last year’s phones. The shiny finish is unfortunately a canvas for all your fingerprints and smudges.</p><p>The OnePlus 11 has a gorgeous 6.7-inch 2,048 × 1,080 OLED screen that can reach up to 120Hz refresh rates. Once again, there’s an LTPO panel that can now dip low at 1Hz when the always-on display (AOD) is on. OnePlus claims that, compared with typical 30Hz AODs, OnePlus 11’s 1Hz AOD consumes 30 percent less power. Of course, it’s not using much power to begin with as an AOD, but could lead to a little more battery life in the long run, even if it’s not represented in our typical battery rundown tests. Aside from the upgraded AOD capabilities, this screen is otherwise identical to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-10-pro-review-specs-price-camera-comparison-143032415.html">OnePlus 10 Pro</a> – which isn’t a bad thing. It’s another area where OnePlus often goes toe-to-toe with the best smartphones out there, despite typically costing hundreds of dollars less.</p><p></p><h2>Camera</h2><figure><img alt="OnePlus 11 smartphone lying on a bamboo table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ed5d46a0-a624-11ed-bffe-369213966b6e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>The OnePlus 11’s primary camera is a new 50-megapixel sensor, with a f/1.8 aperture. It sounds similar to the OnePlus 10 Pro’s main camera, but uses a bigger 1/1.56-inch sensor.  This works alongside a 115-degree ultrawide 48MP camera that pulls double-duty for macro shots.</p><p>This time, OnePlus’ flagship has a 32MP telephoto camera, up from a measly 8MP on its predecessor. However, optical zoom tops out at 2x, while the lower-res OnePlus 10 Pro could punch in at up to 3.2x optical zoom. It’s an unusual change to make. Which is the better solution? While I didn’t have last year’s  OnePlus 10 Pro to compare directly with the OnePlus 11, the images didn’t seem as muted as I remember. Of course, they weren’t as magnified, but given the higher-resolution, I can always crop in without ruining the results too much. It’s pretty much a manual digital zoom, cropping like this, but you benefit from a better sensor before you crop away the excess megapixels.</p><figure><img alt="A photo of a blurred underground train running through a station." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/6d548290-a6e5-11ed-bff1-0988266d42a5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>The OnePlus 11’s camera array, what it calls its third-generation Hasselblad Camera, is improved, and still comes with some addictive filters for stills and video. However, It doesn’t quite reach the pinnacle of smartphone photography, led by the Galaxy S22 Ultra, iPhone 14 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro, though.</p><p>The OnePlus 11 seems to do its best work on landscape and street photography. There’s a Pro mode again, so you can dabble in RAW editing, but I was more than happy with the JPGs.  The OnePlus 11 also features an AI Highlight video mode. The phone uses image processing to maintain even levels of exposure when recording video and shifting between areas of different lighting. I tested it out on a sunny afternoon, on a bridge, but I didn’t see too many tangible benefits to overexposure. It works a little better when you’re filming in a mostly dark situation, but, oddly, this is meant to be the standout software feature for this year’s OnePlus flagship – it’s not particularly remarkable.</p><p></p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><figure><img alt="OnePlus 11 smartphone lying on a bamboo table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ed5d1f92-a624-11ed-be5f-7e94103bea77" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>The OnePlus 11 has the de facto top Android processor: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It’s powerful, sure, but the bigger benefits might come through longer battery life. According to the chip maker, its new Adreno GPU can offer up to 45 percent better power efficiency.</p><p>OnePlus software doesn’t appear to have changed much since the  OnePlus 10 Pro. OnePlus claims its HyperBoost Gaming Engine uses machine learning (and Qualcomm’s latest processor) to balance performance and battery drain. The caveat here is that it’s only compatible with major mobile titles like <em>Genshin Impact</em>. It’s also hard to tell whether it offers a discernible impact on games, when so many other phones are similarly specced and offer a similar experience.</p><p>The OnePlus phone series typically offers decent battery life. So it’s no surprise that the OnePlus 11 clocked almost 20 hours on our video rundown test. Although the battery icon seemed a little ‘sticky’ around 100 percent after playing video for a good two hours. The only phones that beat that are the company’s own OnePlus 10T and the iPhone 14 Pro.</p><p>While that’s great, the speed that OnePlus 11 can charge is even more impressive. 100W charging is here – the kind of wattage we get with laptops. There’s a compatible charger in the box, thankfully, but it’s proprietary tech, so you'll need this specific charger, this cable and OnePlus’ latest phone to hit those heady charging speeds. OnePlus says it takes 25 minutes to reach a full charge from empty, and in practice, that’s been accurate.</p><p>The ability to plug my phone in for a brief stint (roughly ten minutes) and have it top up 50 percent is magical. However, there’s no wireless charging. It’s not a deal breaker for me but it’s definitely something to note as missing from a flagship phone. I’d take these heady charging speeds over wireless charging any day.</p><p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="OnePlus 11 smartphone lying on a bamboo table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ed5cf880-a624-11ed-a3ff-0b2cab1c2f5e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>The OnePlus 11 has a great screen (again), incredibly fast-charging (again) and cameras that are better than its predecessors. However, the supercharge speeds seem to be the only unique thing that the OnePlus 11 brings to the table. But is that enough to make you want to upgrade from an older phone, or choose a OnePlus over the competition?</p><p>At <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d8d4d385-7f93-4537-83d1-d5fb47d219ec&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OnePlus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkOGQ0ZDM4NS03ZjkzLTQ1MzctODNkMS1kNWZiNDdkMjE5ZWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25lcGx1cy5jb20vdXMvb25lcGx1cy0xMSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWIxOGU4MzMtNTRkNS00MTMxLWFmMTktODBiOWQxZTc3OTViIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAefle-07yH-3-lu0btYBoyou8H0RVWh8bKF_8Z1GDWYZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-11">$699</a>, with 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage, that’s $100 less than last year’s flagship. It’s a much better deal than its predecessor – and this could be a deciding factor. The OnePlus 11 sits between midrange devices, like the Pixel 6a, and premium phones including Google’s Pixel 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S23 series. In many ways, you get the best of both, but against the dominance of other phone makers, it needs to do more to distinguish itself.</p>

## Meta reportedly plans to open Horizon Worlds to younger teens as soon as March

<p>Only adults 18 and older can sign up for Meta's Horizon Worlds at the moment, but according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tZXRhLXRvLXJldmFtcC1ob3Jpem9uLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1hcHAtcGxhbnMtdG8tb3Blbi1mb3ItdGVlbi11c2UtYXMtc29vbi1hcy1tYXJjaC0xMTY3NTc0OTIyMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWM5NzQzYzItMzI2Yi00YzM2LWI4YTUtMWRhNzRjOGFiNWVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUMKg9u9I1iKxhqiGNin-RSjqMj-WckGeYh2lFu72H-f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-to-revamp-horizon-metaverse-app-plans-to-open-for-teen-use-as-soon-as-march-11675749223"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, that could change very, very soon. Meta is reportedly opening up its virtual reality social experience to younger players aged 13 to 17 as soon as this March as part of its efforts to grow Horizon's numbers and improve user retention.<em> The Journal</em> says it saw the information in a memo entitled "Horizon 2023 Goals and Strategy" in which Gabriel Aul, Meta's VP for the VR experience, outlined its goals for the first half of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>In the memo, Aul reportedly wrote that these younger users are the "true digital citizens of the metaverse" and that Meta needs to ensure that it serves them for Horizon to succeed. Meta spokesperson Joe Osborne told the publication that "[t]eens are already spending time in a variety of VR experiences on Quest, and [the company wants] to ensure that [it] can provide them with a great experience in Horizon Worlds as well, with age-appropriate tools and protections in place."&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Osborn didn't say what the experience will offer in the way of protecting young users. In 2021,<em> The Journal</em> reported that the company's own researchers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html">found Instagram</a> "harmful for a sizable percentage" of teens, particularly teenage girls. Meta paused its work on an Instagram for Kids as a result, and it has also launched a bunch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-launches-take-a-break-features-for-teens-080049775.html">teen safety features</a> for the app since then. It also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-limit-sensitive-content-for-new-teen-users-by-default-185029119.html">automatically limited</a> triggering or sensitive content for new users under 16.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to welcoming younger teens to Horizon, Meta is aiming to grow the game's monthly active users to 500,000 from 200,000 within the first half of the year. Perhaps more importantly at this point in time, it's targeting a retention rate of 20 percent. Apparently, Horizon had an 11 percent retention rate in January, which means only one in nine users returned to the experience the following month. Meta is hoping to achieve those goals by improving the service's reliability and performance and getting rid of bugs that may affect people's enjoyment.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is aiming to release 20 new Horizon experiences built by third-party studios in an effort to win more people over, as well. Plus, it's apparently hoping to make the VR game a lot more accessible by rolling out a web version for mobile and desktopf by June. Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-horizon-worlds-web-version-194644865.html">teased the web version</a> of the experience in the past, but the company missed its initial launch target last year. This year, the company is not only hoping to launch Horizon's web version within the next few months, it's also looking to have as many as 150,000 monthly cross-screen Horizon users in the first half of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: Google's ChatGPT rival is called Bard

<p>In the face of so much ChatGPT news and buzz, Google announced on Monday its own chatbot AI project, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">Bard</a>, will be unveiled with more details at Wednesday's Google Presents event in Paris. Bard will serve as an &quot;experimental conversational AI service,&quot; according to a blog post by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Monday. It uses Google's existing Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) platform, which the company has been developing for the past two years.</p><p>However, it won’t be open to everyone, like ChatGPT currently is, which ruins the hype a little. Google is starting with a lightweight version of LaMDA, open to a select group of trusted users before scaling up. &quot;We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information,&quot; Pichai said.</p><p>As we’ll get into below, it’s a busy time for OpenAI’s chatbot tech. Microsoft has a surprise event later today, and that AI-generated Seinfeld stream (based on OpenAI’s GPT-3 Davinci model) was banned from Twitch.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bastl-microgranny-monolith-review-vintage-sampling-grit-in-a-portable-package-133044781.html">Bastl Microgranny Monolith review: Vintage sampling grit in a portable package</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/someone-reverse-engineered-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-for-pc-115542772.html">Nintendo classic 'Zelda: A Link to the Past' gets an unofficial PC port</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-charging-accessories-are-up-to-46-percent-off-in-amazon-sale-101840741.html">Anker charging accessories are up to 46 percent off in Amazon sale</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-phones-good-deal-amazon-best-buy-161539802.html">Google's Pixel 7 phones have dropped to their lowest prices to date</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/hogwarts-legacy-boycott-editorial-110018998.html">Why I’m reviewing Hogwarts Legacy</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-super-bowl-163646320.html">'The Last of Us' episode five will premiere two days early on HBO Max</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2s-first-crossover-skin-transforms-doomfist-into-one-punch-man-204542726.html">Overwatch 2's third season will let you turn Doomfist into One-Punch Man</a></p></li></ul><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-vr2-faq-details-headset-virtual-reality-194415674.html">Sony’s expansive PlayStation VR2 FAQ answers (almost) all your burning questions</a></h2><h3>The $550 peripheral will arrive on February 22nd.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-vr2-faq-details-headset-virtual-reality-194415674.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/87af2cd0-a6d6-11ed-abaa-952857d3e673" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><h3></h3><p>Sony has published a lengthy FAQ for all things PS VR2.

## WhatsApp statuses get a big overhaul with voice, emoji reactions and more

<p>WhatsApp has introduced some <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-ways-to-enjoy-whatsapp-status">new updates</a> to Status, the feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-21-whatsapp-facebook-status-updates.html">introduced in 2017</a> as an answer to Snapchat and Instagram Stories. One of the key additions is a feature called Voice Status that gives you the ability set voice notes up to 30 seconds long as status updates. The company calls it a more personal way of providing updates, particularly if you're more comfortable talking rather than typing or creating a video.</p><p>Another key update is a feature called Private Audience Selector that lets you choose who can view your status updates. It lets you select your audience for every status update you do, providing more granular control and convenience than the current privacy settings.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you're more of an emoji person, WhatsApp has also introduced Status Reactions, providing &quot;a quick and easy way to respond to status updates from your friends or close contacts,&quot; WhatsApp wrote. It lets you reply to any status simply by swiping up on it and tapping one of eight emojis, rather than use other means like text, voice messages and stickers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Status Profile Rings put a ring around your profile when you share a status update, and is visible in chat lists, group participant lists and contact info. Finally, you'll now see a preview of a link when you post it on your status, giving your contacts a better idea of what it is before they click.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the new features (status reactions, profile rings and link previews) were announced previously, but are now being highlighted as a group of Status updates, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-brings-new-features-to-status-updates-on-whatsapp-for-ios-and-android/"><em>WaBetaInfo</em></a> notes. The new features are rolling out to users globally and will be available to everyone &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot;</p>

## The Switch has outsold the PS4, but Nintendo sees tougher times ahead

<p>The Switch just leaped over both the Game Boy and PlayStation 4 to become the third best-selling console of all time. The console has sold 122.55 million units overall as of the end of 2022, Nintendo announced in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230207_4e.pdf">earnings report</a>, so it's is now behind only the DS and PlayStation 2 in lifetime sales.&nbsp;</p><p>That's the only silver lining in a darker cloud, though. Switch unit sales for the nine-month period ending December 31st dropped to 14.91 million from 18.95 million the year before, and revenue declined 5.6 percent for the fiscal year ending in March. Game sales also fell by 4 percent over the same period, with the new <em>Pokemon Scarlet/Violet</em> titles (which totalled an impressive 20.61 million units) unable to offset the decline. As a result, the company has lowered its fiscal year forecast from 19 million to 18 million units with 5 million fewer games — continuing a downward <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-lowers-its-switch-sales-forecasts-but-believes-everything-will-be-alright-093502498.html">trend</a> from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-switch-and-game-sales-dropped-significantly-last-quarter-103810604.html">last year</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nintendo attributed the decline to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, with the lack of consoles affecting software sales too. However, Sony set a new sales record for PS5s last quarter with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-blockbuster-ps5-holiday-sales-show-its-supply-issues-appear-to-be-over-082455028.html">7.1 million sold</a>, up 82 percent year-over year.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo's issues likely boil down to its aging hardware, as well. Buyers are going for the latest OLED model, with the older Switch and Switch Lite models seeing a decline. The Switch is now relatively underpowered compared to the latest Xbox Series and PS5 consoles, and Sony and Microsoft are also pouring money into games and subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo said last year that the transition to its next console is &quot;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-the-transition-to-its-next-console-is-a-major-concern-for-us/">a major focus for us</a>,&quot; and it could start becoming more urgent soon. It'll be interesting to see if the Switch can hang around long enough to become the best selling console of all time, but Nintendo will have to sell around 33 million more units to surpass the PlayStation 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk may have to think of a lot more ways to make Twitter Blue appealing to potential subscribers if he wants the subscription service to be a major source of revenue. According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiYTBhNGNkYy1jZWM4LTQxNmEtOWU5My1lMTFiODE3OTEyOWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaW5mb3JtYXRpb24uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL211c2tzLXR3aXR0ZXItaGFzLWp1c3QtMTgwLTAwMC11LXMtc3Vic2NyaWJlcnMtdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1sYXVuY2g_cmM9d2hmMGZkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzZjQwNTdkNy1lYTQ4LTRlY2UtYTNjNC03ZGZlMTYxM2I0MjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASdOX_Fhxv2hoFwgb_GZyKBN3rKjBc3dI9p8u4SX4X5V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fmusks-twitter-has-just-180-000-u-s-subscribers-two-months-after-launch%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd"><em>The Information</em></a>, only 180,000 people in the US have been paying for a Twitter subscription by mid-January, and that's apparently around 0.2 percent of the website's monthly active users. The publication said it saw the information on a document, which also revealed that 62 percent of the company's paying users is from the US. That means Twitter has approximately 290,000 subscribers worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter Blue costs $8 a month for users who pay via web — or $7, if they pay for an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-now-offering-a-yearly-discount-rate-on-blue-verified-checkmarks-115514908.html">annual subscription</a> — and $11 for those who pay via Apple's or Google's app stores. Since the latter option gives the tech giants a cut of subscribers' payments, Twitter still only gets $8 a month from users overall. With the current number of paying users, the website is only set to earn $27.8 million a year from its subscription services. That said, Twitter has only just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-monday-11-per-month-ios-221436172.html">relaunched Blue</a> in mid-December last year after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-verification-twitter-blue-161532924.html">bumpy initial launch</a> a month before that. It's bound to rack up more subscribers, though it remains to be seen if it can achieve the level of growth Musk wants to see.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>The Information</em> notes, Musk told Twitter employees last year that he wants half of the website's revenue to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiYTBhNGNkYy1jZWM4LTQxNmEtOWU5My1lMTFiODE3OTEyOWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaW5mb3JtYXRpb24uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL211c2std2FybnMtdHdpdHRlci1tYXktbG9zZS1iaWxsaW9ucy1uZXh0LXllYXI_cmM9d2hmMGZkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzZjQwNTdkNy1lYTQ4LTRlY2UtYTNjNC03ZGZlMTYxM2I0MjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXgm7sd1WQn_QPc5ySzGPiNykgXM9f5kPT6JXX4AAv7Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fmusk-warns-twitter-may-lose-billions-next-year%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd">come from subscriptions</a>. Since the company has to pay over $1 billion a year in interests alone from the loans Musk took out when he purchased the website, the executive is aiming to take in a revenue of $3 billion for 2023. Twitter has to have quite a lot of subscribers to earn half of that from Blue. One avenue the company is considering to earn more from its subscription services is to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-developing-ad-free-blue-subscription-tier-185653843.html">offer a higher-priced membership</a> tier that allows users to browse the website with zero ads. Twitter is also reportedly planning to charge businesses $1,000 a month for their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-colored-badges-verified-accounts-094651616.html">gold verification badges</a> and an extra $50 a month for each <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-early-access-waitlist-organization-verification-093816293.html">account affiliated</a> with them.&nbsp;</p>

## Tinder adds an incognito mode and more safety features

<p>On Safer Internet Day (and with Valentine's Day fast approaching), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tinder/"><ins>Tinder</ins></a> is starting to roll out some new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-background-checks-garbo-165142514.html"><ins>safety features</ins></a> and updates to some others. Users will now be able to take advantage of an incognito mode, which Tinder says is a &quot;step up&quot; from hiding your profile completely. Only folks that you Like will see you in their recommendations. That should give you more granular control over your visibility.</p><p>In addition, you can block profiles that pop up in your suggestions. So, that could mitigate some awkwardness if you spot an ex or someone else from your life, such as (shudder) a family member. This follows a feature that allows users to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-block-contacts-feature-184037759.html"><ins>block others based on their phone number</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's another new safety feature called long press reporting. If you receive an offensive message or unwanted picture, you can tap and hold to swiftly report it. Tinder says that it hopes this will encourage more people to report bad behavior so it can take action against users who are breaking the rules.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tinder has made some changes to features called &quot;Are You Sure&quot; (which asks folks to reconsider before sending a message with potentially harmful language) and &quot;Does This Bother You,&quot; which encourages users to report inappropriate conversations. Tinder says the features will detect more language that it deems harmful or inappropriate, including hate speech as well as sexual harassment and exploitation. The company says that, since it added &quot;Does This Bother You,&quot; it has received 46 percent more reports of messages containing harmful language.</p><p>Along with these updates, Tinder is rolling out a series of <a href="https://nomore.org/learn/guide-to-healthy-dating/">Healthy Dating Guides</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://nomore.org/">No More</a>, a campaign to end domestic violence and sexual assault. The guides are designed to help users spot red flags and protect themselves at every stage of the relationship. Starting on February 8th, Tinder will also start running a campaign called Green Flags, which is about highlighting safety features and the steps people can take to safely date online.</p>
