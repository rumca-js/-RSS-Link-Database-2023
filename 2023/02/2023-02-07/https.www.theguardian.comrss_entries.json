As fewer state students have the opportunity to engage with arts or music, fewer go on to study these subjects at A-level or university.

It\u2019s very much in the style of Capcom\u2019s smash hit 1942, but massively unforgiving \u2013 a factor acknowledged in the original Mega Drive conversion which included a cheat for multiple smart bombs. Truxton is arguably Toaplan\u2019s first ageless classic, a sci-fi blaster with a similar three-type weapons mechanic as Twin Cobra, this time including the awesome Truxton Beam which fires a continuous laser that locks on to and tracks enemy craft. Zero Wing is a horizontal scroller from 1989, clearly inspired by Gradius and R-Type, with similar biomechanical enemies and landscapes, but it\u2019s notable in its own right due to the tractor beam feature that lets you grab enemy ships and use them as shields.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/feb/07/toaplan-arcade-shoot-em-up-collection-vol-1-review-zero-wing-truxton\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/07/kaylea-titfords-father-found-guilty-of-killing-her-by-letting-her-become-obese", "title": "Kaylea Titford\u2019s father found guilty of killing her by letting her become obese", "date_published": "2023-02-07 14:21:24+00:00", "description": "<p>Alun Titford convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence over 16-year-old\u2019s death in October 2020</p><p>A man has been found guilty of killing his disabled daughter by allowing her to become fatally obese during the first Covid lockdown.</p><p>Alun Titford, 45, was convicted by a jury of manslaughter by gross negligence after the death of his \u201cfiercely independent\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d 16-year-old daughter, Kaylea.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/07/kaylea-titfords-father-found-guilty-of-killing-her-by-letting-her-become-obese\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/07/race-hate-us-uk-black-lives-policing-al-sharpton", "title": "I have seen race hate in the US and UK and the message is the same: no one is free until we are all free | Al Sharpton", "date_published": "2023-02-07 14:05:45+00:00", "description": "<p>In both countries, policing still devalues Black lives, but there is good news: we have seen progress, and know our struggle yields results</p><p>I came to London more than 30 years ago to protest against the vicious murder of 15-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/rolan-adams-murdered-1991-father-richard-adams-chiling-similarities-stepehen-lawrence-killing\">Rolan Adams</a>.

While the toasted stuff \u201chas a lovely, nutty quality\u201d, green has a habit of \u201ccoming out gloopy and almost gluey\u201d.

They have travelled there as part of an official survey committee and are being escorted by a white missionary teacher, Matthew Diamond, who wants to teach Latin and Shakespeare to the island\u2019s racially diverse residents but also feels a \u201cvisceral, involuntary repulsion\u2026 in the presence of a living Negro\u201d. The story is set in the early-20th century US, when anti-black prejudices were frequently mistaken for scientific truths, and the two doctors in the surveying group could brazenly become members of the \u201cSection on Eugenics in the American Breeders\u2019 Association\u201d. The doctors go about measuring every inch of the islanders\u2019 breathing bodies with calipers and metal rulers, as if they were mere lab specimens. At one point, someone in the group shows a little black girl photographs of a train engine, a telephone, the then American president William Taft, and asks her to identify the images. Despite his racist views, Diamond is upset by the impertinence of the committee and nearly ends up telling them that the little girl \u201ccould answer your questions in Latin\u201d.</p><p>Harding\u2019s novels are rife with such carefully calibrated moments, when a character briefly transcends their desires and deficiencies, when a sentence lays them bare as hauntingly human. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/25/tinkers-paul-harding-jay-parini\">Tinkers</a></em>, his Pulitzer prize-winning debut, an old man wonders if, decades after his death, he will be \u201cno more than the smoky arrangement of a set of rumours\u201d to his descendants. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/07/enon-review-paul-harding-brilliant-exploration-bereavement-charlie\">Enon</a></em>, a grieving father spends so many nights awake beside his daughter\u2019s grave that he starts to doubt if the cemetery and the adjoining hills are real or a \u201clarge, elaborate set\u201d. I can\u2019t help thinking, however, that Harding\u2019s gifts have found their fullest expression in <em>This Other Eden</em>. Pick any excerpt from these 200 pages and you will find that each sentence contains multitudes and works well by itself, and yet the chapters, the paragraphs, have also been sewn together into a numinous whole.</p><p><em>This Other Eden</em> by Paul Harding is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (\u00a316.99).

It just feels as if patients have been backed into a corner where, if we complain about our access to general medicine, some tax-avoiding Tory pops up to suggest that we should pay for appointments, while, if we say it\u2019s fine, they say: \u201cThere you go \u2013 it\u2019s all going great and nobody knows what doctors are complaining about.\u201d There ought to be some space between these two options where you can acknowledge the pressure GPs are under, while still noting that they\u2019re good.

Same-day appointment, not too early (they somehow have it in her notes that she is not a morning person) with the loudest doctor (they also know she is deaf, but diplomatically call it \u201chard of hearing\u201d, which is ironic, because it\u2019s much harder on everybody else). When they asked if she\u2019d like a mid-morning call from a receptionist, to reassure her that the doctor would call her later, it began to sound like a guilt trip.
