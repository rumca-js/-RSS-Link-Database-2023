<p id="aR91yh">Currently, Tinder’s algorithm surfaces your profile in other members’ recommendations, whether you swipe right <em>or</em> left on them. Incognito mode, on the other hand, will hide your profile from other users unless you’ve expressed interest, which should help ensure you’re profile’s viewed by the people you want to see it. </p>

  <p id="S089QW">Zoom is laying off about 15 percent of its staff, which means about 1,300 people will lose their jobs, according to a memo from Zoom CEO Eric Yuan that the company <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-from-eric-yuan-ceo-of-zoom/">posted on its blog</a>. “Each organization” at the company will be affected by the cuts, Yuan said.</p>
<p id="Z2Hd3f">The company scaled up rapidly as people shifted to remote work during the pandemic, and Zoom grew three times in size within 24 months. However, “we didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities,” Yuan wrote. “The uncertainty of the global economy, and its effect on our customers, means we need to take a hard — yet important — look inward to reset ourselves so we can weather the...</p>

  <p id="K2PN5O">Samsung announced its second-generation QD-OLED TV lineup back at CES, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537971/samsung-s95c-qd-oled-tv-announced-features">a new 77-inch model</a> joining the 55-inch and 65-inch sizes that were offered with last year’s S95B. Regardless of what size you prefer, these TVs utilize the very latest quantum dot OLED panels from Samsung Display, which promise significant brightness gains — potentially crossing 2,000 nits — and the S95B was already among the brightest OLEDs on the market. Now we know how much the 77-inch S95C will cost: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftelevisions-home-theater%2Ftvs%2Foled-tvs%2F77-class-s95c-oled-4k-smart-tv-2023-qn77s95cafxza%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F2%2F7%2F23589306%2Fsamsung-s95c-qd-oled-tv-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">it’s priced at $4,499.99</a>. </p>
<p id="RirgUw">That’s more expensive than LG’s 77-inch G2 (the company hasn’t yet announced pricing for its 2023 series yet), but not outlandishly so: the G2 originally had an MSRP of $4,199.99. And I’m sure we’ll see discounts on Samsung’s OLEDs...</p>

  <p id="c0rzk7">The numbers on food waste are staggering. Globally, about a third of the world’s food production is lost or wasted — roughly <a href="https://www.wfp.org/stories/5-facts-about-food-waste-and-hunger">1.3 billion tons</a> each year — and most of it ends up rotting in landfills leaking methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it first enters the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="Ian3QE">One way to tackle those problems is to <em>reuse</em> that food waste, turning it into more food. It’s an option that’s even more effective than composting when it comes to tackling climate change, but it’s not always so easy to do at home. So a newly launched startup called Mill Industries wants to change that.</p>

  <p id="qcyRJE">A little over a month after launching in China, OnePlus is bringing its flagship Buds Pro 2 true wireless earbuds to international markets alongside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23351444">OnePlus 11</a>. The new earbuds cost $179 (£179 / €179) and will go on open sale on February 16th. </p>
<p id="wnUI4a">One of the more interesting features of these earbuds is support for head-tracked spatial audio when used with the OnePlus 11. That means the earbuds can track the movement of your head in an attempt to make it sound like audio (either stereo or surround) is coming from a fixed point in space. Similar features have previously been available for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211775">Apple’s AirPods</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23312192/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro</a> and are also coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23538743/google-pixel-spatial-audio-buds-pro-january-update">Google’s Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p>

  <p id="BuIInB">OnePlus’ debut tablet, the OnePlus Pad, has been officially announced… sort of. Today, the Oppo subbrand is detailing the tablet’s specs alongside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23351444">OnePlus 11 smartphone</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23351795">OnePlus Buds Pro 2 earbuds</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23353093">OnePlus Keyboard</a>, but it’s not ready to announce pricing just yet. It’ll be available to preorder in North America, Europe, and India in April. </p>
<p id="Aw83bY">In terms of hardware, perhaps the most interesting part of the OnePlus Pad is its LCD display, which is 11.6 inches in size, has a 2000p resolution, and has a refresh rate of up to 144Hz for compatible apps. It also has an unusual aspect ratio of 7:5, which, in practice, should mean it’s a little taller in landscape than a comparable 3:2 display of the same width but not quite as tall as a 4:3...</p>

It’s called the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro, and the company says it’ll be available to order in April at a price that’s to be announced.
