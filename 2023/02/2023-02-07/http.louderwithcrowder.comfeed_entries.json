Not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. </p><p>But it didn't stop there.

Some of these noble diversity heroes included Kim Petras, the transgender person who performed from Hell alongside Sam Smith; Harry Styles, a man who sometimes wears dresses for attention; and Lizzo, resident large person. The gang's all here!</p><p>She then turned her attention to red states, specifically Governor Ron DeSantis: <em>\"I could only imagine the heads exploding in red states. I imagine Ron DeSantis is somewhere stalking through his governor\u2019s mansion trying to figure out how to ban the airing of the Grammys in Florida and take away CBS\u2019 tax exemptions. \u2018No educational value, queer theory, Black music!\u2019\"</em> </p><p>Actually, DeSantis isn't upset at all. At least not according to his <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sam-smith-destantis-grammys\" target=\"_blank\">team</a>, who pointed out which group is <em>really</em> waging the war on culture. It's not the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mom-explains-school-board\" target=\"_blank\">moms</a> begging school boards to ban biological males from locker rooms with their prepubescent daughters. Nah, it's actually the people dressed as Satan performing a degenerate song in a segment sponsored by Big Pharma. The diversity crowd hasn't won the culture war because they aren't the ones fighting back. </p><p>So sure, in their little Hollywood bubble, they can nominate and reward as many transgender plus-sized lesbians as they want.

Carry on. </p><p>Yesterday, 150 Trans Lives Matter protests stormed the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/university-drag-queen-story-hour\" target=\"_blank\">Oklahoma</a> Capitol building to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/furries-counterprotest-feminists\" target=\"_blank\">protest</a> proposed bills that would ban various forms of gender-affirming medical procedures, including reassignment surgery, for people under the ages of 18-26. The protestors were taped inside the Capitol, chanting, \"trans lives matter\" and \"protect trans kids.\" Many of them held signs with slogans like, \"you can't erase us\" and \"my birthday wish is for trans rights.\" </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201chttps://t.co/X7TXB0DW1c\\u201d</div> \u2014 Nick Camper (@Nick Camper)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickcamper/status/1622656770152833042\">1675706029</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Oklahoma State Legislature hasn't voted on the proposed laws yet. The least restrictive proposal bans anyone under the age of 18 from receiving gender reassignment surgery. Y'know, since they can't even legally consume alcohol yet. Seems reasonable to me. But then again, my birthday wish wasn't for trans rights. </p><p>The most restrictive law bans physicians from referring anyone under the age of 26 for gender transition procedures, which include surgery and hormonal treatment. If a doctor provided such a referral anyway, they could face criminal charges and/or lose their license. The bill was proposed by Republican Senator David Bullard, who said the age of 26 was chosen because research shows the brain continues to develop until the age of 25. </p><p>Governor Stitt also gave his State of the State address last night, and, despite the protestors, doubled down on the state's efforts: <em>\"</em><em>'We must protect our most vulnerable - our children. After all, minors can\u2019t vote, can\u2019t purchase alcohol, can\u2019t purchase cigarettes\u2026we shouldn\u2019t allow a minor to get a permanent gender-altering surgery in Oklahoma. </em><em>That\u2019s why I am calling on the Legislature to send me a bill that bans all gender transition surgeries and hormone therapies on minors in the state!\" </em></p><p>It's unclear how many of the protestors have since been tracked down by the FBI and placed in solitary confinement until their trial date.

I don't share some of the pearl-clutching over the Sam Smith performance. I'm oldhead enough to remember when listening to Ozzy Osbourne was going to make me kill myself (I haven't) and that Iron Maiden would make me carve a pentagon in my forehead. Yet I managed to still turn out okay-ish. I'm also oldhead enough to not fully know what a Sam Smith is. Apparently, he's the latest popstar hardo looking to offend the \"squares.\"</p><p>But the fact that a popstar going on national television looking to upset a majority of American he/they/xi knew they would offend in an event sponsored by DOCTOR Jill Biden's favorite pharmaceutical company is part of the problem.</p><p>Every time you turn on the TV, or open a magazine, or send your kids to public school, a small minority of leftists bombard you with their radical political agenda and ideology. Yet they are never accused of launching a war on the culture. It's only when the right, or anyone slightly to the left of Karl Marx, starts to push back that we're told WE'RE the ones starting culture wars. </p><p>Teachers' unions for decades have been spending millions on school board elections. Once the right decided they were going to compete in an open election and do the same, the media clutched their pearls and claimed: \"it was never like this.\"</p><p>It's not that conservatives aren't the ones starting a culture war. It's that the left is unhappy we're finally retaliating again the one they've been waging for generations.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
