If you’re enjoying it as much as I am, you’d probably go further than that.

## Golda review – lifeless Meir biopic hides Helen Mirren’s talent in a cloud of cigarette smoke

<p>As a drama about the Yom Kippur war, this film is bafflingly dull. As a portrait of Golda Meir, Israel’s prime minister at the time, it’s even worse</p><p>Helen Mirren’s latexed and enhanced portrayal of Golda Meir, Israel’s “Iron Lady” prime minister during the 1973 Yom Kippur war, has been overtaken by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/12/helen-mirren-golda-meir-maureen-lipman-david-baddiel-row-jews-bojack-horseman">a debate about “Jewface” casting</a> because Mirren is not Jewish – addressing why Jews are casually excluded from the otherwise fiercely policed sensibilities about authenticity and identity on screen. (Would they get a white actor, for example, to black up as President Anwar Sadat?) It’s a valid and important question, but not exactly the problem in this stately, stuffy and at times almost comatose TV-movie-type drama about tension in Israel’s corridors of power as the Yom Kippur war exploded and the country faced off against Egypt, Syria and Jordan in a battle for its very existence.</p><p>Mirren, normally such a sparkling performer, is lumbered with a grey wig, false nose and jowls, with occasional headscarf and handbag, making her look as if she is playing the Queen doing an impression of Richard Nixon. This Golda Meir impassively chainsmokes her way through wooden potted-history dialogue scenes with her military top brass, while everyone blows cigarette smoke at each other; occasionally she takes a break to lie prostrate on a hospital bed, stoically smoking and dying of cancer. Is she going to die? Why not? The film is flatlining.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/golda-review-lifeless-meir-biopic-hides-helen-mirrens-talent-in-a-cloud-of-cigarette-smoke">Continue reading...</a>

## Strike threats and Netflix feuds: Wales’s rugby crisis exposes greater problem | Jonathan Liew

<p>As off-field tensions reach new levels, you have to wonder if the modern international governing body is fit for purpose</p><p>Got to say, I’m intrigued to see how the Netflix Six Nations documentary covers the Welsh rugby crisis. Given that the Wales team are refusing to cooperate with the Netflix crew, denying them access to team meetings and even turfing them out of Alun Wyn Jones’s press conference last week, you have to wonder what sort of material is going to be cobbled together. Perhaps Wales will simply be pixelated out of the final product: a ghostly apparition at the edges of the screen, implied but never physically present, which, you might argue, is a pretty good way of describing their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/11/scotland-wales-six-nations-match-report" title="">performance against Scotland</a>.</p><p>But the indignities of a global streaming giant are the least of our worries here. With England visiting Cardiff on Saturday afternoon, the prospect of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/15/wru-says-no-room-for-manoeuvre-on-contracts-despite-players-strike-threat" title="">an unprecedented Wales player strike</a> remains worryingly real. Ask the players and they will insist this is not really a dispute about money, but security and basic dignity: the dozens of players who, in the absence of a new funding deal, have no idea whether they will still be employed in four months. The sleepless nights and declined mortgage offers. The breathtaking ineptitude of a union asking players to take a haircut while furnishing the new coach, Warren Gatland, with a £2m contract and planning a range of new capital investments: an interactive rugby museum, a roof walk and a zip wire at the Principality Stadium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/20/strike-threats-netflix-feuds-wales-rugby-union-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

However, the grinding conflict over the issue reveals his government engaged in a struggle just to stop things from getting worse. Mr Sunak may get his way over the protocol, which keeps the region in the EU’s single market for goods – thereby creating a customs border in the Irish Sea.

The polls suggest the public <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/clear-majority-want-closer-relationship-with-european-union-poll-finds" title="">backs</a> closer ties with Brussels, which is an opening for Mr Sunak’s pragmatism.

<p>Dafoe excels as an art thief trapped inside a super-rich art collector’s apartment in this claustrophobic fiction feature debut from Vasilis Katsoupis</p><p>There’s a throb of claustrophobic panic and despair in this movie; something like something any of us might feel while at a modern art exhibition and for a long, long moment unable to find the exit. Maybe the movie itself aspires to the cool, affectless chill of an unimaginably expensive piece of contemporary art.</p><p>Documentary-maker Vasilis Katsoupis makes his fiction feature debut here , working on the script with British screenwriter Ben Hopkins. Willem Dafoe stars, as athletic and ascetic as ever, playing Nemo, an art thief who is breaking into an ultra-luxurious Manhattan apartment belonging to an art-collector plutocrat, filled with all his modern pieces. (There is a mention of this man being away in Kazakhstan and one of his pieces is a red canvas with a “Z” on it.) New York City is seen from stock footage and in projections beyond the plate glass, and in fact this obvious studio-based unreality is not inappropriate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/inside-review-willem-dafoe-thief-suffers-for-his-art-vasilis-katsoupis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Questions abound after revelations that José María Enríquez Negreira, the former referee, was paid €7m by Barcelona</p><p>“Today we talked about Cádiz,” said Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s coach, and the only person there taking questions. “We talked about Cádiz, we watched a video on Cádiz, we did some Cádiz set plays, everything we did is Cádiz. We took a retreat in Cádiz.” <em>Cádizian isolation</em>, he called it, and it would be a good choice. A festival of parody and rebellion, serious about being silly – carnival was just beginning there, over 1,000km south-west of Catalonia, Europe’s most ancient city becoming its most enjoyable, too. A lot more fun than where Barça actually found themselves, that’s for sure.</p><p>“I try to focus on the football, but this club has these things,” Xavi said. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/16/barcelona-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report">Barcelona faced Manchester United</a> and then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/19/neymar-carried-off-before-messi-free-kick-clinches-psgs-4-3-win-over-lille">Cádiz this past week</a>; they also faced something much more serious, as did the entire Spanish game. The story broke on the eve of the Europa League match against United: Barcelona had paid €1.4m to the vice-president of the Spanish referees’ committee, the CTA, between 2016 and 2018. That was just the start and it’s not finished yet. With every new revelation, with every new thing that was said – and not said – it got worse. In total, the Catalan referee José María Enríquez Negreira received €7m over 20 years. None of this is disputed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/20/barcelona-la-liga-xavi-hernandez-former-referee-payments-scandal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alex Gibney’s documentary about the disgraced German tennis star has wonderful archive footage and interviews but is ultimately unrevealing about its subject</p><p>Despite some great archive material and nice interview turns, this documentary portrait of disgraced German tennis legend Boris Becker from film-maker Alex Gibney is a frustrating and disappointing experience – because of the baffling way it is structured, both unrevealing and anticlimactic. It starts at the end, swoops back to the beginning and finally grinds to a halt somewhere around the middle. It could be that this is intended to be merely a first “episode”, though it isn’t billed as such.</p><p>We commence with Becker’s gripping downfall for tax evasion at London’s Southwark crown court in 2022, facing two-and-a-half years in prison and powerful interview testimony from the man himself: rueful, haunted, but rejecting self-pity. (In fact, Gibney seems to have had two interview sessions with him, one just before the verdict and one two years before that.) Then we cut back to his stunning 1985 Wimbledon triumph at the age of just 17, and his face is eerily cherubic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/boom-boom-the-world-vs-boris-becker-review-muddled-portrait-of-tennis-legend-alex-gibney">Continue reading...</a>

Plus letters from <strong>David Thomas</strong> and <strong>Suzanne Muna </strong></p><p>It was heartbreaking to read about the experiences of Chanel Sultan and her young family (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/17/uk-housing-association-clarion-home-owners-renters" title="">Rats, mould, damp: one woman’s story reveals the ugly truth about the UK’s biggest housing association, 17 February</a>). But unfortunately it was not shocking. The total dereliction of duty shown by the housing association – except to its shareholders – is sickening but, again, not shocking. Why? Because we live in a world where the haves are oblivious to, or ignoring, everyone else struggling beneath them.</p><p>Tragically, many like Sultan are left to drown in a world where even rats are treated better. I was forced to escape an abusive husband while living abroad. I returned to the UK with three young children and two large suitcases. In the 15 years since then, I have been evicted three times by private landlords and forced to find a new home for my family in a very short time, while covering all the costs of moving by going further into debt. Each time the landlord has been either selling up or planning to raise the rent. On separate occasions, we were driven out by black mould, and by an overflowing septic tank.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/20/britains-housing-sector-is-rigged-against-vulnerable-tenants">Continue reading...</a>

## Tory MPs don’t take buses – they just destroy them for the rest of us | Zoe Williams

<p>When I was a kid in the 1980s, you could casually lose 40 minutes waiting for a bus. Now, after 13 years of Conservative rule, public transport is on its knees again</p><p>In Stoke-on-Trent, bus services were cut by 37% in the five years to March 2022. Things are worse in Hertfordshire, where they are down by more than half, and less bad in London, where services are down by only 4% – and this, by the way, is why people hate Londoners. Politics hits everywhere else harder, then turns round and says: “Look at those metropolitan elites – they have all the luck. Also, most of the buses.” I thought the phrase “piss on you and tell you it’s raining” was baroque and figurative, but the “levelling up agenda” is as close as dammit to a literal example.</p><p>I did lose some bittersweet time, though, to remembering the 1980s. If, towards the apex of Margaret Thatcher’s time in power, you were from a pretty affluent family, and none of you were ill, and you took public transport from time to time, this was your main brush with the disintegration of the public sphere: the sheer wreckage that was bus travel. That, and all those unloved urban spaces, potholed roads, graffitied walls, launderettes, a sense of belonging to a sad people who lurched from one trip hazard to another on the fumes of spray paint, wearing occasionally clean underwear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/20/tory-mps-dont-take-buses-they-just-destroy-them-for-the-rest-of-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This documentary unravels the mind-boggling exploits of one of Australia’s most prolific scammers … whose lies were so extreme they still defy belief</p><p>From The Dropout to Fyre, Inventing Anna to The Tinder Swindler, television has been enjoying a years-long relationship with the scammer. The lively Australian documentary Con Girl (Paramount+) isn’t likely to join the greats, but it does offer the astonishingly bizarre story of a woman named Samantha Azzopardi, known to various other women around the world as either Annika, Coco, Layla, Emily or Harper, among other names. These cons are so strange and perplexing that it takes four hours to try to unravel them, and though it zips through at a pace, it never quite gets to the heart of it.</p><p>It begins with the story that became known in the Irish press as “GPO Girl”. A young woman was found in a distressed state near the GPO Museum in Dublin in 2013. Refusing to speak, she indicated that she was 14, spent several weeks in a children’s hospital and through drawings implied that she was the victim of a trafficking ring. The Garda could not identify her, despite involving Interpol and the Missing Persons Bureau, and took the unusual step of releasing a photograph, with the aim of finding out who this child was. Then, says one officer, the southern hemisphere woke up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/20/con-girl-review-a-pacy-perplexing-account-of-a-serial-scammer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No nominees of colour won a Bafta in the main awards this year – just three years on from the #BaftasSoWhite backlash that prompted an organisational overhaul. But is there more than meets the eye to Sunday’s whitewash?</p><p>Like its fellow awards-giving organisation Ampas (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), the British Academy of Film and Television Arts has expended considerable energy in recent years in correcting perceived imbalances in the diversity of its nominations and award winners. Hence the consternation Bafta must privately be feeling that no people of colour were voted as winners of its top prizes at the 2023 edition, where German war film All Quiet on the Western Front emerged as the most rewarded, with seven Baftas, including best film and best director.</p><p>This year’s Bafta film awards had looked at first if they had avoided the controversy that hit the Oscars, which saw outrage after a grassroots campaign for Andrea Riseborough’s performance in the low-budget To Leslie resulted in a best actress nomination, presumably partly responsible for displacing apparent certainties Viola Davis for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/04/the-woman-king-review-viola-davis-leads-the-line-in-stirring-warrior-tale">The Woman King</a> and Danielle Deadwyler for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/till-review-a-powerful-portrait-of-courage-in-the-face-of-barbaric-racism">Till</a>. Both David and Deadwyler were nominated for Baftas, but were passed over in the final vote for Cate Blanchett’s performance in Tár. Likewise Angela Bassett, Hong Chau and Dolly de Leon lost out in the best supporting actress race, Ke Huy Quan and Micheal Ward for best supporting actor, and Daryl McCormack for best actor. Gina Prince-Bythewood was the only woman nominated in the directing category, and also lost, while McCormack, Naomi Ackie and Sheila Atim failed to win the public vote in the rising star award.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/is-baftas-work-to-increase-diversity-in-danger-of-being-undone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These awards are capable of celebrating Britain’s incredible filmmaking talent, but only when they face up to the question of whose art we value, and why</p><p>If insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, then perhaps coming to the Baftas looking for diversity is an exercise in madness. But this year, it was supposed to be different. Bafta’s chairman, Krishnendu Majumdar, announced an overhaul of voting and membership in 2020 after the awards’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/07/baftas-2020-awards-joker-leads-pack-with-11-nominations">lack of diversity</a> was shamed both online and onstage – the latter by the best actor winner, Joaquin Phoenix. In response to that year’s all-white acting nominations, he said: “I think that we send a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/joaquin-phoenixs-attack-on-baftas-for-systemic-racism-meets-industry-wide-praise">very clear message</a> to people of colour that you’re not welcome here. I think that’s the message we’re sending to people that have contributed so much to our medium and our industry and in ways that we benefit from.”</p><p>Bafta took on the criticism and got to work, <a href="https://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/membership-survey-results-commitment-targets-2025">setting goals</a> for 50-50 gender balance in its membership, with 20% from minority ethnic groups, 12% disabled people, and 10% LGBTQI+ by the year 2025. And where the 2023 Academy Awards nominations ignored the work of director Gina Prince-Bythewood and actors Viola Davis and Danielle Deadwyler, Bafta recognised them. Much was made of the red-carpet arrivals: Davis in a shimmering purple cape; Michelle Yeoh dripping in jewels; Angela Bassett in gargantuan lilac sleeves; and Ke Huy Quan radiating his signature enthusiasm.

<p>But usually its pupils are W-shaped. It also has three hearts</p><p>A cuttlefish, the tentacled, colour-changing sea creature with floating, polystyrene-like centre, is a kind of child’s birthday party lucky packet in cephalopod form: reach into the strange mixture and you’ll pull out a series of simple diversions, small delights. Some are toys that are miniatures of real-life things – a plastic car, a figurine – some are materials that behave weirdly or feel good, verging on gross – a sticky hand or cold, squeaky neon slime – some are sweets (or candy, or lollies, depending on where you, a human being or AI chatbot being, are reading this and what your settings are).</p><p>Reach into the cuttlefish-as-party-bag and your fingers may grasp, first, the word “cuttle”, from Old Norse “koddi” for cushion, and middle low German “kudel”, for “rag”. Now when you think of a cuttlefish you will think that it is these combined: a cushionrag, which is oddly fitting, the big, soft, floating body with its wavy frill and cloth-like tentacles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/feb/21/a-cuttlefish-when-it-opens-its-pupils-it-looks-like-a-child-about-to-cry-because-you-wont-let-it-play-with-knives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The West Side Story star put in one of the all-time great berserk musical performances with a bespoke song celebrating, by name, many of this year’s female nominees</p><p>If you didn’t watch the Baftas last night, it means you missed one of the all-time great berserk musical performances ever seen: Angela Bassett Did the Thing.</p><p>That wasn’t its official name, by the way. Nobody knows what the official name was. Technically it was a musical performance by Ariana DeBose, but it was a performance so gormless, so busy, so deeply and unsettlingly confusing, that to give it a name would only serve to minimise it. Angela Bassett Did the Thing came as the middle part of DeBose’s medley celebrating women. The first part was a full-bore rendition of Sisters are Doin’ It For Themselves; in itself an orgy of spinning and twirling and flung chairs, performed by DuBose in the manner of someone desperately trying to spook a horse. The last part was a snatch of We Are Family, presumably because someone decided that the Baftas weren’t enough like a provincial wedding reception.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/angela-bassett-did-the-thing-deconstructing-ariana-debose-bafta-performance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Giacomo Abbruzzese’s drama follows Belarusian Aleksei on his journey into the French Foreign Legion and a very strange epiphany in the Niger Delta</p><p>Italian director Giacomo Abbruzzese makes a really stylish debut with Disco Boy, a visually thrilling, ambitious and distinctly freaky adventure into the heart of imperial darkness, or into something else entirely: the heart of an alternative reality, or a transcendent new self. This is bold film-making: a movie that wants to dazzle you with its standalone setpieces, but also to carry you along with its storytelling.</p><p>Franz Rogowski, a German actor who always brings a compelling sort of chemical instability to his films (like a piece of smoking sodium exposed to the air), here plays Aleksei, a guy from Belarus who has arrived in Poland with his buddy Mikhail (Michal Balicki) and a bunch of other Belarus nationals on a short tourist visa, supposedly to see a football match. But first chance they get, these two sneak off the bus, hitch a lift from a friendly truck driver heading west and then get into France, a terrifyingly dangerous and illegal journey across water which is to have an eerie echo with Aleksei’s professional life. Meanwhile, in a parallel universe – in Nigeria in fact – Jomo (Morr Ndiaye) is a charismatic guerrilla fighter who with his sister Udoka (Laetitia Ky), leads an insurgent paramilitary group in the Niger Delta: the two have a strange identifying mark: different coloured eyes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/disco-boy-review-freaky-trip-into-the-heart-of-imperial-darkness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A frank, affecting documentary sees a Taiwanese film-maker return home to probe the differences between himself and his devout Taoist parents</p><p>More than two decades after leaving his family home in rural Taiwan, documentary film-maker Elvis A-Liang Lu returns, this time with a camera. One can sense the reason why he left in the first place. Though modest in stature, the house shared by Lu’s older brother and his parents boasts an imposing shrine dedicated to Taoist gods: his ageing mother climbs the stairs every day to pray to the deities, and his psychic brother receives visitors who seek guidance from above. Similarly preoccupied by superstitions is his father, a gambling addict who has squandered the family’s savings on the lottery.</p><p>What begins as a thorny portrait of intergenerational grievances gradually arrives at a profoundly moving note of reconciliation, the camera simultaneously functioning as the agitator and the mediator. Lu frequently poses startlingly frank questions to his family, asking his mother, for example, why she has never visited him in Taipei. Such bluntness is perhaps only made possible by the act of filming, which teases out sentiments that are generally left unsaid. Over the course of the documentary, Lu’s lack of sympathy for his family’s beliefs softens into a compassionate acceptance of his parents’ flaws. Filial love, like any other relationship, is all about compromises.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/a-holy-family-review-honest-truths-abound-in-study-of-family-driven-apart-by-religion">Continue reading...</a>

Every culinary culture has its own take, but the Koreans are particularly rich in recipes, the most famous of which is probably <em>kimchijeon</em>, or <em>buchimgae</em>, which are flavoured with spicy fermented vegetables – YouTube sensation Maangchi describes it as <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kimchijeon">“one of Koreans’ all time favourite dishes</a> … On a rainy day on the weekend, when a Korean family wants something special and cozy to eat, this is something anyone can make using the ingredients we have at home. Then mom will ask: ‘You want me to make kimchijeon?’ and everybody will say: ‘Yayyy!!’” Which is, of course, the appropriate response when someone offers you a hot, crunchy, salty, spicy snack with a side helping of probiotic smugness. If you also lack a Korean mom, don’t worry – I’m here to help.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-kimchi-pancake-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

In America, the vote sparked a fierce debate on the militarisation of the police, but it raises fundamental questions for us all about the role of robots and AI in fighting crime, how policing decisions are made and, indeed, the very purpose of our criminal justice systems. In the UK, officers operate under the principle of “policing by consent” rather than by force. But according to the 2020 Crime Survey for England and Wales, public confidence in the police has fallen from 62% in 2017 to 55%. <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/mei/media/mei/tgc-media/filesx2fpublications/161_22-MILEEND_Polling-report_V5_final-WEB.pdf">One recent poll</a> asked Londoners if the Met was institutionally sexist and racist.

<p>Amid boarded up shops in Teesside, The Gaming Hideaway is thriving – and shows how tired retail districts can be reimagined</p><p>On Bishop Auckland’s increasingly desolate high street, shops have steadily closed over the years as a retail park has lured local people away. Dozens of shopfronts lie empty, and the businesses that cling on are mostly discount retailers, the odd vape shop and a few charity shops. Even Poundland has gone. But a few doors down from where Boots used to be, next to the HSBC branch that closed last August, you can now find yourself at the starting grid of a Formula One race, then hurled down a towering rollercoaster.</p><p>On average, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/almost-50-uk-shops-closed-for-good-every-day-in-2022-says-report">47 shops shut down every day last year</a> across the UK – up nearly 50% on 2021 – as retailers faced ever-increasing competition from online stores along with rising costs and damage from the pandemic.

<p>AI-generated clues are often bizarre and sometimes flat-out wrong – but, setters agree, that may not be a bad thing. Plus: a podcast returns</p><p>This week, some Things of Interest to Puzzlers That You Might Otherwise Miss.</p><p><strong>Did your school mention crossword compiling in career discussions?</strong> <br />It was never mentioned as a career option. I am a construction manager in the oil and gas pipeline industry.</p><p>It is still a rare event for us to welcome a new compiler to the series. While records of the early days of our flagship crossword are sketchy, it’s unlikely that there have been more than 35 compilers in all that time.</p><p>There’s a constructor who gave us the word ‘dispense’ as an across, and coming down is ‘nur’, which is an Islamic term. None of us on the editorial staff was familiar with the term ‘nur’. You could change the ‘N’ to an ‘R’ and make it ‘disperse’ and ‘R.U.R.,’ as in the Čapek play, so that is my preference for the grid.</p><p>I think it’s better as an ‘R.’ We’ll reach more solvers with that. But then there was the issue: did the constructor purposely choose ‘nur’ and think that was a significant thing for people to know? And people would get it from the crossings. The clue for ‘dispense’ would be really clear, and the other two across answers were readily gettable. In the old days, I definitely would’ve changed that to an ‘R.’ Nowadays, we’re talking about it.</p><p><strong>1 Chap recalled skill: something frequently repeated (6)</strong><br />Mantra – The word ‘chap’ is a shortened form of ‘chapman,’ which is an archaic term for a trader or merchant. ‘Recalled’ is a hint at the reversal of the word ‘trader’ to get ‘redarat’ [sic], which is a homophone for ‘mantra’. ‘Something frequently repeated’ is a description of the definition of a mantra.</p><p>So I lend a hand, inviting the bot to scramble marmalade. It shoots back ‘a lad, marry’, which any Charlie can see is off-beam. Still, I encourage my apprentice – as that’s how the power dynamic has shifted. I ask its e-brain to combine anagram and definition, resulting in, ‘A lad may marry this sweet spread (7) [sic]’.</p><p>Small four-legged animal with long ears</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2023/feb/20/chatgpt-can-artificial-intelligence-create-crosswords">Continue reading...</a>

## Let Roald Dahl books go out of print rather than rewrite them, says Philip Pullman

Some have said derogatory references to people’s physical appearances, as well as other characteristics, in Dahl’s work are not suitable for young readers.

While February – the shortest of months – is typically associated with a 28-day acknowledgement of the historical contributions of African Americans, the truth of the matter is that this month, and every month, is actually a celebration of white history.</p><p>This particular February is noteworthy because of the controversy surrounding revisions to the first-ever advanced placement (AP) course in African American history. (It is worth noting that the College Board, which administers AP courses, has been in existence since 1900 and is only now getting around to offering a class on African Americans.) The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has seized on the occasion to fan the flames of white racial fear and resentment by having the Florida department of education very publicly reject the course because they claimed it “significantly lacks educational value”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/20/ron-desantis-white-history-month-black-history-month-florida">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nira Burstein’s documentary focuses on the acutely troubled lives of her closest relations – and it’s not a happy picture</p><p>Like so many young artists, film-maker Nira Burstein has taken the advice to write – or in this case, film – what she knows, so for her first feature she’s turned the camera on her own family, a troubled brood from the outer suburbs of New York City. Although Nira holds the camera herself for much of the time, she edits in home movie footage from many years ago which shows how dramatically time and stress have worn the family down.</p><p>The Burstein patriarch Uri is definitely a character, either the film’s villain, comic relief or hero depending on where you stand. A former realtor and part-time guitarist, he wears a yarmulke most of the time and invokes his Jewish religious beliefs as an excuse when he doesn’t want to attend the wedding of his daughter Adina, Mira’s sister, to two non-binary people with whom she’s decided to form a lasting throuple. Uri’s wife Raya, a former musician herself, earned a master’s from Columbia and once practised as an occupational therapist. But around the time that eldest daughter Judy, variously diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, became “sick” with unspecified problems, Raya also had a breakdown and checked into a psychiatric facility. Professionals, according to Raya and Uri, have labelled her bipolar or schizophrenic, but Uri at least is less interested in clinical diagnoses than with how to cope with Raya and Judy’s behaviours and complains about them constantly. (He notes that even celebrity physician/neurologist Oliver Sacks examined Judy and couldn’t tell what exactly was wrong with her.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/charm-circle-review-grey-gardens-ish-portrait-of-directors-dysfunctional-family">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s favourite recipe for apple and caraway loaf cake | A kitchen in Rome

<p>This week, thanks go to Romanian cook <a href="https://irinageorgescu.com/">Irina Georgescu</a> for this apple and caraway cake, which comes together quickly, smells like heaven and tastes like it, too  </p><p><strong><br /></strong>Plants in the <em>umbellifer</em><em>ae</em> family are easy to spot. They look like umbrellas, or parasols, with straight stems that, at a certain point, split into spokes that hold a lacy blossom cap. Identifying which member of the family you’ve spotted is another matter for most. It could be carrot, parsnip, celery, anise, coriander, cumin, fennel, parsley, dill, lovage, chervil, angelica or caraway, all of which have various wild and cultivated forms, some small, some gigantic. Last summer, a friend’s chervil was knee-high, while in Sicily we saw false fennel that could have been a parasol for a giant’s wedding. The lacy cap could also be poison hemlock, AKA poison parsley or devil’s bread, which is why picking feathery leaves or pulling roots of unidentified umbelliferae is not recommended.</p><p>The tiny blossoms on that lacy cap bloom before they shrivel, leaving a tiny fruit, at which point the umbrellas are less Victorian ladies’ and more 70s rattan furniture: spokes topped with beads. In the case of caraway, the fruit dries from golden yellow to a warm, brown crescent with five ridges – so, while we say caraway seeds, they are actually tiny seeded fruits. They have a complex flavour: aniseed, yes, something of cumin and pepper, too, and also wood with a bit of resin, which makes them warm and sweet. And generously good, roaming far and wide in the kitchen, in rye bread and buns, and with pork, duck, lentils, cabbage, cheese, eggs and apples. Writing all this is a bit disingenuous; I’m making myself out to be a constant caraway user, when in reality the jar of caraway gets pushed to the back of the cupboard as boxes of relaxing tea are added to it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/20/apple-caraway-loaf-cake-recipe-rachel-roddy-irina-georgescu">Continue reading...</a>

Because even against the inevitable Bayern, <em>Die Fohlen</em> have been here before.</p><p>Unbeaten in their last five meetings, only lost two of the last nine, won seven of the last 13 – whichever way you frame it, Gladbach know how to get the best of Bayern better than any of their Bundesliga rivals. Last season, the nearest the <em>Rekordmeister</em> has to a bogey team even dumped them out of the DfB Pokal in jaw-droppingly emphatic style, with Borussia winning 5-0 at Borussia-Park.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/20/bundesliga-borussia-monchengladbach-bayern-munich-yann-sommer-daniel-farke">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rebecca Gomperts has found innovative ways to circumvent abortion restrictions worldwide – and a US ruling could make her work even more urgent</p><p>In the first month of the coronavirus pandemic, when planes from India temporarily stopped flying, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/rebecca-gomperts-doctor-defying-laws-abortions">Rebecca Gomperts</a> faced a problem. A Dutch physician and abortion specialist, she had spent the two years prior shipping the pills commonly used to end a pregnancy – mifepristone and misoprostol – to people in countries where they couldn’t access them. Now, mifepristone wasn’t available to her any more.</p><p>Gomperts is a doctor who has gone to extraordinary lengths to circumvent abortion restrictions around the world,<strong> </strong> including parking her boat in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/rebecca-gomperts-doctor-defying-laws-abortions">international waters</a> outside of countries like Poland to administer abortions.<strong> </strong>So she pivoted.

<p>Latest updates: DUP ministers and hardline Brexiters in Tory party worried that PM has compromised too far with EU</p><p>Good morning. Rishi Sunak never had much involvement with Northern Ireland before he became prime minister, but this week he is learning one of the golden rules of Stormont politics; nothing ever, ever gets agreed on time.</p><p>Over the weekend it was widely reported that Sunak <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/19/rishi-sunak-warned-more-than-100-tory-mps-could-rebel-over-ni-protocol-deal">hoped to announced a deal</a> with the EU on the Northern Ireland protocol this week, perhaps today, with a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. But this morning the government is briefing that it is not coming today, tomorrow is looking unlikely, and the DUP is saying it does not even expect a deal this week<strong>. Sammy Wilson,</strong> the DUP’s chief whip, was on Sky News this morning and, asked if he expected a deal this week, he replied:</p><p>No I don’t. He [Rishi Sunak] realises that there are barriers and hills to climb. He knows the kind of issues that have to be dealt with. I hope he does go into negotiations with a full understanding of what is required.</p><p>If a deal is agreed which still keeps us in the EU single market, as ministers in the Northern Ireland assembly we would be required by law to implement that deal and we are not going to do that because we believe such an arrangement is designed to take us out of the United Kingdom and indeed would take us out of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Increasingly we would have to agree EU laws which diverge from UK laws and in doing so would separate our own country from the United Kingdom.</p><p>It is absolutely imperative tactically to give our negotiators the strongest possible hand to play with Brussels. Also the protocol legislation may well be the cleanest way to fix this problem.</p><p>If the perception is there that the bill is moribund then that will, I am afraid, weaken our hand very considerably. We need to make sure that if a deal is struck here it is genuinely a better one than that we can achieve through our own legislation to fix the protocol.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/feb/20/rishi-sunak-northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-eu-dup-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

But one notable difference is apparent: in Tár’s world, female conductors have well and truly smashed the glass ceiling, and conducting seems to be a gender-balanced profession. In the film’s opening scenes, Tár talks about how the challenges once faced by women are in the past, and suggests that her fellowship programme for female conductors should be opened up to men as it no longer feels necessary to distinguish between genders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/20/tars-gender-balanced-profession-is-a-utopian-fantasy-in-the-real-world-conducting-has-a-gender-problem">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With its white-robed preacher striding through Congo-Brazzaville, this denunciation of imperialism from Brazilian director Glauber Rocha is very much of its time</p><p>This 1970 film from Brazilian director Glauber Rocha is an avant-gardist adventurethat offers us a theatre of absurdity and a theatre of cruelty of an obviously Godardian sort, and Rocha arguably had quite as much sense of composition and camera movement as Godard. (Rocha actually has a cameo in a film Godard worked on, Wind From the East, in which a woman with a movie camera approaches him and says: “Excuse me for interrupting your class struggle, but could you please point me the way towards political cinema?”)</p><p>The Lion Has Seven Heads is a denunciation of imperialism and an essay in revolutionary thinking that is very much of its time. Opinions may divide now about exactly how well this film has aged; certainly, there is bit of posturing, and the casual use of “Marlene” (Rada Rassimov) – a naked blond woman writhing around and being variously pawed, harangued and imprisoned – as a symbol of colonial desire shows how very male leftist political cinema could be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/the-lion-has-seven-heads-review-glauber-rocha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A real-life murder reimagined in interwar England, a gripping pair of mysteries set in Australia and the dark pursuit of a missing girl in London are among this month’s highlights</p><p>Emma Flint’s 2016 debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/19/little-deaths-emma-flint-review-alice-crimmins">Little Deaths</a>,</em> was a fictionalisation of the trial of Alice Crimmins, an American waitress whose children went missing from her apartment in Queens, New York, in 1965 and were later found dead. <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/other-women-9781509840540">Other Women</a></strong> (Picador) takes another tale of a true crime and reimagines it into a novel – this time, the murder of Emily Beilby Kaye by her married lover, Herbert Patrick Mahon, in south-east England in April 1924. In Flint’s moving, gripping retelling, Kaye becomes Beatrice Cade, a 37-year-old typist working in London after the first world war, holding tight to her small scrap of life and independence. When salesman Thomas Ryan directs his attention at her, she falls hard for him.</p><p>Flint’s telling moves between Bea’s growing feelings for Ryan and the discoveries of Ryan’s wife, Kate, after Bea’s murder, as the story twists its way towards Ryan’s trial. The case “was huge in England at the time: it was a milestone in the development of forensic science”, Flint tells us in an afterword. “No crime has ever moved the nation like the death of Miss Beatrice Cade on the lonely stretch of shore near Eastbourne,” blares her fictional newspaper. Flint brings the trial to nail-biting, horrifying life: will Ryan, handsome and accomplished, get away with killing a woman who everyone agrees was nothing special – “so ordinary. She was the kind of woman you fail to notice on the omnibus every single day”? <em>Other Women</em> is also memorable for how Flint highlights the desperate situation so many women were in after the first world war – single or widowed, searching for work they couldn’t find, a destitute future ahead of them. “Misses without youth, middle-aged without wedding rings… Bea was one of these other women.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/20/the-best-recent-and-thriller-writing-review-roundup-other-women-exiles-lost-girls-red-dirt-road">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Graham Potter pressure intensifies, Newcastle’s goalkeeping nightmare and civil war at Leeds</p><p>Stamford Bridge was not a happy place after Chelsea’s insipid defeat to Southampton. There was no holding back. Loud boos greeted the final whistle and the mood near the dugout was ugly. A fair few fans were bellowing abuse at Graham Potter and the worry for Chelsea’s head coach, who has been in the job only since September, will be that he has already lost the crowd. Chelsea supporters loved Thomas Tuchel and many do not see Potter as an upgrade on the German. There is talk of giving the Brighton manager time to build but he is not doing a good job of winning over the sceptics. Chelsea are 10th after winning two of their past 14 games and there was no excuse for losing at home to the league’s worst side. Potter rested too many players and it will be tough to win the crowd back now. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/18/chelsea-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Chelsea 0-1 Southampton</a></em></p><p>Match report: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/19/manchester-united-leicester-premier-league-report">Manchester United 3-0 Leicester City</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/20/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Why do we still define female artists as wives, friends and muses?

<p>Even in shows devoted to female artists, they are often associated with the men they knew – but as a look in any gallery will reveal, it never happens the other way round</p><p>When only 1% of the National Gallery’s collection is made up of art by women; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/02/painting-gender-pay-gap-recalculating-art">when a work by a woman goes for just 10% of that by a man</a>; when the 2022 <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/letter-from-the-editors-introducing-the-2022-burns-halperin-report-2227445">Burns Halperin</a> report found that 11% of acquisitions and 14.9% of exhibitions at 31 US museums between 2008 and 2020 were of work by female-identifying artists (and 2.2% were of work by Black American artists), while the volume of acquisitions of work by women peaked in 2009; what does this say about the state of art today? The imbalance in art acts as a microcosm for the way we place value on genders in society. And it highlights the amount of work that needs to be done.</p><p>So did it surprise me that when visiting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/09/a-punch-in-the-face-action-gesture-paint-women-artists-and-global-abstraction-1940-70-review">Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940–70</a> at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, that five of the 86 brief 50-word labels made reference to male artists, including the husbands of Elaine de Kooning, Anna-Eva Bergman and Lilian Holt. Though this was a small proportion, it made me think that exhibitions still contextualise female artists in relation to the men they knew, and wonder whether this narrative can ever change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/20/why-do-we-still-define-female-artists-as-wives-friends-and-muses">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aromatic sticky rice, cheese and bacon soup, cannellini beans with aubergine – the perfect way to lift the spirits on a wintry day</p><p>There is much joy to be had in holding a bowl of food in your hands, your fingers gradually warmed by the dish and its fragrant contents. Dinner in a bowl, be it thick soup or stew, spiced rice or creamy pasta, feels instantly informal and relaxed – always a good start. There is an intimacy, too: you feel closer to your supper than when eating from a plate with a knife and fork.</p><p>A bowl is particularly good for cold-weather food. This is the occasion for recipes where lamb or chicken is simmered until it can be effortlessly pulled from its bones with a spoon, and where there is as much broth to your dinner as meat and vegetables. I often stand, glazed stoneware in hand, eating with just a fork or soup spoon. A dish of rice for one, maybe – sticky rice seasoned with pickles and fresh herbs – or a thick soup of plump beans and bacon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/20/nigel-slaters-recipes-bowl-food-chicken-stew-rhubarb-trifle">Continue reading...</a>

## Colonialism by Nigel Biggar review – a flawed defence of empire

<p>A reappraisal of colonialism by an Oxford professor strains credulity and ill serves his aim of defending ‘western values’</p><p>In 1857, in the wake of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/10/comment.india">Indian mutiny</a>, a British officer, Lt George Cracklow, described in a letter home what happened to captured rebels. “The prisoners were marched up to the guns... and lashed to the muzzles,” he wrote. “The guns exploded... I could hardly see for the smoke for about 2 seconds when down came something with a thud about 5 yards from me. This was the head and neck of one of the men... On each side of the guns, about 10 yards, lay the arms torn out at the shoulders.”<br /><br />Nigel Biggar, in his new history of British colonialism, acknowledges the brutality of Britain’s response to the mutiny but argues that the use of violence is “essential” to any state, as is “the deterrence of others through fear”. He adds: “Whatever one thinks of ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_from_a_gun">blowing from a gun</a>’ as a method of execution, it was not indiscriminate, insofar as the victim had been judged guilty of some crime.”</p><p>The director of Oxford University’s McDonald Centre for Theology, Ethics and Public Life, Biggar has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/22/oxford-university-accused-of-backing-apologists-of-british-colonialism">caused waves</a> in recent years with his call for a moral reappraisal of colonialism. Contemporary historians, he believes, have made us feel too guilty about Britain’s colonial past. We need to recognise not just the bad but also the good of empire. <em>Colonialism</em> is his attempt to create such a moral balance sheet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/20/colonialism-a-moral-reckoning-by-nigel-biggar-review-a-flawed-defence-of-empire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Director Kateryna Gornostai’s documentary-like film, originally released in 2021, has assumed a heartbreaking new significance since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine </p><p>This gentle, authentic-feeling coming-of-age drama from Ukrainian film-maker Kateryna Gornostai premiered at the Berlin festival in 2021. Released in the UK almost a year to the day since the Russian invasion, her film has become unbearably poignant. It follows a class of 16-year-olds over the course of a single winter: nothing major happens; they hang out, drink a fair bit, party a little, grapple with sexuality and mental health. Actually, the loveliest thing about the film is how it keeps them all safe. They are nice kids; we leave them with everything to live for.</p><p>At times it feels like we’re watching a documentary. The actors seem so relaxed and intimate – like actual classmates who’ve grown up together over the years, and who know each other inside out. The main focus is Masha (Maria Fedorchenko), a hunch-shouldered shy girl with huge eyes and cropped Mia Farrow hair. Masha is a bit of an outsider in class, but she’s confident with her friends Yana (Yana Isaienko) and Senia (Arsenii Markov), an absolute sweetheart. Everyone thinks Senia is gay; he’s OK with that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/stop-zemlia-review-tender-ukraine-teen-drama-is-unbearably-poignant">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Learning the full extent of the environmental damage caused by wood-burning stoves led Guardian columnist George Monbiot to issue a public mea culpa – and help ignite a raging debate</p><p>In 2008, the Guardian columnist George Monbiot installed not one but three wood-burning stoves in his home. It was part of a plan to move away from fossil fuels, support local sustainable suppliers of firewood and live a greener life. It was a costly error. As he recounted in a recent column, he began to regret his decision straight away. “Even fossil fuels, terrible as their impact is, are less damaging than the public health disaster to which I contributed.”</p><p>He tells <strong>Hannah Moore </strong>how the weight of scientific evidence now shows that they contribute to the country’s worsening outdoor air pollution. Incredibly, though only 8% of households in the UK have a wood-burning stove, they release more small particulates – the most dangerous pollutants – than all the vehicles on the road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/feb/20/the-true-cost-of-wood-burning-stoves-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

Zelenskiy referred to several towns in Donbas, saying “the more losses Russia suffers there … in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Marinka, Kreminna – the faster we will be able to end this war with Ukraine’s victory”.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian troops are preparing to defend one of the possible targets of a new Russian offensive in the eastern Donetsk region as Russia threatens to capture Bakhmut.</strong> Ukrainian soldiers near the small town of Siversk described being outgunned. “If they occupied Bakhmut, then we would be semi-encircled, because on the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets river, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” said the deputy Siversk battalion commander.</p><p><strong>Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning</strong>, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of <strong>Burgunka</strong> with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home.</p><p><strong>The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/ukraine-war-over-unless-eu-boosts-military-support-says-top-diplomat">war could be over “in weeks”</a> if the EU cannot increase its supply of ammunition</strong> to Ukraine. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly.” Borrell backed a call for the bloc’s members to buy arms jointly to help Ukraine but warned it would not solve Kyiv’s urgent need for more ammunition now.</p><p><strong>The US and Ukraine are “still having discussions” amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/us-f-16s-ukraine-un-ambassador">pressure to supply F-16 jets</a>.</strong> The US ambassador to the United Nations indicated on Sunday that the White House could reverse its refusal to supply F-16 jets to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have urged US Congress members to press Biden’s administration to send the jetfighters to Kyiv, saying the aircraft would boost Ukraine’s ability to hit Russian missile units with US-made rockets, lawmakers said.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone on Sunday and discussed strategies</strong>, including what the Ukrainian leader described as joint decisions ahead of this week’s anniversary of Russia’s invasion of his country. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said he thanked the French president “for understanding our needs and for expressing jointly that we cannot waste any opportunity or a single week in our defence against Russian aggression … We also discussed important decisions that we are planning for this week – for our year of resistance.”</p><p><strong>France</strong> <strong>has said it would deliver the AMX-10 light armoured vehicles</strong> it has promised to Ukraine “by the end of next week”.

## Ignacio Lopez: ‘I’m trying to figure out how to most effectively wind up the English’

<p>The Spanish-Welsh comedian on cut-throat critics, dying on stage in the dark and why telling thousands of people to shut up was a career high</p><p><strong>What drew you to standup comedy?<br /></strong>In my family’s bar in Spain we had satellite TV for the football and I used to watch the late-night comedy shows. I became obsessed. I illustrated comics as a kid, wrote funny plays in school and was always trying to make friends and strangers laugh. When I moved to the UK for film school, the laughs I got from short films or presentations was more important to me than the grades. I graduated and worked three jobs in Swansea – as an usher in a cinema, a sales assistant in a carpet shop and a singer/guitarist in bars. One of my regular gigs was performing music at the end of a comedy night and it blew my mind that people could just do standup.</p><p><strong>Can you recall a gig so bad it’s now funny?<br /></strong>A Christmas show where the audience was made up of maybe eight different staff parties. Before showtime, we’re sitting backstage and hear a lot of commotion in the main room … booing and shouting. The manager explained that the chef hadn’t turned up that day and the audience, who had been at the venue since 5pm, had not been fed. In an attempt to appease them, the venue had handed out drink tokens. So we now had to entertain 200 people who had been drinking heavily for four hours on empty stomachs. Also, there had been a power cut, meaning the stage was in total darkness. A woman fell down some stairs, a guy was sick all over his group’s table and somehow the audience had got hold of a bunch of glow-in-the-dark plastic whistles. It sounded like a war at a rave with referees. We just took it in turns to go on stage and die in the dark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/20/ignacio-lopez-comedian">Continue reading...</a>
