<p id="aPGeja">Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11382547B2/en">filed a patent application</a> for a “brain stimulation system to provide a sense of wellbeing” back in 2016, and it was granted last year. But I only discovered it <a href="https://mstdn.social/@GazEtc/109665578358682615">thanks to a more recent Mastodon post by attorney Jeff Steck</a>, and I am <em>fascinated. </em>Embraer’s reasonable starting premise is that lots of people become anxious on long car, train, and airplane rides, “turning a short trip into a long one.” From there,...</p>

  <p id="7aNbuo">Social networks have struggled with spam, scams, impersonation, and account hijacking for years. And over the past week, two of them unveiled a new plan for dealing with it: passing the cost to users.</p>
<p id="H34kTc">The first move came from Twitter, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23605073/twitter-blue-charge-sms-2fa">made SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) a premium feature</a> late last week. After March 20th, users will need to either switch to an app-based authentication system, pay $8 to $11 a month, or turn off the basic security feature. The decision is part of a larger attempt to push people onto subscription-based Twitter, and Musk also agreed with <a href="https://twitter.com/TitterTakeover/status/1626781483435188226">a tweet saying</a> that it’s also an attempt to cut down on carriers charging Twitter for spam SMS messages.</p>

As such, the Five will likely remain part of Sonos’ lineup after the pending hardware announcements.</p>

That’s because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23605073/twitter-blue-charge-sms-2fa">Twitter’s putting the feature behind a paywall</a>, which means you either have to pay $8 per month for Blue or switch to another authentication method — and I think most of us would choose the latter. </p>
<p id="qwl1s4">Fortunately, SMS 2FA isn’t the only way to secure your Twitter account, with other methods still available for free. The platform’s shutdown of the feature — at least for non-Blue subscribers — is actually a good reminder that we shouldn’t be using it in the first place.</p>

  <p id="LM8zT4">Microsoft is preparing to launch a new version of Microsoft Teams next month that has been rebuilt from the ground up to significantly improve its system resource usage on PCs and laptops. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the software giant has recently started testing this new Teams client broadly inside Microsoft, with plans to roll out a preview to Microsoft Teams users in March.</p>
<p id="CcdDtF">Known as Microsoft Teams 2.0 or 2.1 internally, Microsoft has been working on this new Teams client for years. The app should use 50 percent less memory, tax the CPU less, and result in better battery life on laptops.</p>

  <p id="Kyl2jg">Former NBA champion Paul Pierce has agreed to pay over $1.4 million in penalties after unlawfully promoting the EthereumMax (EMAX) cryptocurrency to his Twitter audience. In a statement <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-34">published on Friday</a>, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges against the former Boston Celtics player — nicknamed ‘The Truth’ — for making “false and misleading” statements about EMAX and failing to disclose that he was paid more than $244,000 worth of EMAX tokens to <a href="https://twitter.com/paulpierce34/status/1397628485917577217?lang=en">promote the cryptocurrency to his social media following</a>.</p>
<p id="4LyRKm">In one example of his illicit activity, the commission claims that Pierce <a href="https://twitter.com/paulpierce34/status/1398294745806299139">tweeted a misleading screenshot</a> of an account displaying significant EMAX holdings and profits without disclosing that the image did not...</p>

  <p id="bbXaOz">Almost two decades after the release of the Guillermo del Toro-directed <em>Hellboy</em>, the character is getting yet another reboot. Millennium Media has confirmed that <em>Hellboy: The Crooked Man</em> will enter production next month in Bulgaria, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/hellboy-crooked-man-details-plot-production-millennium-efm-1235264086/"><em>Deadline </em>reports</a>. Casting for the titular character (originally played by Ron Perlman and then David Harbour) is yet to be announced, but the new film will be directed by Brian Taylor, best known for the Jason Statham action movie <em>Crank.</em></p>
<p id="XR68nv">Perhaps most interesting is that the comics’ original creator Mike Mignola has written the script for the upcoming film alongside Chris Golden. Both were reported to have worked on the script for the 2019 reboot <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/hellboy-reboot-works-stranger-things-star-david-harbour-1001462/">by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, though Andrew Cosby ultimately ended...</p>
