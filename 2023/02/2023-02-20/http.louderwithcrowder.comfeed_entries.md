No, not their military.

<p>The pigs were created by cross-breeding domestic pigs with wild boars imported from Europe. Farmers began doing this to raise the offspring for meat, and larger pigs meant more meat. However, the pigs soon got into the while, as many of the pigs escaped from farms. Others were purposely released into the wild because the demand for pig meat just wasn't high enough. </p><p>Since then, the pigs have been allowed to "breed uncontrolled for decades". And thus was born the mobs of Super Pigs, hurdling towards the United States border. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/20/us-threat-canada-super-pig-boar" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, <em>"The wild pigs are also responsible for a laundry list of environmental damages, ranging from eating innocent farmers’ crops to destroying trees and polluting water. They also pose “a human health and safety risk."  </em></p><p>So that sounds pretty bad. But wait, there's more! At least one Super Pig clocked in at 661 pounds, which makes it able to survive even the harshest Canadian winter. The "experts" originally thought it'd be no big deal if a Super Pig escaped into the wild because pigs can't survive the -50 C windchills of Canadian winters. But these are no average pigs. The Super Pigs tunnel up to 2 meters under the snow to create a "snow cave" and use their tusks to cut cattails to use as a warm insulation layer. Yes, they literally build themselves a little bed so they can live another day to wreak havoc on the ecosystem. Cunning little creatures, they are.</p><p>So is there any hope of eradicating this Super Pig problem? Not really - at least not in Canada. The Canadians have mainly been focused on managing the damage caused by the pigs as opposed to the 600-pound beasts themselves. And they've made themselves quite at home.  </p>

## 'I have been stripped of my authority': James O'Keefe brings receipts over who ousted him from Project Veritas

So, essentially, Project Veritas is no more. The upside is James O'Keefe had receipts to share before his departure. He Project Veritas-ed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-board-directors" target="_blank">Project Veritas</a>. And it's wonderful to see. </p><p>O'Keefe announced his removal from the board and as CEO to his staff earlier today, saying,<em> "A former board member told me 10 years ago, Project Veritas will never be stopped from the outside. It will only be because we stopped ourselves... We find ourselves in that situation today, where I have been stripped of my authority as CEO and removed from the board."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>And then came the receipts. O'Keefe had a text message from a Veritas board member who told a journalist they'd get a pay raise if O'Keefe was forced out: <em>"You get a raise if there is a restructure without James O'Keefe." </em></p><p>The board member deleted the message, but not before the journalist took screenshots. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>O'Keefe also revealed a Project Veritas officer sent an email to the board alleging that Project Veritas funds had been used to pay the down payment for O'Keefe's wedding. Which is strange, given that O'Keefe is not, nor has ever been, married. </p><p>The expense was in fact for a wedding venue, but it was actually used for their company's Christmas party. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cJames O'Keefe says that a Project Veritas officer lied to the board about him using corporate funds for a "wedding" despite the fact that he's never been married and that it was used for the company Christmas party.\u201d</div> — Greg Price (@Greg Price)

<p>I don't know what's happening here, but I know that this whole thing stinks to high heaven. It seems the board may have gotten their feelings hurt, and decided to oust the leader and face of their company as retribution. Or it could have a little something to do with a certain uber-powerful pharmaceutical company. But the situation is undeniably corrupt. One of the donors mentioned in the allegations against O'Keefe<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-donor-project-veritas" target="_blank"> refuted the claims</a> and said they were "blown out of proportion". </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cA donor who was mentioned in the list of allegations against  @JamesOKeefeIII that resulted in him being placed on leave from Project Veritas has refuted the claims. In a video posted on Instagram, Dianna Remmers said her interactions with James were misrepresented in the letter.\u201d</div> — Andy Ng\u00f4 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@Andy Ng\u00f4 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08)

<p>There does seem to be a silver lining here. Project Veritas may be dead, but James O'Keefe is not. He <a href="https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1627743289033240576?s=20" target="_blank">told</a> his staff, <em>"Our mission continues on. I'm not done. The mission will perhaps take on a new name, and it may no longer be called Veritas, I'll need a bunch of people around me, and I'll make sure you know how to find me."</em></p><p><p>

## Controversial shop teacher gives first interview: claims they're not a dude, not trans, but the size-z boobs are real

That honor goes to the revelation Kayla's size-Z chesticles -- believed to be prosthetics since she was believed to be a he -- are ALL NATURAL BABY!</p><p>If the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/19/canadian-teacher-with-size-z-breasts-kayla-lemieux-claims-they-are-real/" target="_blank">New York Post doesn't get a Pulitzer for this reporting</a>, we shouldn't bother having a Pulitzer. They landed the first and only interview with Kayla, who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-dresses-man" target="_blank">denied being the dude she was accused of being in the last story</a>. More shocking than that is a claim Kayla's boobs are real. She (I think) suffers from something called gigantomastia.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="b17a0" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33061234&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>It's sometimes called macromastia or breast hypertrophy. Also, and this is key, Kayla has no way of proving they suffer from this condition. They were never formally diagnosed.</p><p>As Kayla explains. "It’s rare, there’s no doubt about it. It affects women on a very rare basis, but in my case, I believe — and my doctor thinks — because I have XX chromosomes as well, that has something to do with it, and hormone sensitivity to estrogen has caused it."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Remember, last fall <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-rumor" target="_self">the anon boards started to report</a> the teacher -- when identifying as a male -- was almost fired for "toxic masculinity" and would tell his shop class of impressional young boys how silly the idea of things like gender-neutral bathrooms is? </p><blockquote>He's now upping the ante to exploit the very clown world the school and society itself has created. His long game is most likely to get fired, then sue for discrimination.</blockquote><p>I'm leaning more and more toward this being a massive troll job. What I'm not sure if who is being trolled. The easy money is it's a massive indictment on the Canadian government and public school system. Each story has been more ridiculous than one before.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-suspension" target="_self" title="view post: Students threatened with suspension, forbidden from taking any more photos of Kayla Lemieux">Students threatened with suspension, forbidden from taking any more photos of Kayla Lemieux</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canadian-teacher-poolside" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Shop teacher Kayla Lemieux with those enormous fake knockers debuts their new poolside look">Shop teacher Kayla Lemieux with those enormous fake knockers debuts their new poolside look</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-dance-recital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Trans teacher with ginormous fake breasts sneaks into children's dance recital, asked to leave by parents">Trans teacher with ginormous fake breasts sneaks into children's dance recital, asked to leave by parents</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-skydiving" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Our favorite beautiful and brave 'chesty' shop teacher goes skydiving, but not all of 'her' makes it">Our favorite beautiful and brave 'chesty' shop teacher goes skydiving, but not all of 'her' makes it</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: That trans shop teacher with enormous fake chesticles?

Think that James Lindsay/Peter Boghossian's project <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/this-video-exposes-sjw-corruption-in-academics" target="_blank">where they submitted fake studies to expose academia</a>. Only instead, Kayla is the fake study to see how many clicks they can bait.</p><p>I'd be happy to admit I got got if that's the case. It beats what we're expected to accept as reality.</p><p><p>

## CNN claims they didn't punish Don Lemon, they gave him time off because y'all are being too mean to him

Lemon was not at work Friday due to a "planned' vacation day. Lemon also was not at work today. CNN is refuting reports his days at CNN are numbered with one of the dumbest excuses I've ever heard.</p><p>A report in a gossip site claims Lemon's future is being reevaluated and that the journalismer has become a constant distraction. <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/new-cnn-denies-report-don-lemon-benched-over-sexist-comments-but-he-wont-be-on-air-monday/" target="_blank">Mediaite obtained a statement from CNN</a>, and the news-content provider says the problem isn't Lemon.

<p>In case you missed Don Le'mon's comments, here they are. He took issue with Nikki Haley saying politicians over the age of 75 should be given a cognitive test. For the sake of context, Sour Lemon has since apologized to all who were offended. Though not to Nikki Haley.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Don Lemon: "Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime.

Lemon is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-florida-law-banning" target="_blank">terrible at his job</a> and has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-super-bowl-elon" target="_blank">been extra snippy</a> ever since being demoted to a morning show. If he does get yeeted, CNN will replace him with someone else who sucks.</p><p>But claiming he's been given the day off because he's getting attacked and is unwell about it?

## Watch: Biden's favorite GOPer attacks DeSantis' school reforms, but then his education record is called into question

Larry Hogan is rumored to be running for the GOP presidential nomination. It was a rumor first started by people hoping to make money off of him running for president. The plan is to ride the Jeb Bush Memorial Highway all the way to the Iowa Caucuses as the Republican cable news can count on to attack conservatives. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/larry-hogan-wapo" target="_blank">He's also Joe Biden's favorite Republican</a>.</p><p>Hogan was on <em>Meet the Press</em> this weekend, where he was quick to attack Ron DeSantis (another potential GOP candidate) over Florida's common sense school reforms, calling them "authoritarian." <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/larry-hogan-ron-desantis" target="_blank">Unclear is if Hogan had a chance to read those reforms before commenting</a>. As commentator Erick Erickson points out, Hogan's position doesn't make sense. He claims to support setting standards for education...as long as it's not conservatives setting those standards. Did we mention Joe Biden loves the guy?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Larry Hogan is essentially saying that setting standards for education, which he supports, is fine so long as conservatives are not the ones setting those standards. Then it becomes a problem. This is not a good position to take. <a href="https://t.co/XJfl41RSHh">https://t.co/XJfl41RSHh</a><br />— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) <a href="https://twitter.com/EWErickson/status/1627362379439669249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>If Hogan wants to compare education records between him and DeSantis, it makes for an important debate. Author Karol Markowicz points out that during the pandemic, DeSantis acted to stop the  terrible things done to our kids and Larry Hogan did not.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">If you let kids get hurt because it doesn't fit with your ideology to help them, I don't know what to tell you.<br />— Karol Markowicz (@karol) <a href="https://twitter.com/karol/status/1627346954698072066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Another author Bethany Mandel, a Maryland resident at the time, points out how Hogan had the WORST record on schools during the pandemic.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Maryland was closed the longest in the entire country. Larry hogan only spoke up for kids once: private school kids in the richest county. His office ignored me and everyone else begging him to step in on any number of issues related to bad local governance.<br />— Bethany S. Mandel (@bethanyshondark) <a href="https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1627669420729327617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'd argue that education <em>is</em> the most important issue heading into the 2024 primaries, as it's been a major force driving a diverse group of parents to the polls to vote against the left in 2021 and 2022. Hogan's position of "we shouldn't push sex on children but we also shouldn't do anything about it or be mean about it" will be an interesting position to defend.</p><p><p>

## Woman quotes anti-sexual violence organization while playing clips of popular TikTok star and my skin is still crawling

It's going viral, with over a million plays between just the source material and a single tweet that shared it.</p><p>The woman plays Marsh clips while quoting the organization RAINN. RAINN provides <a href="https://www.rainn.org/news/grooming-know-warning-signs" target="_blank">a list of warning signs of a tool common to those who target children</a>. Rhymes with shrooming.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This woman has put together a video using RAINN as a source to highlight how dangerous this kind of behaviour from a grown man is.<br /><br />Literally made my skin crawl to see it collated.<br /><br />Brilliant to see one more woman making the issue so clear: <a href="https://t.co/TpDTMF1ha7">pic.twitter.com/TpDTMF1ha7</a><br />— Lorelei 🌕🧙🏻♀️🕸🍄 (@hatpinwoman) <a href="https://twitter.com/hatpinwoman/status/1627307254650134528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here are the warning signs that this TikToker believes a prevalent in Jeffrey Marsh videos:</p><ul><li>Victim selection</li><li>Gaining access and isolating the victim</li><li>Trust development and keeping secrets</li><li>Desensitization to touch and discussion of sexual topics</li><li>Attempt by abusers to make their behavior seem natural</li></ul><p>Earlier this month, Marsh went viral for a clip where he told his young audience that "their parents screwed up" and that they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/young-fan-patreon" target="_blank">should join his private Patreon for</a>, quote, "connected time." Unclear is if that viral video is what inspired this woman to create hers. The MArsh clip in question is one of the featured clips in the woman's montage.</p><p>Also unclear is if RAINN will be forced to change these definitions by activists opposing this viral video. Activists <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wikipedia-elon-musk" target="_blank">have succeeded in changing</a> the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cdc-definition-emails" target="_blank">definitions of commonly used terms</a> in recent years.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Chunky hero puts vapid influencer in her place when asked "do you think I'm hot?"

Watch him as he devours a vapid influencer's (pronounced in-flu-ence-rrrrrrrrr) ego like it's an entire pizza. Not a regular Neapolitan pizza either. One of those gourmet pizzas that has baked ziti and bacon on it.</p><p>Let's call our dude Tiny and our antagonist Becky With An I. Becky With An I walks around filming people to see if they think she is hot or nah. I can't tell if she's the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/marriage-influencer-cop-desperate" target="_blank">same broad from this video who got shut down by a cop</a> or is just biting off her content. But she thought she had her mark in Tiny: morbidly obese, alone, and potentially desperate. For clarity's sake, Tiny is not the one who needs a push-up bra.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Well played sir 🤣 <a href="https://t.co/oAydxAB3uA">pic.twitter.com/oAydxAB3uA</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1627405320330035200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Tiny utterly DESCERCATES Becky with an I.</p><blockquote>What's not hot about me?<br />Your personality and your voice.<br /></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="93986" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33059780&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Also, only one of the two had a weight problem. And it wasn't Tiny.</p><blockquote>You're a little too small. Maybe eat a burger and not be anorexic.</blockquote><p>Becky With An I told Tiny he was being "aggressive" as she tried to pretend it didn't bother her. Also, as she attempted a product shot of whatever energy drink was suddenly regretting their endorsement deal. She was also wrong. "Aggressive" was Tiny's final bars.</p><blockquote>I don't know who you're trying to impress. No one is gonna simp over you.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="5dd34" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33059830&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>There are few pieces of content on this godforsaken internet that is purer than <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/influencer-old-man-park-bench" target="_blank">influencers (pronounced "in-flu-ence-rrrrrrr") getting put in their place</a>. Tiny may not be the hero we deserve. But he is the hero we all need to start the week. Leaving Becky With An I to go make gym videos where she claims dudes are creeping on her.</p><p><p>
