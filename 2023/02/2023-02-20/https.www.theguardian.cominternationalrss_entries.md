## ‘It’s an insane amount of money’: fans feel shortchanged by K-pop ticketing as idols finally hit the UK

<p>British K-pop fans are bracing for a bumper year of gigs – but worry that short-notice ticket releases and high prices play into the hands of scalpers</p><p>Last year, the biggest acts in K-pop largely bypassed Europe on tour, to prioritise the more lucrative US market, which saw BTS hold four shows in Las Vegas. For newer groups held back by the pandemic, local Asian markets were the obvious springboard. But in the coming months, some of the biggest names in the genre will finally visit the UK, to the delight of their devoted British fans. This week the boyband Ateez will headline the O2 Arena, while fellow boyband NCT Dream has just announced a long-awaited London show, and reigning girlband <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/03/blackpink-o2-arena-london-review-born-pink-k-pop-juggernaut-with-world-beating-attitude">Blackpink</a> will headline their own one-day festival as part of the BST Hyde Park concert series.</p><p>But British K-pop stans fear they could miss out on seeing their idols due to the self-contained industry swerving towards short notice on ticket releases. The announcement of tour dates and ticket drops are commonly days apart, leaving some fans without enough time to save money for tickets, travel and hotels: K-pop-rock group the Rose announced their London tour date one day ahead of the pre-sale, and four days ahead of the general sale. “It’s just not enough of a chance to get organised,” says fan Gabii Rayner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/20/its-an-insane-amount-of-money-fans-feel-shortchanged-by-k-pop-ticketing-as-idols-finally-hit-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not everyone enjoys Marco Baroni’s defensive style, but he doesn’t care – and with good reason</p><p>On paper, it looked like a game Atalanta should win. They had been rounding into form since the start of 2023, piling up goals and muscling their way back into the fight for Champions League places. Last weekend, a 2-0 win at Lazio leapfrogged them into fourth, so Sunday’s fixture at home to 13th-placed Lecce should have been straightforward by comparison.</p><p>Football matches, however, are not played on paper. Nor, as the Lecce manager, Marco Baroni, reminded us recently, are they played on a video game console. “There are some PlayStation maestros out there who think our system of play doesn’t work,” he said after a 2-0 win at last-placed Cremonese this month. “They’re wrong.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/20/youth-muscle-and-attitude-lecce-win-at-atalanta-validates-baroni-methods">Continue reading...</a>

Zelenskiy referred to several towns in Donbas, saying “the more losses Russia suffers there … in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Marinka, Kreminna – the faster we will be able to end this war with Ukraine’s victory”.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian troops are preparing to defend one of the possible targets of a new Russian offensive in the eastern Donetsk region as Russia threatens to capture Bakhmut.</strong> Ukrainian soldiers near the small town of Siversk described being outgunned. “If they occupied Bakhmut, then we would be semi-encircled, because on the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets river, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” said the deputy Siversk battalion commander.</p><p><strong>Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning</strong>, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of <strong>Burgunka</strong> with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home.</p><p><strong>The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/ukraine-war-over-unless-eu-boosts-military-support-says-top-diplomat">war could be over</a> if the EU cannot increase its supply of ammunition</strong> to Ukraine. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly.” Borrell backed a call for the bloc’s members to buy arms jointly to help Ukraine but warned it would not solve Kyiv’s urgent need for more ammunition now.</p><p><strong>The US and Ukraine are “still having discussions” amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/us-f-16s-ukraine-un-ambassador">pressure to supply F-16 jets</a>.</strong> The US ambassador to the United Nations indicated on Sunday that the White House could reverse its refusal to supply F-16 jets to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have urged US Congress members to press Biden’s administration to send the jetfighters to Kyiv, saying the aircraft would boost Ukraine’s ability to hit Russian missile units with US-made rockets, lawmakers said.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone on Sunday and discussed strategies</strong>, including what the Ukrainian leader described as joint decisions ahead of this week’s anniversary of Russia’s invasion of his country. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said he thanked the French president “for understanding our needs and for expressing jointly that we cannot waste any opportunity or a single week in our defence against Russian aggression … We also discussed important decisions that we are planning for this week – for our year of resistance.”</p><p><strong>France</strong> <strong>has said it would deliver the AMX-10 light armoured vehicles</strong> it has promised to Ukraine “by the end of next week”.
