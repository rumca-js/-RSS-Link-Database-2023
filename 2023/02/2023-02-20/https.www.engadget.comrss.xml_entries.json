[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Rode claims its new podcast-friendly NT1 offers 'unclippable' audio", "description": "<p>When a microphone has been around for 30 years, it must be doing something right. The <a href=\"https://rode.com/en/microphones/studio-condenser/nt1\">Rode NT1</a> is arguably the company's flagship studio mic and origin story for the brand's name. The mic was originally called the Rodent1, shortened to Rode NT1 and the rest is history. Today, the company is unveiling the<a href=\"https://rode.com/nt1-5th-generation\"> fifth iteration</a> and it comes with two key updates that should <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html\">interest podcasters</a> and vocalists alike. Those would be 32-bit float recording and the addition of USB connectivity.</p><p>The inclusion of USB might feel like something that should have been there all along, but typically \"pro\" studio microphones are XLR only, with USB being the reserve of desktop microphones. Times are changing though and more folks are seeking a classic microphone but without the need to use an audio interface. Now, with the NT1 you have both. The USB connection is tucked away right at the base of the existing XLR port. It's a clever solution, but you will need a USB cable with fairly slim connections else it won't fit.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>With the new USB connectivity comes the option for tailoring the sound of the mic. Usually that part is offloaded to an interface or mixer, but now there's an onboard DSP that allows you do apply things like a noise gate or compressor to the mic directly (via Rode's Central or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rode-connect-podcasting-app-000034018.html\">Connect</a> apps). Not to mention this makes the microphone much more portable as you won't need to bring a separate, often clunky interface along with you.</p><figure><img alt=\"A man shouts into a microphone in a studio booth.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/1fb602a0-aebc-11ed-9d6d-5e80d563fb2c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Rode</div></figure><p>Easily the biggest benefit of the MK5 (and that built-in DSP) is the introduction of 32-bit float recording. In a nutshell, 32-bit allows for an exponentially larger dynamic range than 16- and 24-bit (which is what most systems use). This means you can forget about clipping (when audio is too loud and distorts) as there's enough headroom for almost any sound that would be possible. Or, put another way, you can effectively forget about setting levels safe in the knowledge you can adjust them in post without any audio loss.</p><p>What this means for podcasters and vocalists is less time worrying about levels at the point of recording, knowing you can set things as you want in post. Of course, good levels at the point of recording is always adviseable if possible, but it at least means any sudden sounds won't ruin your take. It's also currently very rare to find 32-bit float on a microphone like this - typically you'd have to buy a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tascam-portacapture-x8-annoucement-170543095.html\">pro-level audio recorder</a> if you wanted this feature.</p><p>At $259 the NT1 sits in an interesting spot. Shure's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/shure-mv7-microphone-podcast-streaming-130002893.html\">MV7</a> also offers XLR and USB connectivity and retails for $250 without 32-bit float (it's also a dynamic mic which will be either a benefit or a disadvantage depending on your needs). Sennheiser's fantastic MK 4 condensor typically runs for around $300 and doesn't offer USB connectivity. Similarly, if you're using something like a Blue Yeti and looking for an upgrade, the NT1 makes a compelling option.</p><p>The NT1 goes<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cb5d0194-594c-4e7a-a102-c90ee3046e5f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon+Australia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYjVkMDE5NC01OTRjLTRlN2EtYTEwMi1jOTBlZTMwNDZlNWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS5hdS9kcC9CMEJRSEhaMVFRIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZmM5Yzc2ZC05NWI2LTRkMTYtODJjNS0yMjRhZjNiY2U2MWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVdnjwByFdVRHQhLPmvtpKka1VFIGqeJU_uR-mSsj9NR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com.au%2Fdp%2FB0BQHHZ1QQ\"> up for pre-order</a> today.&nbsp;</p><p></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/rode-claims-its-new-podcast-friendly-nt1-offers-unclippable-audio-230009586.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-20 23:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google Chrome's memory and battery saver modes are rolling out to everyone", "description": "<p>Over the 14 years since it debuted, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20chrome/\"><ins>Google Chrome</ins></a> has increasingly become a resource hog, vacuuming up more and more of your system's memory and battery life with seemingly reckless abandon.

It's believed that the Era 100 won't have upward-firing drivers, though it should build on the Sonos One's performance by including a second tweeter (to help deliver stereo audio) and larger mid-woofer for stronger bass.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Sonos Era 300 smart speaker\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/4d8e0ea0-b157-11ed-befc-49451bb5b7ba\" style=\"height: 500; width: 750;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sonos</div></figure><p>The drum-style Era 300, meanwhile, appears to have similarly indented controls and seems to be designed with spatial audio in mind.

It's also understood that you'll need to buy a so-called combo adapter if you want to plug in an Ethernet cable as neither speaker has a built-in port.

The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-creator-fund-183231670.html\"><ins>TikTok Creator Fund</ins></a> was unveiled in 2020 with an initial commitment of $200 million.

TikTok hasn't confirmed how much it plans to pay out through the Creativity Program, but confirmed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/20/tiktok-revamped-creator-fund-creativity-program-beta/\"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a> it will \"provide a higher average gross revenue for qualified video views\" under a revised formula.</p><p>TikTok is starting to roll out the Creativity Program in the US after testing it in France and Brazil over the last few months.

It also has ten more grind settings than the previous model and employs conical burrs to achieve consistent results. Like the Ode, the Opus has a magnetically-aligned catch cup outfitted with a spouted ring that helps keep your counter clean, doing so with the assistance of Fellow\u2019s anti-static technology. Also like its predecessor, the Opus doesn\u2019t have a massive hopper to store beans on top: it\u2019s meant to be a single-dose machine where you can grind up to 110 grams at a time. This saves space since the Opus is considerably shorter than a lot of the competition. Plus, that design choice gives the device a much more refined appearance than the typical coffee grinder.</p><figure><img alt=\"Fellow's Opus is a versatile grinder that can do everything from espresso to cold brew, and it's as much of a showpiece as a piece of brewing equipment.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/76f5efe0-b12c-11ed-b9bb-4a74258590d3\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I have been using the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CYXJhdHphLUVuY29yZS1Db25pY2FsLUNvZmZlZS1HcmluZGVyL2RwL0IwMDdGMTgzTEs_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbGgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFkZjRjZTQ4LTAwYzMtNDQ1Ni05YTdjLWEzZTU4MDY3YmYzMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbcbEqNUy-2GZwiN5UoTwRWSUTckQX8OpEBhd_Xn6I5B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBaratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder%2Fdp%2FB007F183LK\"><ins>Baratza Encore</ins></a> since I compiled <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-the-best-gifts-for-coffee-geeks.html\"><ins>the first coffee buyer\u2019s guide</ins></a> for Engadget in 2019. If you take a poll among professional baristas, I\u2019d wager the majority of them would tell you that\u2019s the gold standard for at-home coffee grinders. And it\u2019s for good reason: the Encore is very versatile and has been producing consistent quality for years. It does have the big hopper up top, whether you want to store your beans there or not. It\u2019s loud, and because it pushes ground coffee into the catch from the side, there\u2019s a lot of mess that ends up on your counter.</p><p>The Opus quickly solved two of the issues I have with the Encore. First, it\u2019s remarkably quiet. I can actually run the Opus at night or early in the morning while my two-year-old is still asleep in a room near the kitchen free from worry I\u2019ll wake him. That\u2019s not always the case with the Encore. Second, the Opus drops grounds straight down into the catch cup, leaving less room for debris to escape. Fellow\u2019s new grinder doesn\u2019t have a knocker to reduce grind retention like the Ode, but it doesn\u2019t need one. When I put in 70 grams of whole beans, I get 70 grams of ground coffee every time. It\u2019s been so consistent I no longer feel the need to reweigh grounds to make sure I have enough \u2013 an added step I undertook with the Encore. And when you\u2019re grinding for espresso, Fellow has included an insert for the catch cup to make transferring small loads to a portafilter a much less messy affair.</p><p>Fellow has also made the Opus very easy to use. A rotating ring near the top spins to adjust to your desired coarseness. If you\u2019re like me and forget which setting to use for French press or pour-over, Fellow has printed a guide inside the lid of the bean chamber. No more reaching for a notebook or your phone to Google, the details you need will be right there when you go to load whole beans.</p><figure><img alt=\"Fellow's Opus is a versatile grinder that can do everything from espresso to cold brew, and it's as much of a showpiece as a piece of brewing equipment.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/76ef6030-b12c-11ed-bfb7-ff2ed0696be7\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Ease of use extends to the controls. There\u2019s only a single button you press to operate the Opus: one press for 30 seconds, two for a minute and three for 90 seconds. You can also long press the button for the grinder to run a full two minutes. Unlike the Ode, the Opus doesn\u2019t turn off when it senses all the beans are ground. Instead, it runs until the selected time runs out or you mosey back to and press the button one final time. The lack of auto-shutoff doesn\u2019t bother me though, since the Encore runs until you turn it off with no set time options.</p><p>The Opus improves three things for my daily coffee routine. It runs quietly and it keeps my kitchen cleaner while producing consistently ground beans no matter which setting I put it on. It also looks a lot better than the two coffee grinders I\u2019ve used for any length of time, mostly due to the fact that the lack of a large hopper makes it as much of a showpiece as a piece of brewing equipment. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9e95760a-c57f-4a36-9e7d-674face57081&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Fellow&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZTk1NzYwYS1jNTdmLTRhMzYtOWU3ZC02NzRmYWNlNTcwODEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9mZWxsb3dwcm9kdWN0cy5jb20vcGFnZXMvb3B1cy1pcy1jb21pbmciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFkZjRjZTQ4LTAwYzMtNDQ1Ni05YTdjLWEzZTU4MDY3YmYzMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZ0WeqSMvV-cGHLO0umSTZwc9GdvdqX9GDcWUvFOnBEx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffellowproducts.com%2Fpages%2Fopus-is-coming\"><ins>At $195</ins></a>, it\u2019s significantly cheaper than the Ode but slightly more than the Encore.

Broadly, those on the right favor repealing Section 230 because they claim it enables <a href=\"https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-big-tech-believes-there-is-no-power-that-can-constrain-them?uuid=zO4fjHJKeiBKXKPQ3617\">censorship</a>, while some on the left have said it allows tech giants to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMC8wMS8xNy9vcGluaW9uL2pvZS1iaWRlbi1ueXRpbWVzLWludGVydmlldy5odG1sP3V1aWQ9OURMVHo3UmhaVjhtU2h5aDQ2MTciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ0YTRmOTQzLTQ1OWUtNGExYy04MzA4LWY1ODkxYzBjYmViYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASLfvYev3cXc5Rqy-v25WqBiWtsGRFRDViKJIO_l2Z9Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2020%2F01%2F17%2Fopinion%2Fjoe-biden-nytimes-interview.html%3Fuuid%3D9DLTz7RhZV8mShyh4617\">avoid responsibility</a> for the societal harms caused by their platforms. But even among those seeking to amend or dismantle Section 230, there\u2019s been little agreement about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/congress-quizzes-facebook-whistleblower-on-section-230-reforms-203605272.html?uuid=jux0tYgMd8NmQYLi2617\">specific reforms</a>.</p><p>Section 230 also lies at the heart of <em>Gonzalez v. Google</em>, which the Supreme Court will hear on February 21st. The <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/gonzalez-v-google/\">case</a>, brought by family members of a victim of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack, argues that Google violated US anti-terrorism laws when ISIS videos appeared in YouTube\u2019s recommendations. Section 230 protections, according to the suit, should not apply because YouTube\u2019s <em>algorithms</em> suggested the videos.</p><p>\u201cIt basically boils down to saying platforms are not liable for content posted by ISIS, but they are liable for recommendation algorithms that promoted that content,\u201d said Daphne Keller, who directs the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center, during a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/gonzalez-v-google-and-the-fate-of-section-230/\">recent panel</a> discussing the case.</p><p>That may seem like a relatively narrow distinction, but algorithms underpin almost every aspect of the modern internet. So the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling could have an enormous impact not just on Google, but on nearly every company operating online. If the court sides against Google, then \u201cit could mean that online platforms would have to change the way they operate to avoid being held liable for the content that is promoted on their sites,\u201d the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/gonzalez-v-google/\">explains</a>. Some have speculated that platforms could be forced to do away with any kind of ranking at all, or would have to engage in content moderation so aggressive it would eliminate all but the most banal, least controversial content.</p><p>\u201cI think it is correct that this opinion will be the most important Supreme Court opinion about the internet, possibly ever,\u201d University of Minnesota law professor Alan Rozenshtein said during the same panel, hosted by the Brookings Institution.</p><p>That\u2019s why dozens of other platforms, civil society groups and even the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252645/20230119135536095_21-1333%20bsac%20Wyden%20Cox.pdf\">original authors </a>of Section 230 have weighed in, via \u201cfriend of the court\u201d briefs, in support of Google. In its <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252674/20230119145120402_Gonzalez%20-%20Reddit%20bottomside%20amicus%20brief.pdf\">brief</a>, Reddit argued that eroding 230 protections for recommendation algorithms could threaten the existence of any platform that, like Reddit, relies on user-generated content.</p><p>\u201cSection 230 protects Reddit, as well as Reddit\u2019s volunteer moderators and users, when they promote and recommend, or remove, digital content created by others,\u201d Reddit states in its filing. \u201cWithout robust Section 230 protection, Internet users \u2014 not just companies \u2014 would face many more lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to be aggrieved by everyday content moderation decisions.\u201d</p><p>Yelp, which has spent much of the last several years advocating for antitrust action <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-23-yelp-antitrust-google-complaint.html\">against Google</a>, shared similar concerns. \u201cIf Yelp could not analyze and recommend reviews without facing liability, those costs of submitting fraudulent reviews would disappear,\u201d the company <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252630/20230119125532147_Yelp%20Amicus--Gonzalez%20v.%20Google.pdf\">argues</a>. \u201cIf Yelp had to display every submitted review, without the editorial freedom Section 230 provides to algorithmically recommend some over others for consumers, business owners could submit hundreds of positive reviews for their own business with little effort or risk of a penalty.\u201d</p><p>Meta, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252712/20230119155949995_2023.01.19%20Final%20Google%20v.%20Gonzalez%20-%20Meta%20amicus.pdf\">argues</a> that a ruling finding 230 doesn\u2019t apply to recommendation algorithms would lead to platforms suppressing more \u201cunpopular\u201d speech. Interestingly, this argument would seem to play into the right\u2019s anxieties about censorship. \u201cIf online services risk substantial liability for disseminating third-party content \u2026 but not for removing third-party content, they will inevitably err on the side of removing content that comes anywhere close to the potential liability line,\u201d the company writes. \u201cThose incentives will take a particularly heavy toll on content that challenges the consensus or expresses an unpopular viewpoint.\u201d</p><h2>Twitter v. Taamneh</h2><p>The day after the Supreme Court hears arguments in <em>Gonzalez v. Google,</em> it will hear yet another case with potentially huge consequences for the way online speech is moderated: <em>Twitter v. Taamneh</em>. And while the case doesn\u2019t directly deal with Section 230, the case is similar to <em>Gonzalez v. Google </em>in a few important ways.</p><p>Like <em>Gonzalez</em>, the case was brought by the family of a victim of a terrorist attack. And, like <em>Gonzalez,</em> family members of the victim are using US anti-terrorism laws to hold Twitter, Google and Facebook accountable, arguing that the platforms aided terrorist organizations by failing to remove ISIS content from their services. As with the earlier case, the worry from tech platforms and advocacy groups is that a ruling against Twitter would have profound consequences for social media platforms and publishers.</p><p>\u201cThere are implications on content moderation and whether companies could be liable for violence, criminal, or defamatory activity promoted on their websites,\u201d the Bipartisan Policy Center says of the case. If the Supreme Court were to agree that the platforms were liable, then \u201cgreater content moderation policies and restrictions on content publishing would need to be implemented, or this will incentivize platforms to apply no content moderation to avoid awareness.\u201d</p><p>And, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/twitter-v-taamneh-eff-amicus-brief\">noted</a> in its filing in support of Twitter, platforms \u201cwill be compelled to take extreme and speech-chilling steps to insulate  themselves from potential liability.\u201d</p><p>There could even be potential ramifications for companies whose services are primarily operated <em>offline</em>.<em>&nbsp;</em>\u201cIf a company can be held liable for a terrorist organization\u2019s actions simply because it allowed that organization\u2019s members to use its products on the same terms as any other consumer, then the implications could be astonishing,\u201d Vox <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=111c4362-0f7f-48fd-83a0-5cf398008667&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxMTFjNDM2Mi0wZjdmLTQ4ZmQtODNhMC01Y2YzOTgwMDg2NjciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9wb2xpY3ktYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjMvMi8xNi8yMzU4Mjg0OC9zdXByZW1lLWNvdXJ0LWludGVybmV0LXNlY3Rpb24tMjMwLXRlcnJvcmlzbS1jYXNlcy1nb256YWxlei1nb29nbGUtdHdpdHRlci10YWFtbmVoIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NGE0Zjk0My00NTllLTRhMWMtODMwOC1mNTg5MWMwY2JlYmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdu4daoJ89vpwFWaNIyv9SXZ3FsCY11DpAkOSKMoCLxb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fpolicy-and-politics%2F2023%2F2%2F16%2F23582848%2Fsupreme-court-internet-section-230-terrorism-cases-gonzalez-google-twitter-taamneh\">writes</a>.</p><h2>What\u2019s next</h2><p>It\u2019s going to be several more months before we know the outcome of either of these cases, though analysts will be closely watching the proceedings to get a hint of where the justices may be leaning. It\u2019s also worth noting that these aren\u2019t the only pivotal cases concerning social media and online speech.</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/supreme-court-punts-on-texas-and-florida-social-media-law-cases.html\">two other</a> cases, related to restrictive social media laws out of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/florida-supreme-court-petition-social-media-regulation-195239421.html\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/scotus-texas-moderation-law-platforms-hb20-231226107.html\">Texas</a>, that might end up at the Supreme Court as well. Both of those could also have significant consequences for online content moderation.</p><p>In the meantime, many advocates argue that Section 230 reform is best left to Congress, not the courts.

If you want to change, you\u2019ll have to go through the verification process again.</p><p>The blue tick on Twitter does come with the cringe-inducing text of: \u201cThis account is verified because it\u2019s subscribed to Twitter Blue.\u201d (And you know I click to check.) Will Meta take a similar approach? And can we stop our egos from chasing that Instagram blue tick?

By exploiting the flaw, American player Kellin Pelrine defeated the KataGo system decisively, winning 14 of 15 games without further computer help. It's a rare Go win for humans since AlphaGo's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-14-the-final-lee-sedol-vs-alphago-match-is-about-to-start.html\">milestone 2016 victory</a> that helped pave the way for the current AI craze. It also shows that even the most advanced AI systems can have glaring blind spots.&nbsp;</p><p>Pelrine's victory was made possible by a research firm called FAR AI, which <a href=\"https://goattack.far.ai/pdfs/go_attack_paper.pdf\">developed a program</a> to probe KataGo for weaknesses. After playing over a million games, it was able to find a weakness that could be exploited by a decent amateur player. It's &quot;not completely trivial but it's not super-difficult&quot; to learn, said Pelrine. He used the same method was to beat Leela Zero, another top Go AI.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Here's how it works: the goal is to create a large &quot;loop&quot; of stones to encircle an opponent's group, then distract the computer by making moves in other areas of the board. Even when its group was nearly surrounded, the computer failed to notice the strategy. &quot;As a human, it would be quite easy to spot,&quot; Pelrine said, since the encircling stones stand out clearly on the board.</p><p>The flaw demonstrates that AI systems can't really &quot;think&quot; beyond their training, so they often do things that look incredibly stupid to humans. We've seen similar things with chat bots like the one employed by Microsoft's Bing search engine.
