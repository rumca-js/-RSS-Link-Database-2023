He is also the author of \u201cAn Immigrant's Love Letter to the West,\u201d a Sunday Times Bestseller. He has written for several publications including Quillette, The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph, and Standpoint on issues relating to tech censorship, woke culture, comedy, and other topics, but currently publishes articles on his popular Substack. Kisin made headlines in 2018 when he refused to sign a \"safe space contract\" to perform comedy at a British college and again in 2023 when he participated in an Oxford Union debate on the motion of \"This House Believes Woke Culture Has Gone Too Far\".
