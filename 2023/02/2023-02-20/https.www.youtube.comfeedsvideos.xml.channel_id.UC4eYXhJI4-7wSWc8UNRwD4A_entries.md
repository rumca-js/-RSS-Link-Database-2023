This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

The powerful messages of her music, magnified by the strength of Tamela Mann's vocals, made for a tearful Tiny Desk concert. These were happy tears; eventually, Tamela herself, overcome with emotion, explained how singing her songs helps keep her faith intact. After closing with one of her signature songs, "Take Me to the King," she gave us some parting words of encouragement. "Let's just hold on to faith, hold on to hope, hold on to joy," she said, "because it still exists in our society."

The Fort Worth, Texas, native's calling was evident early in her childhood, wowing the congregation at Holy Tabernacle church by the time she was 12. Her career has since stretched far beyond music. After meeting Tyler Perry in 1999, she and her husband, actor David Mann, became integral to his explosion on the stage, television and film. Faith and family have remained at the helm throughout her decorated career, earning Stellar Awards and a Grammy. Her daughter, Porcia, coordinated their trip to Washington, D.C., while her daughter Tia sang background, and of course, David was in the audience entertaining the crowd before and after the show. It's impossible to tell the history of Black people in America without the gospel, and Tamela Mann represented at NPR headquarters.
