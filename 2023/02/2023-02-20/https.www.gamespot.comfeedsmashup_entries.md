<p>The 2018 film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-review-into-the-spider-verse-is-the-per/1100-6463503/">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a> shouldn't exist. It goes against everything we expect from superhero movies and the big studio system behind them. It's animated when the rest are live-action. It's about Miles Morales, instead of Peter Parker. It also has not one Spider-Man, but <em>seven </em>of them (two of which <em>are</em> Peter Parker, though he's a supporting character at best). It doesn't pull inspiration from a classic Spider-Man story, but rather one of the most complex and goofy ones, in which Spider-Man works with all of the other Spider-People from other Marvel Earths. It's a weird movie. It's a really, really good, weird movie, though. It uses its weirdness to tell a satisfying story about responsibility, family, and self-confidence that works as well as, or better than, every Spider-Man movie to come before it.</p><figure style="width: 1200px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4098342-spiderman-beyond-01.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4098342-spiderman-beyond-01.jpg" /></a></figure><p> </p><p dir="ltr">It not only is a great movie, but also a commercial success. It did quite well for Sony Pictures, despite being an animated picture not aimed squarely at kids. On a $90 million budget, Spider-Verse raked in $384 million. It also sits atop the other Spider-flicks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-into-the-spider-verses-review-roundup-h/1100-6463515/">among critics</a> with a 97% fresh rating, higher than any other Spider-Man movie. The closest are Spider-Man 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spider-man-no-way-home-review-nostalgic-in-a-good-way/1900-6417801/">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>, each of which sits at 93% fresh.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-latest-trailer-new-cast-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6511448/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Overrun by bloodthirsty vampires who cast the town into darkness by eclipsing the sun, Redfall has turned into a bloodbath. The vampires have pushed back the sea from the land and made getting off the island impossible. As the town descends into chaos, the people of Redfall (those who have survived) have no choice but to fight back against the vampire threat.

<p dir="ltr">The distance between Earth and the observable edge of the universe is 46 billion light-years. That's such a massive amount of space that it's impossible to comprehend. Some of the greatest minds on the planet are working tirelessly to make it possible for us to get to the nearest solar systemâ€“which is only 4.2 light-years away.</p><p dir="ltr">Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games, believe it or not, is right there alongside scientists studying interstellar travel. It has been building a sequel from the ground up in order to make traveling across the universe possible in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">"One thing we're noticing, especially with the more advanced technologies in the game is that we're sometimes the first people to depict something because we're trying to keep abreast of the latest research," said Kerbal Space Program 2 creative director Nate Simpson. "Sometimes a piece of research will come very hot off the presses and we'll have to figure out what it might look like and our depiction of this thing is going to be the only one for a while."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kerbal-space-program-2-is-heading-into-deep-space/1100-6511656/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Have you ever wanted to compete against your friends in a race to the moon? Maybe you'd rather work together to build a colony on Mars to help push civilization into the great beyond. Either way, Kerbal Space Program 2 may have what you're looking for sometime after launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Space agencies are one of the first new things you'll notice when you boot up the sequel to the rocketry-focused space-exploration game. They let you design a flag and choose a name for your version of SpaceX, NASA, or the European Space Agency. That agency will serve as the foundation of the game's multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Agencies are gonna be a significant component of the multiplayer experience," said Kerbal Space Program 2 creative director Nate Simpson. "So there will be multiple launch complexes and you will be able to, when you have multiple people playing, have multiple agencies. They can either be aligned with one another or potentially competing with one another in space races."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kerbal-space-program-2s-multiplayer-will-let-you-have-full-on-space-races/1100-6511655/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomic-heart/">Atomic Heart</a> doesn't hide its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock-infinite/">BioShock Infinite</a> inspirations. The game begins in a city in the clouds, features reality-bending and elemental powers you can employ in your fight against advanced robots, sees you scrounging for resources in an idyllic city that's falling apart, and stars an amnesiac protagonist grappling with the nuances of free will. By the time you reach the climax of the story and you're asked to visit a lighthouse, you know what's up. Where Atomic Heart most differs from its inspiration is in the lens through which it focuses its narrative, exploring concepts of free will via Soviet Russian collectivism instead of the U.S.' individualism. However, its intriguing premise is let down by a deeply unlikable protagonist and a predictable storyline that doesn't do anything interesting with its cool ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">In the alternate history of Atomic Heart, a scientist named Dmitry Sechenov kickstarts a robotics boom in Russia in the 1930s. By the 1950s, the working class has been abolished in the Soviet Union and completely replaced by robots controlled through a hive-mind network called Kollectiv 1.0. The game begins a few years after that, just prior to the public unveiling of Kollectiv 2.0, which will allow all humans to have equal access to the hive-mind to control robots remotely through a Thought device wired straight to their brain, as well as connect and share information with each other across great distances. Basically, it's the Internet plugged into your brain and available 24/7.</p><p dir="ltr">With the benefit of 21st-century hindsight, we know the Internet will not end up being a 100% good idea even if the main character Major Sergei Nechaev, an agent who serves Sechenov, fully believes in the dream of a world where everyone equally has access to each other and the wealth of information that will surely be shared. Assigned to investigate a disturbance in Facility 3826, the Soviet Union's foremost scientific research hub, Sergei is joined by Charles, a sentient glove that gifts the agent with a host of polymer-fed technopowers like telekinesis and cryokinesis, and provides a sounding board for Sergei's oftentimes annoying and borderline abusive collection of quips and unfunny comebacks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-crispy-critters/1900-6418033/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
