Airpods are expensive and will only last you a few years. Well, that's true of all wireless earbuds. So why do we keep buying them? Convenience probably. But when you are spending tons of money on something, you want it to last right? Well that's a big reason why WIRED headphones are making a comeback. We take a look at some entry-level planar magnetic earbuds, the 7hz x Crinacle Salnotes Dioko and compare them against the flagship Audeze Euclids. Just how good can $100 dollar headphones be?
