<p>Last week’s defeat at Everton felt like old days, but the manager backs his side to produce strong response against Brentford</p><p>Back in the old days, when Mikel Arteta was an Arsenal player and the team had suffered one of those Arsenal defeats, maybe away from home in the Champions League, it was him and only him who would front up to the press and say what needed to be said.</p><p>Actually, that is not true. It was Arteta or Per Mertesacker, sometimes both but never anyone else from the squad. Arteta would be collared as he headed for the team bus, its engine revving impatiently, in the bowels of the stadium in, say, Milan or Dortmund, and he would burn with frustration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/10/mikel-arteta-arsenal-tougher-brentford-preview">Continue reading...</a>

## Jonjo Shelvey: ‘Leaving Newcastle was hard, but I can’t say I regret it’

<p>After persuading Eddie Howe to let him depart, Shelvey is set to make his Forest debut at Fulham and hopes to lead by example</p><p>There were high-fives and hugs all round last month as Newcastle’s players celebrated securing a first Wembley final since 1999 when Callum Wilson smuggled Jonjo Shelvey, doing his best to keep a low profile having signed for Nottingham Forest that day, into the home dressing room for one last hurrah. Before kick-off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/newcastle-united-southampton-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">against Southampton</a>, Shelvey bid farewell to a sold-out St James’ Park and afterwards he addressed his former teammates and staff, some of whom he had shared the previous seven years with. “I’m not really an emotional person but the kids were a bit upset and the missus was crying when I walked out on to the pitch,” Shelvey says.</p><p>Wilson ensured Shelvey was part of the celebratory post-match squad photo, a tradition that has followed Eddie Howe to Tyneside and the Newcastle manager praised Shelvey for standing up for the club in dark times. How does the club Shelvey joined from Swansea in 2016 compare with the one he left behind on deadline day? “Massively different,” he says. “Last season when the owners took over they really came in and made their mark. They brought the manager in and he was brilliant for me personally. I had a great run of games last season, we got a great winning feeling and he really enhanced that within the club. I can only wish them every success.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/10/jonjo-shelvey-leaving-newcastle-was-hard-but-i-cant-say-i-regret-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coach takes lessons from last year’s Paris defeat into the first Six Nations game to feature the world’s current top two</p><p>The streets around the stadium were quiet the day before the game, but if you listened carefully you could hear the crackle. It was there in the conversations at the coffee shops, and between the kids chattering at the bus stops, it was in the snatches of talk radio coming from the open windows of the cabs idling at the rank around the corner, and in the glimpses of the TV screens in the pubs along the Pembroke Road. “Dan Sheehan’s going to be a big miss for us.” “France are bound to be better this week.” “At least Conor Murray’s playing.” “If we play the way they did in the first half against Wales ….” It’s only going to get louder now. And by Saturday afternoon, it will be deafening.</p><p>Every Test match matters, but this one matters more than most. It’s the first time the two best teams in the world have played each other in the Six Nations. Ireland have been top of the rankings since they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/16/new-zealand-ireland-third-test-rugby-union-match-report">beat New Zealand in Wellington</a> last summer. It is a reward for a run of form in which they have beaten every team in the top 10 except the one right behind them in second place. France have won the past three games between the teams, by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/31/france-ireland-six-nations-final-match-report">eight in 2020</a>, two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/feb/14/charles-ollivon-and-penaud-edge-france-to-six-nations-win-in-ireland">in 2021</a>, and six in 2023. No doubt that Ireland feel they have something to prove, to themselves as much as to everyone else. Being first doesn’t much matter if second is better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/10/six-nations-ireland-france-andy-farrell-dublin-preview">Continue reading...</a>

Jamming in double mattresses, wardrobes, cabinetry, and concealed gas cookers into a few square metres, the design combined ingenuity with a willingness to sacrifice creature comforts.</p><p>For months, he and his partner travelled the country, visiting its small towns, waking up to surf and eat breakfast. “We noticed that New Zealand had a big van tourist scene,” he says. The country’s isolated coastlines and natural landscapes became suddenly accessible, and affordable. “The van really opens all of that up.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/11/bogged-the-toilet-laws-that-could-spell-end-of-the-road-for-new-zealands-van-lifers">Continue reading...</a>

In Syrian regime-controlled areas, no institution has the capabilities to handle this disaster, including civil society.

## Calm, confident Todd Murphy justifies quick climb into Australia Test side

<p>The spinner picks up five debut wickets in India’s first innings in Nagpur, including KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli</p><p>For a visiting slow bowler, India can be a trap. It is the spiritual home of spin, the still centre of the universe of revolutions, the place where you might find the most dramatic turner since Tina. It is the place tilted drastically to your advantage, like doing high jump on the moon. But if you’re not steeped in how to use the advantage, if you don’t hit the right lengths, if you don’t know how to bowl to players who know how to face you, then the place chews you up and spits you out, as ragged as the cricket ball after 80 overs on those rough pitches.</p><p>From his first encounter, Todd Murphy has emerged intact. Innings figures of five for 82 could become more flattering or less when India continue their first innings on the third day with three wickets in hand. But whatever the final analysis, the quiet off-spinner from country Victoria has shown that he is up to the task. KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli have 53 Test centuries between them and nearly 18,000 runs. Murphy put them all in his pocket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/10/todd-murphy-justifies-his-rapid-ascent-into-australia-test-side">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hyping AI’s utility is part of a commercial push to get users to cede authority to machines</p><p>In his 1991 book Consciousness Explained, the cognitive scientist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/17/peopleinscience.philosophy">Daniel Dennett</a> describes the juvenile sea squirt, which wanders through the sea looking for a “suitable rock or hunk of coral to … make its home for life”. On finding one, the sea squirt no longer needs its brain and <a href="https://goodheartextremescience.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/meet-the-creature-that-eats-its-own-brain/">eats it</a>. Humanity is unlikely to adopt such culinary habits but there is a worrying metaphorical parallel. The concern is that in the profit-driven <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/10/google-v-microsoft-who-will-win-the-ai-chatbot-race-bard-chatgpt">competition</a> to insert artificial intelligence into our daily lives, humans are dumbing themselves down by becoming overly reliant on “intelligent” machines – and eroding the practices on which their comprehension depends.</p><p>The human brain is evolving. Three thousand years ago, our ancestors had brains that were larger than our own. At least one explanation is that intelligence became increasingly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220503-why-human-brains-were-bigger-3000-years-ago">collective</a> 100 generations ago – and humans breached a population threshold that saw individuals sharing information. Prof Dennett wrote that the most remarkable expansion of human mental powers – the rise of civilisation through art and agriculture – was almost instantaneous from an evolutionary perspective.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-chatgpt-search-exploiting-wishful-thinking">Continue reading...</a>

Just think how many more of this elusive 50% would flock to it, the thinking goes, if it included works about, say, nature, politics and history.</p><p>In order for the new award to go ahead this year, £200,000 in sponsorship needs to be found before the end of May by the organisation currently known as the Women’s prize for fiction. Though it has never been averse to a name change, having previously been known as both the Orange and the Baileys prize, before settling for its current title in 2017, it is not dangling the enticement of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/30/baileys-drops-womens-prize-for-fiction-sponsorship">headline sponsorship</a> this time round. Instead it is inviting donors to join a “family of sponsors”, which includes Baileys and Amazon’s audiobooks subsidiary, Audible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-philanthropy-in-the-arts-a-bare-necessity-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Authors and publishers discuss the gender imbalance in nonfiction writing, and ask whether the newly announced award can redress it</p><p>‘Close your eyes and think of a historian, and most people see an elderly white man,” says classicist and author Mary Beard. This stereotypical view of what experts look like means that “there is a bit of a ‘big books by blokes about battles syndrome’” when it comes to acclaimed nonfiction writing. So, she adds, the newly announced Women’s prize for nonfiction will be “very useful”.</p><p>The Women’s prize for fiction was set up in 1996 after no female writers were shortlisted for the Booker prize in 1991. For almost 30 years, the prize has been “consistently excellent”, says Natalie Haynes, who writes both nonfiction, such as the bestselling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/08/pandoras-jar-by-natalie-haynes-review-rescuing-women-in-greek-myths">Pandora’s Jar: Women in the Greek Myths</a>, and fiction, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/23/a-thousand-ships-natalie-haynes-review">A Thousand Ships</a>, which was shortlisted for the Women’s prize in 2020. “In a way it seems bonkers that they didn’t [start a nonfiction prize] ages ago,” Haynes adds. When it comes to nonfiction prizes, only 35% of winners in the past 10 years were women, according to research commissioned for the Women’s prize looking at seven major UK nonfiction prizes. The new prize is “not about taking the spotlight away from the brilliant male writers, it’s about adding the women in”, Kate Mosse, the founding director of the Women’s prize, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/08/womens-prize-to-launch-annual-award-for-womens-non-fiction-writing">told the Guardian</a> when the news was announced.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/10/why-we-need-womens-prize-for-nonfiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yoghurt brings a silky mouthfeel to this loaf cake for a sweet-but-tangy afternoon treat  </p><p>Grapefruit isn’t for everyone, but I love it. Especially in these cold, dark, winter months, when it tastes so refreshing and welcome. Its tartness is mellowed by sweetness in this loaf cake, with its moist crumb. Adding yoghurt to cakes is a gamechanger, bringing a subtle tang and almost silky texture. Add a classic icing sugar glaze to finish, and you’ve got the perfect afternoon pick-me-up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/10/grapefruit-yoghurt-loaf-cake-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>About 2 million people die a year as a result of a core group of fungi, and the WHO is concerned we are unprepared for the future</p><p>The year is 2003, and a species of Cordyceps fungus has made the leap from ants to humans, transforming its hosts into frenzied, bloodthirsty zombies that spread the infection to everyone they bite. The solution proposed by a leading mycologist in Jakarta, Indonesia, where the first cases were detected, is radical, but in her view, essential: bomb the entire city and everyone in it, to stop the infection in its tracks.</p><p>Last month, HBO’s long-awaited post-apocalyptic series The Last of Us hit our screens, to huge acclaim from both critics and fans. It posits that it isn’t viruses or bacteria that pose the greatest threat to society, but fungi – those same organisms beloved by brewers, bakers and wild-food enthusiasts. More specifically, climate change has prompted <em>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</em>, commonly known as “zombie-ant fungus”, to adapt to surviving at higher temperatures, rendering humans an alternative host.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/10/a-growing-threat-to-human-health-we-are-ill-equipped-for-the-dangers-of-fungal-infections">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It doesn’t have to be fizz to impress your valentine – nor even alcoholic</p><p>Judging by the number of emails I’ve had from firms asking if I want to opt out of Valentine’s Day communications, it’s clear that this is a fraught day for many, and one heavily loaded with Fomo. I don’t get it myself, never having fallen for the kind of guy who does a dozen red roses and a candlelit dinner, and at the same time never having felt deprived as a result. There’s no one way to express your love, after all. Frankly, I’d prefer a cuppa brought to me in bed and the occasional £5 bunch of supermarket flowers over the occasional grand gesture.</p><p>If you are in a relationship with a romantic, however, it’s more a question of managing expectations, and Valentine’s Day is synonymous with fizz. Does that need to be champagne? No, but you might as well – though, as I suggest below, it could also be English wine. Should it be a household name? Maybe, especially if you’re trying to impress your partner, but if they don’t know that Lidl sells the more than adequate <a href="https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/sparkling-wine/comte-de-senneval-champagne-brut/p9911">Comte de Senneval for £14.99</a>, you should maybe try to get away with that.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/10/reds-and-whites-to-woo-romantic-wines-and-other-drinks-for-valentines-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If your coat doesn’t have much chat, let a statement scarf do the talking </p><p>There is only one clothes show in town at this time of year, and that is the coat. Walk down the street and all you see is coats. You could be rocking the chicest outfit and it would go unappreciated, because your coat is all anyone else is going to see. This is liberating in some ways – the sartorial pressure is definitely off – but it also gets kind of dull. Clothes are self-expression. They talk to the world for you, sending out vibes about who you are, what kind of day you’re having, what mood you’re in. And your coat probably doesn’t have much chat.</p><p>But a coat can be a “coat-fit”. We all remember <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/michelle-obama-isabel-toledo-sasha-malia">the Obamas at the first inauguration</a>. Michelle in a lemon coat with chartreuse leather gloves. Little Sasha, seven years old, in an orange scarf with a pink coat. It was a masterclass in using accessories and colour to jazz up your look without undoing a single button.

## John Grant review – uncanny beauty with jagged edges

<p><strong>St James’s Church, London<br /></strong>Performing a stripped-back show as part of the Piccadilly piano festival, the singer-songwriter gave a forceful performance of some his most wrenching material – but there was laughter in the dark</p><p>With its Corinthian columns, stained-glass crucifixion scene and aroma of incense, the Christopher Wren-designed St James’s church on London’s Piccadilly is an unusual gig venue. And even taking into account its progressive reputation, it is an interesting setting for a man whose strict Methodist family told him he was going to hell for being gay, and who sings lines as spicy as the one on the T-shirts he sells: “I hope you know that all I want from you is sex.”</p><p>Then again, John Grant’s songwriting feeds on radical contrasts. He anatomises the ugliest depressive episodes and the bitterest break-ups with exquisite melodies and a chocolatey baritone. He likes his beauty to have jagged edges.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/10/john-grant-review-st-james-london-piccadilly-piano-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She’s been picked apart by gossip columnists, stereotyped and had her alopecia become part of a global scandal. But now, as her new series hits our screens, the star is being zen about it all …</p><p>Jada Pinkett Smith plays many roles in a day. She’s an actor, a mum, a wife. Once the frontwoman of a metal band called Wicked Wisdom, she is also a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/06/jada-pinkett-smith-memoir-book-deal">soon-to-be memoirist</a> – as well as, to some, an almost pathological over-sharer on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk">Red Table Talk</a>, the Facebook Watch chatshow she co-hosts with her daughter Willow and her mother Adrienne “Gammy” Banfield-Norris.</p><p>But Pinkett Smith isn’t entirely comfortable with the reputation she has acquired: a honey-voiced, wise woman who never seems ruffled or fazed – a “level five auntie” as someone on social media put it. “Well, it’s interesting,” she says, speaking from her Los Angeles office. “I don’t really look at it that way. But I do think that, as we get older, that’s how it should be.” She laughs and soon I’m on the receiving end of one of her classic soothing declarations. It feels like a cross between a sermon and a guided meditation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/10/sometimes-it-is-racism-jada-pinkett-smith-on-prejudice-typecasting-and-the-fallout-from-that-slap">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plus the brilliant Happy Valley, 25 years since the death of my dad, my psychiatrist retires and a Fawlty idea</p><p>A new book, The Good Life, co-written by Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz and based on Harvard University’s 84 years and counting study of adult development has found there is a direct link between happiness and living longer. Those who nurture healthy relationships and have learned how to forgive themselves – regret is a dirty word – are less likely to die prematurely. In which case, it might just turn out that Liz Truss is going to live for ever. Most normal people – if a prime minister can ever be said to be a normal person – who had tanked the economy and increased everyone’s mortgage substantially in just under 50 days might have been tempted to lie low for a couple of decades at least. But not our Liz. In just three months, she has re-emerged with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/09/how-legitimate-are-the-claims-in-liz-trusss-4000-word-spectator-essay">4,000-word piece for the Sunday Telegraph</a> and an interview with Spectator TV. That is quite some speedy self-absolution. There again it turns out that Truss has forensically sifted the evidence and concluded she doesn’t have anything to feel sorry for. It was all the fault of the commies working in the Bank of England and the Tory party. Magnificent. Boris Johnson may look to be out of shape but he could also outlive us all as he too has no regrets and is planning a comeback. Asked by Nadine Dorries on TalkTV whether he might have tried to cover up his involvement in Partygate he was outraged. As if! It would be totally out of character for him to tell lies. I guess we could all do with a bit of what Liz and Boris are taking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/10/digested-week-whatever-theyre-taking-liz-and-boris-might-just-live-for-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Warren Gatland puts faith in vibrant prodigies while the hosts aim to win both opening games for the first time since 1996</p><p>“We just need to find that balance,” said Warren Gatland, by way of explanation after the voluntary jettisoning for this weekend’s Test against Scotland of three of his most trusted lieutenants for three of his most promising youngsters. In so doing, he replaces 360 caps’ worth of experience with 10, or a depletion of a shade under 117 caps per player. Less a balancing act, more a wild seesaw.</p><p>That said, the theory is compelling. For Alun Wyn Jones (168 caps), Taulupe Faletau (101) and Justin Tipuric (91) come Dafydd Jenkins (two), Christ Tshiunza (three) and Tommy Reffell (five). The incomers bring all the vibrancy and chutzpah one might expect of youth, not to mention the athleticism. All three ply their trade the other side of the bridge in England. Jenkins and Tshiunza are at Exeter, both the Chiefs and the university; Reffell is at Leicester, just the Tigers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/10/wales-trust-in-young-guns-as-scotland-search-for-six-nations-consistency">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This fictionalised biography of the Cornish poet covers his tender bond with his mother, and the effects of losing a friend during war</p><p>Mother’s Boy opens in 1941 as a navy coder named Charles receives news of a vessel that has sunk in the Denmark Strait, and realises his boyhood friend – “his best friend, arguably” – was on the ship. A fictionalised account of the life of the poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/nov/06/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries">Charles Causley</a>, Mother’s Boy then jumps back in time to the first meeting of his laundress mother, Laura, and his father, Charlie, a groom and gardener. After the couple are married, Charlie goes to war, leaving his wife to raise their baby son alone in Launceston, Cornwall. Laura is ferociously protective of young Charles, who is quiet, bespectacled and bookish. When Charlie returns from the war, he is laid low with tuberculosis and father and son strike up an uneasy rapport. But when Charlie dies it is almost a relief for Laura and Charles to find themselves alone once more.<br /><br />The book’s author, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-gale">Patrick Gale</a>, is the narrator, skilfully navigating his protagonists’ Cornish accents and providing a tender and intimate evocation of the maternal bond, and of a young man intent on keeping his true self hidden. In the author’s note, Gale reveals how he drew on Causley’s diaries and poems to build a portrait that is based on fact but used “fiction and conjecture to fill the gaps in stories that history and discretion left blank”. It’s with great poignance that the recording ends with Gale reading Causley’s poem Angel Hill, in which a sailor back from war visits an old flame hoping to rekindle their affair and is rejected: “I heard him sing as he strolled away / You’ll send in your fetch for me one fine day / No, never, said I.”</p><p>Available from Tinder Press, 11hr 27min</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/10/mothers-boy-by-patrick-gale-review-imagining-charles-causley-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bold, unpretentious and one of the poshest restaurants in the New Forest. But can you handle the wallpaper?</p><p><a href="https://www.stanwellhouse.com/dine-with-us/samphire-restaurant/">Samphire</a> is a cacophony of bold, floral wallpapers, <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Kia-Ora#:~:text=Kia%2DOra%20is%20a%20concentrated,sold%20in%20a%20concentrated%20state.">Kia-Ora</a>-orange chairs, sage banquettes, fuchsia scatter cushions and accent lamps. The interior designers of the newly renovated <a href="https://www.stanwellhouse.com/">Stanwell House </a>boutique hotel in Lymington, Hampshire, were very brave, and have come up with a sort of “eruption in a <a href="https://www.cathkidston.com/">Cath Kidston</a> outlet” vibe, which I rather loved, not least because I often bemoan restaurants that are decked out in risk-free shades of beige, tapioca and silt, as if the management were neither committing to a theme, nor confident of staying open for very long at all. There’s none of that meekness at Samphire, though. From the off, the place screams: “We are one of the poshest restaurants in the New Forest, but we’re not one of those aloof, Scandi, trial-by-dinner spots where you have to pretend that live ants and raw duck offal are delicious. No, we’re just doing fish and potatoes and the like. Aunty Bertha will be completely safe here.”</p><p>Stanwell House’s refurbishment has resulted in three different dining options. There’s also the Salt Bar and the Orangery, which don’t take themselves too seriously and were packed with guests on the Saturday I visited, all of them eating club sandwiches, brisket and bone-marrow burgers, meze-style sharing boards and plates of doughnuts with coffee espuma for dipping. Meanwhile, Samphire, the fancier offering, which serves red-deer carpaccio, Shetland scallops and Lymington picked crab, was deserted. Or at least it was until we arrived; later, another couple arrived on a date, every word of whose conversation I could hear from six tables away (Sir, you were “friend-zoned” weeks ago; it was as unmissable as Samphire’s bottle-green, mock-Vaudeville wall lamps – sorry).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/10/samphire-stanwell-house-lymington-hampshire-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

## Jenny Slate on making a film with her ex-husband: ‘I wouldn’t suggest it!’

<p>The standup stole scenes in Parks and Recreation and won plaudits for Obvious Child. Now she is stretching herself further with an Oscar-nominated passion project that even divorce couldn’t derail</p><p>It is 9am in Los Angeles and Jenny Slate is smiling – or is that grimacing? – over Zoom. When I ask how she is, the comedian and actor is brutally honest. “I’ve been up since about 4.30am with my two-year-old,” she explains. Slate adds that she and her husband went out at around 7am to get coffee, thinking a change in location might soothe their wailing daughter. It did, but by this point it was too late for Slate. “I was so tired when we got there that I just started to silently – not sob – but just leak tears out of tired eyes … But I think I’m all right! I didn’t, like, walk into the canyon or anything …”</p><p>Slate’s brand of openness doesn’t just extend to telling strangers about the trials of parenting a toddler; a radical kind of honesty has long permeated her stage and screen work. After graduating from Columbia University, the Milton, Massachusetts-born comic spent years honing her craft as a standup in “shitty dive bars” across New York. From the start, her comedy was intimate and revelatory. “I’ve always just shared really personal stories,” she says, “many of them about my body.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/10/jenny-slate-interview-marcel-shell-with-shoes-on">Continue reading...</a>

But, lately, I’ve found myself encountering them on a daily basis. Indeed, there’s usually a handful of them littered across this newsletter, every time we cover a new series from Disney+, Apple TV+, Paramount+ or Discovery+. Streaming companies have gone wild for the plus sign suffix – or what I’ll call, for brevity’s sake, the “pluffix”.</p><p>Granted I’m not the first person to notice this trend: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/business/media/streaming-platforms-plus-signs.html">the New York Times was bemoaning</a> the ubiquity of the pluffix (though they weren’t calling it that) back in 2021. But the trend refuses to die, and reached a new, higher pitch of absurdity last week when the US cable channel Showtime, which is owned by Paramount, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/showtime-renamed-paramount-plus-with-showtime-1235506843/">was given the cumbersome new name</a> of Paramount+ With Showtime. Equally baffling was the decision to rename Starzplay – a title that felt memorable in an endearingly naff way – as the dreary Lionsgate+, in the process replacing one streamer that most viewers will have barely heard of with … another streamer that most viewers will have barely heard of.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/feb/10/the-guide-netflix-disney-apple-hbo">Continue reading...</a>

So reducing how much coffee you use, even if that takes using a coffee pod, can decrease the emissions of your coffee habit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/10/single-use-coffee-pod-environment-impact-better">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lack of goals has contributed to run of one win in 10 games for Patrick Vieira’s side and off-field matters are not smooth either</p><p>It is nearly four years since Crystal Palace tasted defeat against their arch-enemies but, given how this season is panning out, Saturday’s meeting with Brighton could be filled with trepidation for their supporters.</p><p>While Patrick Vieira’s side find themselves in the familiar position of 12th – where they finished last season – just past the midway point, their rivals from down the A23 are in contention to qualify for Europe thanks in part to a scouting system that has become the envy of the country. Whereas the emergence of the Japan winger Kaoru Mitoma as the fulcrum of Roberto De Zerbi’s dashing side has provided Seagulls supporters with a new hero, Palace go into the game at Selhurst Park having won only once in their past 10 matches in all competitions and are expected to be without their own talisman, Wilfried Zaha, as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/10/crystal-palace-brighton-derby-misfiring-patrick-vieira">Continue reading...</a>

Imagine someone says to him: “Here, put this virtual reality headset on; it will help you.” The software in the headset transports the man to the edge of a cliff. Near Dover maybe.

<p>A pass from the hands of one player to another must go backwards to be legal. Right? Wrong</p><p>Rugby union is complex and tactical.

<p>Notorious for their onstage brawls and their imperious frontman, the San Francisco band have managed to survive 30 years of drink, drugs and drama. We catch up with them on tour</p><p>Over more than 30 years, <a href="https://thebrianjonestownmassacre.com/">the Brian Jonestown Massacre</a> have garnered a reputation like that of few other bands. The San Francisco group, led by Anton Newcombe, are known for their fecund creativity, violent volatility, chaos and magic – all of which are woven together to create music spanning psychedelia, shoegaze, country and garage rock. I have joined them for part of their UK tour. “Stop putting off a genius, you cocksucking dickhead!” yells Newcombe to a heckler during one of many guitar-tuning breaks in Brighton. “Go fuck yourself!” he spits to another.</p><p>Much of their reputation was cemented in the 2004 documentary <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dig">Dig!</a>, in which Newcombe delivered lines such as: “You fucking broke my sitar, motherfucker,” after an onstage brawl with his own band. The film is a maelstrom of drama, addiction, blown opportunities and a friendship turned rivalry with the Dandy Warhols.</p><p>Setting up for a show in Brighton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/10/brian-jonestown-massacre-anton-newcombe-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Matador)<br /></strong>A quintessential<strong> </strong>YLT album – but this time, even as Ira Kaplan is wringing his guitar for noise, drummer/vocalist Georgia Hubley is turning down the volume<strong><br /></strong></p><p>Welcome back to the quietest loud band – or the loudest quiet band – in the world. Their 17th studio album is so quintessentially Yo La Tengoish: Ira Kaplan’s squalling guitars and murmured vocals and Georgia Hubley’s still, introspective ballads are both here in glorious effect. This time the band recorded near-live – the basis of most of the nine songs is Kaplan, drummer/vocalist Hubley and bassist James McNew playing in the room together – and what is striking is the contrast between Kaplan and Hubley.</p><p>Even when Kaplan is wringing his guitar for noise – on the opening trio of Sinatra Drive Breakdown, Fallout and Tonight’s Episode – it sounds as though Hubley is playing with brushes, trying to be as unobtrusive as possible, not just in terms of her minimal use of fills, but volume. That is perhaps the biggest difference between YLT in 2023 and 1993; back then, she was hammering her kit, as if to compete.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/10/yo-la-tengo-this-stupid-world-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Elixir by Kapka Kassabov review – Bulgaria’s vale of enchantment

<p>This spellbinding journey through the villages, valleys and thriving ecosystems of the author’s native Bulgaria reads as a lucid dream</p><p>The mark of a good book is that it changes you. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. Nan Shepherd, Robin Wall Kimmerer and Jay Griffiths have all wielded that power over me, but I’ve rarely been so aware of an internal change being wrought, word by word, as I have these past days immersed in Kapka Kassabova’s alchemical prose. I fancy she had me under her spell from page one, with reference to the “smiling gallop” of rivers flowing downhill.</p><p>Geographically, the valley of the subtitle is that of the upper Mesta river and its tributaries in Kassabova’s native Bulgaria. Ecologically, it is classified as montane, and by British standards, enviably rich, with plants that have become rare elsewhere still thriving and providing the basis of an international trade in medicinal herbs. Historically, the communities Kassabova visits in the years straddling the pandemic have been traumatised and tempered over centuries by waves of invasion and persecution. Religiously, they are syncretic. When speaking to non-Muslims, the long-suffering Pomaks use a term equivalent to “Allah-God” to downplay their separateness. Economically the story is one of exploitation by one murderous kleptocratic regime after another, and now by international dealers and distributors of tinctures and teas. For a product on the shelves of health-food shop or chic UK herbalist you might pay 200 to 300 times what an expert forager in the Mesta valley receives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/10/elixir-by-kapka-kassabov-review-bulgarias-vale-of-enchantment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Superstar singer is the much-anticipated half-time performer on the biggest US sports night of the year – but what can we expect?</p><p>A lot has happened since Rihanna, one of the most famous singers in the world, last released an album.

Even the singer has <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1151813/rihanna-jokes-she-lost-her-new-album-as-fans-plead-for-new-music">joked</a> that R9 (the colloquial name for her next, ninth LP) may be lost to time. But it does herald a megawatt return to the music spotlight for one of pop’s most reliable hit-makers, who has for nearly seven years devoted her energy elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/10/rihanna-super-bowl-half-time-show">Continue reading...</a>

But would I be able to handle the boredom? I had been getting drunk pretty regularly since I was an adolescent and was completely inexperienced at having fun without booze. I wasn’t sure it was possible. Happily, I was wrong.</p><p>“It has been deeply ingrained in us by the media, culture and our peers that alcohol is the best way to have fun, and therefore sobriety must be boring,” says Veronica Valli, a psychotherapist, recovery coach and author of <a href="https://soberful.com/">Soberful</a>. She says: “The truth is, with 23 years of sobriety behind me, I can’t think of anything that <em>isn’t</em> more fun without alcohol. But there’s more to stopping drinking than just stopping drinking. We have to learn a lot of new emotional skills.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/10/i-gave-up-booze-and-am-having-more-fun-than-ever-these-seven-tips-could-help-you-do-the-same">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nayef Aguerd is catching the eye, Sean Dyche faces Jürgen Klopp in the Merseyside derby and Leeds face Man Utd … again</p><p>The pressure on David Moyes has eased before West Ham host Chelsea. The east London side remain in relegation peril but recent performances have been more encouraging. Last month’s victory over Everton featured Jarrod Bowen at his driving best and last weekend’s gutsy draw with Newcastle saw West Ham return to the qualities that once made them so effective under Moyes. There were players running for the cause and the defence stood firm. Nayef Aguerd is beginning to look like a very smart buy. The Morocco centre-back missed the start of the season after suffering an ankle injury during a pre-season friendly but he has been excellent since returning to fitness. Aguerd was impressive during Morocco’s run to the World Cup semi-final and has been very good for West Ham lately. Most impressive was his brilliant tackle to deny Callum Wilson after the Newcastle striker went through on goal. Moyes will want more of the same against Chelsea. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><p><em>West Ham v Chelsea, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Brentford, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Crystal Palace v Brighton, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Leeds v Manchester United, Sunday 2pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/10/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

## Your Place or Mine review – Netflix romcom has big stars but little charm

<p>Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher play best friends who swap houses for a week in a bland, if inoffensive, pile of fluff</p><p>Valentine’s Day compels many of us to bemoan not just the sorry state of our love lives but also the even sorrier state of the romantic comedy, a genre given a recent rebirth that’s still in need of a jolt back to life. After a distinct dearth, the streamer-led avalanche of 90-minute meet-cutes has certainly been consistent but it’s also been consistently underwhelming, inoffensively so perhaps but also increasingly aggravating to those of us who fondly remember the best of them. Even without expecting a total wheel reinvention, there’s a laziness that niggles – it’s as if these movies are being pumped out by writers and directors who are half-asleep, their focus elsewhere.</p><p>One might naively expect a little more from Reese Witherspoon’s return to both the genre and to film in general, her first leading role in six years since another romantic comedy, Home Again. But Netflix’s maddeningly milquetoast Your Place or Mine, which pairs her with Ashton Kutcher, is just about as forgettable as most of the mulch we’ve been spoon-fed of late but considerably more disappointing given both the involvement of Witherspoon and writer-director Aline Brosh McKenna. While McKenna did lump us with both I Don’t Know How She Does It and the remake of Annie, she also wrote the smart and charming scripts for 27 Dresses, The Devil Wears Prada and the frustratingly under-seen Morning Glory and co-created the excellent and often daringly subversive Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. It’s rather baffling then that she would make this her directorial debut, something so edgeless and unspecific with only glimpses of the wit and warmth we’ve seen from her work before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/your-place-or-mine-review-netflix-romcom-reese-witherspoon-ashton-kutcher">Continue reading...</a>
