The top brass of the PLA could have deliberately launched a balloon to sabotage Blinken's visit to China.\nIt would be tricky for Taiwan's defense, and it may take a relatively long decision time to respond to this kind of ambiguous provocation, thus losing the opportunity to act in a timely manner. \nFrom a military perspective, the good thing about the balloon incident is that the U.S. military has made full use of this unexpected event to achieve the effect of a real-world combat exercise. \n\nHave questions?
