  <p id="DfTQhD">Jony Ive and his design firm LoveFrom designed the emblem for the coronation of King Charles III, according to a new page <a href="https://www.royal.uk/coronation-emblem">on the Royal Family’s website</a>. The emblem will be used throughout the festivities surrounding the king’s coronation in May and on official coronation merchandise.</p>
<p id="tTNyM3">“It is such an honour to be able to contribute to this remarkable national occasion, and our team is so very proud of this work,” Ive said in a statement about the emblem. “The design was inspired by King Charles’ love of the planet, nature, and his deep concern for the natural world.</p>

  <p id="2Vr4Gi">Fitbit recently <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230028031">filed a patent application</a> (pdf) for a force-sensitive display that would enable blood pressure readings on wearables. But even if patents <em>did</em> guarantee success — which they don’t — the past few months make it hard to be confident in the future of Fitbit smartwatches.</p>
<p id="jV0uvN">First things first, you shouldn’t read too hard into any patent filing. While it can give you a sense of what a company’s working on, it’s a legal tool for companies to effectively call dibs on a particular innovation.

  <p id="SQz6Tb">Reddit doesn’t seem to be too worried about the AI-powered conversational chatbots like the ones Google and Microsoft revealed this week, based on a statement the company shared with <em>The Verge</em>. Shifting from traditional search to ChatGPT-like bots could erase the strategy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23377358/google-search-reddit-discussions-forums-results">appending “reddit” to your searches</a> to find human-sourced information instead of SEO-optimized garbage.</p>
<p id="nb1IIa">But Reddit believes the chatbots won’t replace actual human connection.</p>
<p id="ZijQoM">“AI chatbot technologies are still new and something we’re exploring and keeping our eyes on,” said Reddit spokesperson Nick Singer. “Though, there will always be a need for genuine community and human connection, which can be aided by tools like this. We see chatbots being used in fun and...</p>

However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, for instance, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.</p>

  <p id="hVT3h7">While gadget patents don’t guarantee anything, they can offer a glimpse into areas a company is exploring. Earlier this week, Apple was <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11571048">granted a patent</a> (US-11571048-B1) for an Apple Watch strap release mechanism that could potentially be used with a built-in camera. That, on its own, is a neat idea, but it’s also the third camera-related Apple Watch patent we’ve seen in recent years. The patent application was originally filed in 2019, so Apple engineers have clearly had wearable cameras on the brain for some time.</p>
<p id="rHvwCV"><a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/02/apple-wins-patent-for-an-apple-watch-with-a-built-in-camera-unique-band-system-that-allows-the-watch-to-easily-detach-to-ta.html">First spotted by <em>Patently Apple</em></a>, the patent’s abstract and description section detail a strap with two segments and a “nest” portion. The concept was to create a quick and ergonomic way to pop the watch out of the strap. </p>

  <p id="btreSz">Since <em>Fast Five</em>, each <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> movie has gotten more patently ridiculous than the last. The series has sent cars into space, returned two characters from the dead, and perhaps most incredulously, proposes that somehow John Cena and Vin Diesel are biological brothers. For the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/27/23044447/justin-lin-fast-x-director"><em>Fast X</em></a> trailer, it feels like the series is taking a step back from its action movie power creep and returning to its roots as a good old-fashioned family drama with the occasional exploding car. After all, not too many places you can go once you’ve gone to space. Maybe underwater?</p>

  <p id="3smkIT">Since its launch in 2005, Etsy has become well known as the place to go for handcrafted, one-of-a-kind items from a wide variety of creators. Unfortunately, over the last few years, that rosy reputation has darkened a bit. To begin with, <a href="https://twitter.com/weggles/status/1509202411629559809?s=20&amp;t=N_nYb1iw-wNdSXE2XDmtiw">buyers have been noticing</a> an influx of mass-market goods that are noticeably not handmade.

Investigators for the NTSB issued their <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/?NTSBNumber=HWY21FH007">final report</a> this week that determined the driver was operating the vehicle up until it impacted the tree and that they had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/autopilot-had-no-involvment-in-fatal-texas-tesla-crash-ntsb-says/">via <em>Ars Technica</em></a>).</p>
<p id="z7S8Ql">Here’s the probable cause as written in the NTSB’s final conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p id="cbQGtR">The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the Spring, Texas, electric vehicle crash was the driver’s excessive speed and failure to control his car, due to impairment from alcohol intoxication in combination with the effects of two...</p></blockquote>

  <p id="G4ray7">The latest Chrome beta, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/chrome-111-beta/">version 111</a>, includes a trial for a feature that could make the browser’s picture-in-picture feature significantly more useful.
