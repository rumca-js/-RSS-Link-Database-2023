No one knew who was behind the attack. The U.S.  government treated it like one big mystery with no real attempts to get to the bottom of it. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AL5Y3wNgBs" target="_blank">praised</a> the opportunity presented by the destruction of the pipeline: </p><p><em>“It’s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs. That’s very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come, but meanwhile we’re determined to do everything we possibly can to make sure the consequences of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries or, for that matter, around the world.”</em></p><p>Some suspected Russia was behind the attack, and President Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUsyWnYoKLs" target="_blank">said</a> it was a "deliberate act of sabotage". But why would Russia blow up its own pipeline? Nord Stream strategically kept Germany and Western Europe dependent on Russia for natural gas and provided Russia with a major source of income. </p><p>But what about the United States? This was the accusation from Vladimir Putin and therefore was immediately labeled "Russian propaganda" by our government overlords. But now, five months later, a seasoned investigative journalist published a report suggesting just that. </p><p>The <a href="https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream" target="_blank">report</a>, titled, "How America Took Out the Nord Stream Pipeline" was published on Substack by eighty-five-year-old Seymour Hersh. Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize in 1970 for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its subsequent cover-up during the Vietnam War. </p><p>Hersh explained the Biden administration's plan and execution of the Nord Stream explosions, citing "a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning." </p><p>In June of 2022, U.S. Navy divers planted remotely-triggered explosives under the guise of a NATO exercise called <a href="https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3066830/baltops-22-the-premier-baltic-sea-maritime-exercise-concludes-in-kiel/" target="_blank">BALTOPS 22.</a> Hersh said this was done because "President Joseph Biden saw the pipelines as a vehicle for Vladimir Putin to weaponize natural gas for his political and territorial ambitions." </p><p>Immediately after the explosions, some "conspiracy" minded Americans couldn't help but recall these peculiar words the President had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS4O8rGRLf8" target="_blank">spoken</a> months before: "If Russia invades . . . there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. <em>We will bring an end to it."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Ominous. And possibly a brilliant tactic. Hersh explained, <em>"[Biden's indiscretion] created an opportunity. According to the source, some of the senior officials of the CIA determined that blowing up the pipeline 'no longer could be considered a covert option because the President just announced that we knew how to do it.'"</em> Meaning there was no longer any need to inform Congress. </p><p>We may have underestimated Sleepy Joe. Or at least whoever his handlers are. </p><p>The White House, of course, vehemently denied these allegations, calling them "false and complete fiction." But are they?<span></span></p><p>In terms of motive, the United States is the only country that makes sense. And their lack of investigation suggests they already know the perpetrator, and perhaps were hoping no one would look too far into it. </p><p>Now, some innocent United States civilians may be thinking, "But America would never do that." And I admire the patriotism and optimism of these folks. But America absolutely would do that. Unfortunately. </p><p>The United States has no problem meddling in foreign affairs when they stand to benefit. Back in 2014, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9J6sxCs5k" target="_blank"> phone call</a> between the State Department's Victoria Nuland and the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt was posted to YouTube. The call revealed the Obama administration's plans to oust the current, pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, and usher in a new, pro-West government. Yanukovych was removed as President shortly after this phone call took place. <span></span></p><p>Oh, and Nuland is currently the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs of the United States. Along with Biden and Blinken, she made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ild-PsPD_Uw" target="_blank">public threat</a> against the Nord Stream pipeline earlier this year and subsequently celebrated its destruction. Just a coincidence, I'm sure. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cAt a Senate hearing, top US diplomat Victoria Nuland celebrated the Nord Stream 2 pipeline bombing: \n\n"Senator Cruz, like you, I am, and I think the administration is, very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now, as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea."\u201d</div> — Aaron Mat\u00e9 (@Aaron Mat\u00e9)

</blockquote>

<p>They tell us what they're doing, as they're doing it. Every time. </p><p><span></span>Blowing up Nord Stream was undoubtedly an act of war. Russia has already vowed "consequences" for the United States. If the attack wasn't ordered by President Biden, then who? Why don't we have an answer and a perpetrator to punish?</p><p>I think we know why. But I wouldn't expect answers any time soon. The United States government isn't exactly big on accountability. </p>

## UPDATE: Project Veritas Board Might Be Breaking the Law By Ousting James O'Keefe

As a refresher, James O'Keefe was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-board-directors" target="_blank">placed</a> on paid leave by the board of Project Veritas for allegedly being a meanie poopy head. Also maybe because he just exposed a certain pharmaceutical company that essentially runs the country. Just a slight coincidence. </p><p>We then heard whispers of an actual <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-project-veritas-coup" target="_blank">coup</a> organized by the Board of Directors to oust O'Keefe. Today, Old Row Swig, the same guy who exposed this coup d'état, obtained a Cease and Desist letter sent to Project Veritas' Board of Directors from a law firm representing a handful of "significant" Project Veritas donors. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8EXCLUSIVE\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8: I have obtained a Cease and Desist Demand Letter sent to the @Project_Veritas Board of Directors by a law firm representing a large group of significant PV donors. \n\nRT!!!\u201d</div> — Swig \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Swig \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowSwig/status/1624093172639887361">1676048961</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The letter states that the Board may be violating Virginia law since Project Veritas has consistently solicited donations based on O'Keefe's "leadership, vision, and principles." Since the Board has clearly been planning to remove O'Keefe for some time but continued to solicit donations under O'Keefe's name and mission, this could potentially defraud donors. </p><p>The letter concludes, <em>"We understand that the Board will be meeting tomorrow and that, at least at present, may be intending to take further steps toward reducing Mr. O'Keefe's leadership role and authority resulting in redirection of the mission of Project Veritas. We ask that the Board immediately cease and desist from taking such steps, as they risk violating Virginia charitable solicitation and trust law - as well as the governing documents of the Project Veritas entities." </em></p><p>We'll see what happens over the next few days, but this seems like a strong point in O'Keefe's favor. Even if he ends up getting removed, it's pretty obvious to everyone that there is no Project Veritas without James O'Keefe. If anything, he'll just start another nonprofit and keep going on Grindr dates with corrupt yet wholly unsuspecting Pfizer employees. America needs those hilarious stings now more than ever. It's been a tough year. </p>

	Now I feel bad for the guy. You're at a hockey game having the time of your life. Showing off your sweet, sweet mullet. Next thing you know words are said, fists are thrown, and you are the viral superstar du jour.
</p><p>
	Mullet McGee took over the internet yesterday. All he needed to do was get punched in the face and knocked down a row. But his evening didn't start off like that. Cameras caught up with him before and he was having a blast.

	McGee thought he was just going to a hockey game. Now he had a cameraman asking him to show off his sweet-ass mullet. And he was into it! He took his hood down and shook his hair back and forth like he was Phoebe Cates getting out of swimming pool. He gave the camera a wink, and I think attempted the People's Eyebrow. It was becoming the greatest night of his life!
</p><p>
	But you know what happened next.

</p><p>Unclear is what started this disagreement.

</blockquote></div><p>The aggravating incident was when Mullet McGee called the other guy a, quote, "dumb ass n***a." Obviously, not a racial thing since the dude it was directed to is also what critics call a Caucasian. But as it turns out, even dropping a "soft g" and even in the south...white people? Don't care much for the word either.</p><p>If nothing else, I hope Mullet McGree is somewhere in the DFW area having a hearty laugh over the whole situation. Some days you laugh at content. Some days you are the content. It's a vicious circle of life.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Hero dresses as a clown to protest Austin City Council's woke agenda, blasts city council asking for a job

Some heroes wear rainbow wigs and face paint. That's what this absolute CHAD did to blast the Austin City Council's misguided priorities. The disconnect is while the Austin City Council wants to focus on its woke agenda, residents want to focus on being able to afford their energy bills. You would think these residents would consider that before electing the city council, but...you know.</p><p>Somehow, a power OUTAGE resulted in residents' Austin Energy bills skyrocketing. According to the Wikipedia, Austin Energy is a publicly owned utility providing electrical power to the city of Austin and surrounding areas and returns its profits to the city's general fund to finance other city services The more money Austin Energy makes, the more money that goes into the city coffers.</p><p>Now meet Chad. He finds it odd that an outage would result in paying more and wants accountability. His mom told him to dress for the job he wants, so he dressed as the CEO of Austin Energy.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"My mother told me to dress for the job that you want to have, and that's why I'm here today - because I would like to be the CEO of Austin Energy."<br />Public comments at the Austin City Council meeting start with criticism of storm response.<br />MORE INFO: <a href="https://t.co/3SDnfjQdGE">https://t.co/3SDnfjQdGE</a> <a href="https://t.co/VQuv5d4JX5">pic.twitter.com/VQuv5d4JX5</a><br />— CBS Austin (@cbsaustin) <a href="https://twitter.com/cbsaustin/status/1623729302813515779?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Talk your talk, Chad:</p><p>"I have pronouns in my Twitter bio, I also have Ukrainian flags in my Twitter bio, and due to my extensive qualifications and the fact that my priorities align so much with the city of Austin."</p><p>"Just last month I destroyed the gas stove that I own in a fire that I started because I am firmly committed to saving the planet just like you."</p><p>These bars are my favorite:</p><p>"I would like a salary between $350,000 to $500,000 a year, so that I can support my lifestyle, fund my cocaine habit, and care for <strong>my wife</strong> who has stage five <strong>testicular cancer</strong>."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The video was a nice change of pace. When we report on these public meetings, they tend to involve adults reading aloud the porn that city councils like Austin want to indoctrinate children with.  Here, we have a man instead looking for a job and presenting his credentials. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website wish Chad the Clown all the best in all his future endeavors.</p><p><p>

In fact, it's great! From <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lizzo-body-shamer-instagram" target="_blank">Lizzo</a> to the cover of <a href="https://twitter.com/JusticeTristan/status/1481118968941137921?s=20&amp;t=beFRzqGGSZVXdU9gdcZlxg" target="_blank">Self Magazine</a>, fat is most definitely in. </p><p>Except for one *slight* problem: none of it's true. Being <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/super-mario-ride" target="_blank">fat</a> is actually not good. In fact, it can be very, very bad. </p><p>All of us here know this, but some people out there are still brainwashed. So this lady issued a warning about the dangers of overeating and not exercising: </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cListen to her warning. This is profoundly sad. What are we doing to our young people?\u201d</div> — Catch Up (@Catch Up)

<p>She explained she hasn't been to the store for at least two years and went to the post office once. On one occasion when she went to Urgent Care, she thought her legs were going to give out from under her. </p><p>She also discussed the 30-40 pound growth she has in her FUPA, or her pelvic region, which she has to physically adjust when she walks, and it prevents her from wearing leggings or shorts. </p><p>Then she issued her warning:<em> "I wish I knew the cost of eating. I wish I knew the cost of the comfort at the time that I was seeking. I just want this to be a warning to other people that just need to hear the hard truth, that if you keep it up, and you keep gaining and not taking care of yourself [...] Your health is going to decline. [...] I had to have help trimming my toenails the other day because I felt so out of breath." </em></p><p><em>"There's a lot it's taken away from me, and I want you to know that it's not worth it,"  </em>She continued. <em>"It's not worth your life." </em></p><p>Now, obviously, this is quite an extreme scenario. But a young person could absolutely be hypnotized by all the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/male-model-any-size" target="_blank">"healthy at every size"</a> propaganda and spiral into unhealthy eating habits. Who doesn't want to believe they can eat whatever they want, whenever they want, and be any size they want with absolutely no consequences?</p><p>A good rule of thumb: when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Especially if it's promoted by Lizzo.  </p>

## WATCH: Hammer-wielding woman terrorizes family, yet police don't respond until her video goes viral on TikTok

But I like to keep my hammer attacks to zero, so this is two too many for me. </p><p>A 54-year-old hammer-wielding, racial-slur-spewing woman named Judy Ann Kline was charged with three felonies after terrorizing a Missouri family for over a year. Twenty-two-year-old Fatima Suarez, a member of the victimized family,  said police only took action after she posted the Ring footage to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-andrew-schulz-app" target="_blank">TikTok</a>. So we are officially in the era where TikTok videos are the only way to garner any sort of attention. Past generations built cathedrals, invented airplanes, and fought Nazis.

</blockquote>
<p>The woman appears to believe that Fatima's family is here illegally, screaming, <em>"get the f*** off my property"</em> and explaining that she's an American citizen<em> "unlike you assh*les". </em></p><p>Suarez said Kline had previously broken the glass on the basement door, got inside the house, and banged on the dryer with her hammer. Once she got out of the house, she banged on the front door with the hammer. Police reportedly didn't classify Kline as a "serious persistent offender," despite the concerning hammer-wielding. Kline returned to Fatima's home several times over the next year.</p><p>There isn't too much funny in this story, but we can always count on MSNBC's wokeness to bring a smile to our faces. In their report, the narrator states that Fatima's family <em>"identifies as Mexican-descent." </em> I'm assuming this means they are Mexican. But does it also mean we're identifying as races now? Someone may want to give Rachel Dolezal a call. I'm sure she'll be thrilled. </p><p><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Luke Skywalker might be gay according to certain Star Wars fans, and somehow William Shatner is involved

Related to this there is a debate as to whether or not Luke Skywalker likes boys or girls. As opposed to actor Mark Hamill, who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-hamill-jk-rowling-excuse" target="_blank">has turned into</a> a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-hamill-adoption" target="_blank">real douchebag</a> regardless of how else he identifies. More shocking is that the debate about Luke has been going on for a few years. You may not have been aware of this. I wasn't aware of this until today. But since I have the information now, you need to be stuck with it also.</p><p>Here are five things you need to know about why the internet wants Luke Skywalker to be gay now.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>1. Since as far back as 2016, Hollywood has been what critics call "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dear-hollywood-stop-gaying-all-the-things" target="_blank">gaying all the things</a>." In the name of inclusion, instead of creating news stories and new characters, activists call on established characters to be given a same-sex mate. It's almost to the point of "gaying all the things" supporters having a weird fetish about it. For a while, there was a push for Captain America and Bucky to be lovers. There are fantasies about Elsa having a girlfriend.</p><p>2. There is something called "retconning." Google defines it as "when you revise an aspect of a fictional work retrospectively, typically by introducing a piece of new information that imposes a different interpretation on previously described events." When activists engage in what critics call "gaying all the things," retconning is the word they made up to do so. Giving characters pronouns, looking for facial expressions or lines of dialogue to justify questioning their sexuality, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/velma-bad-ratings" target="_blank">taking decades-old jokes and using them to virtue signal</a>, etc.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>3. These tweets seem to have sparked the current "Luke Skywalker: Gay or Nah" debate, according to <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/luke-skywalker-now-lgbtq-according-to-star-wars" target="_blank">The Post Millennial</a>. There is a website called "Wookiepedia" that has taken it upon itself to decide what Star Wars characters are allegedly a part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You're gonna fucking hate this, then <a href="https://t.co/bi8vo95AZr">pic.twitter.com/bi8vo95AZr</a><br />— Mand'alor the Cringefail (@materassassino) <a href="https://twitter.com/materassassino/status/1621556369542320132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Unclear is what makes Obi-Wan Kenobi and Grand Moff Tarkin gay, other than their both British. Though I haven't watched any of the Disney+ shows.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">There is a story in which he felt romantic feelings towards a guy.<br />— Wookieepedia🫐 (@WookOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/WookOfficial/status/1621600748235636736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>4. It all stems from a single story in <em>Stories of Jedi and Sith</em>, a 2022 book targeting children aged 9-12. Luke may or may not have had a relationship with someone called Sergeant Reyé Hollis. However, the only connection between Luke and his newfound sexuality could be the political activism of the author.</p><blockquote>According to Bounding Into Comics, "the actual story doesn’t appear to show any romantic feelings expressed by Luke Skywalker towards Sergeant Reyé Hollis of Alliance Special Forces despite Sam Magg’s clear history of pushing her activism into her stories."</blockquote><p>5. There has been a push to make Luke gay for a few years now. How do we know this? Because William Shatner got involved. Yes, Captain Kirk. The man who once told nerds "get a life, all of you."</p><p>Shatner entered the debate by quoting Star Wars cannon, which is the funniest aspect in all of this.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Luke got married in SWs canon👇🏻 so unless Tatooine was repressive & he was hiding it looks like he chose a woman named Mara. <a href="https://t.co/NBtYXk7V1X">https://t.co/NBtYXk7V1X</a> <a href="https://t.co/3kO6lzK3mb">pic.twitter.com/3kO6lzK3mb</a><br />— William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1357734071850393603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><p>And this is all why people today are debating if Luke Skywalker is gay or not. I don't care that you never asked. I never asked either, yet I was told anyway.</p><p><p>

	Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin made a surprise appearance at the NFL Honors. The NFL Honors is the NFL's version of the Oscars and Grammys, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sam-smith-church-of-satan" target="_blank">only minus the Satan worship</a>.
</p><p>
	Also, unfortunately, without the rest of the Buffalo Bills. They are all on a golf course somewhere because instead of "Doing it for Damar" in the post-season, they opted to forget how to play football.  So instead of Josh Allen leading his team to victory on Sunday, we get Jackson Mahomes' brother.
</p><p>
	My bitterness is not why I gathered you hear today. I wanted to share Hamlin's powerful testimony to God. The safety was joined on stage by all the Buffalo and Cincinnati medical professionals who saved his life <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/damar-hamlin-buffalo-bills-charity" target="_blank">after a tackle sent him into cardiac arrest</a>.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		"The journey will continue." ❤️💙<br />
<br />
		An incredible moment as <a href="https://twitter.com/HamlinIsland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HamlinIsland</a> takes the stage at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLHonors?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLHonors</a>. <a href="https://t.co/TgqTKSAVKS">pic.twitter.com/TgqTKSAVKS</a><br />

</blockquote></div><blockquote>I would like to just thank God for even being here. Every day I was amazed that my experience could encourage so many others, across the country and even across the world. Encouraged to pray, encouraged to spread love, and encouraged to keep fighting no matter the circumstances.</blockquote><p>Seeing people <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/espn-prayer-damar-hamlin" target="_blank">openly pray</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/josh-allen-bills-god-real" target="_blank">profess their beliefs</a> was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tony-dungy-march-life" target="_blank">powerful to watch</a> as a bystander. Especially when the only time "prayer" enters the public discourse is when the left and the media (but I repeat myself) defecate on the idea of it. But while it was moving to watch on television, it HELPED Hamlin in his fight.</p><blockquote><span></span>My entire life, I felt like God was using me to give others hope. Now with a new set of circumstances, I can only say He is doing what He has always done. I have a long journey ahead, a journey full of unknowns and a journey full of milestones.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a lot easier to face your fears when you know your purpose.</blockquote><p>That last sentence is the one that got to me because I was there for another testimony last week. We lost my mom to a nine-year battle with cancer.</p><p>One thing I take comfort in, mom taught Catholic school for 25 years. She's friends still with a lot of the parents of her first students, and one came to visit her in the hospital. She told her about all the kids she brought to Jesus and how He couldn’t wait to see her to say thank you. </p><p>It was the most alert my mom sounded all week talking to the parent, and when she said “I’m not afraid."</p><p>Being there for her testimony meant a lot to me. If Damar Hamlin can do the same, only with a bigger platform and spread to millions of people, there may be something to the Lord working in mysterious ways.</p><p><p>
