<p>A viral video trend in Japan has got <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sushi/"><ins>sushi</ins></a> conveyor-belt restaurants racing to prevent food tampering. One chain, Kura Sushi, said it will use artificial intelligence to look for "suspicious opening and closing of sushi plate covers," <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Food-Beverage/Japan-s-sushi-chains-rush-to-ensure-food-safety-after-viral-stunts"><em><ins>Nikkei Asia</ins></em></a> reported this week.</p><p>Kura Sushi <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sushi-terrorism-japan-use-ai-cameras-tackle-food-contamination-2023-2"><ins>plans</ins></a> to start upgrading existing cameras, which are used to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc2FoaS5jb20vYWp3L2FydGljbGVzLzEzNzExMjY1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYTRlYzY4MC01NzEzLTQ4MWUtYjM1OC05MWU3MTQ4MWIwNGMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXp3oOT6id_3ti8V0-2rUm6f0SyGyr1vb9wYYiViP47i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asahi.com%2Fajw%2Farticles%2F13711265"><ins>track the dishes</ins></a> customers take from conveyor belts to determine their bill, by early March.

## Ubisoft botched a ‘Division 2’ fix so badly it broke its ability to update the game

<p>Gamers are no strangers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/destiny-2-delayed-beyond-light-expansion-november-193703108.html">delayed seasons</a>, but <em>The Division 2</em> players are in a particularly awkward situation. Ubisoft has revealed that a development &quot;error&quot; has broken the shared-world shooter's build generation system, and thus the studio's ability to update the game. The team not only can't introduce the new season it delayed last week, but can't extend the outgoing one until it repairs the build functionality.</p><p>Ubisoft says it has made &quot;good progress&quot; in fixing the issue in recent days, and there are hints a solution is in sight. The company is <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1624034371563933697">in the midst</a> of a three-hour &quot;unscheduled maintenance&quot; session as we write this, and it's using the downtime to fix <a href="https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/187654/unscheduled-maintenance-february-10th-2023">problems</a> that include an inability to make seasonal in-game purchases. The servers should be back online around 1PM Eastern if there are no complications.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8c3faba2283240bcbb944bcc1e1afbd9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A message from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDivision2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheDivision2</a> team. <a href="https://t.co/KuPiz7t9PL">pic.twitter.com/KuPiz7t9PL</a></p>— Tom Clancy's The Division (@TheDivisionGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1623713481353490433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>The timing is particularly bad for this issue. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-delay-games-canceled-202818759.html">cancelled three games</a> in response to sinking revenue, and workers at its Paris studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-paris-strike-183059140.html">went on strike</a> last month to protest what they say are unfair working conditions. Things aren't going smoothly at the publisher, and it may be a while before there's a degree of stability.</p>

## 'Hogwarts Legacy' review: A massive game, alive with magic

<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is the Harry Potter game I’ve been dreaming of since I was a teenager. I grew up alongside the Harry Potter novels and devoured them all, and I spent the time between book releases reading and writing fanfiction set in the Wizarding World. I would’ve traded my little emo soul for a sprawling role-playing game that allowed me to be a student at Hogwarts, and 16 years later, that exact wish has been fulfilled. (And now I know what happened to my soul.)</p><p><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is alive with magic. It’s a massive and gorgeous open-world RPG that extends far beyond the walls of the wizarding school, with mysteries, danger and cute creatures packed into every corner. Casting spells quickly becomes second nature in this environment and when it comes to puzzles, my magical instincts are often correct and richly rewarded. Combat involves intricate spellwork and lightning-quick responses, and this combination consistently results in a seamless, satisfying flow. I feel powerful while playing <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. I feel like a witch — and that’s all I’ve ever really wanted.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Four Hogwarts students sit casually in a classroom, speaking with their professor, an older witch in deep green robes." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/a5b55780-a8b7-11ed-9cf1-918f9070466f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. Games</div></figure><p>I’m not done with <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, but we weren’t given much lead time for the review and I feel I’ve played enough to form lasting opinions about the game. I’m about 22 hours in on PlayStation 5 and I’m one skill away from completing my witch’s ability set. Her name is Chenault, she’s a Slytherin, and her wand is 13 inches with a dragon heartstring core. Her favorite spell is <em>incendio</em>.</p><p>Combat in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> plays out across a variety of environments and against multiple enemy types, and it’s consistently delicious. Players eventually step into battle with 16 spells ready to fire, a wheel full of potions and plants, a meter that generates extra-powerful magic moves, and some basic defenses — and all of these actions culminate in explosive, frictionless duels. Spells, healing potions and <em>protego </em>bubbles respond even at the last possible moment, and my witch’s moves chain together in a way that feels volatile and magical. There’s strategy and challenge in each new battleground, and I look forward to testing my abilities and various clothing upgrades every time.</p><p>Combat may be where the action lies, but customization and exploration are core aspects of the game. Hogwarts is packed with students to assist (or not) and the school is overflowing with secrets, each one unlockable with the proper combination of curiosity and spellwork. I’ve spent a significant amount of time simply running through the halls and across the grounds of the school, happy to explore while passively gathering XP and watching the mysteries unravel around me.</p><section><img alt="A transparent, protective bubble surrounds a Hogwarts student, deflecting an incoming spell from a dark wizard in a blaze of red sparks." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/29174ae0-a8b6-11ed-b7ed-b4844267c7e1" /></section><p>Flying only makes this process more enjoyable. Whether on a broomstick or the back of a thestral, flight in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> feels exactly how I wanted it to — smooth, swift and stylish, and always with gorgeous views.</p><p>As the map expands beyond Hogwarts, past the streets of Hogsmeade and the boundaries of the Forbidden Forest, players encounter sidequests, challenges, secrets, puzzles and obstacle courses at a persistent pace. The world is large, but purposeful and truly beautiful; it’s clearly the result of intentional design, rather than procedural generation. There’s always something to find, a fresh riddle to solve or skill to learn, and my Quests tab is constantly growing. What’s more, I’m actually stoked to complete the activities I encounter, whenever I want to grind or take a breather from the main storyline.</p><p>The list of things to do in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> feels never-ending. For instance, about 10 hours in, the game introduces interior design mechanics in the Room of Requirement, allowing players to decorate a cavernous space from the architectural touches, to the placement and color of individual tables, chairs, paintings, rugs and tchotchkes. It’s a useful room, too; this is where players keep their clothing-upgrade loom, potions tables, herbology boxes and captured beasts. I’ve spent far too much time tweaking the appearance of my own Room of Requirement — like, <em>hours </em>— but I’m in love with the results and I’ve enjoyed the process immensely.</p><figure><img alt="The main hall of Hogwarts fills the space, with students filtering down twin staircases, the school crest large and lit by two fires on pedestals." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/28f6f1a0-a8b6-11ed-afff-741ad0016e55" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. Games</div></figure><p>I see potential for the glut of stuff in <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>to become tedious, but this hasn’t happened in my playthrough yet. More than 20 hours in, and the magic is still alive for me.</p><p>Before actually playing the game, I was especially excited to brew potions because this was my favorite activity in Pottermore, the browser-based Hogwarts-student simulator that disintegrated into gibberish in the mid 2010s. In Pottermore, brewing potions involved reading recipes and physically manipulating ingredients at the proper moments, and I found the process to be incredibly peaceful. However, potion-making isn’t an overly complicated affair in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. You simply get the ingredients and then leave them on the table for a while, just like growing plants. The mechanics fit the game — in a world this busy and vast, gathering ingredients is the challenge, not the minutiae of chopping, stirring, grinding, measuring and timing — but it’s a missed opportunity.</p><p>Even just writing that, I’m itching to spend some quality time at a potions bench doing all of these things. Maybe this would make for a solid piece of DLC down the line, Advanced Potion-Making? Just a thought, Avalanche.</p><p>Right, back to the actual game.</p><figure><img alt="Two students in Hogwarts school robes brew a potion as blue smoke rises from the cauldron." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/28dc16a0-a8b6-11ed-bf7f-762efa8d193e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. Games</div></figure><p>The main storylines in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> are generic fantasy platforms. Two main arcs collide: one pits players against goblin revolutionaries planning to destroy wizardkind, and the other is an extensive investigation of an ancient and powerful magic — the same magic that you, the main character, can uniquely wield. The latter arc will be painfully familiar to Harry Potter fans, as it involves a bunch of old farts repeatedly throwing a child into deadly situations while withholding crucial information and stroking their long white beards. I guess we know where Dumbledore got it from.</p><p>Personally, I don’t love the focus on the Goblin Rebellions. It’s functional as a basic fantasy premise, but it’s an obvious choice for a Harry Potter prequel and the game hasn’t yet demonstrated that it was a particularly thoughtful decision. The conceit so far is, “goblins are bad, wizardkind is good,” and there hasn’t been an intricate discussion about class, power and revolution within this framework, though these opportunities are prevalent. Regardless of how this storyline concludes, I would’ve appreciated a more nuanced approach or an original enemy.</p><p>There are valid questions about whether the depiction of goblins in Harry Potter is inherently antisemitic, or the result of centuries of European fiction that coded vampires, dwarves and other creatures with its authors’ antisemitism. What you need to know is that goblins in <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>are not meaningfully different to those in the novels, so your stance on the issue is unlikely to shift with this presentation.</p><figure><img alt="A massive hole in the side of a castle wall reveals lush, overgrown foliage and two colorful birds, and two Hogwarts students gaze out in awe." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/291771f0-a8b6-11ed-87ef-e69cdabb97f7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. Games</div></figure><p>The conversation around goblins and antisemitism would likely be top of mind in reviews and tweets about the game, but the author of the Harry Potter novels has made it publicly known that she’s transphobic, and this has understandably dominated the discourse. It’s led some people to call for a boycott of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and a portion of these folks are rebuking anyone who reviews, streams or talks about playing it. This controversy has consumed any broader criticism about the game itself. I addressed my personal decision to review this game for Engadget in an editorial at the start of the week, which is available to read <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hogwarts-legacy-boycott-editorial-110018998.html">here</a>.</p><p>For anyone concerned about encountering transphobic or bigoted content in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>: The author of the Harry Potter novels was not involved in the game’s writing or creation, and in fact, its world is more inclusive than the series has ever been. Crucially, the <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> character builder allows for an array of gender, voice and appearance configurations, and lets players choose their own names. In fanfiction terms, it’s basically a Mary Sue machine. This is ideal for an interactive role-playing medium — the customization options allow players to project their own identities onto the main character, who is an extra-special, super-powered student sorcerer surrounded by basic magic users. It’s a familiar premise for fantasy RPG players.</p><p>What makes<em>&nbsp;</em>this game stand out among open-world RPGs is its density of activities, mysteries and awe-inspiring moments, and its expertly tuned combat mechanics. <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is thrumming with magic, and it expands not only the landscape around Hogwarts, but also the boundaries of representation in an incredibly popular fantasy universe. It’s the coolest work of Harry Potter fanfiction I’ve come across in years, and I’m excited to keep playing. Especially if there’s an Advanced Potion-Making DLC down the line.</p>

Their call quality and six-hour battery life are just OK, but their sound quality, ANC and transparency mode all impress, and they continue to sport a host of features that make them easy to use with other Apple devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Beats Fit Pro</h2><p></p><p>A sportier alternative to the AirPods Pro, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlKTDQxTjlDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtuLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NWYyMGI2OS02NTFjLTQxMWUtYTg0MC05Yjg2OGM0N2QwOTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVOHknhQsMuS164sl-bnKZlhUxDuc5JbIW-rS5-5x2z6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JL41N9C">Beats Fit Pro</a> are currently on sale for $150 at Amazon and Walmart. Outside of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-fall-to-new-low-of-145-for-today-only-085343121.html">brief drop</a> to $145 at Woot last November, this matches the lowest price we've seen. For reference, the earphones have usually retailed closer to $175 over the last few months. The Fit Pro are the "best for workouts" pick in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds guide</a>, and we gave them a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">review score of 87</a> back in late 2021. They pack many of the features you'd get with a set of AirPods, including fast pairing, hands-free Siri and Find My device tracking, but their wing-tipped design should provide a more stable fit while you're on the move. Their rich sound should please those who like a little more bass, too, and they play nicer with Android devices. The ANC is a step behind what you'd get with the AirPods Pro, however, and the built-in controls are more prone to accidental presses.</p><h2>Sonos speaker sale</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvcHJvbW90aW9uYWwtb2ZmZXJzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NWYyMGI2OS02NTFjLTQxMWUtYTg0MC05Yjg2OGM0N2QwOTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASZ-r3KZHSiSxz5A8Zd_tPJUPr3JtScrg_G2uMJcIGDp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fpromotional-offers">Sonos has discounted</a> a handful of its home audio devices ahead of this weekend's Super Bowl.

The device supports all the major apps and HDR formats, too, plus Dolby Atmos.

It's down to $35 this week, which is another discount we've seen in the past, but here matches the lowest price we've tracked. This is the fastest streaming stick Amazon makes, and it supports all the same apps and HDR formats as the Google and Roku models noted above. Its voice search is more comprehensive than Roku's as well. The big downside is that Amazon's UI goes heavier on the ads and tends to prioritize the company's own content and services.

## The second-gen HomePod may be easier to repair than the first

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-13-apple-homepod-review.html">original HomePod</a> was notoriously difficult to repair, to the point where cutting tools were sometimes necessary. Apple isn't giving nearly as much grief with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html">second-gen model</a>, however. iFixit has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj00b2NjTjRIQTBTZyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTJiODVjY2QtZjBiNi00ZWVjLWJmOWYtMTJjMjU4NTQ5YzE5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQjPJ1_RpPP1okmbcpPrF400r6xDEBAotv6CxpIWnbmg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4occN4HA0Sg">torn down</a> the new smart speaker and discovered that it's far easier to pry open.

It's not clear that you can replace circuit boards and still expect a functioning HomePod. Even so, it's evident Apple considers repairability to be a priority this time around, much as it does with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-teardown-more-repairable-172505261.html">standard iPhone 14</a> and other recent products.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a53a6ec644bb4fe3b1cec3a243f29139"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Not that Apple has much choice but to make the HomePod more fix-friendly.

## Sony A7R V review: Awesome images, improved video, unbeatable autofocus

<p>Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-sony-a7r-iv-review.html">full-frame A7R IV</a> was one of the best mirrorless cameras I’ve ever reviewed, so there was a lot of pressure on its successor. The company’s answer is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7r-5-mirrorless-camera-61-megapixels-8k-video-152052459.html">61-megapixel A7R V</a>, designed to deliver the maximum amount of detail for portrait and landscape photography.</p><p>Though it uses the same sensor as the A7R IV, the new model has been improved in nearly every other way. The processors have been updated to the same ones found on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">50-megapixel A1</a>, allowing for faster autofocus and AI tracking and better video specs. Sony has also improved the stabilization, the rear display, EVF and more – all for the same $3,900 price as its chief rival, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">Canon EOS R5</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="54bf7de02a0a498c937c0a849c017485"></div><p>Sony’s advanced technology has always been its superpower, but rival models from Canon, Panasonic and others have started to catch up. To find out if the A7R V is worth buying over other cameras, and even the last model, I took it out for some detailed testing. Spoiler alert – it’s one impressive camera.</p><h3>Body and handling</h3><p>Sony made some changes to the design of its full-frame mirrorless cameras starting with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">A7S III</a>, and the A7R V continues in that vein. On top of a slightly bigger grip, it has a number of improvements over the A7R IV, such as a new dedicated selector for video, photos and the slow motion (S&amp;Q) mode.</p><p>By taking that function off the mode dial, it’s relatively easy to switch between photos and video, then change modes in each. It’s also possible to share some, all or none of the settings like shutter speed and ISO between photo and video modes using the customization menu. Sony also moved the record button from the back to a better position on top.</p><p>As with other Sony cameras, it’s intuitive and easy to use. Some people may find it uncomfortable to hold all day, though, particularly those with larger hands. That’s because the grip has some hard edges and a material that’s less cushy than Canon’s R5, for example.</p><p>A big new innovation on the A7R V is the rear display. Rather than a simple tilt-only screen like before, Sony has come up with a whole new system. It not only flips out, but also tilts – not just upwards like Panasonic’s similar system on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh-6-review-video-a-vlogging-workhorse-153048534.html">GH6</a>, but also down and out as well.</p><p>On top of being better for vlogging and selfies, it also lets you move the screen clear of any microphone or monitor cables. It’s also better for photo shooters. Some people prefer a tilting display (for shooting at high and low angles), so the A7R V has the best of both worlds.</p><p>The A7R IV already had a very good 5.76-million dot EVF, but Sony made it even better. Resolution on the OLED panel is up to 9.44 million dots, though it drops when you focus or increase the refresh rate to the maximum 120Hz. Still, it’s now close to matching what you’d see in an optical viewfinder.</p><figure><img alt="Sony A7R V camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/566b5941-a871-11ed-97fc-40a67c82d796" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Like the A1 and A7S III, it has a pair of dual-format card slots. Each one accepts either UHS-II SD or faster, but far more expensive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-grade-undercuts-sony-with-its-new-c-fexpress-type-a-camera-memory-cards-082048079.html">CFexpress Type A</a> cards. The latter are required for 8K video and let you shoot photo bursts longer before the buffer fills.</p><p>Since the A7R V is now a much better video camera, Sony has seen fit to swap out the tiny and fragile micro HDMI jack for a full-sized one. Though still not up to pro standards, it offers a relatively secure connection and allows for more robust cables, as micro HDMI models are prone to breaking.</p><p>It has the same battery as the A1 and delivers exactly the same number of maximum shots on a charge, 530. That’s under lab conditions, though, and I got about double that in the real world. The USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port is PD compatible, so you can charge the battery and power the camera at the same time. It also comes with microphone and headphone ports as you’d expect, plus a wired LAN port and  the ability to do zoom calls or livestream over USB-C via the UBC webcam standard.</p><h3>Performance</h3><figure><img alt="Sony A7R V mirrorless full-frame camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/76f7c0b0-a941-11ed-b5b6-3297ca91d2b9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The A7R V has roughly the same burst speeds as its predecessor, 10fps in both mechanical and electronic modes, shooting C-RAW and JPEG photos. That drops to 7 fps when shooting uncompressed RAW files. While not super quick compared to Sony’s A1 or the Canon EOS R5 (both have stacked sensors), it’s not bad at all for a 61-megapixel camera. You can shoot about 104 C-RAW + JPEG files before the buffer fills, though that takes less than two seconds.</p><p>Sony is known for its brilliant autofocus, and the A7R V may be its best camera in this area to date. WIth 693 phase detect focus points (up from 567 on the A7R IV) the regular (non subject tracking) AF is uncannily accurate in all five area modes, delivering a large majority of sharp frames even with fast moving subjects.</p><p>Things get even better when you kick in the AI. On top of the excellent face, head and eye tracking, Sony has introduced a new body tracking mode. It works much like 3D motion tracking software used for animation, predicting the position of your head and eyes based on your skeletal structure. If it fails to track the subject’s face, it can also switch to their body and still grab sharp shots.</p><p>On top of humans, it can also track people, birds, animals, insects, cars, trains and airplanes. However, you have to select those manually – it would be nice to have an auto mode that lets the AI choose the subject like Canon’s EOS R6 II. It also has a touch-to-track mode that locks onto subjects more accurately than rival models.</p><figure><img alt="Sony A7R V mirrorless full-frame camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/b8cbc0d0-a942-11ed-9dff-ecf65b223350" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>In most of these tracking modes, the camera did a good job at focusing on the subject’s eyes. Failing that, it accurately tracked the head or body and still delivered sharp photos. The results were particularly impressive considering the high resolution that shows focus flaws in minute detail.</p><p>It sometimes failed to lock onto birds’ and other animals' eyes, though that’s something Sony could potentially improve with firmware updates. By and large, though, it nailed focus nearly every time, beating rivals by a solid margin.</p><p>The A7R V also has a new in-body stabilization system, boosting it from 6 to 8 stops with supported lenses, the same as what Canon’s EOS R5 offers. It was very good for photography, letting me take sharp shots down to a quarter of a second. That means you can shoot handheld and capture the streak of a car’s lights, for instance, while freezing the background. That being said. it falls a bit short for video as you’ll see soon.</p><h3>Image quality</h3><h3></h3><p>As it has the same 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V delivers near identical image quality to the A7R IV. That’s not a bad thing, as the latter can produce stellar images. With the very high resolution and the lack of an anti-aliasing filter, only Hasselblad and Fuji’s 100-megapixel medium format cameras offer greater detail. If that’s not enough, you can use Sony’s Pixel Shift Multi-Shot and quadruple it to 240.8 megapixels.</p><p>With no low-pass filter, beware of antialiasing or moire that can crop up in detailed or repeating parts of an image. The high resolution means that the detail has to be very fine, however.</p><p>JPEGs are ready to share right out of the camera, with nicely tuned levels of sharpening and noise reduction. Colors are more accurate but perhaps less flattering to skin tones than Canon’s latest models. The system is particularly well tuned to sunny, blue-sky scenes, so the A7R V is a great option for landscape shooting.</p><section><img alt="Sony A7R V review image gallery" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/081c1670-a872-11ed-b7f6-f24aeb0899bf" /></section><p>Sony claims 15 stops of dynamic range, above Canon but perhaps slightly below Nikon. That gives you tons of overhead to edit RAW files, fix under- or over-exposed shots or tweak colors. Except for highly detailed scenes, I didn’t notice much difference between compressed and uncompressed RAW files.</p><p>The A7R V does surprisingly well in low light. At speeds up to ISO 6400, grain isn’t an issue. Noise increases considerably at ISO 12800, but images retain detail. Beyond that, they can get gnarly with large grained color noise. Still, for such a high-resolution camera, it exceeded my expectations in this area.</p><p>As it happened, I reviewed the A7R V at the same time as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hasselblad-x2d-100c-incredible-resolution-beautiful-imperfections-150029773.html">100-megapixel Hasselblad X2D</a>, so it was a good opportunity to test two very high resolution cameras. Both use sensors that have the same size pixels, and both are likely manufactured by Sony. For many photos, it was honestly hard to tell the difference, which is not bad for Sony considering the X2D costs over twice as much.</p><h3>Video</h3><p>The A7R V is a pretty darn competent video camera if you understand its limitations. It now offers 8K at up to 24/25 fps, 4K 60p and 10-bit 4:2:2 video with S-Log3, S-Cinetone and HDR formats. The A7R IV had none of those features, so it’s quite a step up.</p><figure><img alt="Sony A7R V mirrorless full-frame camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/76f7e7c0-a941-11ed-8e37-5295e9aeda88" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>There are some asterisks, though. The 8K video has a 1.24 times crop, while 4K 60p has a 1.24 times crop with pixel binning. 4K 30p video is uncropped, but also uses pixel binning. The only way to get supersampled video is with a 1.5 times APS-C crop. That, however, is limited to 30 fps. 120 fps video is only available at 1080p.</p><p>That said, Sony has done a good job with the pixel binning, so it doesn’t look significantly less sharp than the APS-C video supersampled from 6.2K.</p><p>Now that it supports 10-bit capture, the S-Log3 video is far more useful than on the A7R IV. You’ll see less banding once you grade it, and the 15 stops of dynamic range give you extra room to push blacks, pull back highlights and tweak colors. As with photos, hues are natural and accurate, and the A7R V is decent but not awesome for video in low light.</p><p>The A7R V now has the best video autofocus system, too. It’s nearly foolproof, locking onto subjects quickly and accurately even in chaotic circumstances. Shooting one scene with three people, it stayed locked onto the main subject even after he moved positions around the frame. All the AI features mentioned for photos work for video, so it can track animals and other subjects nearly as well as humans.</p><figure><img alt="Sony A7R V camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/566c43a1-a871-11ed-bbdf-ed2954fb115a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The updated stabilization isn’t nearly as good for video as for photos. It’s good for handheld video if you don’t move around, nicely smoothing out any hand shake or small motions. However, any rapid movements or walking will cause jolts that mar the video. Panasonic’s new S5 II is much better in this regard.</p><p>You might be thinking at this point that the A7R V is actually a solid video option, but it’s held back by one thing: excessive rolling shutter. It’s particularly bad at 8K and full-frame 4K, with any camera movement setting off a jello-like effect. The best case scenario is in APS-C mode, but you’ll still need to be careful not to whip the camera around.</p><p>Still, the A7R V is fine for most video shooting. If you’re mainly looking to shoot video, though, I’d get another camera. For instance, Canon’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canons-eos-r-5-c-offers-8-k-video-and-45-megapixel-photos-with-no-cooling-issues-090819863.html">EOS R5c</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-9-mirrorless-camera-review-143006924.html">Nikon Z9</a> are better, if you need 8K and can tack an extra thousand or two onto your budget. If 4K is fine, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r-6-ii-review-an-excellent-hybrid-camera-with-few-flaws-140005140.html">Canon’s new $2,500 EOS R6 II</a> or the $2,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-launches-its-first-hybrid-autofocus-cameras-the-s-5-ii-and-s-5-i-ix-150053908.html">Panasonic S5 II</a> are better and a lot cheaper.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img alt="Sony A7R V mirrorless full-frame camera review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/7728e2d0-a941-11ed-b787-50818730cc23" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Sony is once again on top of the high-resolution full-frame camera market with $3,900 A7R V.  Image quality and detail are outstanding, autofocus is second to none and the updated video capabilities are a great addition for hybrid shooters.</p><p>As mentioned, Sony’s main rival is the 45-megapixel Canon EOS R5, which offers lower resolution and better video capabilities, but suffers from overheating issues. The 45-megapixel Nikon Z9 is also a more capable video camera, but costs $1,500 more, and Nikon’s $3,000, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z7-ii-review-140054141.html">45-megapixel Z7 II</a> is $500 less but has inferior autofocus and video.</p><p>None of those models come close to matching the A7R V’s resolution, image quality and exceptional AF, though. Given that, plus the massive video improvements, it’s now the best high-resolution full-frame camera on the market, by far.</p>

<p>Samsung's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">flagship phone of 2023 is here</a> – if you don’t count the foldables. The Galaxy S23 Ultra starts at $1,200 and has a big, beautiful OLED screen, better cameras, a new chip for even better performance and some revamped software. And, of course, there’s still a built-in S Pen for all your drawing and note taking. The highlight feature since last year’s S22 Ultra is the new 200MP sensor, which offers more options for advanced content creation. And, with five rear cameras, there are a lot of options.</p><p>In normal use, the S23 Ultra uses 16-to-1 pixel-binning from that huge sensor to help gather more light and produce sharp, colorful images without needing extra-large files. And in most situations, it seemed to produce better-looking photos. According to Engadget’s Sam Rutherford, the S23 Ultra images taken using the default 12MP mode featured more accurate colors and better details than those captured with the sensor's full 200 megapixels. However, this could be the most capable smartphone camera yet.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## NASA picks Blue Origin's New Glenn to fly a science mission to Mars

<p>NASA has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-to-launch-mars-magnetosphere-study-mission">selected Blue Origin's New Glenn</a>, the company's heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle that has yet to go on its first launch, for a science mission to Mars. As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/blue-origin-awarded-its-first-nasa-interplanetary-launch-contract-mars-mission-2023-02-10/?taid=63e5ea4eb4257000019ab5de&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, it's also the company's first interplanetary NASA contract. The mission is called Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers or ESCAPADE, and it was designed to study the planet's magnetosphere using twin spacecraft. NASA is targeting a late 2024 launch for the mission, which means we won't have to wait too long to finally see the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-blue-origin-shows-off-the-engine-and-nose-cone-of-its-reusable-r.html">New Glenn</a> in action — if the Jeff Bezos-owned space corp can prevent further development delays, that is.</p><p>The New Glenn vehicle is the company's answer to SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and other company's heavy-lift vehicles. Blue Origin initially targeted a 2020 date for its first launch — and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-approves-blue-origin-for-future-uncrewed-missions-105530293.html">NASA approved it</a> for future unmanned scientific and exploration missions that year — but the event kept getting pushed back. It was moved to 2021 and then to 2022. By the end of March last year, Jarrett Jones, Blue Origin's SVP for New Glenn, <a href="https://spacenews.com/vulcan-centaur-on-schedule-for-first-launch-in-2022-as-new-glenn-slips/">admitted</a> that the vehicle wasn't going to fly for the first time in 2022 and that the company was in the process of setting a new date.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA has granted Blue Origin the contract for ESCAPADE under the Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/13-companies-to-provide-venture-class-launch-services-for-nasa">VADR</a>) program, which was designed to foster the growth of commercial launch services in the US. The agency intends to use launch vehicles from program participants specifically for &quot;small satellites and Class D payloads&quot; that can tolerate higher risk. In other words, VADR contracts are meant for lower-cost missions. &quot;By using a lower level of mission assurance, and commercial best practices for launching rockets, these highly flexible contracts help broaden access to space through lower launch costs,&quot; NASA said in its announcement of New Glenn's selection.&nbsp;</p><p>The ESCAPADE mission will launch from Space Launch Complex-36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. It will take about 11 months for the mission to reach the red planet. After that, it will take a few more months for the twin spacecraft to reach the orbit ideal for gathering information about the Martian magnetosphere. The data it will provide can help give scientists a better understanding of space weather, so that safeguards could be put in place to better protect astronauts and satellites in our continued exploration of outer space.&nbsp;</p>

## Don’t watch ‘Star Trek: Picard’ season three, it’ll only encourage them

<p><em>The following article contains spoilers for earlier Star Trek properties but doesn’t reveal specific spoilers about Star Trek: Picard season three, not that you should be watching it anyway.</em></p><p>It’s 2034 and Warner Bros. decides it needs to wring more cash out of <em>Friends</em>, the decade defining cultural juggernaut and sitcom behemoth. Imagine what that show would be like; A warm and cozy three-decades-later check-in on characters you know intimately well. After all, you probably spent your formative years watching them mature from young single New Yorkers to a series of families. Maybe it’ll tickle those nostalgia glands, reminding you of when you watched the show with your own family as a kid.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unfortunately, the hotshot creator of the age decided they want to go in a different direction this time. This needs to be a dark and gritty miserycore grief orgy that better reflects our more rough-and-tumble times. After all, TV these days can’t be gentle or comforting, offer escapism or posit a better world, not since Trump, Brexit, Bolonosaro, January 6th and Ukraine. The creative team have got that quote on a poster in their office, the one <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/03/edmund-burkeon-in-action.html">about the</a><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e9ad2987-5a65-49e9-86ef-1c1b3e104038&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Goodreads+Inc&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlOWFkMjk4Ny01YTY1LTQ5ZTktODZlZi0xYzFiM2UxMDQwMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZHJlYWRzLmNvbS9xdW90ZXMvMTg0OTAtd2UtbXVzdC1hbHdheXMtdGFrZS1zaWRlcy1uZXV0cmFsaXR5LWhlbHBzLXRoZS1vcHByZXNzb3ItbmV2ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZmZTYwYTkzLWQ4YjUtNDdhZi1hOWU4LTJlNmIzYTcxZDk2ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWKMNh_qC1CFGCqkSM8ZzBfLwRMzj62G3Io6DF-zTJxt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fquotes%2F18490-we-must-always-take-sides-neutrality-helps-the-oppressor-never">triumph of evil</a>, and they’re not going to sit idly by, they’re taking <em>a stand</em>.</p><p>In the sequel, Rachel’s famous for her wellness TikTok that often makes allusions to “reclaiming” the US as a white ethnostate. Joey lost an arm while filming a movie and is now in prison after a failed heist to pay off his life-ruining medical debt. Monica’s got a crippling adderall addiction and slips away most nights to murder the neighborhood cats and dogs. Everything’s shot in ultra gloomy vision, and there’s no laugh track, jokes or a studio audience, just unrelenting misery.</p><p>This revival is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-star-trek-picard-sdcc-2019.html">dense with references</a> to the <em>Friends</em> backstory as well as the broader <em>Friends</em> universe. Remember that Lisa Kudrow played Phoebe’s twin sister Ursula on <em>Mad About You</em>, right? If not, you better get yourself to Wikipedia to study up. I mean, it won’t be relevant to the plot, but it’s something you remember, so clap, go on, <em>clap</em>.</p><p>You might be wondering why such a project would be allowed to happen, given that it wouldn’t be fun for fans of the original series. Times change, characters age, but you can’t turn a cozy sitcom into <em>Breaking Bad</em> overnight and expect that to be satisfying. You’d hardly think it’d be a big pull for newbie viewers either, who’d probably steer clear if they weren’t already familiar with 236 episodes of intricate backstory. Nostalgia revivals don’t need to be slavish to their source material, but it’s hard to see the appeal for something so grim and unpleasant.</p><p>Apropos of nothing, let’s talk about the third and final season of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn from 'Star Trek: Picard' in the USS Titan transporter room. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d1bf2b50-a7b1-11ed-ad78-e174f88d57f4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Trae Patton / Paramount+</div></figure><p>Season three was sold as something of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-new-york-comic-con-trailer-220919228.html">course correction</a> for <em>Picard</em> after its first two deeply <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-two-premiere-080059051.html">unpopular runs</a>. It ditched all but Raffi from the roster of original characters created for it, and instead pulled in the stars from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-tng-cast-reunion-172119529.html"><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em></a>. As well as the returning Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis and Brent Spiner, we’ll see LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden and Michael Dorn back in action. And, in the six of ten episodes I’ve been permitted to watch under strict embargo, I’d say only one of them feels like the character we know and love.</p><p>Unfortunately, while we have the other <em>TNG</em> stars, the creative team of Executive Producer Alex Kurtzman and showrunner Terry Matalas didn’t bother to grab any of that show’s lightness of tone. <em>Picard</em> remains a grimdark slog, shot on perpetually underlit sets and featuring a succession of increasingly-bleak setpieces. The plot is stretched so thin that the first four episodes turn out to be little more than an extended prologue for the rest. A prologue that could, I should add, have been an efficient, and possibly more enjoyable, hour. The story is so obvious, too, that you’ll be ahead of the characters pretty much non-stop as they stumble from one idiot plot to the next.</p><p>It’s maddening that we can see how much of the plot is blocking itself to ensure things can’t move forward too quickly. There’s a whole episode of <em>gosh-isn’t-this-tense</em> tension that could have been eliminated if anyone in Starfleet pulled out a tricorder and used it as God intended. In this utopian future, where science and technology really are advanced enough to look like magic, why does nobody employ the tools hanging from their waistband? Mostly because Paramount ordered ten episodes, and ten episodes is what we’re going to give them. Another episode has a time-filling punch fight runaround because it’s now somehow impossible for a serving officer to use a Federation ship’s intercom system to call the bridge and warn them of impending danger.</p><p><em>Picard</em> is one of those series where you often find yourself shouting at the screen as the next stupid moment unfolds in front of you. Even worse is that the show’s creative team seem to think that it’s us, the audience, who are deficient in the thinking department. There is scene after scene in which characters repeat the same lines back to each other because the crew assume we’re not paying attention. Because of the limits on spoilers, I’ve re-written a scene to match the sentiment, if not the words verbatim, so you can get a sense of what to expect:</p><p><strong>CREW 1</strong>: The ship is being pulled closer to the black hole’s gravity well.</p><p><strong>CREW 2</strong>: We do not have enough power to pull ourselves away, sir.</p><p><strong>RIKER</strong>: Are you saying that we’re dead in the water?</p><p><strong>CREW 1:</strong> We will be passing the black hole’s event horizon in 17 minutes.</p><p><strong>RIKER</strong>: We’re dead in the water and we’re sinking.</p><p><strong>PICARD</strong>: We’re going to be dead in 17 minutes, Will, unless we can find a way to solve this.</p><p><strong>RIKER</strong>: We’re sinking into quicksand, and there’s no time to grab a helping hand.</p><p>The irony is that this run is so thicket-dense with references that the show basically assumes that you’ve already seen pretty much everything produced during Trek’s gold, silver and bronze ages. But, to make sure nobody’s left behind, everyone has to speak in exposition so hamfisted that, now that this is over, I think Michelle Hurd deserves personal injury compensation. Raffi gets saddled with so many cringe-inducing lines where she states, and restates and re-restates the obvious that I started grasping fistfuls of my own hair to relieve some of my discomfort.</p><p>And as for the storyline, what can I say? It’s clear that Alex Kurtzman is only comfortable writing in a single register. His go-to is usually a militaristic, testosterone-fuelled paranoid Reaganite fantasy in which <em>the real villain was our own government all along</em>. He did it in <em>Into Darkness</em>, <em>Discovery</em> season two and even the first season of<em> Picard</em> – to the point where Starfleet is now so lousy with double agents that all of their schemes fail because the saboteurs are all too busy sabotaging each other’s plans instead of that of the wider Federation.</p><p>If <em>Picard</em> is nothing else, it’s nearly pornographic in its use and misuse of franchise iconography. I always felt that Jeff Russo’s Picard theme sounded more like the library music for a corporate advert than the makes-your-heart-soar theme a Star Trek deserves. And here, it’s been ditched in favor of Jerry Goldsmith’s sumptuous, nectar-for-the-ears score for <em>First Contact</em>. The first title card is a direct pull from <em>Wrath of Khan</em>, and pretty much every element therein is an elbow to the ribs, reminding you of older, better Star Trek movies and TV series.</p><p>An early scene has a character “hijacking a starship” under false pretenses while it’s in spacedock. You know, the mushroom-shaped megastation orbiting Earth from <em>The Search for Spock </em>onwards. And because we’re already going beat-for-beat for a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ta0ozLS0ySzd5byIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmZlNjBhOTMtZDhiNS00N2FmLWE5ZTgtMmU2YjNhNzFkOTZlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAY1mUjMN6LJe3CTrS8aiGXhWeYE2S27bp31uM2Y91B3X&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmkJ3--2K7yo">sequence xeroxed from 1984</a>, said starship even jumps to warp as soon as it’s past the exit doors. Despite the fact that the sort of hardcore Trek fans who would spot the reference would also note that you’re not meant to jump to warp while inside a solar system when there’s no urgent need to do so.</p><p>I’ll admit, this is postgraduate degree-level Star Trek nerdery, but you can’t have it both ways: If you’re trying to placate hostile viewers with the excessive fan service, you can’t then complain when they point out that you’re doing it all wrong.</p><div id="6405530a46d64f5b8aa5eca09ce5e752"></div><p>The show’s teaser trailer already revealed we’re getting an overstuffed roster of villains to round out the run. Amanda Plummer’s captain of an enemy ship that shares a design with the Narada from Star Trek ‘09. Then there’s Daniel Davis’ holographic Professor Moriarty, as well as Data’s evil twin brother Lore. Both of these sorta make sense in the context, but there’s a hell of a lot of narrative scaffolding to explain away the fact that Brent Spiner is now 74 years old. (The dude looks good for it, but it’s hard to play an ageless android when time marches on and the de-aging CGI budget is spent on smoothing out Patrick Stewart’s face for a single flashback and the pointless needle-drops that open every episode.)</p><p>Now, before you scurry off to Memory Alpha to confirm that <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/James_Moriarty_(hologram)">Moriarty</a><em>was</em> locked away in a holobox at the end of “Ship in a Bottle,” and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lore">Lore</a><em>was</em> disassembled at the end of “Descent Part 2,” yes, they were. Try to remember that showrunner Terry Matalas and executive producer Alex Kurtzman treat Star Trek’s continuity less as something which informs storytelling and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-two-episode-four-130017595.html">more as a series of shiny objects to keep us all amused</a> when the plot sags or anyone has any time to think about what’s going on.</p><p>I’ll also add that the trailers and promotional material have very intentionally kept a lot of material back. There are more classic-era heroes and villains crowbarring their way into the story in the way that, if it were fanfiction, would seem excessive. But, if I’m honest, the second or third time someone, or something, familiar popped up, I wasn’t whooping and cheering, I was sighing. The Star Trek universe is vast and broad and deep, but <em>Picard</em> makes it feel like a puddle where everyone knows each other, and everyone under the age of 30 has grown up watching <em>The Next Generation</em>. If you’re serving in the US Navy, for instance, how likely is it that you’d know the ins and outs of every exploit of even the most well-traveled combat vessel?</p><p>Now, I don’t have the language or experience to discuss this properly, and I’m aware of others <a href="https://intl.startrek.com/news/i-grew-up-with-a-mom-like-raffi">who do feel differently</a>. This is just my opinion, but I think the depiction of drug and alcohol use in <em>Picard</em> has always felt <em>off</em>. And since I can’t talk about the third season, I’ll talk about the first, where something very similar happened and is just as vexing here as it was back then. Raffi deals with her son’s rejection by relapsing, but then mere hours later, she’s back at her station and advancing the plot. I don’t recall a sense that her use clouded her judgment and I don’t think it was discussed subsequently – so despite the portentiousness in the build-up, it was depicted almost like someone just having a bad day and knocking back some drinks. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, because there are plenty of people who use drugs and it doesn’t impact their professional lives at all. (Read any Making-Of book about <em>The Original Series</em> and you'll notice how more than a few references to the production team's drug use.)  But if you’re going to write a plot where scenes hang on the will-she-or-won’t-she tension of relapse, but it all turns out to be hunky dory straight after, what was the point of depicting any of this in the first place?</p><p>Then there’s the violence, and the casual way that it’s doled out, especially in the show’s numerous interrogation scenes. I’m not advocating for forced confessions, but given Starfleet’s advanced science, and the Federation has a planet of literal telepaths at its disposal, why are we always punching people in the nose with a butt of a phaser pistol? I mean, I know why: It’s a nerdy sci-fi show play acting as a muscular basic-cable drama, but that doesn’t mean <em>it works</em>. I’ve often theorized that many modern-day Star Trek creators would much rather be over the hall making their own Star War instead. Maybe I’m wrong, and the <em>Picard</em> crew is really nostalgic for the hamfisted Bush-era politics of<em> 24</em>.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Amanda Plummer and some aliens in a dark corridor in an unnamed location during 'Star Trek: Picard's third season" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/55e95b40-a7b1-11ed-8f3f-465e23db4073" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Trae Patton / Paramount+</div></figure><p>It was always going to be hard to pull <em>Picard</em> out of its creative slump that started back when the show was greenlit. If there was ever a character who we’d seen grow, change, mature and treat his own life with more kindness, it was Jean-Luc Picard. Some of <em>TNG’s</em> best episodes forced Picard to consider his own life, his history, his mortality, his motives, including the series’ grand finale. “All Good Things” isn’t just good Star Trek, it’s one of the best series finales ever made, encompassing the entire breadth and depth of <em>The Next Generation</em> in one glorious sweep. And between seven years of TV and four less essential but still important movies, he was <em>done</em>.</p><p>I wrote somewhere, I forget where, that a smarter idea would have been to center the action on a less-well served member of the Enterprise D crew. I’d have been second in line to watch a Geordi LaForge spin-off (behind uber fan Rihanna, of course), and there’s plenty to explore there. Or a Beverley Crusher spin-off, as she solves people’s problems as a simple <del>country</del> space doctor back on Earth or on some far-flung planet. Maybe a sci-fi version of <em>In Treatment</em> fronted by Marina Sirtis could have worked, and would have certainly <em>cost</em> less than this.</p><p>All of which would be preferable to what we got, which despite initially having a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist at the helm, was two years of go-nowhere, do-nothing bore-a-thons. Its brief moments of cleverness drowned out by the baffling character decisions, tin-eared dialog and ligneous acting. And both had plots which would have struggled to fill a movie stretched out across a painfully slow ten hour runtime.</p><p>And that’s before we get to the moralizing, which had characters pointing at a bad thing and saying “thing bad.” I don’t think the second season’s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star_trek_picard/s02">26 percent rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes is because the (inexplicably) conservative wing of Trek fandom was outraged that a show about <em>happy space communists solving problems while remaining friends</em> suddenly “got woke.” Good, old-fashioned Star Trek at least had the good grace to cloak its progressivism in allegory that could slide past the otherwise closed minds of some of its viewers. By comparison, Picard felt like the first draft of a high school theater production made the term after the teacher had explained agitprop.</p><p>Maybe that’s why I feel so annoyed by <em>Picard</em>, because all of the things that are wrong with the show, and its kin, are examples of amateurishness. Amateurish plotting, amateurish dialogue, a lack of thoughtfulness about the material, what it says, or what it’s doing. Just an endless parade of big, dumb, brash, po-faced melodrama used in place of some sort of maturity or integrity. I don’t expect Star Trek to be brilliant all the damn time, but I do expect a minimum standard of <em>something</em> to be upheld. And this falls so far below it, it’s hard to call it Star Trek. Some people will call that gatekeeping, but Star Trek can be anything it damn well wants to be, so long as it's competently made and halfway entertaining.&nbsp;</p><p>The constant callbacks got me thinking about the period when Nicholas Meyer was, directly or indirectly, the major creative force behind Star Trek. It’s been 32 years since his 1991 swansong, <em>The Undiscovered Country</em>, and it remains a high-water mark of cinematic Trek. Drawing to a close the story of <em>The Original Series</em> crew, Meyer didn’t go for nostalgia, but savaged his characters, exposing their flaws, their bigotries, their failings. There was redemption, and heart, and it never needed Meyer to stage endless close-quarters phaser-fu fights in unlight rooms.</p><p>But that was a filmmaker with a clear vision, and the good graces to really drag his characters in the dirt before washing them clean. Imagine what would happen if Picard encountered any of the same level of subtext – they’d probably spend an hour running from it before beating it over the head with the butt of a phaser rifle and then spend the next hour feeling glum about it. If nothing else, I’d say don’t even watch <em>Picard</em> for ironic kicks, lest Paramount think it’s somehow a runaway hit and continue to produce crap like this.</p>

## Reddit was hacked in a phishing attack targeting its employees

<p>A Reddit employee's credentials were stolen in a targeted phishing attack, an administrator for the website has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/10y427y/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_we_know/">revealed</a>, and hackers were able to infiltrate its systems on February 5th. Apparently, Reddit employees had been receiving &quot;plausible-sounding prompts,&quot; which lead to a website that mimic the looks and behavior of its intranet gateway, designed as such to steal people's logins and second-factor tokens. While one employee did fall for the scheme, they immediately self-reported. That allowed the website's security team to respond quickly and to cut off the infiltrators' access.</p><p>The Reddit spokesperson said the bad actors were able to access some of the website's &quot;internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems.&quot; Contact information for hundreds of company contracts, current and former employees, as well as some advertisers were also exposed. They assured users, however, that the security team investigating the incident has found no evidence that their passwords or any of their non-public data have been compromised. The team also didn't find evidence that the information stolen from Reddit has been distributed online — at least, at this point in the investigation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reddit's spokesperson said the website is &quot;continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely.&quot; They also said that lessons they learned from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-01-reddit-hacker-snagged-email-addresses-old-passwords.html">a security breach five years ago</a> continue to be useful. If the attackers were only truly able to steal some non-user information this time, the 2018 breach was a much more serious incident. Back then, bad actors were able to grab users' current email addresses, as well as a database backup from 2007 that contained account passwords.</p>
