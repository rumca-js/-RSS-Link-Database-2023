As someone who has never enjoyed working with frontend JS frameworks (yes, I sucked it up and learned them and have worked with them professionally) I'm wondering who all the companies are who have embraced the semi-recent \"HTML over the wire\" movement (Can you imagine... using hyper text transfer protocol for transferring hyper text?  Seems nuts, I know).  It's a massive slog shifting through endless React/Vue/etc-focused jobs out there.  Even if you use React in small areas where it pulls its weight but generally try and stick to simplicity of sending plain ol' HTML, I'd love to know who you are.

Not to mention the stupid paywall which is infuriating.<p>Why did Medium end up like this? In the beginning it was pretty good but then it started to wither. Is there any way for a platform like Medium to keep up with high quality posts while also paying their writers well?<p>Substack has done a good job at competing in the blogging market but it's different from Medium. Medium is more of a social blogging platform while Substack is more of a newsletter platform. Substack doesn't have an algorithm that recommends you content, but instead shows you exactly who you follow. This is nice, but I can't deny that I also like finding new content through a recommendation engine, which Medium <i>also</i> sucks at.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

more readable, add types, etc.<p>This inspired me: what if there was an extension that could use AI to make your code worse as well?<p>Meet Spaghettify. An extension I developed that can do things like:<p>- Obscure your code<p>- Introduce a bug<p>- Make the variable names way too descriptive<p>- Use nonsymmetrical whitespace<p>- Add irrelevant/rambling comments<p>- Document the code with emoji<p>- Document the code in any style (Dirty Limerick, Fast Talkin' 1930s Gangster)<p>I built this extension over the last couple of days and released it in collaboration with BCAD.one. It's available on the VSCode Marketplace, you will need an OpenAI API Key to use it. You can grab it here:<p>(<a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BCAD.spaghettify\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BCAD.spa...</a>)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34740529\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34740529</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "link": "https://www.spaghettify.dev/", "date_published": "2023-02-10 15:03:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Dslcad a programming language and interpreter for building 3D models", "description": "<p>Hey HN.\nOver the last half a year I have been working on a 3D CAD programming language called DSLCAD.

You must go through a third company (consulting firm/body shop) which we work with.\"<p>But why the heck would I even consider doing that? The whole point of freelancing (at least IMO) is being _free_ from the middlemen.<p>Anyway, humoring the idea of actually doing that I contacted one of these middlemen companies and was sent a hideous contract full of terms that -let's put it mildly- are not in my favor. (Liabilities fully on me, limitations on where I can go afterwards, Information asymmetry, need to support for long after project finish, etc).<p>So the question remains - is there any real freelancing still on? (I'm not talking platforms here - I wouldn't go there for several reasons).<p>Could it be that the specific market I've been looking at (UK/IE) is skewed like that and other markets are in better

We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"http://meticulous.ai/\">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You\u2019ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr
