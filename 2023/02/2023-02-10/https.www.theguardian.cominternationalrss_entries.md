<p>His Meghan Markle column might have been unrelentingly horrible, but Jeremy Clarkson is portraying himself as a mildly irascible bumbler again – and he’s disconcertingly good at it</p><p>It would be too much to say Jeremy Clarkson is complex, or an enigma. He does not contain multitudes. But he does have the disarming ability to present different versions of himself. At one end of the Clarkson spectrum is the rightwing bully columnist, bigoted in print and serially unpleasant in person; at the other is the presenter of Clarkson’s Farm (Prime Video), a perfectly agreeable celebrity-out-of-their-depth reality show, documenting Jeremy’s chaotic efforts to turn 1,000 acres (405 hectares) of Oxfordshire into a profitable concern.</p><p>The unobjectionable first season softened Clarkson’s reputation, but the second one arrives amid a lingering hubbub of outrage. A few weeks before the new episodes’ release, Bad Clarkson, horns aglow, spoiled Slightly Less Bad Clarkson’s moment by writing an article about his irrational loathing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/16/i-apologised-to-harry-and-meghan-says-jeremy-clarkson">Meghan Markle that was so horrible</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/21/the-sun-jeremy-clarkson-women-media">the Sun took it off their website</a>.

Wales and Scotland are also in the process of settling with their health workers. That leaves those in charge of services in England left looking even more obstinate, unreasonable and ideologically fixated.</p><p>The GMB’s public services national secretary, Rachel Harrison, yesterday morning told me that the offer to the fire brigades was “massive” and said that if her ambulance workers and other strikers were offered that, “we’d definitely suspend action and call it off immediately”. Members would have to decide, but the view around the unions yesterday was that a similar deal would settle these strikes.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/10/uk-government-strikes-pay-bodies-striking-workers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After months of debate and diplomacy, western tanks are finally heading to Ukraine for what promises to be a spring escalation in the fighting. But will they be decisive? Dan Sabbagh and Daniel Boffey report</p><p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy made an unannounced visit to London this week to rally support behind Ukraine before what is expected to be a major escalation in fighting in the coming weeks. He called on Britain to supply his forces with fighter jets to help defeat the Russian invasion. But while Rishi Sunak was non-committal on planes, the western coalition has made a significant breakthrough on the other big request from Zelensky: modern tanks.</p><p>The Guardian’s defence and security editor, <strong>Dan Sabbagh,</strong> is in eastern Ukraine and tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal </strong>that as the battlefield thaws, the war is likely to escalate quickly and the race is now on to get those western tanks into service. It’s not simple though: the tanks are more complex to operate than the ones Ukraine’s army are used to. And they rely on different supply chains for parts and ammunition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/feb/10/could-western-tanks-be-decisive-in-ukraine-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this series, Guardian writers share the best advice they’ve ever received and how it’s impacted their lives since</p><p>My grandfather was a prolific collector of aphorisms and inspirational quotes. “Failing to plan is planning to fail” is tattooed on the brains of my entire family, he said it so much. But it was one poem (of the many) he often recited about self-belief that has really stayed with me.</p><p>If you think you are beaten, you are<br />If you think you dare not, you don’t<br />If you’d like to win, but think you can’t<br />It is almost a cinch you won’t.</p><p>If you think you’ll lose, you’ve lost<br />For out in this world we find<br />Success begins with a fellow’s will<br />It’s all in the state of mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/10/my-grandfather-was-quick-with-advice-but-its-a-poem-about-self-belief-that-stayed-with-me">Continue reading...</a>

The lamp heads weighed up to 15kg (33lb), he said – about equivalent to a bulk sack of rice, full-grown border collie or a microwave oven. They were falling from heights of 4-6m.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/10/wellington-falling-street-lights-lamps-new-zealand">Continue reading...</a>
