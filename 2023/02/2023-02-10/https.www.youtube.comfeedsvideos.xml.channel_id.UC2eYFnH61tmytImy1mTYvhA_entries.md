You should know that when you "delete" a file on your computer in your operating system, whether Linux, Windows or Mac, the file is not *really* deleted or overwritten until the space is needed for new data. This is beneficial when you accidentally delete a file, but is dangerous when you "delete" a sensitive file and falsely feel like you're safe.

Linux has the command `shred` which overwrites files with random data, which solves this issue. You can also output /dev/urandom or /dev/zero to blank or distort empty space on a drive.

Even in the case of encrypted drives, it's a good idea to use /dev/urandom or obscure unused or previously used space to prevent metadata leakage about how much you've stored on the drive or what used to be on it, in a way that could tie you to an important USB drive or computer.
