While not every single repeating puzzle is complicated to complete, a few can be a bit confusing if you aren't sure which spell to use. Some of them are even locked until you progress further in the story, so you might have found one of these puzzles, but can't complete it yet. Here is every type of recurring puzzle in Hogwarts Legacy and how to complete them.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Moth Mirrors</h2><figure style=\"width: 3840px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4097988-mothmirror.png\"><img alt=\"After casting Lumos, Moth Mirrors show the location of the missing moth.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4097988-mothmirror.png\" /></a><figcaption>After casting Lumos, Moth Mirrors show the location of the missing moth.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Moth Mirrors are blank metallic mirrors with a series of moth ornaments around the edges. To complete these puzzles you must cast Lumos on the mirror. This will reveal a different location in the mirror, usually somewhere nearby. You must navigate to the area shown in the image, where you will find a moth. If Lumos is still active, the moth will follow you. Lead it back to the mirror and cancel Lumos to have the moth return to the mirror, completing the puzzle.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Symbol Doors</h2><figure style=\"width: 3840px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4097989-symboldoor.png\"><img alt=\"Symbol doors require a bit of math.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4097989-symboldoor.png\" /></a><figcaption>Symbol doors require a bit of math.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Symbol Doors have a series of images around the door frame and two math puzzles on the door itself, that are revealed when you interact with the door.

Lakeburg Legacies is a medieval village management sim that allows players to also be their town's matchmaker. In order to build your village up and farm resources--all things found in your typical town management sim--you have to successfully wed your townsfolk to nearby settlers or other villagers and encourage them to get to baby-makin'. The wooing process requires you pay attention to what the couples' likes and dislikes are, and ensure they get through three successful dates with their potential partner. After all, it might be hard for someone who loves kittens and is anti-war to hit it off with someone who enjoys public executions. Additionally, a bigger village can lead to bigger drama, including dramatic divorces and interactions where you must carefully decide the fate of your citizens. Lakeburg Legacies is the spiritual successor to The Sims Medieval I have been waiting for, and it's incredible.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/7-cozy-steam-next-fest-game-demos-to-snuggle-up-with-this-weekend/1100-6511434/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/7-cozy-steam-next-fest-game-demos-to-snuggle-up-with-this-weekend/1100-6511434/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-10 21:20:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Hogwarts Legacy - All Vivarium Biomes And Upgrades Guide", "description": "<p>Hogwarts Legacy allows you to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beasts-vivarium-capture-tame-guide/1100-6511394/\">capture and tame</a> dozens of magical creatures. However, you'll soon find out that the space in your <strong>Vivarium</strong>, a sanctuary for animals in the Room of Requirement, is quite limited. Thankfully, there's a way to remedy the issue somewhat, though it's going to take quite a bit of progression. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you unlock all Vivarium biomes. These are, technically, the only way to upgrade the game's Vivarium mechanic.</p><h2>Unlocking Vivarium biomes in the campaign</h2><p>Just a quick recap: The default Vivarium in Hogwarts Legacy has space for 12 animals, but you're only allowed a maximum of 4 different species. As such, if a biome already has a Unicorn, Hippogriff, Thestral, and Puffskein, you won't be able to add something else, like a Giant Toad.</p><p>That means the only method to acquire a Vivarium upgrade is to unlock an entirely different biome altogether. This is done by completing Deek's sidequest arc.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-vivarium-biomes-upgrades-guide/1100-6511437/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-vivarium-biomes-upgrades-guide/1100-6511437/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-10 21:19:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "How To Breed Animals And Beasts In Hogwarts Legacy", "description": "<p>If you like catching animals in various games, then you'll likely do the same in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/\">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.

Still, if you progress further in the campaign, you'll unlock a method that allows your animals to have their own offspring. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you breed your Beasts and animals in the Vivarium.</p><h2>Foal of the Dead quest: The breeding mechanic</h2><p>To start breeding magical creatures in Hogwarts Legacy, you'll need to complete Plight of a House Elf and Charles Rookwood's Trial.

This patch will fine-tune their presentation and hopefully make the changes, up or down, easier to understand.

According to 343 Industries, dropping weapons had become standard practice in competitive Halo and players had been expressing concerns about how often weapons were dropped.

That's how the game presents itself at first, until a pitch-perfect fake-out ending gives way to a completely different game type entirely. Donkey Kong GB is lengthy puzzle-platformer full of traps, and the predecessor to later games like March of the Minis. It's one of the best, constantly surprising games in the entire Game Boy library, and absolutely deserves a spot in the Switch collection. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: NintendoComplete on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mario Tennis (Game Boy Color)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097960-inkovicdoeslp.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Mario Tennis series has been one of Nintendo's longest-running spin-offs, but most of the attention has been on the console games through the years. One shining diamond in the rough--or clay, as it were--is the Game Boy Color's Mario Tennis. Part sports game and part role-playing game, the main mode barely features any Mario characters at all, instead focusing on a new tennis academy student named Alex as he learns the sports' basics and climbs up the ladder. Disappointing as the lack of Mario may seem at first, Mario Tennis on Game Boy Color is shockingly good, with great and relatively simple tennis mechanics that players of all ages can enjoy. That soundtrack also goes hard as hell for no reason, which is just an added bonus. <em>-- Gabe Gurwin</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: inkovicdoeslp on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mega Man 5 (Game Boy)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097963-nintendocomplete-mm5.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mega Man was a bona fide action star on the NES, but his Game Boy offerings were essentially just bite-sized ports that approximated them for Mega Man fans on the go. Mega Man 5 was the lone exception, breaking the mold and making its own unique Mega Man game that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the best in the series. Part of this identity change was swapping the usual variety of bosses like Frog Man and Gemini Man for a single unified theme. The Stardroids were named after celestial bodies like Pluto and Mars, which made it tougher to guess their rock-paper-scissors weaknesses. The level design was clever and challenging while feeling correctly scoped for the Game Boy's specs. It's a gem of a Mega Man game and should be the one to make it onto Nintendo Switch, if any of them do. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: NintendoComplete on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Super Mario Land (Game Boy)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097961-loganbenjamin.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Holding the dubious honor of the absolutely strangest mainline Mario game, Super Mario Land hails from an era when Nintendo hadn't quite nailed down what a Mario game even was. This was just a year after the company rebranded Doki Doki Panic as Super Mario Bros. 2 in the West. That uncertainty shows through in Super Mario Land, which features an absolutely itty-bitty Mario with a sense of weight and momentum that feels even heavier than the original Super Mario Bros. The game is full of odd settings and enemies, from Koopa-Troopa-like enemies who drop bombs when they die to giant Easter Island heads. Mario pilots a submarine and a fighter jet, and the boss of the whole affair is a space alien. It's not the best Mario game, but it is interesting in its weirdness, and more people should get to experience why. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: Logan Benjamin on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (Game Boy Advance)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097956-worldoflongplays-fft.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Final Fantasy Tactics on the PlayStation was an opus of strategy game design and sharp, operatic storytelling. I was a huge fan of FFT, which had the unfortunate side effect of making me disappointed in the Game Boy Advance spin-offs. Their stories were simpler and their battles were generally smaller in scope. That said, with the benefit of hindsight I can say I didn't give these a fair shake. They were something different than I expected, but by all accounts they were solid bite-sized tactical experiences. The new Judge mechanic provides some clever twists by placing constraints on a battle, forcing you to think differently about your approach. And their art style was especially vibrant and colorful, taking full advantage of the GBA's bright palette. I'd love to see these again, in part so I can give them the reevaluation they deserve. <em>-- Steve Watts</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: World of Longplays on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones (Game Boy Advance)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097959-bigklingy.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Fire Emblem series' first Western release--just called Fire Emblem over here--was a great introduction to the tactical-RPG franchise, but it was the next game that really showed its true potential. Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones took the same basic framework of the previous game but introduced a new level of player-choice, letting you pick different upgrade paths for the various characters and even choosing to accompany one of two twins in their perilous journey. By the modern games' standards, it's brutally difficult, and it lacks the \"casual\" no-permadeath setting we expect these days, but Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is such a well-designed strategy gem that it demands inclusion on Nintendo Switch Online. <em>-- Gabe Gurwin</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: BigKlingy on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords (Game Boy Advance)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097970-screenshot2023-02-10at5.14.03pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing needs to be said in favor of A Link to the Past, but both because its quality is unquestioned and because the original SNES version is already available through Switch Online. But the Four Swords version released for GBA included not just that game, but an entirely new one, which, as the name suggests, represented Nintendo's first foray into multiplayer Zelda. (It also featured an additional unlockable dungeon in A Link to the Past.) But despite this notable status, it's a game largely lost to time--good luck finding multiple other people with access to the game and necessary hardware to play together in-person. Briefly available DSiWare and 3DS eShop versions can no longer be obtained, so Switch Online, with the added benefit of permitting easy online multiplayer support, would be a great way to provide access to this forgotten gem. And with any luck, that can help to eventually tee up Switch Online support for GameCube games and Four Swords' sequel, Four Swords Adventure. <em>-- Chris Pereira</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: WiiLikeToPlay on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metal Slug Advance (Game Boy Advance)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097957-worldoflongplays-metalslug.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">You can never have enough Metal Slug, so I'd be happy to see Metal Slug Advance join the NSO library. While GBA was home to many ports of things like Mario games, Metal Slug Advance was an entirely original entry. It maintains the basic Metal Slug formula and look, but it introduced things like a health meter and collectible cards, the latter of which added a high level of optional difficulty--they can be collected during a level, but you need to avoid dying for the remainder of it in order to successfully claim it. Doing so oftentimes served only as an achievement for managing this (no easy feat, as decades of playing Metal Slug games have made me no less terrible at them), but some also unlocked permanent upgrades. As with several of the other games I've nominated here, Metal Slug lends itself to relatively short play sessions that I find ideal for Switch Online, but I certainly wouldn't mind having access to its Rewind feature to help me finally see my way through all of Metal Slug Advance. <em>-- Chris Pereira</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: World of Longplays on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rhythm Tengoku (Game Boy Advance)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097958-a425.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">I admit, I'm calling for Rhythm Tengoku to be added despite never having played it. The first entry in what would later be known as the Rhythm Heaven series, Rhythm Tengoku was never released outside of Japan. (Shockingly, it's a GBA game released in 2006, almost two full years after the Nintendo DS launched.) As such, bringing it to Switch Online would be a great opportunity to offer the game to a brand-new audience, even if some of its content may have later ended up in the 3DS's Rhythm Heaven Megamix. It's not entirely dissimilar from the aforementioned WarioWare, offering a series of minigames with oftentimes silly premises, but with a rhythm-centric hook to the goal of what you set out to accomplish.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As much as I appreciate having great, longer experiences like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga available on Switch Online, more often than not when I turn to the classic games catalog on Switch, I'm looking for a quick fix. Games like Rhythm Tengoku where you can jump in, play a level, and be done in a few minutes are the ideal match for what I want out of the service. <em>-- Chris Pereira</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: A425 on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>WarioWare: Twisted (Game Boy Advance)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4097962-mariofan98longplays.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The initial batch of GBA games on Switch Online thankfully includes one WarioWare game, but why not more? Twisted was another GBA gem, thanks not just to the timeless WarioWare formula--a rapid series of \"microgames\" that last only a few seconds and have you doing things like catching objects or picking your nose--but the novelty of its unique gameplay. As its name suggests, Twisted often revolved around twisting the system in your hands to interact with it, made possible by a built-in gyro sensor. It was like very little else at the time, and with the recent WarioWare games centering around button-based controls, it would be fun to mix up the formula with what Twisted brought to the table. You can never have enough WarioWare, and fleshing out the catalog would keep me coming back--and subscribing--to Switch Online for a long time. <em>-- Chris Pereira</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Image: Mariofan98 Longplays on YouTube)</em></p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-boy-and-gba-games-that-should-come-to-switch-online/2900-4639/", "date_published": "2023-02-10 20:28:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Bungie Raises $200,000 In 24 Hours For Earthquake Relief In Turkey And Syria", "description": "<p>Destiny developer Bungie has raised more than $200,000 in just 24 hours for earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria as the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-politics-earthquakes-turkey-syria-e9a69f7909a37aff392d570fc4259cac\">devastating natural disaster's death toll passes 20,000</a>.</p><p>Bungie is raising funds through its Bungie Foundation charity.

In the original Destiny, it was the raids, pinnacle six-player activities that challenged your patience, game sense, loadout, and team communication. The barrier for raids was so high that it was a frustrating pain point for many players, with many on social media lamenting that they felt like they couldn't ever run one. Thankfully, now the endgame is quite robust and varied, with multiple options of three-player and six-player activities that can be both exciting and challenging.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With dungeons, Grandmaster Nightfalls, and countless other Legendary activities, there's an opportunity for a larger portion of the player base to engage with the endgame and the rewards it has to offer. This is great for players who don't have a team of six always ready to go, and each endgame activity has its own merits, but the raids truly stand head and shoulders above all else unless you're a PvP fanatic. Tweaks to raids over Destiny 2's lifetime, such as introducing Triumph Seals and craftable raid weapons with Ability 3.0-friendly perks (Incandescent, Repulsor Brace, Voltshot), make them all the more compelling.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-destiny-2s-lfg/1100-6511432/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-destiny-2s-lfg/1100-6511432/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-10 19:51:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Winnie The Pooh: Blood And Honey Director On Turning Beloved Childhood Characters Into Bloodthirsty Monsters", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Elevated horror is so 2018.

Thanks to a combination of Hollywood's hunger for franchise properties and games developing more sophisticated storytelling techniques, games have actually developed into a fertile ground for TV and movie adaptations. Right now, games as diverse as Mass Effect, Days Gone, and Fallout are all in some stage of development with adaptations on the way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Castlevania and Arcane were very successful animated adaptations of popular game franchises, and now HBO has a prestige hit on its hands with The Last of Us. The Naughty Dog game was already very cinematic in its presentation and revered as one of the best stories in video games, so it seemed primed for a TV adaptation like few other franchises. We wondered what other games could be turned into smash TV series. Lots of games could lend themselves to the TV format if handled with care. Here's our picks for the games best suited for TV adaptations.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Plague Tale</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092195-3989812-plague.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A period story with fantasy elements, the A Plague Tale series is virtually ready-made for a big-budget serialized TV series. The slow unfurling mystery of Hugo's powers would provide a through-line to draw viewers back week after week, and the swarms of carnivorous rats can provide visceral scares for TV-MA audiences. More than most series, this one would live or die by casting the leads. Amicia and Hugo need to be played by charismatic actors with good sibling chemistry, especially as the protective big-sister dynamic also explores elements of horror and self-doubt. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Control</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092196-3519466-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The X-Files and Fringe showed what an episodic paranormal sci-fi series can be, and Control could easily follow in those footsteps. The world-building of Control would be the star here, exploring the ins and outs of working for the Bureau of Control. The game itself implied so much about the day-to-day work of these mid-level G-men trying their best to get their arms around otherworldly threats. The story wouldn't even need to replicate the game, exactly. Instead, it could treat the confrontation with the Hiss and Jesse's ascension to Bureau Director as the pilot or backstory, opening narrative possibilities as she explores her new role. As a bonus, this could easily segue into an Alan Wake spin-off or crossover.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deathloop</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092197-3879273-4057229013-38173.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The pitch for the game already took liberal notes from Hollywood--it's a '70s spy thriller meets Groundhog Day--so transitioning this Arkane game back to the screen would take a subtle touch. To serialize it, showrunners could take notes from mystery-driven shows like Lost and The Leftovers, slowly teasing out the central mysteries while exploring the fish-out-of-water story of Cole repeating his loop. The repeating nature would give the show lots of room to toy with different levels of scale too, speeding through several loops in one episode and slowing down to show just one loop--or even just part of one loop--for another full episode.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Diablo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092198-3456934-diablo-3-eternal-collection-review-thumb-nologo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This dungeon-crawling series keeps audiences engaged for years with a grind for epic loot, but the show would rely more on its decades of world-building. A supernatural fantasy series revolving around the last bastion of human adventurers holding the line against a demonic scourge just below the surface is fertile ground for an action-adventure series or a movie akin to the upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons film. The franchise's unique take on heavenly beings--who are not necessarily the bastions of goodness as usually depicted--would add a further factional wrinkle to the struggle to protect our realm.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Into the Breach</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092199-3356844-into-the-breach-review-thumb-nologo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Mechs vs. Monsters is a classic trope explored in many kaiju series. Into the Breach plays in this space, but what sets it apart is that it also adds a time-travel element to the mix. In the game you're hopping between timelines to avert a disaster of the invading Vex attempting to destroy human infrastructure. A show could explore this reality-bending concept even further with overlapping realities, alternate timelines, and heady concepts that reward multiple rewatches. Think Primer meets Pacific Rim.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metroid</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092200-3285745-msr_wallpaper.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Lots of Nintendo's classic franchises feature silent protagonists, which can present challenges when adapting to the screen. Metroid, though, could get by with charismatic Samus Aran in the lead, setting the stage for a moody sci-fi series with light horror elements. A loose adaptation of the first three Metroid games, culminating in the baby Metroid's heroic sacrifice, would make for a satisfying season, but the show could also take a more expansive approach by exploring Samus' life as a lone bounty hunter and the last surviving remnant of the Chozo.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mirror's Edge</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092201-2988608-mirrors-edge-catalyst-game-wallpaper.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This franchise has the dubious distinction of commercially flopping not once but twice, but hear us out. A small-screen adaptation would lean on the sparse, high-contrast art style to produce a very different kind of paranoid spy thriller. We don't see many hyper-clean dystopias like the one in Mirror's Edge, and the acrobatic Runners use information as their weapon of choice. That could lend itself to social commentary as sharp as Faith's bangs if handled with a smart, light touch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monkey Island</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092202-4037659-untitled-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The tragedy of a Monkey Island adaptation is that Our Flag Means Death beat it to the punch as a modern-day pirate comedy. Still, we think there's room on the seven seas for two such shows, and Monkey Island could be a hammier, Monty Python-esque take on the subject of piracy. Plus, the series has plenty of fantastical elements like pirate ghosts, so you could sprinkle in some zany fantasy elements as well. Yarr!</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Portal</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092203-2105857-169_portal_2_x360_video_review_041811_1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Portal has already gotten a live-action adaptation, of a sort, with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk\">short film</a> from Dan Trachtenberg before he went on to direct feature films like 10 Cloverfield Lane and Prey. And while that short is a great showcase of his directing skills and creative application of the portal gun, the nihilistic tone didn't exactly match the games. A serialized Portal show would need to be dark, yes, but also humorous--it could even explore the everyday going-ons of Aperture Science prior to the events that led into Portal and Portal 2. At its best, Portal is a razor sharp satire of corporations and technology, so it's just not the same without GLaDOS or Cave Johnson. Bonus: have beloved actor J.K. Simmons reprise his role as Johnson.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Psychonauts</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092205-3870467-psychonauts2-screenshot-launch-007.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This Double Fine franchise is perfectly suited for a cartoon adaptation. With its heady humor and mystery-driven plots aiming for a teen audience, the serialized show could get a lot of mileage out of stories revolving around the brain-diving agency and its myriad missions. As Psychonauts 2 showed, there's also plenty of room for heart and a sensitive look at mental health as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Red Dead Redemption</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092206-3440994-gamespot1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A dusty western isn't exactly an original setting for a TV show, and in recent years we've had something of a revival of the genre, but there's a reason Red Dead Redemption and its sequel captured players. Rockstar has carved out a space for itself to tell unique stories about the waning days of the Old West, as rustlers feel the march of time making them irrelevant. The first game used this to tell a mobster-infused \"one last job\" story familiar from the GTA series, while the prequel expanded on the concept with the ensemble dynamics of a roving gang of outlaws. Either one would work for an adaptation, but for our money, we'd love to see a series flip the order: Establish the gang dynamics first, and then end the series with the tragic finale that is the first game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Titanfall</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092207-faf7ajtxgaagf6k.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Modern and near-future military conflict is a relatively common setting, but a Titanfall adaptation would veer slightly more into the realm of science-fiction while still remaining recognizable. The world of Titanfall is essentially a slightly forward-facing military trope, with the addition of giant mechs. We've already seen how this can pack a narrative punch with Titanfall 2's single-player campaign, so a TV adaptation could simply expand on that. Show us several characters with their own differing relationships to technology and war, and let the stories progress from there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>World of Warcraft</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092208-3696690-world-of-warcraft-1194014-1280x0.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This franchise already took a stab at a big-screen adaptation in 2016, which was a notorious flop. The <em>idea</em> of a fantasy series centered around a war between races that are equally sympathetic still has value, though. The title represents a shift in focus from Warcraft the strategy game to World of Warcraft the MMORPG, which takes a more serialized approach perfect for the small screen. Blizzard has been wringing new stories out of these conflicts for years, and there's no reason we couldn't build entire seasons out of some of their more infamous story arcs like the Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, or Shadowlands.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Yakuza</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4092209-4035311-likeadragon8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A crime family story with goofball energy isn't an obvious match, but the Yakuza series has made it work across several games and spin-offs. The Yakuza series successfully blends an unusual culture depiction for Western audiences, hard-boiled crime fiction, lovable characters with big squishy hearts, and occasional tragic melodrama. Giving us a weekly antihero story with these types of characters is a no-brainer, and the games have already introduced several season-length plotlines that would sustain such an effort.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-that-should-be-adapted-to-tv/2900-4622/", "date_published": "2023-02-10 16:54:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Best Selling Digital PS5 Games Of January 2023 Revealed", "description": "<p>Grand Theft Auto V once again tops the list of best-selling digital PlayStation 5 games in January.

For Xbox and PlayStation players, the graphics modes on offer won't be too surprising. Current-gen systems such as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S get the usual Performance and Resolution options, with these modes favoring frame rate and resolution, respectfully.</p><p>Team Ninja noted that Resolution mode targets a full 4K output while Performance mode aims to deliver a smooth 60fps experience, and on Xbox Series S, Quality mode targets a 2560\u00d71440 resolution. On last-gen consoles, don't expect to see more than 30fps on those older machines. While the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro are targeting 4K resolutions, the Xbox One and base PS4 will deliver 1080p visuals at 30fps.</p><p>PC requirements for the game lean towards the demanding side, as you'll need a GTX 1650, 8GB of RAM, and 60GB of storage space to get 720p and 30fps. For a better experience at 1080p and 60fps, you'll need to have a GeForce RTX 2060 and 16GB of RAM inside your PC. Team Ninja is still finalizing the PC requirements for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and the studio says that its internal testing has the game running at 4K 60fps using a GeForce RTX 3080 and graphics set to standard.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-console-modes-and-pc-requirements-revealed/1100-6511400/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-console-modes-and-pc-requirements-revealed/1100-6511400/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-10 13:39:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Division 2 Dev Can't Update The Game Due To System Error, Delays Season 11", "description": "<p>The Division 2 can't be updated due to a system error, forcing the developer to delay season 11 once again.</p><p>Ubisoft announced <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1621554326849060864\">last week</a> that it was delaying season 11: Reign of Fire due to a localization issue that was impacting the experience for players, therefore moving the release from February 7 to an unspecified date.
