The east London side remain in relegation peril but recent performances have been more encouraging. Last month\u2019s victory over Everton featured Jarrod Bowen at his driving best and last weekend\u2019s gutsy draw with Newcastle saw West Ham return to the qualities that once made them so effective under Moyes. There were players running for the cause and the defence stood firm. Nayef Aguerd is beginning to look like a very smart buy. The Morocco centre-back missed the start of the season after suffering an ankle injury during a pre-season friendly but he has been excellent since returning to fitness. Aguerd was impressive during Morocco\u2019s run to the World Cup semi-final and has been very good for West Ham lately. Most impressive was his brilliant tackle to deny Callum Wilson after the Newcastle striker went through on goal. Moyes will want more of the same against Chelsea. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><p><em>West Ham v Chelsea, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Brentford, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Crystal Palace v Brighton, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Leeds v Manchester United, Sunday 2pm</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/10/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/10/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend", "date_published": "2023-02-10 00:01:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Thousands of Afghans who helped British forces \u2018remain stranded by UK\u2019", "description": "<p>Damning report by MPs urges government to ensure safe passage for interpreters and contractors at risk from Taliban</p><p>Several thousand Afghans who helped British forces before the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 remain stranded and at risk from the Taliban because of failures of the government\u2019s settlement schemes, according to a damning report by MPs.</p><p>The defence select committee\u2019s report urged the government to set out what action it is taking to ensure safe passage to the UK for at least 4,600 Afghans, including interpreters and contractors, who worked for UK forces.</p><p>A lack of preparedness for the number of potential applicants resulting in under-resourcing, backlogs in applications, and errors in decision making.</p><p>Poor communications with applicants causing stress to them and increasing correspondence to MPs and others.</p><p>Unclear and frequently changing eligibility criteria.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/10/thousands-of-afghans-who-helped-british-forces-remain-stranded-by-uk\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/10/thousands-of-afghans-who-helped-british-forces-remain-stranded-by-uk", "date_published": "2023-02-10 00:01:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK travellers warned of a big jump in the cost of hiring a car overseas", "description": "<p>Which? finds typical rise of 72% on pre-pandemic prices, with cost doubling in some holiday hotspots</p><p>UK holidaymakers heading overseas this Easter will typically have to pay 72% more to hire a car than they did just before the coronavirus pandemic, data shows.</p><p>The consumer group Which? said the hire cost in some holiday hotspots would be double what it was in 2019.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/10/uk-travellers-big-jump-cost-hiring-car-overseas-which-holiday-hotspots\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/10/uk-travellers-big-jump-cost-hiring-car-overseas-which-holiday-hotspots", "date_published": "2023-02-10 00:01:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Your Place or Mine review \u2013 Netflix romcom has big stars but little charm", "description": "<p>Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher play best friends who swap houses for a week in a bland, if inoffensive, pile of fluff</p><p>Valentine\u2019s Day compels many of us to bemoan not just the sorry state of our love lives but also the even sorrier state of the romantic comedy, a genre given a recent rebirth that\u2019s still in need of a jolt back to life. After a distinct dearth, the streamer-led avalanche of 90-minute meet-cutes has certainly been consistent but it\u2019s also been consistently underwhelming, inoffensively so perhaps but also increasingly aggravating to those of us who fondly remember the best of them. Even without expecting a total wheel reinvention, there\u2019s a laziness that niggles \u2013 it\u2019s as if these movies are being pumped out by writers and directors who are half-asleep, their focus elsewhere.</p><p>One might naively expect a little more from Reese Witherspoon\u2019s return to both the genre and to film in general, her first leading role in six years since another romantic comedy, Home Again. But Netflix\u2019s maddeningly milquetoast Your Place or Mine, which pairs her with Ashton Kutcher, is just about as forgettable as most of the mulch we\u2019ve been spoon-fed of late but considerably more disappointing given both the involvement of Witherspoon and writer-director Aline Brosh McKenna. While McKenna did lump us with both I Don\u2019t Know How She Does It and the remake of Annie, she also wrote the smart and charming scripts for 27 Dresses, The Devil Wears Prada and the frustratingly under-seen Morning Glory and co-created the excellent and often daringly subversive Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. It\u2019s rather baffling then that she would make this her directorial debut, something so edgeless and unspecific with only glimpses of the wit and warmth we\u2019ve seen from her work before.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/your-place-or-mine-review-netflix-romcom-reese-witherspoon-ashton-kutcher\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/your-place-or-mine-review-netflix-romcom-reese-witherspoon-ashton-kutcher", "date_published": "2023-02-10 00:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
