(Recovering & Deleting Data)", "description": "You should know that when you \"delete\" a file on your computer in your operating system, whether Linux, Windows or Mac, the file is not *really* deleted or overwritten until the space is needed for new data. This is beneficial when you accidentally delete a file, but is dangerous when you \"delete\" a sensitive file and falsely feel like you're safe.\n\nLinux has the command `shred` which overwrites files with random data, which solves this issue. You can also output /dev/urandom or /dev/zero to blank or distort empty space on a drive.\n\nEven in the case of encrypted drives, it's a good idea to use /dev/urandom or obscure unused or previously used space to prevent metadata leakage about how much you've stored on the drive or what used to be on it, in a way that could tie you to an important USB drive or computer.\n\n00:00 No data's every *really* gone!\n01:49 Gist\n03:37 Dangers of File Recovery\n04:50 Good Op-sec\n05:56 `shred` to overwrite and delete files\n08:09 /dev/urandom and /dev/random\n09:44 Blanking or shuffling drives with randomness\n11:11 /dev/zero\n12:22 Encrypted drives can still leak metadata!\n15:01 Retroactively wiping empty space on an encrypted drive\n16:12 Benefits and Dangers\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nClassical books reprinted by me: https://lindypress.net\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\nor Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.lukesmith.xyz\nBTC: bc1qd20r7phdct3t0e0z6jqs55ulectg25pngt7hyl\nXMR: 89yML3AtqnTNdo3wNuoaW44D94Zx1kBZNSBc9SyNxGdaKEZwZNdVzvy9zpbzJMzysiWZEU3b5LwjQ3XwWuQsknCF8JK73yv\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WcrgvhO_mw", "date_published": "2023-02-10 14:47:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
