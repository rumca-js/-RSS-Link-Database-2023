It's truly infuriating. Case in point: these San Diego women bullied a food vendor over the price of his hot dogs. The hot dogs were $7, which admittedly is a bit steep. But it <em>is</em> San Diego, and also everything is expensive and terrible right now. What did they expect?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cHispanic street vendor outside SDSU harassed by a group girls: the vendor, Arguelles Alvarez, had refused to lower his price when asked by the four women, which led to them touching, eating, and throwing his food.\u201d</div> — ChudsOfTikTok (@ChudsOfTikTok)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ChudsOfTikTok/status/1625864387297681408">1676471251</a>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the girls says,<em> "If you charge me $7, I'm going to f**k you over." </em> Another can be seen eating and licking food she didn't buy before placing it back down on the hot plate. And one of the other girls throws pieces of a bun. That she didn't pay for, of course. </p><p>The vendor initially stayed calm and pleaded with the girls to leave him alone. But as they started eating his food, he grew agitated and yelled at them to stop. He later told Telemundo, <em>"They grabbed my bacon with their hand, all my vegetables, everything I use.</em><em>People realized all the dirty things they were doing and it disgusted them. They no longer wanted to buy more."</em></p><p>The girls haven't been identified, but according to the LA Times, two of the women are former Cal State students. The woman who filmed the incident is also a Cal State student. Cal State has declined to provide their names but said an investigation is ongoing. The other girls are believed to be students at San Diego State University, though the college hasn't confirmed it yet. </p><p>I could see this type of drunk behavior from a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/berkeley-12-year-old" target="_blank">college</a> freshman, <em>maybe</em>. But former students? Meaning 23, 24 years old? Ladies, it's time to grow up and stop molesting a poor hot dog vendor's ingredients. Maybe, I don't know, <em>get a job</em>. So next time, they can afford the $7 hot dog. </p>

## Trans Author Threatens to Slit JK Rowling's Throat After Killing Her Off in Their Gruesome Anti-Woman Novel

Rowling. Some of her most misogynistic actions include <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-shelter" target="_blank">opening a female-only rape clinic</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-afghan-women" target="_blank">helping Afghanistan women escape the Taliban</a>. The nerve on this broad. </p><p>Due to Rowling's extremely transphobic and hateful ideas, a transgender horror author <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/trans-activist-threatens-to-slit-jk-rowlings-throat#google_vignette" target="_blank">threatened to slit her throat</a>. Because that's definitely a proportional response. </p><p>In a now-deleted tweet, Gretchen Felker-Martin wrote, <em>"Blood on Jesse Singal's hands, blood on Helen Joyce's, Rowling's, every just-asking-questions journalist and fear-mongering TERFs. You're scared for our children? They're killing ours." </em><br /></p><p>Felker-Martin was responding to the murder of a British transgender teenager. She followed this tweet up with, <em>"If they all had one throat, man." </em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f3fa5" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33056965&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Felker-Martin just published a book in 2022 titled "Manhunt," in which a transgender - ahem- <em>woman</em> searches for estrogen and "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53246892-manhunt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hunts feral men and harvests their organs</a>" in a post-apocalyptic world. According to the reviews, it also depicts gruesome scenes of rape and one instance where a character eats an uncooked testicle.  Seems perfectly normal to me. Nothing mentally unstable about that. Not one bit. </p><p>Oh, and in the novel, J.K. Rowling actually makes an appearance! Before she is burned alive. Which, given the recent threat, could be a <em>slight</em> cause for concern. </p><p>Jesse Singal condemned the threat from Felker-Martin and revealed that he and this author actually go wayyy back. Felker-Martin has been tweeting disturbing things about Singal since at least 2019, when they wrote, <em>"*Bing Jesse Singal with strong rope and bring him to the quarry at the edge of town. Give him to us alive and unspoiled. Leave, and no matter what sounds you hear, don't look back."</em></p><p>Felker-Martin also wrote several sexual fantasies about Singal, which I won't detail here, for the sake of everyone's mental and physical well-being. Just assume the worst. </p>

He feels the class should <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-history-class" target="_self">teach kids about history</a> and not <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_self">Marxist indoctrination</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_blank">who is smashing who</a>. Partisan activists and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) claim DeSantis doesn't want to teach about slavery. This is where Mitchell's lie comes from in her "question" to Harris.</p><p>"Let me ask you, what does Governor Ron Desantis not know about black history and the black experience when he says that slavery and the aftermath of slavery should not be taught to Florida schoolchildren?"<br /></p><p>Team DeSantis was quick to call bullsh*t.

## Marvel's 'Ant-Man' actress claims Disney had her back against being 'canceled' after attending anti-vax protest

Yet, it was one that Marvel's Ant-Man actress Evangeline Lilly took. And we're finding out now Disney gave her their full support when the usual suspects attempted to have her canceled over the actress expressing a single opposing viewpoint. Shocking, because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=gina+carano" target="_blank">Disney isn't known for doing that</a>.<br /></p><p>A year ago January, Lilly <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/evangeline-lilly-anti-mandate" target="_blank">attended what critics called an "anti-vax" protest</a>. It was actually an anti-vax-mandate protest. Lilly was schmaccinated. But while the left was changing definitions of things, being "anti-vax" was redefined to include being "pro-vax" but opposed to government mandates. She also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/evageline-lilly-trudeau" target="_blank">had beef with Justin Trudeau for the same reason</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZPQ4hlLFCl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZPQ4hlLFCl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Evangeline Lilly (@evangelinelillyofficial)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><p>The usual suspects went to have her CANCELLED for her wrongthink.

Per the actress:</p><blockquote>I’ve had direct conversations with them that I have instigated and they’ve always said, ‘That’s not our business. That’s not for us to tell you how to live your life or what opinions to have.’ And I actually even got a really supportive phone call from Peyton Reed at one point and just saying like, ’Just so you know, there’s some rumors spreading about Marvel ditching you or canceling you. And that didn’t come from Marvel and that didn’t come from us, so just ignore that.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>It's nice to see a giant entertainment conglomerate have the courage to stand behind one person once. It is so unlike Disney to do so. And it obviously means that cancel culture isn't real or something.</p><p><p>

## Couple attempts road trip in electric car, ends up with 'range anxiety' after needing to recharge TWELVE times

Contrary to a number of reports that EV struggle to perform <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/electric-vehicle-road-trip" target="_blank">basic car</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ford-electric-truck-total-disaster" target="_blank">truck functions</a> as opposed to their more reliable gas-powered counterparts.</p><p>Three things stood out that, in an attempt to sell people on taking a road trip in your EV, make it sound like a miserable experience. The first is having to drive in the freezing cold because having your heat on might drain your battery faster: "A Kia engineer told us that the cold would put extra stress on the battery, draining it faster than normal. So I used only the heated steering wheel and heated seats while driving — no cabin heat."</p><p>Taking a 1500-mile trip in gas-powered vehicles, you need to refuel a lot less than TWELVE TIMES. Also, "charging times varied between 20 minutes and 55 minutes, depending on the state of the car's battery and the speed of the chargers we used."</p><p>As opposed to it only taking ten minutes to refill your gas tank IF you also take extra time to pick out munchies for the next leg of the road trip.</p><p>Then there is this: "We were constantly thinking about where to charge next. It occupied our minds more than where to eat or spend the night."</p><p>The entire point of the "Great American Road Trip" is that it's supposed to be a relaxing experience. You turn the radio up and enjoy the scenery. Only if you can't drive with the heat on, your radio will drain the battery as well. The classic road trip playlist is replaced by "lol at those anti-science rubes driving gas guzzlers" and "shit, I forgot where the next charging station is."</p><p>Instead of enjoying the ride, you're worried about your battery dying on the side of the road. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/electric-vehicle-road-trip-coal" target="_blank">And hoping some coal miners come by to give you a push</a>.</p><p>What's most important is the superiority you feel over gas-powered vehicle owners. It's not the cost savings - electricity is more expensive than gasoline right now. It's the smugness in knowing you care more about the Earth as you painstakingly plan your journey, charting every charging station, and needing to break out a calculator to figure out how many miles you have until you need to stop again.</p><p>As opposed to getting into your car and hitting the open road. With the heat on.</p><p><p>
