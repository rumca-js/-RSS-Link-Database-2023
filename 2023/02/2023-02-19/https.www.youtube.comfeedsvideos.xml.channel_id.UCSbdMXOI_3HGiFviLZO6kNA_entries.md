In this video I travel all the way to Japan to go from Kyoto to Tokyo to visit multiple VR game studios and VR hardware manufacturers! From The Quest 2 to Index and Pico (or even Shiftall's own Headsets the MeganeX) VR is truly undergoing a pretty crazy revolution right now in terms of VR software and hardware production. So! Come on the journey with me!
