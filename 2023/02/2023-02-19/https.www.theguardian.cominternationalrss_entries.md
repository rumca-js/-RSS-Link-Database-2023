There are just eight points between 20th-placed Southampton and 12th-placed Crystal Palace. Saints, Bournemouth and Everton all won yesterday while Leicester, Wolves and Nottingham Forest have all – generally speaking – been on an upward curve. West Ham are 18th, with five wins and five draws from 22 games, a point ahead of Leeds and two above Saints. The Hammers cannot count on three other teams being worse: they need to get busy.</p><p>On the plus side, however, David Moyes is one of several managers in the bottom half who sounds genuinely upbeat about his team’s prospects. “There’s a lot of good things coming through,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/feb/17/weekend-football-countdown-premier-league-team-news-and-more-live?page=with:block-63ef94528f0892f0cefe7036#block-63ef94528f0892f0cefe7036">he said on Friday</a>. It’s his job to sound upbeat, sure, but the injury-list is shortening, and there are players starting to show glimpses of the form that helped them to a comfortable top-half finish last season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/feb/19/tottenham-v-west-ham-premier-league-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Enough by Stephen Hough review – a note-perfect pianist’s memoir

<p>The distinguished piano player’s recollections verbalise the abstract mystery of music</p><p>E<em>nough</em>, the title of Stephen Hough’s memoir, is something of a misnomer, even though it rhymes with his often-mispronounced surname. It’s not enough for Hough to be a concert pianist with a globetrotting career; he is also an adroit and versatile composer and here he reveals himself as an endearingly humorous, entrancingly lyrical writer.</p><p>“A writer is God,” says Hough admiringly, thinking of God – he is a Catholic convert – rather than claiming godlike powers for himself. He then quotes the Bible on the word being made flesh as “an idea floating in the air is caught, a concept becomes carnal”. The piano leaves ideas afloat, airily uncatchable: Hough’s book describes “the liquid lasso” of a stone thrown into a pond in Debussy’s <em>Reflets dans l’eau</em>, and in the notes to his recent recording of Federico Mompou’s <em>Música Callada</em> he remarks that these brief, whispery religious meditations evaporate as they are played. Defying the monochrome abstraction of the keyboard, Hough always sets himself to make sounds tell stories without words. In his reimagining, Tippett’s Piano Concerto proceeds from an orchestral rumbling “under the soil of the earth to the tinkle of arpeggios tracing a delicate tune above the treetops”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/19/enough-by-stephen-hough-review-a-note-perfect-pianists-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She was also the first woman to win an Oscar for best original screenplay. Now a new radio documentary aims to give her pioneering work a fresh appraisal</p><p>In 1991, as a film student, I was offered £50 by a German women’s collective to shoot Muriel Box. But when the documentary director and I arrived at her home we were told that she was too ill to see us. She died a few months later aged 85. While I regret never meeting her, I’m also relieved. How terrible to have shown even a glimpse of my full ignorance of her achievements, a pioneering film-maker who had fought her way through an industry hostile to women to make a major contribution to cinema.</p><p>Box directed 13 feature films in the 1950s and early 60s and remains Britain’s most prolific female director. Her titles, made for a mainstream audience, include <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wtcJq6WpJg">The Passionate Stranger</a></em>, an imaginative retort to the romance novel, which boldly experiments with form; the controversial juvenile courtroom drama <em>Too Young </em><em>to Love</em>; and Box’s favourite, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgjGtArScC0">The Truth About Women</a></em>, an eclectic tapestry of the complex lives of women.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/muriel-box-female-film-director-carol-morley-sunday-feature">Continue reading...</a>
