My most complicated device is this weather station with many sensors. We also use BLE devices like the Xiaomi body scale in our bathroom. Today I will show you how to connect such devices to your smart home without hacking. And, as usual, you will learn some tricks and why the BLE proxy of Home Assistant sometimes does not work.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nTTGO LoRa Board: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFdmxuV\nTTGO T7: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dl5AcqN or https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeG9Ojr\nVideo on how to connect to Telegram: https://youtu.be/-VdFh1EMUmU\nNode-Red Flow 433MHz: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18MaCuL00J1BUKPNqhcmblYeU67UUm-1M/view?usp=share_link\nNode-Red Link BLE: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIbZBZELM7F7_xvK47xBpeAODnGYrSA6/view?usp=share_link\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://passiv-energie.gmbh/\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\nhttps://yosmart.com/\nYouTuber Patreon: https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMashup/\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
