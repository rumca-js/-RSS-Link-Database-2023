I love 433MHz sensors because they are cheap and work over a long distance. My most complicated device is this weather station with many sensors. We also use BLE devices like the Xiaomi body scale in our bathroom. Today I will show you how to connect such devices to your smart home without hacking. And, as usual, you will learn some tricks and why the BLE proxy of Home Assistant sometimes does not work.
