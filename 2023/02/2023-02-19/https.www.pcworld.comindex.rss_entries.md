<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about publishers and content creators getting their due in the new age of AI-powered chat, you might want to adopt Neeva, a small search engine that emphasizes pushing you to its sources as much as giving you the answer.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=//neeva.com&amp;xcust=2-1-1511545-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Neeva</a>, founded by Sridhar Ramaswamy (ex-senior vice president of ads at Google), and Vivek Raghunathan, (ex-vice president of monetization at YouTube), is one of the small number of search engines that are either built around AI-powered technology or have added it. While the big three include ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and eventually Google Bard, both You.com as well as Neeva have a chance to try and grab some attention as AI-powered search begins to grow.</p>



<p>However, Neeva can&rsquo;t really be considered an AI-powered chatbot, at least not yet. Think of it as AI-powered search, or search plus a bit of AI layered on top. Prompts like &ldquo;tell me a joke&rdquo; go ignored, as well as fun but dumb prompts like &ldquo;tell me the fastest car in the style of a 1940s gangster.&rdquo; In fact, unless you specifically use NeevaAI, its chatbot, you&rsquo;ll see a list of results that looks just like any other search engine. Neeva promises no ads, however, and no trackers. </p>



<p>Instead, Neeva&rsquo;s niche is in multi-site search. Want a list of the best laptops? NeevaAI will tell you, providing you an explanation about a paragraph or two long, with footnotes. Below Neeva AI&rsquo;s response is a series of links, so that you can see the sites it&rsquo;s pulling from.</p>



<p>To the right, however, is something unique: The NeevaAI synopsis, summing up the meat of the site in a sentence or two. It&rsquo;s not a bad compromise: Users receive a short sentence or two about what the site has to say on the topic, but hopefully users will see the need to visit the site for more context and information. The link to the site is right at top, and there&rsquo;s a large image (if the site has provided one) that illustrates the topic a bit more, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="NeevaAI best laptops" class="wp-image-1514039" height="720" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neeva-1-laptops.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>NeevaAI in action, with a synopsis to the right.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://Neeva.com&amp;xcust=2-1-1511545-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mark Hachman / IDG</a></div>



<p>Neeva is even going so far as to say it will pay its sources, though it&rsquo;s barely begun.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still early days when it comes to our revenue growth; as such we have informal agreements with publishers when we use their content, for example Medium / Quora / Reddit,&rdquo; Ben Kobren, head of communications at Neeva, said in an email. &ldquo;In some cases, we are already cutting checks. Future Publishing is one.&rdquo;</p>



<p>NeevaAI doesn&rsquo;t trigger all the time, and there&rsquo;s no direct link to the AI chatbot right now. (For an example prompt that should trigger NeevaAI, try &ldquo;should you warm up your car.&rdquo;) You&rsquo;ll also need to be logged in to Neeva to access NeevaAI, though slightly ironically you can do so with a Google Gmail login.</p>



<p>What you may (or may not) want to do is allow Neeva to access your own data, so it can be searched, too. Neeva can be connected to Google apps like Gmail, Drive, and Contacts, but also Office 365, Dropbox, Github, Jira, Figma, Slack, and more. Providing those credentials allows Neeva access to &ldquo;relevant items&rdquo; in your search results, governed by a public <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://neeva.com/privacy&amp;xcust=2-1-1511545-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">privacy policy</a>.  You can also store or bookmark items into Spaces, which seems to be Neeva&rsquo;s version of Microsoft Edge&rsquo;s Collections.</p>



<p>Neeva is small, with just 2 million users internationally. But the time is now for it to start amassing users as AI chat begins to go mainstream. </p>

## This Microsoft Edge feature drives me insane. Luckily there’s a fix

<p>If you&rsquo;ve come to expect a certain behavior from Windows&rsquo; Alt + Tab shortcut&mdash;that it will cycle through all open windows&mdash;you may be thrown for a loop when using Microsoft Edge as your browser. Inexplicably, Alt + Tab presents you with not just every open program, but also every open tab <em>within</em> the browser.</p>



<p>I hate it.</p>



<p>Somewhere deep in the annals of Microsoft history exists a reason for this decision. There must have been focus groups and feedback that confirmed that folks would love this feature. In fact, among the billions of Windows users out there, many people probably adore the inclusion of their last five active tabs when sifting through open windows. You don&rsquo;t need to first bring the browser to the forefront, then find the desired tab. You can jump straight to it.</p>



<p>But visual noise slows me down. I try to keep my number of open windows to a minimum, otherwise hopping over to the one I want in the task switcher is cumbersome. And this helpful Microsoft Edge feature adds unwanted visual clutter for my eyes to have to pick through. (So unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not helpful to me.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 10 Alt + Tab settings " class="wp-image-1512826" height="837" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/multitasking.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Multitasking settings in Windows 10.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Thankfully, you can disable this setting&mdash;though you won&rsquo;t do this within Microsoft Edge. You must instead head to your Windows settings. Under Multitasking, you&rsquo;ll see an option for Alt + Tab. Choose the <em>Open windows only</em> setting. Now when you use the task switcher, you&rsquo;ll have the classic Windows experience of only open apps and File Explorer windows to cycle through.</p>



<p>If you have the complete opposite preference to mine, you can also instead embrace chaos and violence via the <em>Open windows and all Edge tabs</em> option. That means yes, all your Edge tabs become part of the Alt + Tab madness. You have 44 Edge tabs open? Well, now you have 44 additions to your task switcher lineup.</p>



<p>The good news is that Microsoft actually gives us a choice, including the ability to step down the number of Edge tabs that appear. I&rsquo;m not sure if I could keep using Edge otherwise, even with it already being one of my secondary browsers.</p>
