<ul><li>Tourists search for answers after defeat by India inside three days</li><li>Former captain Allan Border ‘disappointed’ and ‘shell-shocked’</li></ul><p>Captain Pat Cummins has admitted Australia went “too high tempo” in a stunning capitulation as they lost the second Test in Delhi inside three days. Defeat meant Australia’s hopes of winning a Test series in India for the first time in 19 years are over in less than six days of cricket, crushed twice by a ruthless Indian spin attack.</p><p>While they were never in the contest in the opening Test in Nagpur, at Arjun Jaitley Stadium the tourists began day three with the advantage, but were demoralised by tea. Australia’s collapse of 48-9 was their third-worst in the third innings of a Test, behind the infamous Cape Town debacle of 2011 (36-9) and a match against the World XI in 2005 (47-9) when the country’s golden generation were already in a winning position.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/20/cricket-australia-india-second-test-reaction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This documentary’s drone-based perspective on the war is like little else – from amateurs talking about stopping tanks with homemade equipment to aerial footage of dropped grenades</p><p>This one-off documentary is brought to you by the production company that made Europe from Above, Hidden Britain by Drone, and The Emirates from Above. It specialises in using aerial photography to find new perspectives, in other words – but Ukraine from Above: Secrets from the Frontline (Channel 4) is not like the others.</p><p>Almost a year since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, pictures taken from the air illustrate a story of destruction on a hideous scale. Before and after photographs show Ukrainian apartment blocks that used to teem with happy everyday life, now with every window blown out; previously magnificent theatres with craters in the roof; and pictures of whole cities which, when overlaid on a map, show the systematic razing of civilian buildings such as schools and health centres. Modern drone technology enables those images to be taken closeup, a development that has turned this theatre of war into a heavily surveilled crucible where atrocities are hard to conceal. When the Russians massacred surrendering civilians on the road out of Kyiv, a drone was in the air above them, clearly filming a man with his hands raised being shot dead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/19/ukraine-from-above-secrets-from-the-frontline-review-the-startling-tale-of-how-a-child-destroyed-russian-tanks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While Lancashire constabulary’s investigative focus may have been right, it will face the consequences of its disclosures for years</p><p>“I have never seen anything like it,” said Det Supt Becky Smith, the senior investigating officer on the case of missing Lancashire woman Nicola Bulley, last week. Though Smith was talking about the attention on social media, where wild speculation of the case had blown up, these could have been the words of anyone after what has become one of the highest profile – and most unusual – missing persons cases in years.</p><p>To those who observed it closely, there was probably only one way that Bulley left the field where her phone was discovered, still logged on to a work call, nearly a month ago. And, sadly, after a body was found on Sunday morning in the River Wyre close to where Bulley went missing, it looks as though <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/19/nicola-bulley-police-say-body-found-in-search">the police may have been right</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/19/polices-poor-communications-on-nicola-bulley-case-are-a-lesson-for-other-forces">Continue reading...</a>

And it is the tried-and-tested formula that stars at the Baftas wore at the award ceremony on Sunday night. The red carpet was a sea of monochrome.</p><p>If this is the ultimate in “safe pair of hands” evening dressing, there were deviations. Some stars combined different pieces – in a way that felt a little more like “real life” dressing. The Princess of Wales wore a flowing white frock combined with long black gloves, while Julianne Moore had a Saint Laurent column black dress with a fluffy white marabou coat. Jamie Lee Curtis wore an outfit that would work just as well off the red carpet – a white satin skirt and black jacket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/baftas-in-monochrome-black-and-white-dominates-red-carpet-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nenad Cicin-Sain’s documentary tells the story of a maverick film-maker who, with extraordinary persistence, induced the Irish rockers to keep the spotlight firmly on the Bosnian war </p><p>Thirty years on, the Bosnian war still has the power to horrify, with its genocidal massacres and concentration camps in the heart of Europe even as international leaders solemnly avowed their determination never to repeat the nightmare of the second world war. Even now, cultural commentators call the 1990s the “Seinfeld decade” where nothing happened, disregarding the carnage in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</p><p>Nenad Cicin-Sain’s music documentary gives us an unofficial, unlicensed look at the nightmare of Sarajevo and the way that rock music kept humanity and hope alive: the rough-and-ready gigs and discos happening in Sarajevo’s battered garages and bomb shelters, while war raged above. It also tells the story of a maverick American journalist and film-maker called Bill Carter, a member of the ragtag expat group of aid workers, musicians and artists in Sarajevo, who was electrified by the sight of U2’s Bono on MTV talking about the Bosnian war. With extraordinary persistence, Carter got an interview with Bono for Bosnian TV, induced the band to do live TV linkup interviews on stage with Bosnian people during their colossal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_TV_Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a> and finally inspired the band to mount <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV-bqgsGpbw&amp;ab_channel=Belaj">a giant concert in Sarajevo</a> in 1997 supported by local bands and a Muslim women’s choir, after the Dayton Accords peace agreement. People interviewed here believe that the Bosnian war only properly ended when Bono took to the stage and yelled: “Fuck the past, kiss the future!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/kiss-the-future-review-bono-and-u2-keep-hope-alive-in-sarajevo">Continue reading...</a>

Must has shown support for that stance via a statement that also made clear its unease with Thani’s bid given the ownership of Paris Saint-Germain by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI).

<p>What a difference 15 minutes can make. For half of this affair a bad week showed the potential to deteriorate further for Tottenham, who had laboured against a similarly uninspired West Ham and showed nothing to enthuse the recuperating Antonio Conte as he watched from home. But a quarter of an hour inside with his deputy, Cristian Stellini, brought a team transformed: Spurs were strong, aggressive and smart in the second period and deservedly won with two fine goals.</p><p>Emerson Royal scored a superbly worked first and it will do no harm that Son Heung-min, relegated to the bench, added his first league strike since 4 January within four minutes of coming on. Spurs return to the Champions League places and perhaps this was something of a reset; for David Moyes, the spectre of relegation was made no fainter by an ultimately bland display.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/19/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league-report">Continue reading...</a>

So much for the oval-shaped episode of Last of the Summer Wine we were all meant to be watching.</p><p>The illusion could not be sustained indefinitely but even a furious second-half revival from Saracens failed to ruin the distinctly old school vibe.

<p>Preventing further tragedies like Awaab Ishak’s will depend on redressing the power imbalance between landlords and renters</p><p>“The tragic death of Awaab Ishak should never have happened,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/09/father-boy-killed-mould-flat-welcomes-law-prevent-repeat" title="">Michael Gove</a> said recently during a visit to Rochdale. Despite repeated complaints from Awaab’s father about the black mould that ultimately caused the death of his two-year-old son, Rochdale Borough Housing failed to act. The problems in England’s social housing extend far beyond this single tragedy. Formal complaints to the housing ombudsman about damp and mould <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/02/mould-damp-complaints-social-housing-ombudsman-tenants-landlords" title="">doubled</a> this year. The TV programme “Help! My Home is Disgusting!” tells of insect infestations, overflowing plumbing and leaks. In January, the housing ombudsman found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/17/uk-housing-association-clarion-home-owners-renters" title="">Clarion</a>, the UK’s largest social landlord, responsible for “severe maladministration” for the <a href="https://www.socialhousing.co.uk/news/news/clarion-handed-third-severe-maladministration-finding-in-space-of-three-months-76651" title="">third time</a> in three months.</p><p>Mr Gove has now pledged to introduce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/09/father-boy-killed-mould-flat-welcomes-law-prevent-repeat" title="">“Awaab’s law”</a>, an amendment to the social housing regulation bill that will require landlords to fix health hazards within strict timeframes. The bill, which is awaiting its third reading in the Commons, reverses over a decade of Conservative reforms and gives new powers to England’s housing regulator to conduct inspections, issue unlimited fines, and charge landlords for emergency repairs. The former social housing regulator was abolished by Grant Shapps in 2012 as part of a bonfire of quangos, and replaced with a body that focused on financial stability alone. The job of ensuring the quality of homes was left to landlords, effectively allowing housing associations to mark their own homework.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-housing-associations-tenants-must-be-listened-to">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As it prepares to elect a new leader, the centre-left Democratic party is suffering an identity crisis</p><p>During a famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T32EyDrMmM" title="">sequence</a> in his film Aprile, the Italian director Nanni Moretti rages at the television as Silvio Berlusconi bullies a centre-left politician in debate, on his way to becoming prime minister in 1994. “React! Say something leftwing,” Mr Moretti urges the hapless socialist. “Say something that isn’t leftwing! Say anything at all!” If Mr Berlusconi’s first victorious election represented a traumatic low point for the Italian left, its current predicament is just as bleak. Last week, in regional elections in the north and south, Italy’s radical right government <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/right-wing-coalition-wins-landslide-victory-in-italian-regional-elections/" title="">won</a> even more handsomely than anticipated, albeit on a low turnout. Lombardy has always been a rightwing stronghold. But the centre-left had run the southern Lazio region for a decade.</p><p>In all, the right now runs 15 of the country’s 20 regions. Meanwhile, prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/italy/" title="">gained</a> in popularity since the autumn election, and stands at 30% in the polls – almost double the dismal score of the centre-left Democratic party (PD). Ms Meloni is enjoying an extended honeymoon period, as her personal approval ratings approach 50%. A pragmatic decision broadly to stick to economic parameters set by her predecessor, Mario Draghi, has reassured the markets. Robust support for Ukraine’s resistance to Vladimir Putin has had the same effect in Brussels, on whose goodwill Italy depends for the full release of almost €200bn from the EU Covid <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/recovery-plan-europe_en#:~:text=A%20total%20of%20%E2%82%AC2.018,and%20support%20those%20in%20need." title="">recovery fund</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-italys-failing-left-time-to-rethink-and-reset">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Visitors have gone 2-0 down, largely thanks to a preconceived idea of playing sweeps to India’s spinners, come what may</p><p>A week ago in Nagpur, Australia’s batting collapse in the first Border-Gavaskar Test came while trailing badly with no realistic route back. It was not ideal but broadly made sense. A week later in Delhi, their collapse was the second surrender of ascendancy in the match. In the second innings they had allowed India’s last three partnerships to reduce Australia’s three-figure lead to a single run. In the third innings, the visitors were 66 ahead on a pitch where 180 might well have been enough, only to lose their last nine wickets for 59.</p><p>Over the previous year and a half, as these Australians prepared for and undertook a multi-series Asian odyssey to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and now India, there has been a formula to questions about batting preparation. The paraphrased answer was like this: “Everyone is different, so guys will be coming up with their own plans. Whether that’s the sweep and reverse sweep, or whatever it may be.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/19/asutralia-swept-aside-india-manic-parade-cross-batted-wallops">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marcus Rashford’s 23rd and 24th strikes of a campaign he will long cherish were taken with cool aplomb and sent Manchester United en route to the perfect start of what they aim to be a landmark eight days. Erik ten Hag’s men are again five points behind Arsenal, having played a game more, and entertain Barcelona here in Thursday’s Europa League last-32 second leg, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/16/barcelona-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report">the tie poised at 2-2</a>. Knock the Catalans out and beat Newcastle in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final and United will have enjoyed their finest week and a-day of recent memory.</p><p>Rashford’s first-half opener, against a Leicester team that might have already been 4-0 up, made him the first United player to register in seven consecutive Premier League home outings since Wayne Rooney in 2010. The centre-forward’s second, after the break, had him skating onto Fred’s pass and beating Danny Ward through the goalkeeper’s legs, while Jadon Sancho’s finish derived, too, from a smart United sequence: Lisandro Martínez pickpocketed Kelechi Iheanacho and passed to Rashford who pinged the ball to the wideman. After swapping passes with Bruno Fernandes Sancho’s left foot did the rest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/19/manchester-united-leicester-premier-league-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are you ready for British cinema’s night of glory, as celebs and stars queue up to get their mitts on a shiny golden mask? Join us as we run the rule over the red carpet and the awards ceremony itself</p><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/baftas2023">2023 Bafta film award</a> liveblog. Before we get going, I bring you both good news and bad news. The good news is that, after the almighty mess of last year’s awards season, everything seems to be back on track. The Golden Globes were on TV again this year and so far – fingers crossed! – no major awards ceremonies have been upended by one celebrity hauling themselves onstage to wallop another celebrity in the face. It’s just a nice, normal awards season, and don’t let anybody tell you otherwise.</p><p>More good news: in a happy break from tradition, some of the Baftas are actually going <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/18/the-strictly-shuffle-baftas-shake-things-up-with-new-tv-format-as-awards-go-live">to be broadcast live</a>. In previous years, the ceremony happened way before the television broadcast, meaning that anyone with the internet already knew who won everything by the time it was on TV. But this year, we’re promised, the final four awards will be presented live. This will add an exciting frisson to proceedings, not least because it means I won’t be able to just copy and past the winners into the liveblog like I usually do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2023/feb/19/baftas-2023-britains-big-film-awards-night-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While pregnant, surfer Gill Hutchison voluntarily ‘beached herself’.

The relationship was tumultuous, but because the biological clock was not ticking in our favour, less than a year in we decided to try for a baby.

What was life going to look like now?</p><p>As an avid surfer for five years, I tried to continue in the first trimester. But the motion of the ocean made me feel ill, my breasts hurt as I paddled and the low-lying fear of being eaten by a rogue shark, swamped by a rogue wave, or knocked out by a rogue surfer, ratcheted right up. The thought of paddling out triggered a cascade of possible catastrophes in my mind’s eye; every surfer was a potential physical threat.

<p>The most stressful time of day is apparently 7.23am – but, for many, life is a constant roiling churn. Here are a few small changes that would help</p><p>I’ve been trying to work out what the most stressful moment of my day is and I think I’ve got it: 5.38am, or thereabouts. That’s when I realise that, having been woken by the dog (erratic, ancient) sometime between 3am and 4am, none of my getting-back-to-sleep strategies are going to work and instead turn to catastrophising about the day ahead, reminding myself insomnia is probably worse than smoking, sitting down and snorting asbestos combined.</p><p>The question arose because according to what I suppose we could call research (a <a href="https://swnsdigital.com/uk/2023/02/top-50-everyday-dramas-brits-experience-including-being-stuck-in-traffic-and-waking-up-late/">survey commissioned by Rescue Remedy</a>, the flower-based potion for modern malaises), 7.23am is the “most stressful” time of the day. I get it. Bad things tend to happen around then: verticality, showering and dressing for starters. If you are a parent, you may also be upbraided for human rights violations in the fields of “breakfast”, “teeth” or “shoes”. Possibly a child will pull a dog-eared letter out of a book bag with the triumphant air of a conjurer with a rabbit, informing you they need to come in this morning dressed as Pope Pius VII and bring a scale model of the Sistine Chapel made of “widely recyclable materials only, please”.

<p>Labour-intensive recipes, from yakhni pulao to kucho gojas, were my grandmother’s speciality in a culture where cooking can be a form of artistry and self expression for women</p><p>I never learned how to eat an orange. It is a shameful admission. But it is because every winter, when oranges arrived in the Mumbai markets, my grandmother would make her kheer komola – sweetened milk condensed over a stovetop for hours and then cooled and mixed with fresh orange pulp. That’s how I consumed oranges through most of my childhood, with all the goodness of the fruit forked out and mixed with condensed milk. Why would I eat an orange any other way?</p><p>Bengalis are infamous for their consumption of sweets. A dessert after every meal was a requirement in our Bengali household – yes, even after breakfast. Ingenuity was sought. The rains brought a variation of the kheer. My grandmother, who I called Didu, would take on the task of peeling and deseeding a dozen custard apples for the family, coaxing out the hard black seeds from each fleshy white globule with her fingers. I often asked her why she couldn’t pick an easier fruit and she would always tell me to ask her the question after I’d had my first spoonful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/19/my-grandmothers-indulgent-recipes-show-how-indian-women-express-their-love">Continue reading...</a>

The signs are that it will only get worse, as the Conservative party, having run out of credibility and ideas, looks set to spin the wheel and put everything on culture war. Last week, Iain Anderson, a senior Tory business leader, quit the party as he had learned in discussions with party insiders that Rishi Sunak plans to “ramp up the culture wars” in his 2024 election strategy. In the same week, the party’s new chair, Lee Anderson, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-should-fight-next-election-29211636">said</a> that the next election will probably be “a mix of culture wars and trans debate”.</p><p>A vulgar departure from the dog-whistle approach of the past there from Anderson, but clarifying nonetheless.

<p><strong>Royal and Derngate theatre, Northampton</strong><br />Michael Rosen’s update of Oliver Twist gets the musical treatment in this high-energy show about a schoolgirl ensnared by a street gang</p><p>Charles Dickens’s 19th-century orphan, Oliver, is given a modern twist in this high-energy musical hybrid. Based on Michael Rosen’s book of the same name and adapted by Roy Williams, it draws out the modern-day parallels in that classic, which really come to resonate.</p><p>Dickens’s characters come alive as a class of unruly schoolchildren read his novel. They intermingle with the present-day drama of Shona (Drew Hylton), whose single father (Thomas Vernal) is having trouble making ends meet. Shona is offered a free mobile phone at school but realises she is expected to use it to “fetch and carry” for a street gang. Directed by James Dacre, this is an original production that shows, so keenly, how the trap of child poverty can lead to the trap of child crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/19/unexpected-twist-review-royal-and-derngate-theatre-northampton">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Barbican Art Gallery; Whitechapel Gallery, London</strong><br />The American artist puts her sitters at such ease that, one way or another, they reveal all in a superbly curated show of her life’s work. Elsewhere, an exhibition of 80 overlooked women painters is too much of a good thing</p><p>Alice Neel is in spectacles, striped chair and nothing else. She is 80, cheeks flushed from the effort of being true to herself – “It was so damned hard.” The paintbrush in her hand is directed straight at the naked breast. One eyebrow is raised, rhyming with an energetically upturned toe below. It is a vision of superlative defiance.</p><p>Neel’s self-portrait – by now as famous as she is – rightly opens <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/AliceNeel">this startling show</a>. The floor has been painted gold, to match the frame, and her shining intelligence. Neel (1900-84) deserves her cult status in American art: a lifelong feminist, humanitarian, activist and braveheart; a woman who painted stubbornly figurative images all the way through abstract expressionism, minimalism and pop, who received scarcely any coverage or wall space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/19/alice-neel-hot-off-the-griddle-barbican-art-gallery-london-review-action-gesture-paint-women-artists-and-global-abstraction-1940-70-whitechapel-gallery">Continue reading...</a>

Which is to say, I birthed two babies in relatively quick succession, looked at the cost of childcare (£42.5k a year for a baby and a two-year-old in my part of London, towards which the government will contribute up to £2k a child under the tax-free childcare scheme), and decided that staying home made more sense than putting them in nursery and desperately trying to earn enough to break even.</p><p>I’m far from alone in that calculation. Current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/25/number-of-stay-at-home-dads-in-uk-up-by-a-third-since-before-pandemic">data</a> suggests there’s roughly 1.34 million stay-at-home parents in the UK. Although the percentage of dads is increasing, the vast majority are mothers. According to the Department for Education’s childcare and early years <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents">survey of parents</a>, about half would prefer to do some paid work if childcare were more affordable. On the flip side, the thinktank Civitas has estimated there are more than 2 million mums of young children who’d prefer to reduce their hours, but work out of financial necessity. What could better exemplify the “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” vibe that seems to characterise every aspect of modern parenting?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/jeremy-hunt-stay-at-home-mums-work-parents-employment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In an extract from his new book It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism, the US senator talks about the Capitol attack, Biden’s inauguration, and his sensible attire becoming a global sensation</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/19/bernie-sanders-oligarchs-ok-angry-about-capitalism-interview">Read an interview with Bernie Sanders</a></li></ul><p>I had predicted that Donald Trump would try to overturn the election results in every way possible, including the incitement of violence. But even I didn’t imagine how far the defeated president would go on 6 January 2021. Even in my wildest imagination, I had never contemplated that a violent group of extremists, many of them white nationalists inspired by a vile doctrine of racist and antisemitic hatred, would storm the Capitol and overwhelm the Capitol police, physically take over the US Senate chamber and threaten the lives of the vice-president and the speaker of the House. Being trapped in a room with other senators, guarded by police officers and FBI agents with machine guns, was a scene I never could have predicted – and never want to see again. But I knew then, as I know now, that the deep divisions Trump and his allies had opened up in America, and which they continue to inflame, make the possibility of more anti-democratic violence real. That was one of the many reasons why I later voted to convict Trump for inciting an insurrection, and why I would do so again.</p><p>For weeks before and after Biden’s inauguration on 20 January 2021, thousands of national guard units from states across the country, including Vermont, established checkpoints around the Capitol and secured the perimeter. This was a far cry from the usual peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another that our nation was accustomed to. Instead of what we read about in eighth grade civics class, Washington on those winter days felt like a city beset by civil war. When I spoke with guardsmen and women, I was struck by the fact that they knew exactly why they were there. They were defending the constitution and preserving our fragile democracy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/19/bernie-sanders-viral-mittens-ok-angry-about-capitalism-extract">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elegance Bratton’s impressive tale of a young, gay, homeless Black man who joins up is informed by his own experience</p><p>Ellis French (Jeremy Pope), a young gay Black man, is already battle-hardened by a decade of homelessness and the rejection of his mother Inez (Gabrielle Union, phenomenal) when he decides to join the US Marines. But the daily fight to make it through basic training, with the institutionally sanctioned bullying that kicks up a gear once his sexuality becomes known, is a challenge even for Ellis’s finely tuned survival instincts.</p><p>This well-acted outsider’s-eye view of the inner workings of the US armed forces is fiercely candid, in its condemnation of the brutality that is enmeshed in the training programme, and in its celebration of the bonds and brotherhood that grow between fellow cadets. The confidence that director Elegance Bratton shows in navigating this closed world comes from his own experience. Before he was the director of films such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/04/pier-kids-review-new-york-queer-black-youth-documentary">Pier Kids</a></em>, an award-winning documentary about the homeless LGBTQ+ community in New York, he too escaped a life on the street by serving in the Marines.

<p><strong>Stylus, Leeds</strong><br />The post-punk quartet balance knowing pretension with cutting social realism as they perform tracks about missing tortoises and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex</p><p>There are some bands for whom a performance in a student union building feels entirely fitting, and London’s Dry Cleaning is one of them. Heroes of the post-punk <em>sprechgesang</em> movement, their wordy delivery is unmistakeably borne of an art-school background, balancing knowing pretension with cutting social realism. This is some seriously smart art.</p><p>With two albums to draw from, Dry Cleaning’s live show comes together in a unified whole. Scratchcard Lanyard (the flagship single of their acclaimed 2021 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/02/dry-cleaning-new-long-leg-review">New Long Leg</a>) is dropped early, easily the fan favourite of the night.

Conservative Hell (“am I part of the meal deal?”) elicits an excited whoop from one eager crowd member, as does Gary Ashby, an ode to a missing tortoise that sees frontwoman Florence Shaw intone a semblance of a melody with infectiously droll panache. “Someone sent us an Instagram thing saying RIP Gary, just assuming that he’s dead,” she offers by way of commentary. “It was upsetting.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/19/dry-cleaning-review-stylus-leeds">Continue reading...</a>

## Macbeth (An Undoing) review – sound and fury signifying nothing

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh</strong><br />The concept is promising, and it’s acted with panache, yet Zinnie Harris’s Shakespeare adaptation falls flat</p><p>An essay accompanying the programme of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/zinnie-harris">Zinnie Harris</a>’s latest adaptation tells us that the playwright has been engaged for the past 20 years in “a stealthily radical campaign of creative, feminist intervention in the western dramatic canon”. I find this surprising. Harris’s 2017 take on Henrik Ibsen, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/the-fall-of-the-master-builder-review">(</a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/the-fall-of-the-master-builder-review">The </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/the-fall-of-the-master-builder-review">Fall of) The Master Builder</a></em>, and 2019 reworking of John Webster, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/26/duchess-of-malfi-lyceum-edinburgh-review-zinnie-harris">The Duchess (of Malfi)</a></em>, both seemed to me to undermine their female characters; the same could be said to happen here. Harris, who also directs, transforms Lady Macbeth (Nicole Cooper) and Lady Macduff (Jade Ogugua) into sister/cousins and the sort of entitled figures who would fit comfortably into a television costume drama, their interactions centring mainly on motherhood and menfolk – Macbeth (Adam Best), Macduff (Paul Tinto) and Banquo (James Robinson).</p><p>At first, the injection of contemporary dialogue and made-for-TV-style scenes into Shakespeare’s action feels promising: will the clash of forms spark new insights? It doesn’t. Instead, we are given banalities of backstories that feel like the leftovers from a development process. On to this mismatch are grafted meta-theatrical conceits: the “weird women” (or are they?) directly addressing the audience; actors coming out of character (or are they?) and issuing instructions to stagehands to produce props or costumes; and Lady Macbeth rewriting the “inevitable” conclusion (or does she?).</p><p><em><a href="https://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/macbeth-an-undoing">Macbeth (An Undoing)</a></em> is at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 25 February</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/19/macbeth-an-undoing-review-royal-lyceum-edinburgh-zinnie-harris">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A man returns to his birthplace in Mario Martone’s evocative but waywardly plotted drama</p><p>Felice (Pierfrancesco Favino) was a teenager when he left his home city of Naples. Now, 40 years later, with a wife and a business in Cairo, he finally returns, in this meandering but richly detailed drama. What draws him back initially is his frail elderly mother. But the city has a way of sinking its hooks again into an errant son. Director Mario Martone switches aspect ratios and film stock for flashbacks to capture the nostalgic allure of Felice’s memories. Gradually the city, together with the community that welcomes him, weaves its spell, and Felice starts to consider returning home. But just as the happy moments are ingrained in the fabric of the city, so are the festering grudges and lingering hostilities.</p><p>In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/nostalgia-review-joy-and-danger-await-in-a-naples-homecoming">Continue reading...</a>

I give you as an example Tower Bridge.</p><p>In an overlooked part of east London, weed-strewn and still industrial – a district un-steamrollered by the giant apartment blocks going up in much of the old docklands, close to where the River Lea joins the Thames – two curve-cornered squares of steel frame the view.

They are actually essential elements of the recently completed <strong><a href="https://www.thomasrandallpage.com/Cody-Dock-Rolling-Bridge">Cody Dock Rolling Bridge</a></strong>, designed by the architect Thomas Randall-Page and Tim Lucas of the engineers Price &amp; Myers, which moves in a way that no bridge has done before.

I add mahleb and mastic – this is my grandmother’s recipe. Mahleb are dried cherry seeds, with quite a bitter flavour. Mastic is a resin from a tree, almost pine-like in taste. You probably won’t get these spices in supermarkets but you can buy them in Turkish or Middle Eastern stores.</p><p>I use baharat the most in bread inspired by my grandmother. She used to make a white loaf encrusted with sesame seeds and ripple the baharat mix through.

<p>As the Conservative casualties pile up, thank heavens for Lee Anderson, the no-nonsense MP for Ashfield</p><p>It’s half term and I am rewriting the opening topical 20 minutes of my touring standup show. Again. Damn Rishi’s rollercoaster ride. The current Conservative cabinet has had more lineup changes than the Fall, but will not leave as significant a cultural legacy, bar a similarly large succession of weighty books trying to make subsequent sense of what happened. If it’s Rishi Sunak and your granny on bongos, then this is the Conservative government.</p><p>My tight five on Nadhim Zahawi, I reluctantly admit, will not make it to the show in Coventry on Wednesday, despite the reliable laugh quota generated all around the land by the mere mention of the former minister without portfolio. Once Zahawi didn’t have two portfolios to rub together. But now, he must look back on the days when all he didn’t have was a portfolio with nostalgic regret.</p><p>Stewart Lee’s standup shows <em>Snowflake</em> and <em>Tornado</em> are both currently available on BBC iPlayer. <em>Basic Lee</em> tour dates are <a href="https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates/">here</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/the-ghosts-of-rotten-tories-haunt-my-routine-lee-anderson-conservative-mp-ashfield">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For people with a disability, becoming a parent means battling against prejudice and even outright disapproval. Here, four families share their eye-opening stories of love and joy </p><p><strong>Lucy:</strong> We are both disabled, but our disabilities are very different, and the world has always treated us very differently. James is the epitome of the “good disabled”, as far as everyone is concerned. When we met, you simply had to adjust slightly to the unusual shape of him – and that was it. And isn’t that just the dream disabled person, really? A whole leg missing – the clarity of it! But, like many disabled people, I was a category error. People seem to be particularly suspicious of significant disability when it’s invisible. So when we met, I was the bad disabled.

When people fear for their jobs and the financial safety net is inadequate, is it any wonder they are having smaller families?<p>We’re having fewer babies. Peak fertility in postwar England and Wales was <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2021#live-births-and-fertility-rates" title="">2.93 children per woman</a> in 1964, but that has dropped to 1.6 today. The big falls were largely over by the late 1970s but there has been another decline in the last decade, sparking widespread angst and soul-searching about what could be done.</p><p>We’ve long known that bad economic times generally, and high unemployment specifically, mean fewer babies. Lower or more uncertain income matters because it is 100% certain that having children costs a lot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/want-to-solve-the-falling-birthrate-remember-raising-children-is-expensive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A card game reveals I’m not the finely tuned instrument of recall I once was</p><p>I’m struggling. I’m sure Marshall was in the top left square. I turn the tile and he stares back, but it is a different version of the furry fireman than I expected. My son swoops in to turn it over, before flicking his wrist with a victorious hoot, to reveal its twin elsewhere. I am distraught. My son pats my hand and tells me to keep going, which sharpens the sting immeasurably.</p><p>We’re playing a <em>Paw Patrol</em> memory game. Its rules are simple; place 24 pairs of images face down and turn them over two at a time. Find a match, and you withdraw those two cards to your own personal stash, otherwise you flip them both back over and your opponent takes their turn. In theory, every wrong effort adds more knowledge to your arsenal, as you build up a mental Rolodex of the slowly growing grid in front of you. The problem, in fact the existential horror unfolding before me, is that I find I can’t remember a bloody thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/19/my-son-beats-me-at-our-memory-game-but-i-soon-forget-who-wins">Continue reading...</a>

Bizarrely, he was simultaneously promoted to four-star rank.</p><p>In other late-night online interventions, Muhoozi has backed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and praised Donald Trump as “the only white man I have ever respected”.

<p>High-fibre choc won’t send your blood-sugar levels soaring the way the other stuff does</p><p>As part of a health trial a few months ago, I had to wear a blood-glucose monitor. I soon learned what affected my blood-sugar levels and what didn’t. Potatoes at any time of day were a no-no, but an almond croissant, eaten in the morning, was OK. But the first really big surprise came one afternoon when I was testing a <strong><a href="https://www.solkiki.co.uk/">Solkiki</a></strong> boulder purely for this column. Surely, I thought, this will send it Peak District. But no.</p><p>Maybe it was because I was relaxed (stress can raise blood sugar levels). I forced myself to try again a few days later. A rolling hill of an elevation, nothing more. I was so intrigued I contacted Solkiki. What sorcery is this, I asked. ‘Oh that,’ they said, ‘yes that’s because our chocolate has a lot of fibre in it’ (fibre reduces the glycaemic index of food, which in turn means a slower, shallower blood-sugar rise).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/19/notes-on-chocolate-who-knew-about-fibre-in-chocolate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spaniard has sympathy for the injuries faced by his former club Liverpool, who face holders Real Madrid in the Champions League</p><p>“If I say Istanbul, he says Athens.” Rafa Benítez smiles. It is almost 18 years since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/29/newsstory.sport12">Liverpool’s comeback</a> against Milan in the 2005 Champions League final, but everywhere he goes, everyone he speaks to, it is always there. Well, <em>almost</em><em> </em>everyone. “When I see Carlo Ancelotti we don’t talk about it much,” the former Liverpool manager says. “He doesn’t like talking about it and I don’t like talking about the final two years later. In Athens we were better and didn’t win; in Istanbul they had a great team and didn’t. That’s football.”</p><p>For Benítez, it is <em>the</em> moment and it helped form Ancelotti, who often cites that night as a lesson. “Experience is a rank,” Benítez says, a recurring theme soon revealing itself: the defence of a generation. Two years later, Ancelotti’s Milan team defeated Liverpool in the final.

The exit of the SNP’s most formidable advocate offers Labour an opportunity that Sir Keir Starmer can’t afford to squander<p>When Nicola Sturgeon announced she was quitting the stage, the most extravagant bouquets of compliments were thrown not by her friends, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/15/nicola-sturgeon-expected-to-resign-as-first-minister-of-scotland" title="">but her adversaries</a>. “A gamechanger,” whooped excitable Labour people, instantly and rather prematurely imagining the parliamentary seats they could bag with the SNP deprived of her star power. “The union is safe,” gasped euphoric Tories, immediately and rashly thinking that they could stop worrying about Scotland separating itself from the UK.</p><p>It is not hard to see why opponents were so gladdened by her departure. She led her party at three general elections and two for the Scottish parliament. Five contested, five won. Each by crushing margins over her competitors. Other politicians would exchange one of their lungs for an electoral record like that. She had staying power. There have been five tenants of Number 10 during her eight years as first minister of Scotland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/nicola-sturgeon-departure-scotland-union-snp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dean Fleischer Camp and Jenny Slate’s gently absurdist Bafta- and Oscar-nominated animation is as profound as it is enchanting</p><p>At both the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/baftas-2023-the-full-list-of-nominations">Baftas</a> on Sunday night and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2023">Oscars </a>next month, there’s a strong chance that the award for best animated feature will go to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/27/guillermo-del-toros-pinocchio-review-a-superbly-strange-stop-motion-animation">Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio</a></em>, an astonishing stop-motion animation that uses a beloved fairytale as a springboard for a deep dive into themes of death, fascism and Catholic guilt. Yet there’s another contender that has also been dazzling audiences with its ability to blend philosophical profundity with stop-motion whimsicality – a gently absurdist mockumentary about the inner life of a lonely shell who spends his days perambulating around an Airbnb, musing upon matters of life, the universe and everything.</p><p>“Life relentlessly goes on, and people get lost… and you continue to be alive, and you have to decide how to do that with some sort of grace and curiosity.” That’s how co-writer and actor Jenny Slate slyly described the moral of <em>Marcel the Shell With Shoes On </em>in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/10/jenny-slate-interview-marcel-shell-with-shoes-on">recent </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/10/jenny-slate-interview-marcel-shell-with-shoes-on">Guardian</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/10/jenny-slate-interview-marcel-shell-with-shoes-on"> interview</a>. She provides the voice of the film’s inch-high hero – a tiny carapace with scampering feet and a single eye, who film-maker Dean (played by director Dean Fleischer Camp) meets when he moves into temporary accommodation. Dean has recently split from his partner and needs a place to stay. As for Marcel, he’s been separated from his own family since the human couple who once owned this house broke up, leaving him with only his grandmother Nana Connie for company.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/marcel-the-shell-with-shoes-on-review-oddball-mollusc-mockumentary-is-one-from-the-heart-dean-fleischer-camp-jenny-slate">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m heavily reliant on slapstick’: Jamie Demetriou on imposter syndrome and his surreal childhood

<p>In the Bafta-winning Stath Lets Flats, Jamie Demetriou unleashed a trail of comedy carnage. Here, he talks to Alex Moshakis about body contortions, dealing with ‘feeling thick’ and finding inspiration in the chaotic antics of his Cypriot family</p><p>The comedian Jamie Demetriou was slumped in a chair, trying not to look. He was at a cast-and-crew screening of his new Netflix special, <em>A Whole Lifetime with Jamie Demetriou</em>, in which he takes viewers on an off-centre-sketch musical journey through life’s stages, from womb to grave. (The grave, in this case, is a hospital wheelie bin.) Earlier that day, Demetriou had arrived late for lunch – a nervous wreck, he’d been delayed by several visits to the toilet. And though audience members at the screening laughed cheerily in the right moments, Demetriou couldn’t bring himself to watch. “You know when a horse bolts?” he says, when we meet one mid-morning in an east London café. “Apparently it’s blind and deaf for the entire race. I kind of felt like that. Like, I didn’t hear or see <em>anything</em>.”</p><p>Demetriou is best known for writing and starring in <em>Stath Lets Flats</em>, the Bafta-winning Channel 4 sitcom, in which he plays the titular character, a dim-witted, <em>almost</em> likable lettings agent. <em>Stath</em> features several comic actors with whom Demetriou often works, including his sister, Natasia, or Tash, who is also a successful comedian. While making the series, Demetriou became “incredibly reliant on the relief of the ensemble,” he says, because then he “gets a rest from my own face when I’m in the edit”. The new special features several of the same actors, but here Demetriou stars prominently in every sketch – as a screen-addled teenager begrudgingly attempting sex, a best man getting it wrong, a pensioner witnessing the moment after his own death – and he seems apprehensive about the attention. At the screening he worried, “When is the lull going to kick in? And how <em>painful</em> is that going to be?” When I ask why he has been feeling this way, he says simply, “It’s 53 minutes of my head.” And then, tutting: “Like, this is hardcore my head.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/19/jamie-demetriou-interview-stath-lets-flats">Continue reading...</a>

Charles, he said, by way of reconciling the title with his disquiet about “military history”, is “one of the most sincere, devout lovers of Shakespeare I’ve ever met in my life”.</p><p>Perhaps because there really is no question about Charles’s feeling for Shakespeare, this unusually resourceful excuse – surely making its first appearance among an anti-establishment figure’s reasons for embracing its decorations – has been respectfully received.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/love-of-shakespeare-is-one-reason-to-accept-an-honour-whats-everyone-elses-excuse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not only is Avoriaz part of one of the world’s largest ski areas,  it also hosts a banging week-long music festival, so you can ski in and boogie out</p><p>There’s nothing quite like blinding white, early-morning mountain sun, a blast of crisp, cold air and an Alpine valley stretching ahead of you to start your day. Welcome to Avoriaz, sitting on a cliff-face at 1,800m – and the only fully pedestrianised resort in France. It is also home to Snowboxx, a week-long music festival where you can combine skiing with partying, electronic music, late-night DJ sets and forest raves. As it’s ski-in, ski-out and vehicle free, you can get everywhere by foot. Better still, take a horse-drawn carriage to get around.</p><p>Part of Portes du Soleil, one of the world’s largest ski areas, offering some 600km of ski runs, Avoriaz is a modern resort that crisscrosses France and Switzerland. It was purpose-built in the 1960s, with high-rises and chalets sharp-angled and wooden-clad, working in sympathy with the mountains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/19/snowboxx-music-skiing-festival-france-alps">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The BBC Newsnight reporter’s investigation into the Tavistock’s gender identity clinic for children makes disturbing reading</p><p>Hannah Barnes’s book about the rise and calamitous fall of the Gender Identity Development Service for children (Gids), a nationally commissioned unit at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in north London, is the result of intensive work, carried out across several years. A journalist at the BBC’s <em>Newsnight</em>, Barnes has based her account on more than 100 hours of interviews with Gids’ clinicians, former patients, and other experts, many of whom are quoted by name. It comes with 59 pages of notes, plentiful well-scrutinised statistics, and it is scrupulous and fair-minded. Several of her interviewees say they are happy either with the treatment they received at Gids, or with its practices – and she, in turn, is content to let them speak.</p><p>Such a book cannot easily be dismissed. To do so, a person would not only have to be wilfully ignorant, they would also – to use the popular language of the day – need to be appallingly unkind. This is the story of the hurt caused to potentially hundreds of children since 2011, and perhaps before that. To shrug in the face of that story – to refuse to listen to the young transgender people whose treatment caused, among other things, severe depression, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis and stunted growth, and whose many other problems were simply ignored – requires a callousness that would be far beyond my imagination were it not for the fact that, thanks to social media, I already know such stony-heartedness to be out there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/19/time-to-think-by-hannah-barnes-review-what-went-wrong-at-gids">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine arrives, author Olia Hercules recalls those first horrifying days, and the pride she feels as she watches her home country’s fight for survival</p><p>This week it will be one year since the war started. When I think back to the last week before the invasion, I think about coffee and seeds. I remember that my brother, Sasha, who lived in Kyiv, was working on his startup business plan in a cosy café, sipping flat whites; I recall that my mother, who lived in the countryside in Khersonshchyna, was sorting through her handmade seed packets, preparing for the sowing season in March. Here, in London, I was doing both, the coffees and the seeds, and to me, those two rituals – one so modern and one so ancient – were great signifiers of stability. They’re also something that most people in the UK can easily relate to.</p><p>In a country where you can drink flat whites and sow tomato seeds, how can you also have tanks grinding down the streets? How can you have strangers with guns, that come from thousands of miles away, breaking in and barking at you that now you are either one of them or you’ll be taken down to “the basement” for “re-education” or worse? It’s just absurd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/london-based-ukrainian-chef-olia-hercules-one-year-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thurstan Redding’s image of four C-3P0s from Star Wars, part of a deep dive into the subculture of cosplay, isn’t as far removed from ordinary life as it may first seem</p><p>The word “cosplay” was probably first coined by a Japanese journalist to describe the dressing up of visitors to the 1984 World Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles. Previous terms, fancy dress, masquerade, didn’t quite capture the dedicated spirit of homage. If <em>Star Trek</em> was fundamental in starting the trend back in the late 60s, <em>Star Wars</em> was virtually created with the merchandising possibilities of cosplay in mind. Comic conventions around the world ever since have been crowded with Darth Vaders and Chewbaccas with varying levels of accuracy.</p><p>The fashion photographer Thurstan Redding first became interested in the people who did the dressing up when he met some on their way to an LA Comic Con in manga-influenced outfits in 2017. That started a four-year journey documenting the culture, which has become a book: <em>Kids of Cosplay</em>. To start with, Redding only photographed cosplayers at public gatherings, but as he got into the work he scrapped that idea; he became more interested in picturing them in their home environments, often the suburban living rooms where their fantasy worlds were created.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/19/the-big-picture-droids-c3po-redding-kids-cosplay">Continue reading...</a>

## Serums: 10 of the best

<p>More than a moisturiser, a decent serum will sink into the skin to target specific issues from reducing pigmentation to boosting collagen</p><p>Serums are now ubiquitous in skincare. But I remember a time when no one understood what they were or did. And I’ll take a hunch and say that many still don’t. Everyone tells you serums are good for the skin. And they are. Well, the decent ones, anyway. But do they do anything more than your bog standard moisturiser? Well, actually, yes. A serum, particularly important for mature skins, is not simply a liquidy moisturiser. Moisturisers tend to treat and hydrate the top layer of the skin. A serum has a concentrated level of active ingredients that are designed to sink deeper to address specific issues. Soho Skin’s is calming (as is Paula’s Choice and Stella’s) and regulates pigmentation. The antioxidant-rich Green Booster by Ere Perez is like a superfood for the face. By Terry’s delivers deeper, longer-lasting hydration (and is also available in eye serum). Vichy’s is retinol-infused – great for resurfacing and smoothing the skin. Seasoned retinoid users will also love Dr Sam’s offering. This great overnighter will unclog pores, reduce pigmentation and boost skin-plumping collagen. For brightening, Sephora’s Ultra Glow serum is a win (and one of the beauty industry’s secrets). Tired of heavy creams weighing down the delicate skin around your eyes? Try this excellent cooling serum by La Roche-Posay. As with all skincare routines, you need decent sun protection. Ultra Violette feels and acts more like a serum and is one of the best SPFs I’ve used in a long time.</p><p><strong>1.

<p>Your own mortality might be the underlying fear – but your love will live on in him</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma</strong></em><strong> </strong><em>I need to understand why I worry so much about my grandson. We have two much-loved children, long grown up, and now, late and unexpectedly, an adored grandson, our only grandchild. As a mother I have, of course, worried about my own children over the years – their safety, their health, their happiness– but not more than most parents. However, the worry I have for my grandson is on a totally different scale. I am petrified of something happening to him and by this I mean him dying. These thoughts consume me too often and may be triggered by something I read or hear, or simply by my own thoughts. There is no limit to my fears and right now he is just a year old and as fit as can be. Can someone be too precious?</em></p><p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>A one-year-old grandson cannot be too precious to his grandmother. It is as though you have developed a phobia. Phobias appear to be irrational, yet they’re not something you can talk yourself out of – I’m sure that you’ve tried – and they can come with unpleasant physical symptoms, like panic attacks. I have tried to come up with some theories for you and if any of them resonate, that might help.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/19/i-have-an-irrational-and-extreme-fear-of-my-grandson-dying">Continue reading...</a>

Rather than talking about rejoining the EU, we should instead rejoin the single market and the customs union<p>So the Ditchley Park retreat held a cross-party private discussion last week about how to make Brexit work better with our neighbours in Europe (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/11/revealed-secret-cross-party-summit-held-to-confront-failings-of-brexit" title="">Secret cross-party summit held to confront failings of Brexit</a>”, News). If they had been reading William Keegan’s splendid columns in the <em>Observer</em> since 2016, they would have known the answer: we can’t. Brexit was won by a very small margin, with only around a third of the electorate actually voting Leave, because people were lied to and encouraged in xenophobic thinking. Brexit is failing to deliver on its promises, not because the Tories haven’t done it properly, but because it was never a viable proposition, as is now obvious with its dire impact on the UK economy.</p><p>The answer is not to rejoin the EU, as some would like. What should happen is this: propose to the EU that we rejoin the single market and the customs union. This would be of huge benefit to the country and its economy and would immediately solve the Northern Ireland border problem. And though the off-the-dial Brexiter wing of the Tory party would rail against this, I am confident that a large majority of the UK citizenry would support it.<br /><strong>Mary Pimm</strong><br />London E9<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/brexit-will-never-work-heres-my-solution-letters">Continue reading...</a>

## Falling back in love with Italian white wines

<p>Light, easy drinking and very big in the 80s… Unfashionable Italian dry whites like Frascati, Soave and Orvieto are reinventing themselves</p><p><strong>Castel de Paolis Frascati Superiore DOCG, Italy 2019 (£18.88, <a href="http://strictlywine.co.uk/">strictlywine.co.uk</a>) </strong>When was the last time you drank Frascati? A wine that was once one of the staples of the UK’s vast Italian restaurant scene, has rather fallen from favour in recent years, languishing in that difficult place where passé has yet to become vintage. I suspect many of us haven’t missed it because, even at the height of their popularity, the vast majority of wines produced in the Frascati vineyards in Lazio just south of Rome were never exactly memorable. There was a tendency, in the area’s fertile volcanic soils, to push production as high as possible, rather than curtailing yields in the hope of making wines of character and verve. In what is a familiar story across Italy, however, producers tired of having the name of their region associated with thin, acidic, quasi-industrial wines have persisted with a different approach, among them the Santarelli family, makers of the electrifying swirl of minerals and stone fruit of Castel del Paolis Frascati Superiore.</p><p><strong>Waitrose Soave Classico, Italy 2021 (£7.99, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/">Waitrose</a>)</strong> At its best, Frascati is never super-showy or massively aromatic. The pleasure derived from a wine like Castel del Paolis or the equally attractive Principe Pallavicini Frascati 2020 (£13.99, <a href="http://nobelgrape.co.uk/">nobelgrape.co.uk</a>) is all in the mouthwatering purity and subtle insinuations of lemon skin, blossom or hillside herb, a set of characteristics that means they are also adept at performing what their producers would see as their primary role as mouthwatering companions to food (especially fish). You could say something similar of another traditional Italian dry white wine staple of trattoria and pizza places: Soave. Like Frascati, the northeastern Italian wine’s name hasn’t always been a byword for arresting personality and quality. But well-made, and great value wines such as Tesco Finest Soave Classico Superiore (£7.50) or Waitrose Soave Classico both offer wines of gently insinuating acidity and soft pear and apple juiciness which are brilliantly unobtrusive partners for scallops or seafood risotto.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/19/falling-back-in-love-with-italian-white-wines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first dedicated ramen shop in Wales comes from an unexpected source, but don’t wrinkle your nose; it’s inventive, geeky and superb</p><p><strong><a href="https://matsudai.co.uk/">Matsudai Ramen</a>, 183-185 Clare Road, Cardiff CF11 6QS. Small plates £4-£8, ramen £12.50-£15, dessert £7, cocktails from £8.25, beers from £4.75</strong></p><p>In the beginning was a logo: two concentric rings to represent a bowl, with two lines representing chopsticks bisecting them, their tips touching in the centre. Around the edge are the words Matsudai Ramen, which roughly means “Ramen Forever”. James Chant, a one-time musician, tour manager for noughties indie bands you won’t recall and organiser of music festivals, had turned 40 and needed a new direction. He was, he told me after dinner, “tired of facilitating the creativity of others rather than being creative”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/19/matsudai-ramen-cardiff-bowls-of-deep-care-and-thoughtfulness-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s country braces for Russia’s spring offensive, weapons are slow in arriving and political strains among western supporters  increasing</p><p>Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began a year ago this week, was an extraordinary and unexpected event that has changed the world in which we live. Long-held assumptions about peace in Europe, post-cold war relations with Moscow and Nato’s diminished standing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/ukraine-is-fighting-for-all-of-us-now-europe-must-fight-putin-too">were shattered overnight</a>. The war has revolutionised German defence policy, silenced French talk of “strategic autonomy”, boosted EU unity, revived US commitment to the transatlantic alliance, dramatised the global north-south divide, reduced the UN to the role of hand-wringing bystander and given the UK an opportunity, after Brexit, to show it still has an international role to play.</p><p>The fallout from Russia’s illegal, unprovoked attack, ordered by its president, Vladimir Putin, has caused immense economic and social disruption reaching beyond Europe. Vital grain exports from Ukraine to Middle Eastern and African countries faced a Black Sea naval blockade. Fragile, post-Covid global supply chains were further damaged, fuelling a cost of living crisis. Europe’s over-dependence on Russian gas and oil was painfully exposed. As western sanctions bit, Putin deliberately weaponised energy prices, attempted nuclear blackmail and sought a closer alliance with China. Under air and missile attack, millions of refugees fled Ukraine. <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/02/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-13-february-2023">Thousands of civilians have died</a> – and are still dying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/19/the-observer-view-on-the-war-in-ukraine-one-year-on-an-even-more-dangerous-phase-may-await">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With emergency services stretched, residents are banding together to clean up and guard against looters – and say they are seeing humanity’s best and worst</p><p>Everywhere, strewn across the valleys and plains, there are apples. Red spheres line the roads and stud the drying mud. They are strung like beads on the fences, impaled on the barbed wire. As the flood waters rose, people waded through water up to the waists, then shoulders – and then swam through the torrent, past all the royal gala and braeburn. As the river rose through Max Robertson’s home, he pushed his father and two dogs on to a floating table, and tried to crack a joke: “I said: look Dad, we can go apple bobbing.”</p><p>When rivers burst their banks and sent Cyclone Gabrielle’s flood waters sweeping through Hawke’s Bay, they washed over hundreds of hectares of orchards, stripping the fruit from the trees and propelling it across the valleys.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/everyones-pretty-gutted-new-zealanders-struggle-to-pick-up-pieces-after-cyclone-gabrielle">Continue reading...</a>

Half of the 85 organisations running 154 food banks that responded said if demand rose further they would either have to cut support or turn people away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/19/record-number-of-uk-households-depending-on-food-banks">Continue reading...</a>
