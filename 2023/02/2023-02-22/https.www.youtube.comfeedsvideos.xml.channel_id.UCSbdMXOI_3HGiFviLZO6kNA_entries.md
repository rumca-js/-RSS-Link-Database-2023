Hello and welcome BACK to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Well, except this episode is one  WEDNESDAY! This is actually a really crazy episode of TN, probably one of the most action packed TNs yet. PSVR2 has launched, cheap full body tracking is on the way in the form of Stonx, a cheap way to increase faux FOV, the US taking VR actions as real.. and most importantly the legitimate popping of the VR/ XR bubble. Meta laying off employees, Pico is in deep trouble, Microsoft exits VR etc etc oh also The Quest 2 maybe coming to **ina!
