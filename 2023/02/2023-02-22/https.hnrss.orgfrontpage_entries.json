href=\"https://jotte.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jotte.ai</a>) which we believe can be a game-changer for AI-generated longform writing like novels and research papers.<p>As you may know, current AI like ChatGPT and GPT-3 have a token limit of around 4000 tokens or 3000 words, which limits their effectiveness for longer writing tasks. With Jotte, we've developed a graph-based approach to summarize information and effectively give AI \"unlimited\" memory.<p>Jotte remembers recent details like the meal a character ate a page ago, while avoiding getting bogged down by irrelevant details like the blue curtains mentioned 5 chapters ago. We've created a proof of concept and would love to hear your thoughts on it.<p>Do you think this approach could lead to better longform writing by AI? Let us know in the comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34901481\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34901481</a></p>\n<p>Points: 20</p>\n<p>#

is becoming more dehumanized, IMHO. What can we do as an industry, to make hiring more efficient for everyone?<p>Some of the pain points I observe are:<p>1. Applicants must wade through large volumes of job postings, which are often poorly written, and frequently lacking key information which is important to the applicant.<p>2. Employers are overwhelmed with large numbers of applicants, most of whom don't meet the requested minimum requirements.<p>3. Employers are then too overwhelmed to reply to all the applicants.<p>4. Applicants are then annoyed with the lack of replies.<p>5. By the time an employer finds a potential match, the applicant may be difficult to reach, or is no longer interested.<p>6. By the time an applicant hears back from an employer, they are disappointed in the quality of the response, and already have a bad impression of the employer.<p>What is working well today to address these pain points?<p>What are other Possible Fixes?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

We\u2019re Kyle and Jacob, the founders of Depot (<a href=\"https://depot.dev\">https://depot.dev</a>), a hosted container build service that builds Docker images up to 20x faster than existing CI providers. We run fully managed Intel and Arm builders in AWS, accessible directly from CI and from your terminal.<p>Building Docker images in CI today is slow. CI runners are ephemeral, so they must save and load the cache for every build. They have constrained resources, with limited CPUs, memory, and disk space. And they do not support native Arm or multi-platform container builds, and instead require emulation.<p>Over 4 years of working together, we spent countless hours optimizing and reoptimizing Dockerfiles, managing layer caching in CI, and maintaining custom runners for multi-platform images. We were working around the limitation of multi-platform builds inside of GitHub Actions via QEMU emulation when we thought \"wouldn't it be nice if someone just offered both an Intel and Arm builder for Docker images without having to run all that infrastructure ourselves\". Around January of 2022 we started working on Depot, designed as the service we wished we could use ourselves.<p>Depot provides managed VMs running BuildKit, the backing build engine for Docker. Each VM includes 16 CPUs, 32GB of memory, and a persistent 50GB SSD cache disk that is automatically available across builds\u2014no saving or loading of layer cache over the network. We launch both native Intel and native Arm machines inside of AWS.\nThis combination of native CPUs, fast networks, and persistent disks significantly lowers build time \u2014 we\u2019ve seen speedups ranging from 2x all the way to 20x. We have customers with builds that took three hours before that now take less than ten minutes.<p>We believe that today we are the fastest hosted build service for Docker images, and the only hosted build service offering the ability to natively build multi-platform Docker images without emulation.<p>We did a Show HN last September: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33011072\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33011072</a>. Since then, we have added the ability to use Depot in your own AWS account; added support for Buildx bake; increased supported build parallelism; launched an eu-central-1 region; switched to a new mTLS backend for better build performance; simplified pricing and added a free tier; and got accepted into YC W23!<p>Depot is a drop-in replacement for `docker buildx build`, so anywhere you are running `docker build` today, you replace it with `depot build` and get faster builds. Our CLI is wrapping the Buildx library, so any parameters you pass to your Docker builds today are fully compatible with Depot. We also have a number of integrations that match Docker integrations inside of CI providers like GitHub Actions.<p>We\u2019re soon launching a public API to programmatically build Docker images for companies that need to securely build Docker images on behalf of their customers.<p>You can sign up at <a href=\"https://depot.dev/sign-up\">https://depot.dev/sign-up</a>, and we have a free tier of 60 build minutes per month. We would love your feedback and look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

We\u2019re open-sourcing highlight.io (<a href=\"https://github.com/highlight/highlight\">https://github.com/highlight/highlight</a>), a session replay and error monitoring tool. Highlight.io gives you a high-precision video-like replay of what users are doing when an error or exception occurs in your web app, along with a full-fledged error monitoring experience (similar to bugsnag, rollbar, etc..).<p>The main value prop of highlight.io  is that we help you understand the full context surrounding an error and allow you to drill down to the code path that a user invoked (i.e user clicked button X,  sent network request Y, and backend code Z was executed). Some of our customers compare this to a \u201cweb debugger\u201d of sorts. A picture of what this looks like in our app is here [1].<p>For some background, when we worked at our previous companies as engineers, we encountered hard-to-reproduce issues spanning across both the frontend and backend. The main issues were (1) if a customer complained about a problem, it was hard to reproduce the issue without asking for a screen-share or jumping on a video call; and (2) when viewing errors caught by tools like BugSnag or Rollbar, understanding the triggered code path required stitching together logs, errors, and trace; all from different sources.<p>Highlight.io is completely open source and written in Go and Typescript. To build the replay capability, we use an open source project called rrweb [2] and have worked closely with their team to add support for features like canvas recording, shadow dom recording, and more [3]. Beyond that, we use the OpenTelemetry spec for our SDKs [4], which has made it pretty straight forward to support several languages, even with our small 4-person engineering team!<p>Our product is completely self-serve at app.highlight.io. Installing it is as easy as a npm/yarn import and installing the backend sdk of your choosing. In addition, given the privacy-centric nature of session replay, we also offer the option to self-host [5].\nHighlight.io currently makes money off of our hosted offering, and our self-hosted deployment is completely free. We\u2019re also toying with the idea of an \u201centerprise\u201d self-hosted deployment, similar to gitlab\u2019s billing model, and thoughts from the community on this front would be appreciated!<p>And as far as what\u2019s next for us: Our customers are asking to render logs and traces on a highlight.io session (and vice versa), and we\u2019re excited to be going deeper into a developer\u2019s debugging stack. The long term goal is to build a platform that connects replay, errors, logs and more so that engineers can \u201cplayback\u201d the full state of a web application.<p>Overall, we\u2019re quite new to the open source scene and would love the HN community to share their feedback on what we\u2019re building. If anyone has opinions on where we\u2019re going, or what they\u2019d like to see in an open source monitoring product, we\u2019re all ears. \nCheck us out at highlight.io and at github.com/highlight/highlight to give us a shot.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/frontend-backend-mapping\">https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/frontend-backe...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb\">https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://highlight.io/docs/general/product-features/session-replay/overview\">https://highlight.io/docs/general/product-features/session-r...</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://opentelemetry.io/docs</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/open-source/self-host-hobby\">https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/open-source/se...</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897645\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897645</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://github.com/highlight/highlight", "date_published": "2023-02-22 16:02:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Eggspensive", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://eggspensive.net/\">https://eggspensive.net/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897534\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897534</a></p>\n<p>Points: 55</p>\n<p># Comments: 75</p>", "link": "https://eggspensive.net/", "date_published": "2023-02-22 15:55:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Graphic \u2013 A grammar of data visualization and Flutter charting library", "description": "<p>Graphic is a grammar of data visualization and Flutter charting library, with there features:<p>- A Grammar of Graphics: Graphic derives from Leland Wilkinson's book The Grammar of Graphics, and tries to balance between theoretical beauty and practicability. It inherits most concepts, like the graphic algebra.\n- Declarative and Reactive: As is encouraged in Flutter, the chart widget of Graphic is declarative and reactive. The grammar of data visualization is implemented by a declarative specification and the chart will reevaluate automatically on widget update.\n- Interactive: With the signal and selection mechanism, the chart is highly interactive. It is easy to pop a tooltip or scale the coordinate.\n- Customizable: With the shape and figure classes, it's easy to custom your own element, tooltip, annotation, etc.\n- Dataflow Graph and Operators: Graphic has a internal structure of a dataflow graph and operators.

Starting a new project is so hard because before you actually get to building the idea itself, you have to search for tools and figure out how to piece them together. With starter.place, you can find proven starter templates/boilerplates/stacks that use the technologies you want and get to building right away.<p>If you\u2019ve made a starter repo you think others would find useful, you can immediately reach a wide audience without having to make your own site/app to sell it and advertise it by posting on starter.place. Just focus on building the starter all while earning from it if you so choose.<p>starter.place is so helpful to buyers and sellers because buyers are added as view-only collaborators to the repo on GitHub, where they get continuous updates. Buyers can help drive the project by submitting issues and PRs too.<p>Let me know what you think! And if you have a starter template but are hesitant to list it, let me know what I could do to change that.<p>Oh and as for the app's own stack, it uses Remix, EdgeDB, and Tailwind deployed on Vercel and AWS Fargate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892985\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892985</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://www.starter.place", "date_published": "2023-02-22 08:10:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Scott Aaronson: Should GPT Exist?", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7042\">https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7042</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892927\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892927</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7042", "date_published": "2023-02-22 07:58:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Rust-sitter: Define your entire tree-sitter grammar in Rust code", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/hydro-project/rust-sitter\">https://github.com/hydro-project/rust-sitter</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892916\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892916</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://github.com/hydro-project/rust-sitter", "date_published": "2023-02-22 07:57:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Optimizing Haskell Code for Runtime Verification", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://serokell.io/blog/optimizing-k-framework\">https://serokell.io/blog/optimizing-k-framework</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892908\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892908</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://serokell.io/blog/optimizing-k-framework", "date_published": "2023-02-22 07:56:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Fastbook: Listen to Audiobooks Faster", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-02-fastbook/\">https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-02-fastbook/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892855\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892855</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "link": "https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-02-fastbook/", "date_published": "2023-02-22 07:49:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Bloop (YC S21) Is Hiring a Front End Engineer to Work on OSS AI Code Search", "description": "<p>Hi HN,<p>You can join our team of ML, backend (Rust) and frontend (TS, React) engineers and work at the intersection of AI and developer tools.<p>Using our product, you can ask questions about large codebases in natural language, just like you'd talk to ChatGPT. You can also find code, paths and identifiers using regex and navigate defs/refs using precise code navigation. The project is open source (<a href=\"https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop\">https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop</a>) and is built from the ground up in Rust and Typescript.<p>Some highlights from the stack you\u2019ll be working with:<p>- We ship a Tauri based desktop client, a new Rust based alternative to Electron. By indexing local repos, we bring code search to everyone\u2019s desktop.<p>- We\u2019re using a new vector search engine qdrant, written in you guessed it - Rust. This powers our low latency semantic retrieval.<p>- We\u2019re one of the earliest production projects to ship with Anthropic AI\u2019s Claude.<p>We\u2019re looking for someone experienced, and we\u2019d expect this to be apparent through:<p>- Creativity, obsession with visual detail and consistency<p>- Respect for team and process<p>- A wide comfort zone<p>- Passion for the craft, eg: mentorship, Open Source contribution or speaking at events<p>You\u2019ll work predominantly on the frontend, which is deployed to both the desktop and cloud versions of bloop. Our current stack is React, Typescript and Tauri.<p>We\u2019re an international remote-first team of 7 with offices in London. Preference will be given to those on GMT+/-3 as we\u2019re not an entirely async company and this leaves the necessary overlap to collaborate. We get together about three times per year in-person to hang out.<p>We just raised $7m from top funds, namely LocalGlobe, Khosla and Sands Capital as well as leaders in the field like Hamel Husain who led GitHub's code search team. We also host one of the largest meetups on the subject, AI4Code London (<a href=\"https://ai4code-london.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ai4code-london.github.io/</a>).<p>If you'd like to explore working with us, please reach out to me at louis [at] bloop [dot] ai with \"HN Frontend Engineer\" in the subject line and a note about why this is exciting and a link to your portfolio or linkedin/resume.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892541\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34892541</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
