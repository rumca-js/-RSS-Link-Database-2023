<p>A gloomy writer and his friend are trapped with strangers in a Baltic holiday home in Christian Petzold’s tonally wayward tale</p><p>Christian Petzold has for years been a titan of German cinema – and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/berlinfilmfestival">Berlin film festival</a> itself – and his new movie is an odd, quibbling tragicomedy with perhaps a little of Bergman’s Smiles of a Summer Night, avowedly intended as the second part of a trilogy about creativity and love (the first being <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/23/undine-review-a-shaggy-catfish-of-a-story-about-a-woman-with-a-water-obsession">Undine</a>).</p><p>Afire is an approachable and digestible movie in some ways, and I liked the morose, hangdog look conjured by actor Thomas Schubert playing the miserable young writer Leon, who correctly suspects that his new novel, a zeitgeisty relationship comedy called Club Sandwich, is terrible. But in the end I felt that the film fully achieves neither the ostensible comedy of the opening, nor the supposed sadness of its denouement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/22/afire-roter-himmel-review-useless-author-comedy-drama-in-saga-of-angst-and-lust">Continue reading...</a>

She may lose that title next week, when the awards show for 2022 takes place, but has a chance to retain it having been included on the shortlist for a fourth consecutive year. Now that’s consistency. “I hope to win it again and I am really happy to be here again,” says Endler. “It means we are at a good level.”</p><p>After moving to Lyon from PSG in the summer of 2021, the Chile international won the French league and the Champions League in her first season with the club.

<p>Australia’s battled-hardened army of impact players far outnumber those in any other team in South Africa</p><p>Ashleigh Gardner picked up a career-best, player-of-the-atch 5-15 against New Zealand after making just three with the bat during the group-stage fixture of the ongoing T20 World Cup. <br /><br />Georgia Wareham hadn’t played any international cricket in nearly 16 months but dealt Bangladesh a body blow with her match-winning 3-20 upon slotting back into Australia’s XI.</p><p>Alyssa Healy had been on the sidelines with a weeks-long calf injury but struck vital fifties in two of her first three innings after returning to the line-up. <br /><br />Grace Harris’s tone-setting 3-0-7-2 – her best T20I figures – against Sri Lanka was only the second instance she had bowled for Australia since coming back into the side a year ago after a six-year hiatus.<br /><br />Tahlia McGrath hadn’t considered herself any more than a “specialist fielder” through the best part of the tour until her decisive 33-ball 57 against South Africa sealed Australia’s semi-finals berth.<br /><br />To understand Australia’s enviable depth, one has to understand these numbers as much as the context out of which they are born. Few teams across cricket can rival the vastness of the title favourites’ playing resources and fewer can find match-winners in the way the defending champions have.<br /><br />As they gear up to take on India in the semi-final at Newlands on Thursday, the quality of their XI, as much as that of the reserves, explains why depth remains the most potent weapon in Australia’s arsenal. <br /><br />“That’s absolutely our biggest strength – that we’ve got so many options,” McGrath, the player of the match in Australia’s fourth and final group-stage fixture, said. “So many players can play different roles and it seems to be someone different sticks their hand up every time. We’re all in really good form at the moment with the bat, with the ball, so we go into those semi-finals full of confidence.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/22/strength-in-depth-keeps-australia-on-course-for-t20-world-cup-title-defence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dangerously handsome young men carelessly ruining women’s lives are a rarer breed than they were. But their hatefulness still makes compelling reading</p><p>You don’t see many cads in the wild any more: they are, perhaps, an extinct species. This staple of the 19th-century novel is a rare figure in mainstream literature these days. Undoubtedly if I looked hard enough, I would find a subculture of spicy contemporary rogues – tweet me your picks – but in this instance I am concerned with the noxious products of class and odiously outdated sexual politics that make me thankful to live in an age where I can get a credit card without my husband’s permission.</p><p>Dangerously handsome young men with more money than sense, often a dubious connection to empire, and maybe even a title, just don’t seem to be drinking and gambling their fortunes in London gentlemen’s clubs or ruining the lives of young maidens today. And why should they be? Women now get degrees and mortgages, and premarital sex won’t destroy their social standing. A one-night stand with a slightly Byronic posho is just a funny story to tell your friends, a trip to Boots for the morning-after pill, or at worst an outing to your local underfunded and understaffed sexual health clinic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/22/top-10-cads-in-fiction-charlotte-vassell">Continue reading...</a>

Ish.” In Dorothy Tse’s whimsical satire about a version of contemporary Hong Kong going through hellish transformations, Owlish – “something like an owl but also not like an owl” – is a wise and elusive character who quotes from the Bible, speaks in a coded language, and appears and disappears randomly. Regardless of who or what Owlish is, they must find a way “to survive” as “who knows what will happen next? Everything is changing.”</p><p>Owlish is an old friend of Prof Q, “a hack teacher in a debased, cultureless little city” who, despite a long-term marriage to the near-perfect Maria, has fallen in love with Aliss, an animated lifesize ballerina doll. “I’m in a spot of trouble,” Q says. “What you need is a love nest,” Owlish replies. A wild tale of a failed love affair, the novel might be seen as a literary version of what Stanley Cavell dubbed the Hollywood “comedy of remarriage”. Katherine Hepburn could play the “luminously beautiful” Maria, but Prof Q is definitely not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/carygrant">Cary Grant</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/22/owlish-by-dorothy-tse-review-an-anti-fairytale">Continue reading...</a>

## Gary Bettman’s 30-year reign has made the NHL richer. But has it hurt hockey?

<p>The commissioner has shown a tendency to place the business of hockey above the longevity of the sport itself</p><p>“We’re going to dispel the myth that this is a regional sport,” Gary Bettman <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/todays-nhl-almost-unrecognizable-one-bettman-inherited/">said</a> during a <a href="https://youtu.be/r-k9lJ4hzjA">press conference</a> to announce him as the NHL’s first, and so far only, commissioner. “The prospects for growth are phenomenal.” As of this month, Bettman has <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/gary-bettman-recognized-for-30-years-as-commissioner-by-board-of-governors/c-338701538">spent 30 years</a> trying to convince everyone both statements are true, to varying degrees of success.</p><p>By now, anyone familiar with hockey knows about Bettman’s track record since he took office in February 1993. His quest for growth has alienated fanbases. His pursuit of more TV eyeballs has often been uneven and embarrassing – remember the <a href="https://youtu.be/XlRCGR10uBg">glowing puck</a>?

<p>The Schitt’s Creek screenwriter Monica Heisey discusses her debut novel, the similarities between heartbreak and food poisoning, and why failure doesn’t need to make you feel terrible</p><p>In a world where, for many twenty- and thirtysomethings, just about every marker of adulthood – home ownership, grownup holidays, quality furniture – is out of reach, marriage, says Maggie in Monica Heisey’s new novel, is the “only hallmark of what we think of as an ‘adult life’ that’s still accessible”. As long as you can find someone to go into it with, that is. What happens, then, if you get married and then divorce while still young? Have you failed at adulthood? This is what Heisey writes about in her debut novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/06/really-good-actually-by-monica-heisey-review-a-comic-take-on-newly-single-life">Really Good, Actually</a>, which has zoomed up the bestseller lists since its publication last month.</p><p>Maggie and Jon fell in love at university, moved in together because neither could afford to live alone, and got a cat. Marriage seemed the next step. Then, at 28, Maggie found herself divorced; the same age Heisey was when her own marriage ended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/22/when-your-ex-gets-the-cat-the-writer-who-divorced-in-her-20s-and-turned-it-into-a-runaway-bestseller">Continue reading...</a>

## Don’t Think, Dear by Alice Robb review – the beauty and cruelty of ballet

<p>A former student at the School of American Ballet dissects an art form that too often plays host to obsession and bullying</p><p>When Alice Robb was little, she wanted more than anything to be a ballet dancer. After two rejections from the School of American Ballet, the feeder school for the prestigious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/new-york-city-ballet">New York City Ballet</a>, she finally won a place at the age of nine, a few days after 9/11. “The city was in mourning but it was the best day of my life,” she recalls in Don’t Think, Dear. Ballet became Robb’s obsession and her identity, though her dream of turning professional unravelled when she reached puberty. Her hips widened, she grew tall and her teachers began to ignore her in class. She started bunking off lessons and, in 2004, was finally expelled. Robb subsequently finished high school, went to college and embarked on a successful career as a science writer and journalist. But, she notes: “I couldn’t unlearn the values of ballet.”</p><p>Those values, which include discipline, stoicism, submission and near starvation, are put under the microscope in Don’t Think, Dear, which examines ballet through a feminist lens. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, the book weaves her early experiences as a dancer with those of her contemporaries, and of famous ballerinas, among them Margot Fonteyn, Anna Pavlova, Darci Kistler and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/07/misty-copeland-interview-ballet-broken-disney-nutcracker-prince-obama">Misty Copeland</a>. The title is a nod to the late George Balanchine, the hallowed choreographer and co-founder of the New York City Ballet, who championed the image of the ballerina as a willowy waif, and who Robb amusingly calls “my problematic fave”. A Russian émigré in America, Balanchine’s dictum was: “Don’t think, dear. Just do.” He was, by all accounts, a control freak and a bully, demanding impossible standards from his charges, and seeking to control how they looked, what they ate, who they dated and even what perfume they wore. He had sexual relationships with multiple dancers; those who rejected him often paid for it with their careers. Carol Sumner, a Balanchine protege, tells Robb: “He was very grabby. He was always wanting the girls. He’d be arrested by now.” Sumner, who is in her 80s, says this with laughter rather than disapproval. She still regards Balanchine as a hero.</p><p>Don’t Think, Dear: On Loving and Leaving Ballet by Alice Robb is published by Oneworld (£16.99).
