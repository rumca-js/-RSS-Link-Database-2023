  <p id="dWB6BB">Realme, a subbrand of Chinese phone maker Oppo, might be the first Android OEM to clone Apple’s Dynamic Island, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/02/22/realme-dynamic-island-android-clone/">a deleted tweet from a company executive</a> and <a href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-watch-realme-mini-capsule-a-cheap-replica-of-dynamic-island/">a leaked animation</a> suggest. It comes at a time when Apple seems like it might prove that Dynamic Island is <em>worth</em> copying, as the mostly ornamental UI fixture is finally getting some real third-party support.</p>
<p id="2zduFs">This doesn’t come as a major surprise. As <em>9to5Google</em> points out, Realme <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/02/22/realme-dynamic-island-android-clone/">basically told everyone it wanted to clone Dynamic Island</a> back in September. It appears that a feature called the “Mini Capsule” has been in the works since then.

  <p id="N898vj">Netflix is getting into football. On Wednesday, the streaming giant announced a new sports docuseries, <em>Quarterback</em>, that will focus on three NFL quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs (who just collected his second Super Bowl win and second Super Bowl MVP award); Kirk Cousins of the Minnesota Vikings; and Marcus Mariota of the Atlanta Falcons. The series is set to debut this summer.</p>
<p id="LVkyRu">“For the first time ever, the NFL allowed quarterbacks to be mic’d up for every single game of a season,” Netflix wrote <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-hikes-sports-series-with-new-nfl-qb-show-following-patrick-mahomes">in a post about the series</a>. “The upcoming show will feature behind-the-scenes access to some of the biggest moments of the season, as Mahomes set an NFL record for total offense on his way to winning the league and Super...</p>

  <p id="k7f1JB">Razer has launched a new Blade 15 model refreshed with Intel’s 13th Gen processors and Nvidia’s RTX 4000 GPUs.</p>
<p id="xcXPRP">The company announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">16-inch Razer Blade</a> a few weeks ago, and some assumed that it would replace the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RBHLRDC/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2022 Razer Blade 15</a>. The Blade 16 threw a number of new features into the Blade 15’s formula — most notably, a 16:10 Mini LED dual-mode display. </p>
<p id="XpjSyi">But the Blade 15 is a much more minor upgrade from last year’s Blade 15. While the chips are new, the 2023 Blade 15 keeps the same 16:9 aspect ratio as its direct predecessor, just in case you’re one of those old-fashioned people (sorry, I said what I said) who prefers a shorter and wider screen. It’s also the same size and weight as last year’s Blade 15, which means it’s noticeably...</p>

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made the announcement Wednesday alongside California Governor Gavin Newsom (D), who called the announcement “another proof point of the renewable energy vibrancy that is California.”</p>
<p id="AxJSY0">Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 and has called the state home for most of its 20 years of existence. In October 2021, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas">abruptly moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas</a>, in recognition of its new Gigafactory that was under construction in the state.

  <p id="mO144F">Here’s one more reason to love a good mushroom: one day, you might be able to make headphones, memory foam for shoes, or even aircraft exoskeletons with it. Researchers just assessed the engineering possibilities with one particularly impressive mushroom and found that it might be able to replace plastic in a whole bunch of different use cases.</p>
<p id="39bHXa">Using mushrooms instead of plastic could cut down on the mountains of waste humans create. Plastics made out of fossil fuels are actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution">really difficult to recycle</a> and usually wind up cluttering landfills, landscapes, and waterways.

References to the feature, which is like a private version of BeReal, were <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/Instagram-Tests-More-BeReal-Like-Elements/637916/">spotted in Instagram</a> last year, but now a more fleshed-out version of it has shown up in Messenger. </p>
<p id="rJIBgJ">The feature is “an internal prototype, and not testing externally,” according to Meta spokesperson Liz Sweeney, but the screenshots do still give us an idea of how it could work should it ever make it to Messenger or other Meta apps.

<p id="CDvLTg">The lidar will be supplied by Luminar, a Florida-based company in which Mercedes owns a small investment stake.

  <p id="LBQ1vt">Multiroom music (MRM) is a big selling point of Amazon’s Echo smart speakers. For a fraction of the price of some whole-home wireless audio setups (using Amazon’s inexpensive Echo speakers, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23375590/amazon-echo-dot-fifth-gen-clock-smart-speaker-alexa-specs-release-date-price">$50 Echo Dot</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review">$99 Echo</a>), you can stream music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more throughout your house or on several speakers in one room for some seriously souped-up sound.

<p id="8pvJn0">Alexa’s MRM works with audio from various services, including Apple Music, Amazon Music, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, and Tidal. And since you can play multiple streams in your house at once, you can listen to a podcast downstairs...</p>

  <p id="mz9de0">AI voice clones are already being deployed in podcasts and video games, but how long until they can be harnessed directly by the general public? Probably sooner than you think, with Samsung today <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-enhancement-of-bixby">announcing a feature for its Bixby mobile assistant</a> that lets users clone their voice to answer phone calls. The idea is that if someone calls you but you can’t answer aloud you can type out a response and it’ll be read in a simulacrum of your voice. </p>
<p id="NVrMFZ">Some caveats here: this feature is only currently available in Korean as the Bixby Custom Voice Creator app for a small number of Samsung handsets (the new Galaxy S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra), which means we’ve been unable to test it ourselves. The voice quality might be abysmal and response time too...</p>

  <p id="HyeEMr">Would you be more likely to subscribe to a newsletter from your favorite creator if you could read it through a messaging app like WhatsApp? As noted by <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-experimenting-with-private-newsletter-tool/"><em>Wabetainfo</em></a>, code in beta version 2.23.5.3 of WhatsApp Messenger for Android contains references to a new “Newsletter” feature that’s currently under development. The name could itself be a codename, but clues hidden within the code suggest that the one-to-many broadcast tool will be optional and self-contained within its own section of the WhatsApp Status tab, separate from encrypted group chats and messages.</p>
<p id="Fd0utu">According to <em>Wabetainfo</em>’s findings, Newsletter will grant users full control over what they see — there’s no mention of ads (yet), nor is there any sign of algorithm-based...</p>

  <p id="cGGx7f">Today, Sony is officially launching its PlayStation VR2 headset. It costs $550, and you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">read our PSVR 2 review right here</a>. But there are a few key experiences that Sony didn’t distribute to reviewers ahead of time — like<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608858/sony-playstation-vr2-psvr2-gran-turismo-7-vr-mode-launch-window-games">a day-one patch for <em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a><em> </em>that makes almost the entire racing game playable in virtual reality.</p>
<p id="NbEDwK">I’m beginning to think that was a mistake, because <em>GT7</em> is easily one of the best things I’ve tried in this headset, and I’m saying that having never played <em>GT7 </em>before. I’m certain a number of gearheads will buy a PlayStation VR2 for this game alone — and quite possibly a PS5, a steering wheel, and a set of pedals to go with it. </p>

  <p id="zoxBHS">Upcoming foldable flip phones from Samsung and Motorola could have much larger cover displays than the current generation, if a series of leaks about the unannounced devices are to be believed. </p>
<p id="m30jZ9">First there’s the Galaxy Z Flip 5, which Samsung is anticipated to announce this summer. Leaker Ice Universe, who’s been a reliable source of information on unannounced Samsung devices in the past, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1627682906331316225">tweeted</a> to “say for sure” that Samsung’s next flip phone will have a bigger external display than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23600774/oppo-find-n2-flip-review-foldable-flip-phone-specs-features-camera-price">Oppo Find N2 Flip</a>. For reference, Oppo’s flip phone has a 3.26-inch cover display, which is already substantially larger than the Z Flip 4’s 1.9-inch display. </p>

  <p id="mQLb52">On November 21st, Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23472025/elon-musk-twitter-hiring-again-ending-layoffs">gathered Twitter’s remaining employees</a> at its San Francisco headquarters to tell them that, after forcing out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439790/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-trust-and-safety-teams-severance">roughly two-thirds of the workforce</a> in a matter of weeks, layoffs were over. He keeps laying people off anyway.</p>
<p id="s3jU7C">Dozens of Twitter employees across sales and engineering departments were laid off last week, including one of Musk’s direct reports who was managing engineering for Twitter’s ads business, according to company sources and social media posts from affected employees seen by <em>The Verge</em>. This means Musk has done <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/tech/twitter-layoffs-continue/index.html">at least</a> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-lays-off-twitter-engineers-working-on-advertising-as-ad-revenue-shrinks?rc=k5vrz1">three rounds</a> of layoffs since his promise to stop doing them in November.

  <p id="BGzbpk">“We’re a court. We really don’t know about these things. These are not the nine greatest experts on the internet.”</p>
<p id="7dOXRG">Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan made the wryly self-deprecating comment early in oral arguments for <em>Gonzalez v. Google</em>, a potential landmark case covering Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The remark was a nod to many people’s worst fears about the case. <em>Gonzalez</em> could unwind core legal protections for the internet, and it will be decided by a court that’s shown an appetite for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/24/23169382/roe-wade-overturned-supreme-court-abortion-rights-reproductive-health">overturning legal precedent</a> and reexamining long-standing speech law.</p>
<p id="x20SY4">But during a remarkably entertaining session of questions today, the court took an unexpectedly measured look at Section 230. The outcome in <em>Gonzalez</em> is far...</p>
