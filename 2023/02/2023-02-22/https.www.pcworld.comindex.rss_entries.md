<p>Microsoft is bringing Bing Chat, its &ldquo;copilot for the web,&rdquo; to Skype and Bing Mobile, where you&rsquo;ll have a chance to add Bing Chat to your group chats and let its AI features help you out.</p>



<p>Specifically, Bing Chat will be added to the Bing mobile app, where you&rsquo;ll be able to orally dictate or type a chat to the Bing AI chat on both iOS and Android. The same features will be available on the mobile version of Microsoft Edge. Finally, you&rsquo;ll be able to invoke Bing (via @Bing) from Skype group chats with your friends, and ask Bing for recommendations, jokes, advice, and so on.</p>



<p>However, you&rsquo;ll still need to sign up for the Bing Chat waitlist to see the new Bing Chat in action, in whatever app. You can join the waitlist at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https:///www.bing.com/new&amp;xcust=2-1-1520736-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">bing.com/new</a>, where Microsoft will advise you to tweak your browser to the Microsoft-approved defaults to move higher up the queue.</p>



<p>Microsoft may be proceeding a bit slower than expected with its Bing Chat deployment. Instead of rolling it out first to Microsoft Teams, for example, the feature is being added to the somewhat-less-utilized Teams app. Statista reported that Microsoft Teams had 270 million daily users as of 2022, while Microsoft said Wednesday that 36 million people around the world use Skype.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we learn and fine-tune this amazing new capability, we envision bringing it to other communications apps, like Teams, in the future,&rdquo; Microsoft <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/&amp;xcust=2-1-1520736-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a> in a blog post.</p>



<p>While Microsoft appears to be making Bing available to mobile users with the same capabilities (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1519557/microsoft-expands-bing-chat-limits-but-becomes-boring.html">and limitations</a>) as the desktop application, there&rsquo;s apparently one key difference: Microsoft&rsquo;s version of Edge with Bing inside allows you to craft ideas and summarize documents from the sidebar in the desktop browser. It doesn&rsquo;t appear that that capability is within Edge, at least not yet.  Microsoft is treating both the updates to the Edge and Bing apps as &ldquo;previews,&rdquo; however, leaving room for future updates.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Cyber Acoustics&rsquo; DS-1000 Essential Laptop Docking Station can be seen as a trap for the unwary: It&rsquo;s a true USB-C docking station, and that&rsquo;s not always what you want.</p>



<p>If you buy this dock, you&rsquo;re wading into a mess you may not be aware of. Put simply, this dock is likely to achieve what it sets out to do if you use a laptop with a 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core chip inside: power two 4K displays over just a generic USB-C port. (We haven&rsquo;t tested this dock on a laptop with a Ryzen chip inside and USB4.)</p>



<p>USB-C peripherals have traditionally fallen into two categories: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt docks</a>, which simply blast 40Gbps of data across a USB-C cable; and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">DisplayLink-powered USB-C docking stations</a>, which can be used with a laptop with a USB-C port, but not necessarily Thunderbolt. DisplayLink, now owned by Synaptics, uses a proprietary method of data compression that requires dedicated driver support to approximate the experience of a Thunderbolt dock. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve tended to ignore a third option: a laptop with a USB-C cable that supports what&rsquo;s known as HBR3 with DSC. This high-bitrate option uses its own compression techniques in conjunction with the DisplayPort standard, but it needs support by the laptop processor, the GPU, and the dock. This solution is plug-and-play, though, so you should know instantly if it works. </p>



<p>The bottom line is that HBR3 with DSC claims to offer similar performance to what DisplayLink offers (4K60 output to two displays), but support has been inconsistent. Our experience with 11th-gen Core laptops has been that HBR with DSC support is a crapshoot, but 12th-gen and 13th-gen hardware are supported and offer consistent, successful experiences&mdash;especially if your laptop falls under Intel&rsquo;s Evo laptop brand, which undergoes further testing.</p>



<p>So, do you want to deal with all that? Assuming you do, well, CA&rsquo;s DS-1000 delivers with the right hardware.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Cyber Acoustics (CA) UD-1000 USB-C docking station back" class="wp-image-1513960" height="731" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CA-UD-1000-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The rear ports of the Cyber Acoustics DS-1000 USB-C docking station.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>This slim plastic dock measures a hair over six inches wide and about three inches deep. It lacks a stand, and warms rather sharply under load. But it packs a pair of HDMI ports on the rear, four 5Gbps USB-A ports on the back, as well as gigabit ethernet. The USB-C cable, measuring about 2.5 feet, snakes out from the side of the dock. (CA&rsquo;s manual and documentation is lousy, by the way, so we&rsquo;re not quite clear what HDMI port technology it uses.) On the front is another USB Type A port and a USB-C port, too. </p>



<p>The latter USB-C port can be used to charge your smartphone, as it puts out 6.7W of charging power, or enough to fast-charge a smartphone. Otherwise, this is a powered dock, and it will supply 90W of charging power to your laptop, too.</p>



<p>Our test laptops use Thunderbolt 4 connections. Our 12th- and 13th-gen laptops did fine on both a dual 4K output as well as one 4K and one widescreen 1440p display. On an 11th-gen laptop, the DS-1000 could only manage 4K at 30Hz, rather than 60Hz&mdash;which is what CA promises, actually. This was the case for an 11th-gen laptop with Thunderbolt 4, and a second laptop with just a USB-C port. Both laptops included discrete GPUs.</p>



<p>(Are we cheating to use a Thunderbolt 4-equipped laptop? We don&rsquo;t think so. Remember, this dock is $189, relatively cheap for even a budget Thunderbolt dock&mdash;which this isn&rsquo;t. If you can save some cash, why not?)</p>



<p>Streaming 4K60 video via YouTube across the integrated ethernet port worked flawlessly, with just a handful of dropped frames. Those increased when we flipped between tabs on the other display, or moved the window around. There wasn&rsquo;t any lag while moving windows around on either display, and we noticed no stuttering at all, even when copying data from the laptop to an external SSD. </p>



<p>We still wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this dock for gaming, though.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re not formally recommending the Cyber Acoustics DS-1000, because of its compatibility issues with older hardware. But if you&rsquo;re willing to invest the time (and let&rsquo;s face it, Amazon&rsquo;s return policy) this is a relatively inexpensive docking station that can be used in an office or home office.</p>

## Windows 11’s terrible taskbar is about to get a lot more useful

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Look, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s ultra-nerfed taskbar sucks</a>. It just does. But hopeful tidbits from new Windows Insider preview builds suggest about to get a <em>lot </em>more useful, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398949/tune-windows-10-productivity-tips.html">streamlining your Windows productivity</a> in the process.</p>



<p>First up, a much-needed correction. Windows 10 offers a search bar right in the taskbar, where you can type in a query and send your system a-scouring with a simple click of you Enter button. But Windows 11 maddeningly replaced that with a search <em>button</em> that instead opens a separate pop-up window used for search, forcing you to navigate several clicks and interfaces just to find a file. Why, Microsoft, <em>why</em>?</p>



<p>Fortunately, that&rsquo;s about to end. As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-bring-back-taskbar-search-box&amp;xcust=2-1-1520692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>, the latest Windows 11 Release Preview once again places a proper search bar back in the taskbar&mdash;and better yet, it&rsquo;s enabled by default, at least in the Release Preview. It can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>



<p>Next, Internet detectives discovered a <em>new</em> taskbar feature that could render the most common reason to open the Task Manager obsolete. As first reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-will-let-you-end-tasks-directly-from-the-taskbar/&amp;xcust=2-1-1520692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a>, Twitter user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/PhantomOfEarth/status/1625964564637515807&amp;xcust=2-1-1520692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PhantomOfEarth</a> found an option hidden in the new Windows 11 Insider build 25300 that lets you forcibly end a task by simply right-clicking on its icon in the taskbar. <em>Yessssss</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">You will soon be able to quickly end an entire task/process by right clicking it on the taskbar and choosing a new 'End task' option, Task Manager style. New in build 25300 and hidden.<br /><br />vivetool /enable /id:42592269 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/mdw9XLeQln&amp;xcust=2-1-1520692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/mdw9XLeQln</a></p>&mdash; PhantomOcean3&#128153;&#128155; (@PhantomOfEarth) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/PhantomOfEarth/status/1625964564637515807?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1520692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">February 15, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When games get wonky or applications freeze, the easiest way around it is usually to press <em>Crtl + Shift + Esc</em> to summon the Task Manager, find the troublesome app in the active Processes tab, click on it, then select <em>End Task</em>. Having that option a simple right-click away in your taskbar would be a massive quality of life upgrade.</p>



<p>If it sees the light of day, that is. Phantom Ocean needed to dig deep into the guts of the Insider build using a custom-made ViVe utility to find and unlock the capability. Microsoft did <em>not </em>intend this feature to see the light of day yet and it may still be canned. But I hope it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>Neither of these handy-dandy upgrades will make the Windows 11 taskbar&rsquo;s controversial interface much better. But they should save you time in your everyday life and every second you spend <em>not</em> clicking through needlessly tedious interfaces is a second you get to spend actually enjoying your life. Nobody likes fighting with computers for no reason.</p>

<p>Twitter is a wild, wild place these days. From massive <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">data leaks</a> to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479844/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-apps.html">banning third-party clients</a>, it seems like it&rsquo;s going to implode at any moment. Now, Twitter has something else up its sleeve. According to The Verge&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23605073/twitter-blue-charge-sms-2fa&amp;xcust=2-1-1519080-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reporting</a>, unless you pay for the monthly subscription service (aka Twitter Blue), the social media site will turn off your SMS-based <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407376/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-which-2fa-apps-are-best.html">two-factor authentication</a> after March 20. </p>



<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) offers additional protection to your online accounts by requiring a password and a one-time code via text or app. It&rsquo;s the first line of defense in keeping unwanted hackers out of your social media account. The fact that Twitter is stripping away SMS (text) 2FA (unless you pay up) might be annoying, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you are without recourse</p>



<p>Getting 2FA codes via SMS isn&rsquo;t the most reliable option anyway, as the code could be potentially intercepted by hackers. That&rsquo;s why we recommend opting for an authentication app like LastPass Authenticator or Google Authenticator. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to add these apps to Twitter, don&rsquo;t worry. The team at PCWorld put together an easy step-by-step guide below.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-add-an-authentication-app-to-twitter">How to add an authentication app to Twitter</h2>



<p>Adding an authentication app to Twitter is easier than you&rsquo;d think. There are quite a few options to choose from. In our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407376/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-which-2fa-apps-are-best.html">best 2FA</a> software and hardware, the Google Authenticator app nabbed the top spot, as it&rsquo;s simple to use and it doesn&rsquo;t require an internet connection.</p>



<p>Google Authenticator is a free smartphone app that&rsquo;s available for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1519080-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605&amp;xcust=2-1-1519080-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>. The app generates a fresh code every 30 seconds, which reduces the likelihood of a nefarious hacker getting their hands on it. You can also add as many accounts as you&rsquo;d like, which is pretty darn cool.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s how to add an authentication app to your Twitter account. <strong>This only works on desktop, not mobile.</strong></p>



<p>Open your Twitter profile and select <em>More</em>, which lives on the left side of the screen.</p>

<p>The Gigabyte is rocking an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB of PCIe SSD storage. Oh <em>my</em> that&rsquo;s loaded. Expect it to zip through most games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. The 16-inch AMOLED display is gorgeous, too. It has a crystal clear resolution of 3840&times;2400 and a refresh rate of 60Hz. The refresh rate isn&rsquo;t the highest we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a gaming laptop, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a problem, and it&rsquo;s a common tradeoff when you&rsquo;re gaming on a 4K panel. </p>



<p>This is fantastic deal. We&rsquo;d recommend swooping in sooner rather than later, though. We don&rsquo;t expect this deal to last long at all. It&rsquo;s absolutely killer.</p>

<p>For the ultimate example of a simple tool with hidden depths, look to the desktop web browser.</p>



<p>You needn&rsquo;t be a tech whiz to know the basics of how to visit a website or search the web. Even the notion of opening, closing, and rearranging browser tabs is pretty straightforward. But behind those basics are all kinds of powerful features that make web browsing more efficient.</p>



<p>Below are 10 essential browser tricks that everyone ought to know. Note that most of these features work in any web browser, whether it&rsquo;s Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Chromium-based browsers (such as Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi):</p>



<h2 id="learn-some-shortcuts">Learn some shortcuts</h2>



<p>While most web browsers offer <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.howtogeek.com/114518/47-keyboard-shortcuts-that-work-in-all-web-browsers/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">dozens of keyboard shortcuts</a>, chances are you&rsquo;re not going to remember them all. Here are a handful of the most helpful ones, well worth committing to memory right away:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Ctr + T:</strong>&nbsp;New tab</li><li><strong>Ctrl + W:</strong>&nbsp;Close the current or selected tab</li><li><strong>Ctrl + L:</strong>&nbsp;Highlight the address bar</li><li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + B:</strong>&nbsp;Show or hide bookmarks</li><li><strong>Ctrl + F:</strong>&nbsp;Find text in page</li></ul>



<h2 id="manipulate-multiple-tabs">Manipulate multiple tabs</h2>



<p>In all browsers except Safari, select individual tabs by holding Ctrl, or hold Shift to select an entire range. After selecting a bunch of tabs, you can re-arrange them, drag them out into a separate browser window, or&mdash;for maximum satisfaction&mdash;press&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl + W</strong>&nbsp;to close them all at once.</p>



<h2 id="save-tabs-for-later">Save tabs for later</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bookmark all tabs in Chrome" class="wp-image-1511497" height="640" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bookmarktabs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>No need to get anxious about closing your browser and losing all your tabs. Just right-click the area next to your tabs in Chrome&mdash;or right-click the tabs themselves in Firefox and Microsoft Edge&mdash;then select <em>Bookmark all tabs</em>. This will create a new folder with all your open tabs in it. (In Safari for MacOS, you&rsquo;ll find a similar option under <em>Bookmarks &gt; Add Bookmarks for These Tabs</em>.)</p>



<p>I suggest saving the folder to your bookmarks bar for easy access. Then, you can right-click the folder for an option to open them all at the same time.</p>



<h2 id="turn-sites-into-apps">Turn sites into apps</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Gmail opened as a web app" class="wp-image-1511498" height="764" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gmailwebapp.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Turning websites into standalone desktop apps can be a huge efficiency booster, especially for app-like websites such as Gmail, Google Keep, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.notion.so/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Notion</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://raindrop.io/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Raindrop</a>. Instead of getting all the usual web browser clutter, you can launch these sites in free-standing windows that show nothing but the actual web content. You can also add them to your desktop, Start Menu, or taskbar for easy access, and quickly switch between them with the Alt + Tab menu in Windows.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how to create a desktop app out of any website:</p>



<ul><li><strong>In Chrome:</strong>&nbsp;In the vertical &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; menu, click <em>More Tools &gt; Create Shortcut</em>, then make sure <em>Open as window</em> is checked.</li><li><strong>In Microsoft Edge:</strong>&nbsp;In the &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; menu, click <em>Apps &gt; Install this site as an app</em>.</li><li><strong>In Vivaldi:</strong>&nbsp;Right click any tab, select <em>Create Shortcut</em>, then check <em>Open as Window</em>.</li></ul>



<h2 id="share-tabs-with-a-qr-code">Share tabs with a QR code</h2>



<p>Want a fast way to send a website to your phone? Click the Share icon in the Chrome address bar (or click the address itself in Edge or Vivaldi), then click the icon that looks like a set of four squares. With your phone camera, point at the QR code, then tap the link that pops up. (For other browsers, see the &ldquo;Bookmarklets&rdquo; section below.)</p>



<p>While there are other tab-sharing methods to consider, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-tabs-between-devices-google-chrome/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Send Tab feature in Chrome</a>, I always come back to QR codes because of how intentional and dependable they are.</p>



<h2 id="change-up-your-new-tab-page">Change up your new tab page</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Tabliss new tab page for Chrome" class="wp-image-706420" height="706" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tabliss.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Most web browsers&rsquo; new tab pages are either dreadfully boring (see: Google Chrome) or full of unwanted clutter (see: Microsoft Edge). To shake things up, try installing an alternative new tab extension instead.</p>

<h2 id="harness-incognito-mode">Harness incognito mode</h2>



<p>The private modes built into most web browsers aren&rsquo;t merely for unmentionable activities. They&rsquo;re also a quick way to&nbsp;browse in a logged-out state. This has all kinds of innocent (or semi-innocent) uses, such as viewing non-personalized results on websites, bypassing the occasional paywall, checking a second online account without logging out in your main window, and searching Google without tying the results to your profile.</p>



<h2 id="use-picture-in-picture">Use picture-in-picture</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Safari picture-in-picture" class="wp-image-1511499" height="689" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/browserpip.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Firefox and Safari both offer handy picture-in-picture modes that always show your video in a small preview window. In Firefox, just click the little picture-in-picture icon that appears next to any video. Firefox even lets you open multiple picture-in-picture windows at the same time. In Safari, right-click the speaker icon in the address bar, then select <em>Enter Picture in Picture</em>.</p>



<p>For Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, you&rsquo;ll have to install Google&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Picture-in-Picture extension</a>&nbsp;instead. Then, click the extension icon or hit&nbsp;Alt + P&nbsp;while a video is playing to enter picture-in-picture mode.</p>



<h2 id="sort-your-extensions">Sort your extensions</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Pinned extension menu in Chrome" class="wp-image-1511500" height="809" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pinnedextensions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve installed a lot of browser extensions, take a minute to decide which ones should appear next to your address bar. Generally, you&rsquo;ll want to show the ones that require regular interaction&mdash;your password manager or the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Camelizer</a>, for instance&mdash;and hide the passive extensions such as ad blockers and&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.modernwiki.app/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Modern for Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>To manage your pinned extensions in most Chromium-based browsers, right-click the puzzle-shaped extension icon, then pin the ones you want to see on the toolbar.</p>



<h2 id="add-custom-extension-commands">Add custom extension commands</h2>



<p>Avid extension users should also consider setting up keyboard shortcuts to activate them. You might, for instance, assign Ctrl+Shift+Z to view your recently closed tabs in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabbie-undo-closed-tabs/piepmnmkfdajejodnppndgeogppepdld&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tabbie</a>, or assign Ctrl+Shift+F to extract text from images with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copyfish-%F0%9F%90%9F-free-ocr-soft/eenjdnjldapjajjofmldgmkjaienebbj/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Copyfish</a>.</p>



<p>In Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, head to the extensions menu, then click the sidebar and select <em>Extension shortcuts</em>. From here you&rsquo;ll see a list of compatible extensions, along with the option to assign a shortcut to each one. Firefox users can head to <em>Add-ons and Themes</em>, then click the gear icon and select <em>Manage Extension Shortcuts</em>.</p>



<h2 id="use-browser-bookmarklets">Use browser bookmarklets</h2>



<p>Bookmarklets are a powerful tool that can perform complex actions with one click, all from your browser&rsquo;s bookmarks bar. Some popular examples:</p>

## A defense of the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti by a 1440p gamer
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502698/a-defense-of-the-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-by-a-1440p-gamer.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502698/a-defense-of-the-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-by-a-1440p-gamer.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Everything about Nvidia&rsquo;s new GeForce RTX 40-series graphics cards are big: the size, the performance gains, and especially the price. With some versions of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">GeForce RTX 4090</a> retailing for almost $2,000, gamers were anxious for a more reasonably priced modern Nvidia GPU, but is the $800 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti the solution? </p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">the PCWorld review</a>, we called it &ldquo;painfully overpriced&rdquo; without enough power for 4K gaming, and other reviews agree. And yet, the 4070 Ti is perfect for people like me who refuse to give up on 1440p gaming. In that niche, there&rsquo;s really no better choice.</p>



<h2 id="the-price-is-rightish">The price is right(ish)</h2>



<p>Video card prices have finally, mercifully fallen after years of scarcity thanks to the crypto boom and pandemic supply chain difficulties. But they haven&rsquo;t come down to Earth yet. It is absolutely true that the $800 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is &ldquo;overpriced,&rdquo; especially when many vendors are selling their customized versions for even more. But it&rsquo;s also true that <em>all </em>current-gen video cards are too expensive.</p>



<p>Part of the blame rests with Nvidia and AMD, which probably got comfortable with obscenely high GPU prices over the past several years. On the other hand, we&rsquo;re letting them get away with it. We consumers also became so accustomed to seeing top-of-the-line video cards selling for thousands of dollars that, perhaps, the $1,600 starting price for the RTX 4090 didn&rsquo;t set off the alarm bells it should have&mdash;people still lined up to buy them.</p>

<p>All the latest GPUs could stand to be a few hundred dollars cheaper. While Nvidia&rsquo;s new Ada Lovelace-based RTX 40-series GPUs offer a substantial performance uplift over older cards, the prices of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">GeForce RTX 4080</a> and 4090 are bonkers when you can get a 4K-capable PS5 or Xbox Series X for a third of the price.</p>



<p>Sure, when you compare the RTX 4070 Ti to previous GeForce XX70 cards, the price looks ridiculous&mdash;but it&rsquo;s still a blazing-fast GPU. The 4070 Ti is faster than the fastest RTX 30-series cards, some of which came with MSRPs well over $1,500. By that measure, the RTX 4070 Ti isn&rsquo;t <em>terribly</em> overpriced, and it&rsquo;s just right for 1440p gamers.</p>



<h2>An imperfect champion</h2>



<p>Before the much-maligned RTX 4070 Ti, Nvidia released the GeForce RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080, both of which are monstrously powerful GPUs. The card we now know as the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti was initially intended to be a 12GB variant of the 4080, but Nvidia <a href="https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=50b714da855b604aa&amp;q=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuyKn2ivD8AhV5jIkEHSJ8APoQFnoECAAQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jUqcwUQNEP3B0hP4susHy">un-launched that card</a> to rebrand it. That makes sense, given its narrower memory bandwidth and a big drop in CUDA cores compared to the 4080.</p>



<p>Even with those limitations, it&rsquo;s faster than last-gen $2,000 RTX 3090 Ti in many games. And if you&rsquo;ve committed to 1440p gaming, the 4070 Ti will run almost anything you can throw at it with maximum settings. It&rsquo;s always best to play games at your monitor&rsquo;s native resolution, and going 4K is a major commitment. You always need to be on the bleeding edge of graphical technology to keep up with the latest games. If you can&rsquo;t justify the expense of constant GPU upgrades, then you&rsquo;re not getting the most from your fancy ultra-high-resolution display.</p>

<p>For my money, 1440p just makes more sense. It looks much sharper than Full HD, and you don&rsquo;t need to double the cost of your build to render games at native resolution. When I was looking at GPUs for my new workstation/gaming rig, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti was the clear winner, and I&rsquo;m not alone&mdash;this card is reportedly topping sales charts. At 1440p, the it&rsquo;ss fast enough to run games with the bells and whistles <em>and </em>higher frame rates, which is more important to my gaming experience than 4K. I can&rsquo;t imagine spending 50 percent more to get a 4080 when I&rsquo;d experience almost no benefit.</p>



<p>But where is AMD in all of this? The new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">Radeon RX 7900 cards</a> are certainly no slouches, putting up numbers at least in the same ballpark as Nvidia for a little less cash. However, AMD is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1483242/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-vs-amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-which-is-better.html">running at least a full generation behind on ray tracing performance</a>, and I don&rsquo;t see the point in buying a high-end GPU with sub-standard ray tracing in 2023. I&rsquo;ll admit, I was a ray tracing skeptic at first, but game developers have been doing some amazing things. It&rsquo;s worth prioritizing, and for me, it sealed the deal for the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti.</p>

## Microsoft expands Bing chat limits, but becomes boring

<p>Microsoft is tightening its restrictions on its Bing chat AI chatbot in an attempt to limit its &ldquo;atypical use cases&rdquo;&hellip; and loosening them, too. </p>



<p>Last Friday, Microsoft said it would limit the number of individual chats per session to five, and cap interactions with the chatbot at 50. On Tuesday, Microsoft expanded that to six per session, or 60 per day, and said it hoped to move to 100 chats per day, soon.</p>



<p>The reason? Microsoft said that it found that prolonged interactions with the Bing Chat AI produced some of the interactions that have been broadly characterized as weird: professions of love, vaguely threatening responses, and so on. Microsoft&rsquo;s goal seems to be to maximize its utility, without dialing up the crazy.</p>



<p>&ldquo;These long and intricate chat sessions are not something we would typically find with internal testing,&rdquo; Microsoft <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.bing.com/search/february-2023/The-new-Bing-and-Edge-Increasing-Limits-on-Chat-Sessions&amp;xcust=2-1-1519557-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said Tuesday</a>. &ldquo;In fact, the very reason we are testing the new Bing in the open with a limited set of preview testers is precisely to find these atypical use cases from which we can learn and improve the product.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Bing Chat government" class="wp-image-1519563" height="661" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-communism.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft sems to have returned Bing to its primary role as a search engine.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Users complained, however, that the restrictions made Bing too bland, and the small window of interaction in a typical &ldquo;session&rdquo; was too small to allow much interaction, and that a typical search generated a small chat window in the traditional list of links&mdash;which counted against a user&rsquo;s quota. Executives said on Twitter that counting chats generated in the search results against a user&rsquo;s limit was a mistake.</p>



<p>Microsoft said that it&rsquo;s also trying to strike a balance between facts and creativity. </p>



<p>&ldquo;We are also going to begin testing an additional option that lets you choose the tone of the Chat from more Precise&mdash;which will focus on shorter, more search-focused answers&mdash;to Balanced, to more Creative&mdash;which gives you longer and more chatty answers,&rdquo; Microsoft added. &nbsp;The goal is to give you more control on the type of chat behavior to best meet your needs.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Bing Chat boring" class="wp-image-1519562" height="776" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-is-boring.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Is Bing  boring?</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The problem is that Microsoft also appears to be drastically reeling Bing in. A quick few queries asked of the Bing Chat on Tuesday produced the same response: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I&rsquo;m still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.&#128591;&rdquo;</p>



<p>When asked why Bing kept declining to answer, Bing didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
