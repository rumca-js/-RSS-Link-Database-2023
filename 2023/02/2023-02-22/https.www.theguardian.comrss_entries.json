In the playground afterwards everybody was running around, rubbing their hands, doing a \u2018Jewish\u2019 voice. It was cringe-making.\u201d Nothing she saw as an adult reassured her. \u201cI\u2019ve seen productions where Shylock is mocked. I\u2019ve seen versions where he\u2019s a complete victim. I don\u2019t know which is worse.\u201d</p><p>Oberman gradually reimagined Shylock as a tough-as-nails widow, informed by her own family history. At 15, her great-grandmother came to England from her Belarus shtetl. Widowhood left her \u201ca tough single mother in London\u2019s East End. She lived in two rooms in a tenement flat near Cable Street until she was 98.\u201d Oberman recalls other indomitable aunties: Machine-gun Molly (\u201cmen were terrified of her\u201d) and Sarah Portugal, who \u201csmoked a pipe, wore a slash of red lipstick \u2013 everything that was anathema to the aristocratic English. The very thing that made them survivors also made them outsiders \u2013 too loud, too brash, too strong, too opinionated.\u201d<br /><br />It led her to set The Merchant in 1936, when the Jewish community in London\u2019s East End was threatened by Oswald Mosley\u2019s British Union of Fascists. Antonio, the merchant who visits Shylock to secure a loan (penalty for defaulting: the infamous pound of flesh) is based on Mosley. Portia, who humiliates Shylock in court, is inspired by the aristocratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/oct/17/looking-back-the-mitford-sisterslooking-back-the-mitford-sisters\">Mitford sisters</a>. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a dictator the Mitfords didn\u2019t love,\u201d says Oberman, adding, \u201cPortia is seen as the beautiful heroine but actually, she\u2019s a fucking bitch. She destroys Shylock and doesn\u2019t need to.\u201d<br /><br />Mosley\u2019s blackshirts attacked Jewish people and property, preparing to march through the district on 4 October 1936. \u201cThe police were beating up Jews and antifascists, not protecting them,\u201d Oberman explains. \u201cMy great-grandmother always reminded me that their neighbours \u2013 their Irish neighbours, the small African-Caribbean community, the dockers, the working classes \u2013 all stood together. In our time, when nefarious sources try to pit minorities against each other, I hope this play shows we\u2019re stronger, prouder and safer together.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/22/antisemitic-jewish-actors-directors-merchant-of-venice-shylock-tracy-ann-oberman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/22/antisemitic-jewish-actors-directors-merchant-of-venice-shylock-tracy-ann-oberman", "date_published": "2023-02-22 17:28:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK inflation could fall below 2% this year, Citi forecasts", "description": "<p>Falling gas prices and CPI decline could boost public finances before 2024 general election </p><p>Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation</a> rate could fall to below 2% by the end of the year, according to new financial industry forecasts, handing the chancellor a boost to the public finances before a general election in 2024.</p><p>Predictions that falling gas prices will accelerate the decline this year in the consumer prices index (CPI) from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/15/uk-inflation-falls-january-third-consecutive-month\"> last month\u2019s level of 10.1%</a> could also support a recovery in household living standards and persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates earlier than expected.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/22/uk-inflation-could-fall-below-2-citi-forecasts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/22/uk-inflation-could-fall-below-2-citi-forecasts", "date_published": "2023-02-22 17:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Conor Benn cleared of doping due to \u2018highly-elevated consumption of eggs\u2019", "description": "<ul><li>World Boxing Council says Benn has \u2018reasonable explanation\u2019</li><li>Fighter still subject to British Boxing Board of Control probe</li></ul><p>Conor Benn has been cleared of a failed drugs test because he ate too many eggs.

But the original Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were just so unwieldy<em>. </em>They needed too many cables and so much space to operate that you had to dedicate a small room to them (which some of my more techy friends happily did). They were expensive, as were the PCs that you needed to run them. And having already played with VR several times at trade shows, the novelty was wearing off fast. Cool, sure, but the future of gaming? Nah.</p><p>The original PlayStation VR headset was the least technically powerful of that first wave of home VR tech, and also the least annoying to use. I was obsessed with Tetris Effect, which is a transcendental experience in VR, and its music-game cousin Rez. I played Moss, a charming storybook-style adventure about a mouse.

He spends his days sitting in a wicker chair in a slightly squalid flat annexed to a Victorian castle in Dalkey, smoking cigarillos and looking out to the Irish Sea, bobbing with fishing boats, and an island busy with cormorants. He is not unhappy, though his habits are ossifying and his life has lost all force and momentum; he is certainly lonely, although he perhaps hasn\u2019t let himself understand that. That loneliness is clear in his longing for a visit from his daughter, or the eagerness with which he greets the unexpected appearance of Wilson and O\u2019Casey, former colleagues in Dublin who have come to ask for his help with a case they\u2019re working on.</p><p>Old God\u2019s Time by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (\u00a318.99).

Anyone who knows the feeling of broken bones could see what had happened as soon as he was hit by a Mohammed Siraj short ball during the Delhi Test. The way he yelped and flinched when the physio gently squeezed his arm reflects exactly that bright flash of pain that seems to start in the marrow and end between the temples.</p><p>It was strange then that the initial response from Australia\u2019s captain and coach was that he might recover for the third Test a little more than a week away. The elbow fracture sustained is small \u2013 at the team hotel on Tuesday night Warner sat comfortably and only wore a light compression bandage around the injury. But even a tiny fracture hampers all movement anywhere near it. It radiates discomfort. It throbs like a bad tooth. He was never going to be able to hit a cricket ball so soon.<br /><br />Nursing him through the series might have made sense had Warner been the gun player in the line-up blazing runs, but this felt more like making a point that he remains firmly the first-choice opener. Now team management gets a convenient chance to try Travis Head at the top without being seen to have made a definitive call on Warner. The latter\u2019s declining returns have been talked about plenty: his fighting 200 against South Africa\u2019s pace in the Boxing Day Test ensured he would join this India tour, but it is also his only time past 50 in his last 15 innings. His career has never seen a streak that quiet.<br /><br />His two cheap dismissals in Nagpur helped set the tone for Australia\u2019s substandard batting across the match. Those who only follow cricket from the scorecard will think the same of his 15 at Delhi, but that innings weathered a fierce opening hour, added a 50-run opening partnership, and gave the stability for Usman Khawaja to get set and go on to top score. Even the fetishists of hard noses and hard edges can\u2019t credibly complain about getting out after your arm gets broken.<br /><br />Still. In a small sample size, Warner didn\u2019t show a method for India that inspired confidence. He is a player that Australia want batting for a day, not an hour. With Cameron Green coming back, Peter Handscomb managing the conditions well and Head seeing the ball the way he is, Warner\u2019s absence leaves the side looking balanced in these conditions.<br /><br />Head as an opener could work because he loves thrashing pace bowling, and the scant few overs of it that any Australian might see will come at the top of the innings. Even when the spinners follow up, a newer ball might suit his attacking shots. His style in these conditions is a gamble that could equally fail, but his bright start in the second innings in Delhi suggests he might pull off a couple more such efforts.<br /><br />That isn\u2019t a viable option after this tour, though. Head\u2019s propensity for thrashing the ball between cover and backward point would be a liability in England, where the ball swings and seams early while a cordon of catchers waits for the inevitable. His spot at number five has been perfect, facing an older ball while he either presses home an advantage or counterattacks in difficulty.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/22/david-warner-exit-leaves-australian-test-team-looking-balanced-in-india\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/22/david-warner-exit-leaves-australian-test-team-looking-balanced-in-india", "date_published": "2023-02-22 06:09:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "India is a big global player \u2013\u00a0but there are problems it must tackle | Nouriel Roubini", "description": "<p>Now Modi\u2019s government has modernised it must make growth sustainable, inclusive and fair</p><p>India is poised to become the world\u2019s most important country in the medium term.
