This game doesn't directly feature Kiryu and company, instead having those characters and actors playing roles in a historical epic about the changing political landscape in Japan during the 1860s. While the cast and setting might not be familiar to fans of the series, the selection of minigames will make them feel right at home. Since this is a remake of an older game, it doesn't have quite the variety or quantity that some of the more modern entries do, but there are a few unique ones.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Classics like karaoke and dancing make their return in Like A Dragon: Ishin, both of which have been tweaked to better fit the historical setting. Fishing also appears, although this version is a bit more simplistic than it has been in other entries. Some of the unique activities include fighting scarecrows and chicken racing. While some of these games are less interactive and more focused on gambling, things like chicken racing are involved enough to hold your attention.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A few other minigames include the classic fighting arena, where you can test your might and skills in combat against multiple opponents. There is also another fighting-focused activity, which is the battle trooper raids you can go one with your trooper squad. These are short dungeons that have you utilize your troopers and their skills. Here are 10 fun minigames you can play in Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Arena</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102662-arena.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Fighting Arena is a staple of the Yakuza franchise, and it makes an appearance in Like A Dragon: Ishin as well. At the Arena, located in Mukurogai, you can either fight five enemies in a row, with each set of enemies tougher than the last, or a 100-person gauntlet. Completing fights earns you materials and Arena points, which can be used to purchase a variety of items, like materials for crafting or plates which can be sold for money.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wood Chopping</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102663-choppingwood.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Located in the southeastern part of Fushimi, you can find an old man struggling to chop enough wood for him and his family. You can do it for him and earn some money in the process, but the fun part is chopping the wood itself. Chopping functions like a rhythm game, as you need to chop at the exact moment the axe lights up blue, with Sakamoto's speed increasing with every successful chop.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cooking</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102664-cooking.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>At your homestead, you can grow vegetables in your garden. These vegetables can be used to cook meals, along with some fish you can catch. The meals themselves can either be sold or eaten for health, but before you can enjoy some home cooking, you need to cook. This requires you to chop vegetables, pour seasoning, keep the flame hot, and even grill fish. The more complicated the dish, the more difficult it is to cook.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Buyo Dancing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102665-dancing.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Buyo Dancing is a traditional type of Japanese dance, typically done with a hand fan. You can practice your dance moves at Nichibuza in Rakunai. Dancing is similar to the karaoke minigame, where you must press the correct buttons in the style of a rhythm game, with the challenge increasing as you reach the more complicated dances. While similar to karaoke, the way the buttons are presented and the way you time pressing them is quite different.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gambling Galore</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102666-poker.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>At the Gambling Den in Rakugai, you can find a wide variety of different card games to play. There are plenty of Japanese gambling games like Koi-Koi, Oicho-Kabu, Cee-Lo, and more. There are also familiar favorites like Poker, which comes in three different varieties. If you are looking to make a quick buck or just want to relax with some video game gambling, there are plenty of options at the Gambling Den.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scarecrow Chateau</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102667-scarecrow.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Similar to the Arena, the Scarecrow Chateau is a test of your fighting skills, but while the Arena tests strength and endurance, the chateau tests speed. The Scarecrow Chateau features a series of mini challenges, where you must defeat a bunch of scarecrows in a room under a strict time limit. Some of the challenges even limit which fighting style you can use, forcing you to get comfortable with all of the fighting styles. The Scarecrow Chateau also rewards materials and other rare items for successfully completing the trails.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Chicken Racing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102668-chicken.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like A Dragon: Ishin features a gambling-focused event starring chickens. Chicken Racing takes place in Rakuhai, where you can bet money on chickens as they run around a track. Each race has a different distance and set of chickens, making it a difficult minigame to master. But there are a variety of things to bet on and the payout can be anywhere from double to 20 times your initial bet, making it a lucrative way to earn money.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fishing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102669-fishing.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>There are a variety of places to fish in Kyo, with river fishing available in the southernmost part of the map. In the same location, you can find a boat to take you to different ocean fishing locations. Fishing is necessary for cooking, and the fish can be sold as part of your home business. The game itself is quite simple, with you casting your rod near fish, waiting for them to bite, and catching them at the perfect moment. You don't need to reel the fish, making it simpler than some other video game versions of fishing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Karaoke</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102670-singing.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A Yakuza staple, Karaoke makes its return at the Utamaruya singing bar in Fushimi. While the technology hasn't been invented yet at this point in history, that doesn't stop you from belting out a wide variety of Japanese songs at the bar. This version of Karaoke feels similar to how it works in the other games in the series, where you must press the buttons shown on screen in-sync with the song in order to achieve the highest possible score.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Battle Trooper Raids</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102671-battletrooperraids.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Once you join the Shinsengumi and become captain of the third division, you get access to special raids. During these raids you must utilize your troopers and their special abilities to go through a short dungeon filled with enemies. These dungeons typically conclude with a mini boss fight and reward a hefty amount of materials upon completion. These dungeons can be pretty challenging, so it's a great way to test out your combat abilities.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/10-best-minigames-in-like-a-dragon-ishin/2900-4656/", "date_published": "2023-02-22 20:04:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Activision Responds To Huge Hack That May Have Leaked Future COD Info", "description": "<p>Activision has been the victim of a hack that may have leaked information about the future of Call of Duty and more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkg7pn/hacker-breaches-activision-slack-steals-call-of-duty-info\">Vice</a> report, hackers accessed this information by tricking an employee into giving them their SMS two-factor authentication code to log in to their Slack.

In the world of gaming, Okada is best-known for his work on commercials, particularly those for PlayStation. In fact, you likely know his most notable work--a very concise one--as it appears in countless PlayStation commercials. Not only did he compose and produce the music that played during several highly odd and memorable Crash Bandicoot ads in the '90s, as shown in the below video, but he also created the iconic sound that accompanies the appearance of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj8LmtnfqtI\">PlayStation logo</a>.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">It's a sound that's stood the test of time, lasting more than 25 years as an indelible part of the brand.

Its then-new HD-2D engine was a delight to behold, and the gameplay drew inspiration from some of Square Enix's most storied franchises: a deep Final Fantasy-style class and customization system mixed with the non-linear exploration and story of the SaGa series with a dash of combat that took cues from Bravely Default. These are great inspirations to draw from, but it resulted in a game that, while excellent, seemed to be struggling for a distinct identity. Perhaps the developers recognized this as well--with Octopath Traveler II, Square Enix seems to be trying to add new gameplay elements that give the franchise a personality of its own. And, for the most part, it has succeeded admirably.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The core of Octopath Traveler II is a traditional, turn-based JRPG with many of the usual gameplay elements: towns and dungeons to explore, objectives to complete, etc. Where most JRPGs present a linear method of progression, however, Octopath Traveler takes a very different approach: You begin the game by selecting a \"main\" character from eight candidates. This character has their own unique background, story arc, and goals, and will serve as a constant presence throughout your playtime. After an introductory story chapter, you are then free to explore the world to your liking. Eventually, you'll meet the other seven characters, allowing you to bring them into your party and follow their storylines as well, all culminating in a finale that ties the individual story threads together.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The focus on individual character arcs rather than a huge, high-stakes threat for most of the game's runtime is refreshing, allowing Octopath Traveler II to tell a variety of intriguing stories that vary wildly in both tone and focus. Some of them are comparatively weaker, but others command and hold your attention and keep you eager for more. Agnea's star-struck search for fame is notably bland, for instance, while Temenos' investigation into a murder plot by a religious cult and Throne's quest to kill the adoptive parents who raised her are excellent stand-outs. My personal favorite questline is the story of Osvald, who I chose as my starting character--a tale of a scholar who plans a Count-of-Monte-Christo-style prison escape and revenge after being framed for the murder of his own family by a scheming colleague.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-22 16:47:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Gladiator 2 Star Talks About The Sequel Fans Have Been Waiting 20 Years For", "description": "<p>Actor Paul Mescal will play the lead in Gladiator 2 from Ridley Scott, and the actor has now commented on the film, including how he landed the part, what his plans are for a physical transformation of his body, and more.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/paul-mescal-aftersun-oscar-nomination-normal-people-gladiator-1235330756/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mescal said Scott offered him the role of Lucius--he did not have to audition.

While we still have no clue what the game is actually about, they at least showed way more of Hyrule in this trailer than any other trailer to date. This was followed shortly after by a significant (and seemingly legitimate) leak, full of spoilers for the anticipated game. Rest assured we aren't going into any information from the leak here, and instead focusing only on what Nintendo has officially announced. Specifically, we're taking a fine-toothed comb to the most recent trailer and analyzing it alongside information from previous trailers and our encyclopedic knowledge of Breath of the Wild. There's a lot to unpack for eagle-eyed fans, and we're here to guide you through all of it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While a ton of new features were shown here, we still don\u2019t know much about what is happening in the game, how combat mechanics are returning, and much more. We will likely have to wait until another grand reveal before the game\u2019s launch on May 12, 2023. In the meantime, let's go back shot by shot, and break down everything in the latest trailer for Tears of the Kingdom. Be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/videos/tears-of-the-kingdom-in-depth-trailer-breakdown/2300-6460605/\">full video breakdown</a> for even more detail.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102275-totkstill_slide1-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The first shots start off fairly slow, only showing us a couple of new things. This angle facing Death Mountain from Mabe prairie shows more spiral patterns on the ground that we\u2019ve seen in previous trailers. The lightning also has a slight green tinge, usually lightning has a more of an off-white-ish color in Breath of the Wild so this may not be a normal thunderstorm. Throughout the trailer there are dozens of examples of strange boulders, piles of malice, and new buildings that repeat themselves, so I won\u2019t go too much into it since we already know the land of Hyrule has changed quite a bit.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102276-totkstill_slide2-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The military training camp next to Korok forest, without the Sheikah tower, is now infested with the new longhorn bokoblins, and a new flying enemy type seen in a previous trailer as well. Previously thought to be Kargaroks, these seem to be entirely new enemies. Since they seem to be plentiful in Hyrule by the amount of times they show up in this trailer, they\u2019re likely to be our new common annoyance while traveling downwards or upwards, and we\u2019ll likely get into lots of aerial combat with them.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102277-totkstill_slide3-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The area between Tabantha and Hebra range is shown next, with two shining towers attached with spotlights. We also get a closer look of a circling storm surrounding Hebra Peak. With another ground design seen again from previous trailers, the purpose for all of these still goes unexplained. Do keep in mind these tower\u2019s shapes and colors though, because you will see them again later in the video. One thing to point out is that Vah Medoh is missing from its perch here above Rito Village, and we still don\u2019t know what happened to the Divine Beasts.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102278-totkstill_slide4-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">It starts to pick up a bit here, as we get to see some strange ground formations that are completely unique from Breath of the Wild. Besides this square platform here, and the ground symbol from the previous shot, you can see this structure North of Gisa Crater sitting on top of Cuho Mountain with a center and sections that jut out in different directions. This is interesting because this is the largest new structure we\u2019ve seen on the ground floor so far.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102279-totkstill_slide5-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This is when it starts to get interesting. With every trailer underground exploration became teased more and more, and now it is a confirmed reality. In this shot we see a Longhorn Bokoblin with a backpack and rock hammer chipping away at a regular ore. While we can\u2019t see upwards to confirm the cavern ceiling, you can pretty much confirm it from the background audio here, which has reverb to match its cave setting, which will be a new addition audio wise since even Breath of the Wild\u2019s underground location did not account for this kind of audio.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You can also see Longhorn Lilzalfos equipped with throwing spears and Lizal Bows, and covered in rising malice, likely all empowered by the new villain. There are also new pools of malice that line the ground as well. Besides the new vegetation and alien looking trees in the background, blue fire dots the ground to the right side. These will-o-wisp type fires could possibly be Poe, but are more likely something seen before in Twilight Princess, souls as seen in the Twilight Realm. We have seen multiple Twilight references along with Skyward references in previous trailers, so we\u2019ll see how this all connects.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102280-totkstill_slide6-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This shot from Hylia Island looking out towards Hyrule castle and Death Mountain has two notable features. On the left you can see a new structure on top of this hill, and what looks like an opening in the hillside leading likely to an underground area. On the right side is a monstrous creature that is most likely to be a Gleeok, a multi headed dragon that spits fire from Zelda 1. If true, this would be its first return to the Zelda series since the very first game. We also get a glimpse of a blue tower behind the Gleeok, which we\u2019ll get back to in a second.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102281-totkstill_slide7-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This camera angle overlooks Hateno Village looking southwest towards the Faron region. Again we see another spiral structure, and new glowing teepee like buildings dotting the main village, with no explanation still on what they are. One last thing in this shot to mull over here is that overworld Sheikah technology is still clearly missing, the ancient furnace here is gone, and Sheikah towers and shrines are still absent. But something strange is here. Again, this blue structure in the far background near Courage Steppe, is highly likely to be the same structure as the red-orange tower here before. So this may mean that unlocking Sheikah technology may still play a key role in the sequel, even though it's not a major mechanic anymore.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102282-totkstill_slide8-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The next several shots show the blood moon turning into a dark crimson before Ganon launches an attack against Hyrule. Hyrule Castle itself has a large crust of malice surrounding it, as well as the bridge to Zelda\u2019s Study broken completely.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102283-totkstill_slide9-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Then a volley of malice souls are sent towards the Great Plateau, landing right above Mount Hylia. Again, one of the spiral structures appears, seemingly replacing Jee Noh Shrine\u2019s location. But something is amiss here, this south wall does not appear like this in-game, this is completely covered in snow and damaged here, so it's highly likely this cutscene occurred in the past, and Breath of the Wild\u2019s great plateau is the aftermath many years later.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102284-totkstill_slide10-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">An explosion follows up, but is probably a different cutscene entirely, as the ground looks like the wide sandy areas of the Gerudo Desert. What's enveloped in the explosion is a mystery though as we can slightly make out a large enemy with what looks like four guardian-like arms and massive claws.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102287-totkstill_slide11-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Magma filled rocks begin to crumble, likely a separate event from the castle crumbling scene that follows. As far as we can tell, Death Mountain\u2019s lava seems to be in-active, so we\u2019ll see how lava and magma in general plays a role in Tears of the Kingdom.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102288-totkstill_slide12-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Great Plateau appears again, and a couple things can be picked out here. Simple things like the Sheikah Tower missing and another ground design appears again. But you can also catch things like more flat patches of malice near previously Oman Au shrine, and the previous shot of the Gleeok guarding the Bridge of Hylia is nowhere to be found. Another interesting thing is guardians are never seen in Tears of the Kingdom so far, but not even their destroyed bodies exist. Multiple guardians bodies usually litter this poolside in Breath of the Wild, while they are completely missing here. Whether it's related to time, sheikah technology's absence, or some other event, it's still unexplained, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102289-totkstill_slide13-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We see a follow up shot to the blood moon volley we saw before, with Bokoblins coming to life out of the blobs of malice that come down, equipped with serrated horns instead of just normal longhorns we\u2019ve seen so far. They land right on top of the Great Plateau wall.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102290-totkstill_slide14-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Then we see many of Hyrule\u2019s new monsters, with several newcomers. This is the first we see of these new Big Bokoblins, and according to the official Zelda Japan twitter, they\u2019re simply called \u201cBoss Bokoblins\u201d. They resemble a mashup of Wind Waker style Moblins with Breath of the Wild\u2019s bokoblins with a toothed crown. Then we get our first look at a Tears of the Kingdom\u2019s re-dead, a zombie-like creature that has appeared in most major Zelda titles. Seeing as they have a history of creepily latching onto Link. I\u2019m not looking forward to seeing that again with its terrifying new jaws. The Bokoblin and Lizalfos also sport new horn pieces.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102291-totkstill_slide15-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Link then rides off near the newly lifted Hyrule Castle on what looks like Epona, which is interesting because Epona was not easy to make canon into the story of Breath of the Wild since it was locked behind an Amiibo. And memories in Breath of the Wild showed Link on a somewhat generic horse, and making Epona canon now would have to make us wonder what the Epona amiibo would be used for now, but we\u2019ll have to see. We again see the circling storm above Hebra, and possibly a new building in front of the Hyrule Castle Gates on the left.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102292-totkstill_slide16-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Then we see a shot from the Great Plateau looking down Oseira Plains, and what looks like a malice wildfire in the distance. It's hard to tell but there may be a Molduga\u2019s head sticking out of the ground here.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102293-totkstill_slide17-4.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Link stands on top of a travel gate getting surrounded by Guardian-like arms, with guide rails on the side that likely make this elevator go upwards. The one arm in front of Link holds a spool hooked to a wire that feeds down below the platform, but we have no idea why it's handing this device to Link. From what I\u2019m seeing here, I personally have some Robbie or Purah vibes from this scene, possibly handling equipment to Link to help them set up a device. This is also one of the first times we see Guardian technology back in Tears of the Kingdom, so this may be Robbie or Purah\u2019s fiddling. Another important thing to point out is this Sheikah platform here which writes \"Transport\" repeating along the sides. This is not the Sheikah Tower travel gate, rather this is the Divine Beast travel gate, which has the same inscription as well. Since these were only found on divine beasts, and Zelda stated in the secret Breath of the Wild ending that the divine beast Vah Ruta has stopped working, and all Divine Beasts are missing, this may have been salvaged tech ripped off of a divine beast, which yet again sounds like something Pura or Robbie would do.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102294-totkstill_slide18-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This location is the Baobab Tree area between the Gerudo Highlands and Satori Mountain. We then see a pack of bokoblins with the Boss Bokoblin ready for battle. The weapon is hard to make out, but from the small details we see the Boss Bokoblin wielding a malice corrupted Soldiers Claymore in one hand. Tears of the Kingdom also seems to be ramping up its enemy with enemy teamwork interactions such as the Boss Bokoblin commanding the Bokoblins to attack all at once. It may become a situation where taking out a leader will cause the enemy squad to become uncoordinated, similar to Halo games with grunts and elites. Another really cool thing to point out here is that they\u2019re using an asset that we never got in Breath of the Wild, this scrap metal horn. This was in development in the first game as a Lynel horn, but never made it to the final release. Now this metal horn comes to life in the hands of this new enemy.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102295-totkstill_slide19-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Hinox makes a return to Tears of the Kingdom, this one sporting some sort of jelly substance on its necklace and a silly looking hat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102296-totkstill_slide20-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Link then takes us on a couple landscape shots over the Seres Scablands and a close up of a ground design on the North Hyrule Plain. Again, in every shot it seems there\u2019s slightly altered terrain littered everywhere, so we won\u2019t go on pointing out every single one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102297-totkstill_slide21-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The next shot points us eastward between the Korok Forest and Typhlo Ruins, which seems to have lost its shrouded black cover. We still don't have a clear view of The Korok Forest or the great deku tree, which is still possibly missing from a previous trailer. We also get to see another enemy with enemy interaction of these new flying types carrying bokoblins. With the Talus bokoblin sniper fort, bokoblin coordinated attacks, and these flying types carrying Bokoblins, Tears of the Kingdom is definitely ramping up its enemy intelligence in interesting ways. You also get a small closeup of the bokoblin\u2019s stone axe, a weapon likely wieldable by one hand with Link, which would be a first, since we only had two handed axes in Breath of the Wild. Also keep in mind that we have yet to see any Dragonbone weapons at all so far, which is interesting and may tie into the lore behind dragons later on.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102298-totkstill_slide22-3.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Looking southwest from Samasa Plain, we see a Moblin picking itself up. While I initially thought that it was the normal getup animation, it's actually the tail end of a new headbutt attack animation, which makes sense with its terrifying new helmet it's sporting, I\u2019m sure it would hurt. As the camera pans left, we see a glimpse of a new enemy skull encampment with scaffolding on top, this time with a nose.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102299-totkstill_slide23-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A towering new blocky Zonai enemy then attacks Link. You can see some dragon-type inspirations on the blocks on its arms. I imagine these blocks are climbable and this will go down very similar to a Shadow of the Colossus fight, with its shiny weak spot conveniently placed up high. Not quite sure if that Rusty Broadsword you\u2019re carrying is gonna do much Link.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102300-totkstill_slide24-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We then see more missing shots of the supposed Ganondorf waking out of his slumber. While it's slightly more context, it is just more shots of the same situation shown in previous trailers.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102301-totkstill_slide25-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">More shots of the open world, from right near death mountain. And while we constantly see new islands in the background of each new trailer, this shot has many of them together, such as the massive cube, the multi-level island. Also, besides the cyclone around Hebra missing again, the islands up here reach up to a massive height, really giving the scope and scale to some of these sky islands.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102302-totkstill_slide26-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Links skydives yet again, dropping down around the Dueling peaks area. From here you can see this pool of malice north of Breman Peak, and the same strange tower poking out of the Faron region again.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102303-totkstill_slide27-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Going for a nice hike along Sahasra Slope, it's mostly more of things you've seen before: ground designs, cubes in the sky, towers and an upgraded enemy camp next to Nabi Lake.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102304-totkstill_slide28-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Link then shoots a balloon type arrow which automatically homes in on the enemy. It's hard to tell if it's Link\u2019s new arm that enables this ability but light green energy does charge up before the shot. The fact that this also automatically goes for the head for critical damage could be great for making non-bullet time headshots count. This is right in the middle of Salari Plain facing east.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102305-totkstill_slide29-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Shield surfing makes a return, and seemingly being able to magnetically attach to metal rails. This is on Death Mountain by the way, which since it\u2019s inactive and filled with malice, can be walked around without fireproof gear now. A Bokoblin here wields a rusty claymore, more mining carts with no bomb cage since we don\u2019t have remote bombs anymore, wooden walls, likely blocking shield surfing but can be rammed through with carts, and a Moblin archer. While Moblins did have bows in Breath of the Wild, they never had the sentry job of being a lookout for encampments. There are also suspicious looking wheels or fans placed in several spots, with shots coming later it could mean something big.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102306-totkstill_slide30-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Link then grabs a gyro with a new skill the arm hasn\u2019t shown yet, a telekinesis type ability. This is likely to replace magnesis since well, we don't have the Sheikah slate anymore.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102307-totkstill_slide31-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Link then does a two-handed jumping attack with this strange weapon. We think this is actually two different items, the staff maybe one piece attached to a canon at the end but there\u2019s no concrete evidence yet. One thing we can point out is that the same broom logo found earlier is found on this creature in a previous trailer, this maybe some sort of connection or power symbol.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102311-totkstill_slide32-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Then a mysterious lady appears. With the amount of information we currently have, there is no way to pinpoint who this is. Theories such as Zelda, Hylia herself, or someone else entirely, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102312-totkstill_slide33-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Again, Link uses telekinesis to lift up a mechanical wheel out of the Great Plateau\u2019s mud pit, and you can make out a new style of treasure chest on this tiny island as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102313-totkstill_slide34-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Then Link appears on a car, on a hot air balloon, and on a hovercraft. By the way they\u2019re presenting this, these machines seem to be buildable depending on pieces you find during your adventures, especially since the base portion with vertical handlebars and white platform are shared across each machine. The headlights are also the same egg/flower shape found on this robot in a previous trailer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102314-totkstill_slide35-1.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We then finally arrive at this shot of Link riding, possibly Epona riding eastward. Several malice pools dot the left side along with a Hylian encampment. Funny thing is, after 5 trailers, this is the first time we ever see an NPC, someone with topknot looking onward. Nintendo is keeping their cards close to their chest when it comes to any other characters in Tears of the Kingdom, and this is the most we\u2019ve ever gotten on that front. A piece of sky island falls from the sky, confirming our suspicion before of using time reversal on fallen pieces to rise upwards.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102315-totkstill_slide36-3.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The last shot shows again more context to how the initial showdown between Link, Zelda and this Ganondorf figure went. You can see malice grip the master sword from the first strike in a previous trailer, and as Ganondorf goes for a second helping, Link drops the Master Sword and goes for Princess Zelda, we all know how that went.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4102316-totkstill_slide37-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Nintendo then decided to release a few screenshots and social media posts that showed just a tad more, with key ones like this picture of Zelda with probably a Sheikah slate. The Sheikah slate in Breath of the Wild was based on the WiiU GamePad, so just a small theory is this could be a re-engineered slate from Purah or Robbie using the body of a switch to keep up with the times.

Though the pink puffball may not spend his free time go-karting or playing tennis, his catalog includes a ton of experimental games and art styles that stretch the limits of what a Kirby game can be. Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, a remastered version of the 2011 Wii game for Nintendo Switch, is in most ways a very traditional Kirby platformer. But its playful spirit, approachability, and a sizable new epilogue campaign make it much more than a retread.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The main story component of Return to Dream Land is a colorful romp as you restore the parts of an alien ship, set to a joyful and buoyant soundtrack. The adorably bulbous alien Magolor crash-lands on Planet Popstar and seeks help from Kirby and his friends. Those allies are a major component this time, because Dream Land features drop-in co-op for up to four players. You can include any number of multicolored Kirbys in your ranks, but you can also bring along other familiar faces: Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, and King Dedede. Each has their own move set--Meta Knight is more agile than the weighty Dedede, for example--but only Kirby has the signature Copy ability to swallow enemies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kirby's combat isn't simplistic, but it is forgiving. There's a ton of contextual moves you can do with each Copy ability, which means you can pull off impressive juggles. But the enemies aren't much of a threat, so you don't really need to master the combat. It's a different approach from some other Nintendo franchises, which use simple move sets to pull off an increasingly difficult array of challenges. This one seems more aimed at letting players meet it wherever they are.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-kirb-your-enthusiasm/1900-6418034/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-22 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Evo 2023 Lineup Revealed, Includes Street Fighter 6, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">After returning to in-person competition last year, the Evolution Championship Series is once again headed to Las Vegas this summer, with the lineup of featured games for Evo 2023 now officially revealed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The event will feature eight fighting games on its main stage, with each game's Top 6--a change from previous years' Top 6--featuring during each game's time in the spotlight.
