After two rejections from the School of American Ballet, the feeder school for the prestigious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/new-york-city-ballet\">New York City Ballet</a>, she finally won a place at the age of nine, a few days after 9/11. \u201cThe city was in mourning but it was the best day of my life,\u201d she recalls in Don\u2019t Think, Dear. Ballet became Robb\u2019s obsession and her identity, though her dream of turning professional unravelled when she reached puberty. Her hips widened, she grew tall and her teachers began to ignore her in class. She started bunking off lessons and, in 2004, was finally expelled. Robb subsequently finished high school, went to college and embarked on a successful career as a science writer and journalist. But, she notes: \u201cI couldn\u2019t unlearn the values of ballet.\u201d</p><p>Those values, which include discipline, stoicism, submission and near starvation, are put under the microscope in Don\u2019t Think, Dear, which examines ballet through a feminist lens. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, the book weaves her early experiences as a dancer with those of her contemporaries, and of famous ballerinas, among them Margot Fonteyn, Anna Pavlova, Darci Kistler and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/07/misty-copeland-interview-ballet-broken-disney-nutcracker-prince-obama\">Misty Copeland</a>. The title is a nod to the late George Balanchine, the hallowed choreographer and co-founder of the New York City Ballet, who championed the image of the ballerina as a willowy waif, and who Robb amusingly calls \u201cmy problematic fave\u201d. A Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 in America, Balanchine\u2019s dictum was: \u201cDon\u2019t think, dear. Just do.\u201d He was, by all accounts, a control freak and a bully, demanding impossible standards from his charges, and seeking to control how they looked, what they ate, who they dated and even what perfume they wore. He had sexual relationships with multiple dancers; those who rejected him often paid for it with their careers. Carol Sumner, a Balanchine protege, tells Robb: \u201cHe was very grabby. He was always wanting the girls. He\u2019d be arrested by now.\u201d Sumner, who is in her 80s, says this with laughter rather than disapproval. She still regards Balanchine as a hero.</p><p>Don\u2019t Think, Dear: On Loving and Leaving Ballet by Alice Robb is published by Oneworld (\u00a316.99).
