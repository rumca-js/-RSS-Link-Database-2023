<p>Mercedes-Benz is developing a new in-house operating system to power its next generation of electric vehicles. Announced today at an event the automaker held in California, Mercedes said <a href="https://media.mercedes-benz.com/article/7b55c658-898d-4363-9c1f-2fb42e55269c">MB.OS</a> – short for Mercedes-Benz Operating System – will deliver enhancements in safety, automated driving and navigation.</p><p>The automaker is working with several partners to build its new software stack, including NVIDIA, Luminar and Google. Mercedes will lean on NVIDIA for the company’s software, data and AI expertise. The GPU maker's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-jetson-agx-orin-price-release-date-163327815.html"><ins>Orin chipset</ins></a> will also power the first generation of electric cars Mercedes builds based on its upcoming Mercedes Modular Architecture (MMA) platform. The automaker expects the first MMA EV to arrive by mid-decade.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A render of Mercedes-Benz's upcoming Google Maps integration." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d7f87340-b2fc-11ed-9feb-6e0e3961b683" style="height: 2791; width: 4961;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mercedes-Benz</div></figure><p>As for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/luminar-airbus-lidar-safety-autonomous-flight-planes-helicopters-143053397.html">Luminar</a> and Google, the former will provide Mercedes with its LiDAR technology, while the latter will work with the company to build a branded navigation experience incorporating features from Google Maps. In the meantime, Mercedes is <a href="https://media.mercedes-benz.com/article/42118a43-5c19-487b-883b-a11beac9d7cb"><ins>partnering with Google</ins></a> to bring the company’s “Place Details” data to all cars that sport the latest version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">MBUX infotainment system</a>. You can use the integration to look up a local business, find out when it opens, and see photos of the inside and what other Google users have to say about it. Mercedes plans to open MB.OS to other partners as well, including <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/bringing-our-community-a-new-way-to-enjoy-tiktok-with-mercedes-benz"><ins>TikTok</ins></a>, Zoom and even <em>Angry Birds</em> developer Rovio.</p><p>All MMA EVs will ship with the hardware needed for Level 2 automated driving. Mercedes is also working with NVIDIA and Luminar to offer Drive Pilot, a Level 3 automated driving system. The software will arrive later this year in <a href="https://group-media.mercedes-benz.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=55116818"><ins>2024 EQS and S-Class</ins></a> models. Naturally, MB.OS will also enable Mercedes to deliver over-the-air updates, allowing it to add new features to existing cars.</p><p>The company isn’t shy about the fact that some upgrades may cost a one-time fee or come as part of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-acceleration-increase-ev-subscription-230058550.html"><ins>subscription package</ins></a>. In fact, Mercedes has already announced a handful of software bundles it will offer to owners of cars with MB.OS. MB.Connect, for instance, will bring together the company’s navigation, entertainment and communication features in one package. Other bundles, such as MB.Charge, will provide customers with priority access to Mercedes-Benz charging stations. The automaker says it will allow drivers to explore and buy upgrades for their Benz online, through the Mercedes mobile app and directly from the car.</p><p>“The company is confident that this strategic approach to software and hardware development will be the basis for lifetime revenues as well as additional contributions,” Mercedes said, adding it expects software revenue from bundles like MB.Connect to contribute “a low-to-mid single-digit billion euro figure” to its bottom line by mid-decade.</p>

## FCC chair proposes rules to reduce scam robotexts

<p>The chair of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fcc/"><ins>Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> has proposed new rules to tackle the scourge of text message scams. If the agency's commissioners approve the rules at a meeting in March, providers would have to block <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-12-fcc-ruling-allows-blocking-spam-texts.html"><ins>robotexts</ins></a> that are &quot;highly likely to be illegal,&quot; chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement.</p><p>The FCC has yet to publish the full text of Rosenworcel's proposal. If adopted, it will force providers to block text messages that appear to be from numbers on a do-not-originate list. They include unused, invalid and unallocated numbers, as well as those that government agencies and &quot;other well-known entities&quot; say they don't send texts from. Messages from these numbers &quot;are highly likely to be illegal and no consumer would want to receive them,&quot; an FCC statement reads.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Moreover, providers would have to block texts from entities that the FCC flags for sending illegal robotexts. The proposed rules state that providers would additionally need to expand <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/"><ins>National Do Not Call Registry</ins></a> protections to include texts to prevent consumers from receiving unwanted marketing messages.</p><p>“Missing packages that don’t exist; confirmation of payments that didn’t happen; links to shady websites; and truncated ‘wrong number’ messages from strangers. These scam robotexts are a part of everyday life for too many of us,” Rosenworcel said. “I’m asking my colleagues to join me in adopting the first FCC rules to focus on shutting down scam texts. But we’re not stopping here. Because we are going to keep at it and develop more ways to take on this growing consumer threat.”</p><p>The robotext proposal follows measures the FCC has taken to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/robocall-company-may-receive-the-largest-fine-ever-from-the-fcc-110759522.html"><ins>stamp out robocalls</ins></a>. Both issues are <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2023/02/22/march-2023-open-meeting-agenda">on the agenda</a> for the FCC's open meeting next month, along with other items like a proposed framework &quot;for increased collaboration between terrestrial mobile network operators and satellite service providers&quot; to bolster phone service in areas where it is lacking. That could could come in useful for life-or-death situations in remote areas. Certain devices, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-emergency-sos-satellite-connection-183230405.html">the iPhone 14</a>, now offer satellite connectivity for emergency use.</p>

## Apple is reportedly closer to bringing no-prick glucose monitoring to the Watch

<p>Apple's long-running quest to bring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-blood-sugar-rockley-photonics-212241562.html">blood glucose monitoring</a> to the Apple Watch appears to be moving forward. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/apple-watch-blood-glucose-monitor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-care-aapl?sref=10lNAhZ9">sources</a> claim the company's no-prick monitoring is now at a &quot;proof-of-concept stage&quot; and good enough that it could come to market once it's smaller. The technology, which uses lasers to gauge glucose concentration under the skin, was previously tabletop sized but has reportedly advanced to the point where an iPhone-sized wearable prototype is in the works.</p><p>The system would not only help people with diabetes monitor their conditions, but would ideally alert people who are prediabetic, the insiders say. They could then make changes that prevent Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple declined to comment. The project has supposedly been in development for a long time. It began in 2010, when an ailing Steve Jobs had his company buy blood glucose monitoring startup RareLight. Apple is said to have kept the effort secret by operating it as a seemingly isolated firm, Avolonte Health, but folded it into a previously unknown Exploratory Design Group (XDG). CEO Tim Cook, Apple Watch hardware lead Eugene Kim and other top leaders have been involved.</p><p>Any real-world product is likely years away, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. The industry also doesn't have a great track record of bringing no-prick monitors to market. In 2018, Alphabet's health subsidiary Verily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-16-verily-shelves-glucose-monitoring-contact-lens-project.html">scrapped plans for a smart contact lens</a> that would have tracked glucose using tears. Even major brands with vast resources aren't guaranteed success, in other words, and it's not clear how accurate Apple's solution would be.</p><p>There are strong incentives to bring this tech to wearables. The Apple Watch is frequently marketed as a health device and can spot signs of atrial fibrillation, low blood oxygen levels and (as of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html">Series 8</a>) ovulation cycles. Non-intrusive glucose monitoring could make it an indispensable tool for those with diabetes — you wouldn't need a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-27-the-dexcom-g5-lets-diabetics-track-blood-sugar-on-their-phone.html">dedicated device</a> that invades your skin, such as a continuous glucose sensor that sends info from an electrode-equipped thin needle to an external receiver. That painless approach could give the Apple Watch an edge over competing smartwatches.</p>

## Instagram co-founders' news app Artifact is now open to everyone

<p>Artifact, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/artifact-is-an-ai-driven-news-aggregation-app-from-the-creators-of-instagram-180544336.html"><ins>the personalized news curation app from Instagram's co-founders</ins></a>, no longer has a waitlist. The app is live in the Apple App Store in most English-speaking markets, as well as on Android. Starting today, you'll no longer need a phone number to use Artifact unless you want to create an account and move to a different device.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger's team has added more features, including a social element. There's now the option to upload your contacts to see if a certain article has gained traction with your friends. A badge <a href="https://medium.com/artifact-news/artifact-now-open-to-everyone-268c3799ee40"><ins>will appear</ins></a> next to an article that's popular enough among your contacts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d0446c4c5d0040219d1c24f05aceb35d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's not a launch without a little sizzle reel 🌶 Come join us in <a href="https://twitter.com/ARTIFACT_News?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ARTIFACT_News</a> ! <a href="https://t.co/QrdXctfNl1">pic.twitter.com/QrdXctfNl1</a></p>— Kevin Systrom (@kevin) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin/status/1628458732819546113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Systrom told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/22/instagrams-co-founders-personalized-news-app-artifact-launches-to-the-public-with-new-features/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a> that you can't see which of your specific friends have read a story or how many. There's a threshold before the badge appears too, so you won't be able to just upload a single contact and use the feature to track what they're reading. These, apparently, are privacy considerations, but they overlook the fact that you'll need to upload your contacts' details to use it.</p><p>In another time, Artifact might have tapped into Twitter to see what the people you're following are reading (akin to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-expands-3-dollar-twitter-blue-subscriptions-to-the-us-163018030.html"><ins>Top Articles feature for Blue subscribers</ins></a>). But with Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html"><ins>severely restricting Twitter's APIs</ins></a>, that may no longer be viable.</p><p>Eventually, Artifact will have a way for users to share and comment on articles in the app. The beta version already has a Discover feed of things people are sharing. Naturally, users can like and comment on those shared articles.</p><p>The app now has a stats feature that visualizes the categories you've been reading most often, as well as the publishers you've been reading the most. Artifact is grouping articles into more narrowly defined topics as well. Meanwhile, you can now indicate when you don't like an article or publisher and the app will show you less of that. It's possible to block publishers too.</p><p>I've been using Artifact for a few weeks and I'm enjoying it so far. Unsurprisingly, the suggestions have become more attuned to my tastes the more I use it and tell it what I don't want to see. It reminds me a bit of Facebook's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-30-facebook-paper-app-shutting-down.html"><ins>old Paper app</ins></a>, my favorite thing Meta has built to date. Artifact doesn't have anything like the social graph of Facebook, but given that the Instagram guys are behind it, it's hard to bet against their new app finding success.</p>

## Razer updates the Blade 15 with 13th-gen Intel CPUs and RTX 40 series graphics

<p>With its recent announcement of the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-16-and-blade-18-hands-on-all-out-mobile-powerhouses-ces-2023-180043229.html">Blade 16 and Blade 18</a>, you might have assumed Razer was ready to sunset its older <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-15-2022-review-a-real-treat-if-youve-got-the-cash-160032467.html">Blade 15</a> laptop. Not so: the company is keeping the Blade 15 around for at least another year while updating it with the latest components from Intel and NVIDIA. On Wednesday, Razer announced <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=358591a8-2981-451c-a839-e645b5522820&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer+Online+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNTg1OTFhOC0yOTgxLTQ1MWMtYTgzOS1lNjQ1YjU1MjI4MjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL3Nob3AvcGMvZ2FtaW5nLWxhcHRvcHM_cXVlcnk9Om5ld2VzdDpjYXRlZ29yeTpzeXN0ZW0tbGFwdG9wczpzeXN0ZW0tZGlzcGxheToxNSUyQmluY2g6c3lzdGVtLXByb2Nlc3NvcjoxM3RoJTJCR2VuJTJCSW50ZWwlQzIlQUUlMkJDb3JlJUUyJTg0JUEyJTJCaTciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg2NjY0N2M4LTk1ZjMtNDJlNC1iYjg1LThjMzNlYWQ1ZDU1NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUQysXi5tx1VwamOmzWUXML2MBpi3HKaFn9yr8xEORfC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fshop%2Fpc%2Fgaming-laptops%3Fquery%3D%3Anewest%3Acategory%3Asystem-laptops%3Asystem-display%3A15%252Binch%3Asystem-processor%3A13th%252BGen%252BIntel%25C2%25AE%252BCore%25E2%2584%25A2%252Bi7">two new 2023 variants</a> of the Blade 15.</p><div id="fc117614639b40929593dfcdbba4c5a7"></div><p>Both feature 16GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 5,200 MHz, 1TB SSDs and Intel i7-13800H processors. The 13800H is a 14-core, 20-thread chip with a maximum boost clock of 5.2GHz. For reference, all models of the Blade 16 come with Intel’s flagship 24-core <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-13th-gen-laptop-cpu-24-cores-140050825.html">i9-13950HX</a>. That means the Blade 15 won’t offer as much performance as the Blade 16, but it also won’t be a slouch. Part of that is thanks to the fact both new Blade 15 models come with <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-laptop-gpu-price-release-date-165006688.html">RTX 40 series GPUs</a>. With today’s announcement, you can configure the Blade 15 with either an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 GPU. There’s no 4090 option like Razer offers with the Blade 16, likely due to the internal space and thermal constraints present with the smaller chassis.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You also won’t find the mini LED display option that’s one of the highlights of the Blade 16. The Blade 15 limits you to a 16:9 QHD IPS panel with 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage and a 240Hz refresh rate. That’s a shame as 16:10 displays are often better suited for productivity tasks, but to be expected since Razer did not redesign the Blade 15.</p><p>The 2023 Blade 15 is available to order starting today. Pricing starts at <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=358591a8-2981-451c-a839-e645b5522820&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer+Online+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNTg1OTFhOC0yOTgxLTQ1MWMtYTgzOS1lNjQ1YjU1MjI4MjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL2dhbWluZy1sYXB0b3BzL1JhemVyLUJsYWRlLTE1L1JaMDktMDQ4NVlFRDMtUjNVMSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODY2NjQ3YzgtOTVmMy00MmU0LWJiODUtOGMzM2VhZDVkNTU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf17Uce1MW1FyuajcQSoSqIbQfrFnanPyGbBLqle9mgg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0485YED3-R3U1">$2,500</a> for the RTX 4060 model. The RTX 4070 variant will set you back <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=358591a8-2981-451c-a839-e645b5522820&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer+Online+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNTg1OTFhOC0yOTgxLTQ1MWMtYTgzOS1lNjQ1YjU1MjI4MjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL2dhbWluZy1sYXB0b3BzL1JhemVyLUJsYWRlLTE1L1JaMDktMDQ4NVpFRDMtUjNVMSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODY2NjQ3YzgtOTVmMy00MmU0LWJiODUtOGMzM2VhZDVkNTU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbVD0-AUSbX3Z2oxaBuibWymebtr-hrEv_C35utjNz8K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0485ZED3-R3U1">$2,800</a>. In other words, the latter is $100 more than the base model Blade 16, which starts at $2,700 and features an RTX 4060 video card. So the Blade 15 is not exactly a meaningfully cheaper option than the Blade 16. That said, the Blade 15 is about a pound lighter than its newer sibling and 5mm thinner. It should also offer slightly better battery life thanks to its more modest CPU. All things to keep in mind if you plan to buy a new gaming laptop this year.</p>

## Microsoft brings its Bing AI chatbot to mobile apps and Skype

<p>Since it started opening up its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html?uuid=EKHYvtgJk9IGt34A1043"><ins>generative AI-powered chatbot in Bing</ins></a> earlier this month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> has granted more than a million people access to a preview of the tool, while millions more are on the waitlist. Until now, the only way to access the chatbot has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html"><ins>through the Edge desktop browser</ins></a>. But Microsoft is already <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/"><ins>bringing it</ins></a> to more products, services and devices.</p><p>Starting today, those with access to the chatbot through their Microsoft account can use it on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-ai-copilot-184033427.html"><ins>Edge</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bing/"><ins>Bing</ins></a> mobile apps for Android and iOS. Tapping the Bing button at the bottom of the namesake mobile app will start a chat session. In the Edge mobile app, you can fire up the chatbot from the homepage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, you can start using the chatbot in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/skype/"><ins>Skype</ins></a>. Users can <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/blogs/2023-02-bing-bot-in-skype/"><ins>converse with it</ins></a> one-on-one or add it to a group chat. You might use the chatbot to help plan a trip and let everyone else see the suggestions at the same time, or settle a debate by asking it to clarify which movies an actor has appeared in over the last decade. It can translate information between more than 100 languages too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There's also another way to use the chatbot. Microsoft has added voice control on both mobile and desktop. While it's early days for the chatbot, it could finally spell the end for Cortana after years of the voice assistant <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/cortana/"><ins>gradually fading</ins></a> into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cortana-shutdown-harman-kardon-invoke-ios-android-191700426.html"><ins>the background</ins></a>.</p><p>Microsoft notes that it could (and probably will) bring the chatbot to other apps, such as Teams,. However, it said that it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-already-reversing-some-of-the-limits-it-put-on-bings-ai-chat-tools-212138986.html"><ins>still fine-tuning the chatbot</ins></a>, which has run into a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-explains-bings-bizarre-ai-chat-behavior-134931486.html?uuid=yRGGTqwIfhEnVCtH5045"><ins>number of speed bumps</ins></a> after more people got their hands on it.</p>

<p>In 2019, <em>No Man’s Sky </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-02-no-mans-sky-vr-hands-on-interview-sean-murray.html"><ins>reinvented itself for virtual reality</ins></a>. Now, nearly four years later, it’s doing so again. With the release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html"><ins>PlayStation VR2</ins></a>, Hello Games has announced <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/fractal-update/"><ins>Fractal</ins></a>, a free update for <em>No Man’s Sky </em>that overhauls the game’s virtual reality experience on all platforms.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/02/no-mans-sky-fractal-update/?cli_action=1677081769.364"><ins>blog post</ins></a> published Wednesday, the studio said it redesigned the HUD and user interface in <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to make every interaction within the game feel natural and purpose-built. In practice, that means Hello Games has devised some clever ways for you to interact with your tools while playing <em>No Man’s Sky</em> in VR. For instance, you can access all of your Multi-Tool’s capabilities through a menu embedded into the device. Similarly, you can browse your character’s inventory through a wrist-mounted display they wear on their spacesuit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="11569812c0bf4b27bdeaaad9aa58ebfa"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>PlayStation VR2 users can look forward to a handful of platform-specific enhancements. Thanks to the power of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html"><ins>PlayStation 5</ins></a>, the PS VR2 version of the game features enhanced reflections, denser foliage, higher-quality textures and better draw distances, among other technical improvements. The PS VR2 release also takes advantage of the headset’s signature features, including 3D audio technology and intelligent tracking. Best of all, you can seamlessly switch between VR and standard gameplay whenever you feel you need a break from the headset.</p><p>If you don’t own a VR headset, Hello Games hasn’t forgotten about you. The Fractal update includes new content and features for all <em>No Man's Sky</em> players to experience. To start, there’s the new “Utopia Speeder” spacecraft for players to add their stable. Hello Games says this ship is perfect for flying across the surface of a planet at high speed. Additionally, there’s a new expedition that tasks players with rebuilding a solar system. Taking part will allow you to earn a new drone companion for your character, among other items. On the technical front, Hello Games has redesigned the game’s options menu to add new accessibility features. It has also added support for gyro controls on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p><p>All told, Fractal looks like yet another meaningful update for a game that has evolved so much since its rough launch in 2016. You can download version 4.1 of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> today.</p>

## Cruise’s robotaxis have driven 1 million miles with nobody behind the wheel

<p>For autonomous vehicle developers, every mile driven serves as proof that their technology works and as an opportunity to gather data for further improvement. Which is why Cruise, which has just <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/one-million-driverless-miles">announced</a> that it has completed 1 million fully driverless miles, calls the achievement one of its biggest milestones yet. A spokesperson told us that those were miles driven with no safety driver behind the wheel and that most of them were collected in San Francisco.</p><p>If you'll recall, the GM subsidiary started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/g-ms-cruise-is-now-offering-driverless-taxi-rides-in-san-francisco-103542426.html">testing fully driverless rides</a> in the city back in <a href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992698242953219">November 2021</a>. It was also the first company to ever receive a driverless deployment permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, allowing it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-charge-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-092000547.html">to charge passengers</a> for robotaxi rides by June last year. Based on the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/">disengagement reports</a> it submitted to the California DMV, it only had around 30 cars or so operating at the beginning of 2022. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/30/business/cruise-gm-san-francisco-self-driving/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> said it was maintaining a fleet of 100 vehicles by September last year and was seeking to add 5,000 more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mo Elshenawy, Cruise's SVP of engineering, said each one of those miles "has been packed with complex scenarios that have set Cruise up for rapid scale." Since San Francisco streets are often chaotic and packed with people, the company was able to gather tons of useful data it can use to better its technology. "For example," Elshenawy wrote in a <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/one-million-driverless-miles">blog</a> post, "stop sign blow-throughs are 46x times more frequent in San Francisco than in suburban areas."</p><p>Cruise has been feeding data from each drive into a continuous learning machine that creates millions of permutations of real-world scenarios on the road. That allows the technology to learn from simulated drives and then apply what it learns in real life. "When you consider our safety record, the gravity of our team’s achievement comes into sharper focus," Elshenawy continued. "To date, riders have taken tens of thousands of rides in Cruise AVs. In the coming years, millions of people will experience this fully driverless future for themselves."</p><p>Cruise's announcement comes almost a month after San Francisco officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/san-francisco-looks-hit-brakes-self-driving-cars-rcna66204">sent a letter</a> to California regulators, asking them to slow Cruise's (and Waymo's) expansion plans. They reportedly wanted a better understanding of autonomous vehicles first and were worried about "the hazards and network impacts caused by planned and unplanned AV stops that obstruct traffic." As <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wMS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NlbGYtZHJpdmluZy10YXhpLXNhbi1mcmFuY2lzY28uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjgyNzkyMjktNDY5Zi00MDVhLTk0ZmMtZWEyNTIzNmU1YjRjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVVmRS9sMIFW3HxHQo27WeTZRj1_JSqgn4LJsNgQCDEi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F02%2F01%2Ftechnology%2Fself-driving-taxi-san-francisco.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> said in a recent report, stalled Cruise and Waymo vehicles have caused traffic jams in San Francisco several times in the past. Officials believe these companies have to significantly improve their technologies before expanding, or else they "could quickly exhaust emergency response resources and could undermine public confidence in all automated driving technology."</p><div id="926278081d9a481898726f12c5fa93fd"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## Amazon officially becomes a health care provider after closing purchase of One Medical
 - [https://www.engadget.com/amazon-completes-one-medical-acquisition-163431975.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-completes-one-medical-acquisition-163431975.html?src=rss)

<p>Amazon's months-long effort to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-primary-healthcare-provider-one-medical-acquisition-140426086.html">acquire One Medical</a> is finished — for now, at least. The company has officially <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/one-medical-joins-amazon-to-make-it-easier-for-people-to-get-and-stay-healthier">completed</a> its $3.9 billion purchase, giving it a primary healthcare provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well as lab tests. The successful buyout isn't leading to any immediate changes in One Medical's services beyond a temporary $55 discount on a one-year membership (now $144), but Amazon said last July that it planned a &quot;reinvention&quot; of healthcare with the takeover.</p><p>The completion comes just a day after the Federal Trade Commission said it wouldn't contest the buyout. However, the regulator also says it's still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-investigating-amazon-buyout-of-one-medical-irobot-180221944.html">investigating the deal</a> to explore potential anti-competitive effects and privacy concerns raised by Amazon's access to health data. An FTC official <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/22/tech/ftc-amazon-one-medical-deal/index.html">told</a><em>CNN</em> the agency will warn Amazon it's closing the purchase at its own risk, and might still face a government challenge later.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon has spent years making deeper forays into healthcare. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-amazon-buys-pillpack-healthcare-online-pharmacy.html">bought PillPack</a> in 2018 and used the provider to launch an in-house <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-pharmacy-134356646.html">pharmacy service</a>.  The online shopping heavyweight also introduced an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-amazon-care-is-a-new-app-based-health-service-for-its-employees.html">app-based health service</a> for employees in 2019 that it later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-care-telehealth-app-healthcare-expansion-155308198.html">offered to other companies</a>. In 2021, the company introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-hospitals-senior-living-communities-alexa-smart-properties-142048307.html">custom Alexa for healthcare</a>. The One Medical move theoretically completes the picture by letting Amazon handle everything from minor doctor's appointments through to prescriptions.</p><p>Whether or not Amazon could endure an FTC challenge isn't clear. Commission chair Lina Khan is known to  be wary of Big Tech, and her stance even prompted Amazon to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">ask for her recusal</a> from antitrust cases. There's no certainty the FTC might succeed, though, and it recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-reportedly-loses-court-order-to-block-metas-acquisition-of-vr-developer-within-172220645.html">lost an effort</a> to block <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-completes-within-acquisition-223323552.html">Meta's purchase of Within</a>. One Medical is considerably larger than Within, though, and its healthcare focus brings up privacy concerns that aren't always present in tech acquisitions.</p>

## Microsoft expands the Xbox Game Pass family plan to six more countries

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/02/21/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-friends-family-plan-expands-to-six-new-countries/"><ins>expanded</ins></a> the Xbox Game Pass family plan to six more countries. Folks in Chile, Hungary, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden can now sign up for a membership that allows up to five friends and family members in the same country to access Game Pass Ultimate features via a single subscription. This is the first expansion of the Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family plan, which Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-game-pass-friends-family-revealed-at-22-a-month-in-ireland-082403729.html"><ins>debuted in Colombia and Ireland last summer</ins></a>.</p><p>There are <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/xbox-game-pass-friends-family-faq"><ins>a few things</ins></a> worth keeping in mind if you're in one of those countries and you're interested in the plan, which offers access to a library of hundreds of PC, console and cloud games and has other benefits. The primary account holder will be able to convert their existing plan based on the monetary value of the time they have left. A full month of an Ultimate subscription equates to 18 days of Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family access, for instance. People who are invited to join a group can't convert their remaining Game Pass time, however. Those with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-series-s-x-monthly-payment-plans-141958507.html">an Xbox All Access payment plan</a> can't join a friends and family group.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pricing varies by country. A good rule of thumb is that, based on the conversion rates, a regular Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs about three-fifths as much as the family plan. Given the US Game Pass Ultimate pricing, the family plan costs the equivalent of $25 per month. Split that cost between five people, and that's just $5 per month per person for Game Pass Ultimate access — around the same price as a single full game purchase each per year.</p><p>There's no sign of Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family plan coming to North America, the UK or elsewhere more broadly just yet. However, it's clear that Microsoft is interested in getting as many people as possible to sign up for Game Pass in one way or another, so it's likely the plan will expand to more territories down the line.</p>

## WhatsApp is reportedly experimenting with private newsletters

<p>You might not have to send messages to a group chat to keep your WhatsApp friends updated. <em>WABetaInfo</em> has <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-experimenting-with-private-newsletter-tool/">discovered</a> that code in a recent WhatApp beta for Android includes references to an unannounced &quot;Newsletter&quot; feature. While its exact workings aren't clear, it's a private space in the Status tab that lets you share content with many followers. Names and other contact details are hidden by default.</p><p>We've asked WhatsApp parent company Meta for comment. This is the first beta to mention the Newsletter feature, so it may not be ready to test for a while. There's also no guarantee WhatsApp will release newsletters as a finished product.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If this does go ahead, it won't be surprising. WhatsApp is as much a source of information as it is a messaging service, with users frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-misinformation-web-search-forwarded-messages-144336502.html">forwarding messages</a> and receiving news through group discussions. Newsletters would effectively streamline some of that info delivery. Meta has also spent years <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-06-mark-zuckerberg-outlines-facebook-privacy-rethink.html">pivoting toward privacy-oriented services</a>, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-communities-group-chats-150248053.html">communities</a> that can link multiple group chats. The addition could expand WhatsApp's functionality without turning it into a Facebook-style social network.</p>

<p>Last November, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apps-to-download-on-your-new-smartphone-ios-android-180049321.html"><ins>Notion</ins></a>, the popular note-taking app productivity YouTubers <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1IQlBUSnd6S0pUOCZ0PTE4OXMmYWJfY2hhbm5lbD1EYW5pZWxUaXRjaGVuZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAyMzU2NTYxLTJiN2QtNGQ2YS1iMGRlLTkwODJjYWY2MWU1NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfPISMpc50FDlwQp26SVWHue4Qsue7HdMP-M8ew0Iwnd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHBPTJwzKJT8%26t%3D189s%26ab_channel%3DDanielTitchener"><ins>swear will change your life</ins></a>, began testing a built-in generative machine learning algorithm dubbed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/notion-ai-announced-202032305.html"><ins>Notion AI</ins></a>. At the time, the company did not share a release date for the feature. But in a surprise announcement made Wednesday, Notion said anyone, including free users, can start using Notion AI.</p><p>According to Notion, more than 2 million people signed up for the waitlist the company put in place for users to try the alpha version of Notion AI. After 10 weeks of testing, the company found most testers weren’t asking Notion AI to write blog posts and marketing emails from scratch. Instead, they were using it to refine their own writing. Notion AI includes a formatting menu that includes options to prompt the company’s machine-learning algorithm to do things like shorten or extend the length of your text, change the tone and fix any spelling and grammatical errors. “This suggests that most people start by writing their own content, and treat AI as a thought partner and editor,” Notion said.  The company also found people frequently used Notion AI’s “improve writing” option, a feature the company likens to a one-click enhancer for words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fbf3e6cc01584740998f09a3eed289e8"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>As a result of what it saw during the alpha, the company decided to “completely redesign” Notion AI to make it more “iterative and conversational.” The new version of the tool will generate follow-up prompts until you’re satisfied with its results.   “Notion AI is useful for authoring new content — but it will also summarize long documents, extract key learnings from messy notes, improve your writing style, and much more,” Notion says.</p><p>While there’s no waitlist involved and Notion says it’s not running a “limited preview,” there is a limit to how much you can use Notion AI before you need to pay. Until April 5th, the company is offering 20 free AI responses to all users. After that, you’ll need to pay $10 per month to continue using Notion AI. You can get a 20 percent discount if you go with an annual plan. For Plus, Business and Enterprise customers, access to Notion AI will cost $10 per member per month.</p><p>Ten weeks is a surprisingly fast turnaround for a feature Notion CEO Ivan Zhao said in November was very much a work in progress. In that time, generative AI has frequently been in the headlines, often for reasons that don’t inspire confidence in the technology. Late last month, for example, <em>CNET</em> was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html"><ins>issue corrections</ins></a> on more than half of the AI-written articles the outlet <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-gets-caught-playing-ai-mad-libs-with-its-financial-news-coverage-001026432.html"><ins>recently attributed</ins></a> to its CNET Money team.

## Apple is convinced my dog is stalking me

<p>As far as I know, no one is using an Apple AirTag to stalk me. But if that were to change, I’m not even sure I’d notice Apple’s attempts to warn me. The “AirTag Found Moving With You” notification near-constantly sits on my homescreen, and I’ve gotten used to quickly swiping it away.</p><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself – let me tell you about my dog, Rosie. She’s a sweet tempered, mild mannered rescue. Still, there was one catch when we adopted her: She’s a flight risk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve seen this firsthand when the sound of fireworks or a strong wind causes her to enter a full-blown panic. Rosie shuts down, shakes and, when it’s really bad, tries to run away. We’re working on it, but, in the meantime, we’ve turned to Apple AirTags as an extra reassurance.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/airtags/">$29 quarter-sized AirTag</a> attached to her collar keeps track of her location so that we can quickly find her if she ever got away. It’s mostly for peace of mind — we’ve only had to use it once — but it’s also quickly become an annoying part of my daily routine.</p><p>The problem is that the AirTag is registered to my partner’s device. That means that Apple doesn’t recognize my iPhone in connection with the AirTag, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-update-hidden-airtags-easier-to-locate-092003140.html">seeing the unknown tracker as a threat to my safety</a>. It sends a notification that there’s an AirTag following me, which won’t go away until I acknowledge its presence in the Find My app, and there’s no way to tell it “hey, that’s just Rosie!” to disable the recurring notification. Plus, it’ll ping and make sounds to alert me of its presence, causing our already skittish dog confusion.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot of an iPhone displaying a Tracking Notification. Text reads: " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/b1b183f0-b21d-11ed-bb5b-f83717393ce8" /><figcaption>An example of what the unwanted tracking notification looks like and options to proceed.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Katie Malone</div></figure><p>These safety features exist for a good reason. They can notify a survivor that they’re being followed, and put them in control to bring it as proof of stalking to law enforcement, if that’s something they feel safe doing, Audace Garnett, technology safety project manager at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, told Engadget<em>.</em> In cases like that, AirTag’s persistence may be a welcome way to manage one’s safety. Competitors like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-thinks-a-1-million-fine-will-deter-stalkers-from-using-its-trackers-181857358.html">Bluetooth tracker Tile have taken note, implementing a $1 million penalty</a> on people using the product to stalk someone.</p><p>“​​For us, who are not being stalked or harassed, it may be an annoyance to us,” Garnett said. “But for someone that's in a domestic violence situation, who is under power and control, this may be a life-saving tool for them.”</p><p>There are a few viable solutions, but none quite worked for me. The notification provides an option to disable the AirTag, which would be helpful to stop an unwanted third-party from knowing your location. That feature renders the AirTag useless, though, so it would no longer be able to track my dog if she did get out.</p><p>There is a way to pause tracking notifications for that specific AirTag, but it only lasts for 24 hours. Disabling Find My notifications didn’t work, so I tried <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjEyMjI3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkYzZlNDhkNi05NDI2LTQzZjYtYmUwNi1iYjVhZTNiYTkwYzMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaBjXg0ZgNNRL3afWoZExadpfNM1rJeHu_s3PCzE25Ma&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT212227">disabling unwanted tracking notifications</a>. That setting disables <em>all </em>unwanted tracking notifications, not just for this specific AirTag. So, if someone were to slip one in my bag, I wouldn’t get those notifications either.

If we did that, I would unlock an option to cancel notifications for Rosie’s AirTag. We currently have separate accounts, though, and aren’t interested in fully merging our clouds. I could also buy any other tracking device to replace it with, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/best-gps-pet-trackers/">the slew of options available specifically for pets</a>, if I wanted to spend the additional cash to avoid this feature.</p><p>Or, I could deal with the minor inconvenience knowing that somewhere out there, this feature is helping someone else stay safe. I think I’ll go with that.</p><p><em>If you are experiencing domestic violence and similar abuse, you can contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline by phone at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or by texting "START" to 88788.</em></p>

## Spotify's new AI 'DJ' will talk you through its recommendations

I got early access to DJ and have been playing with it for the last day to see how Spotify’s latest take on personalized music works, but the feature is available as of today in beta for all premium subscribers in the US and Canada.</p><p>While Spotify has loads of personalized playlists for users, I’ve found that the app lacks a simple way to tell it to just play some music you like. On Apple Music, for example, I can ask Siri to play music I like and it’ll start a personalized radio station based on music I’ve played alongside some things it thinks I’ll enjoy but haven’t played before. It’s a reliable way to jump right into my collection. In the same vein, Spotify’s DJ pulls together a mix of songs you’re currently listening to, old favorites you might have forgotten, and new tunes that fit in with what it thinks you’ll like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AI twist to DJ comes in the form of a literal DJ, which speaks to you in an AI voice generated by Sonantic, a startup that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-buys-ai-voice-platform-sonantic-145242336.html">Spotify bought last year</a> with a focus on generating realistic speech. In this case, the DJ’s voice model was trained on the voice of a real human, Spotify’s own Head of Cultural Partnerships, Xavier “X” Jernigan. Jernigan hosted “The Get Up,” Spotify’s morning show that combined recorded segments with music tailored to your tastes.</p><p>The DJ’s voice is generated through AI, and so are the things it says to you. When you first kick off a DJ session, you’ll get a quick overview of what you might expect to hear. For example, the first time I started up DJ, “X” came on and told me that it was a DJ designed for music and that it knew what I liked and for starters it was going to play me some Jenny Lewis. Sure enough, Lewis’s “Do Si Do” kicked things off, along with a few other songs with a similar vibe. At the top of the now playing screen, you’ll see a little info on how the song was picked, like “based on recent listening,” “throwbacks,” “recommended for you” or “from your past.”</p><p>Once you start a segment, you’ll generally hear a handful of songs that fit into the category, but if you want to change things up you can just tap the DJ button in the lower right corner of the now playing screen. At that point, X the DJ pops back up to give you some info about what’s coming up next. When I just tapped it, X said, “OK, changing it up. Here are our editor’s picks for the best in hard rock this week, starting with Motionless In White.”</p><p>Spotify says that none of the dialog you hear from X is pre-recorded; it’s all generated on the fly by OpenAI. However, the company wanted to make it clear that it looks at generative AI as a tool for its music editors, not something that it is just trusting to get everything right. Spotify’s VP of personalization Ziad Sultan told Engadget in a product demo that the company put together a “writers room” of script writers, music editors, data curators and engineers, all of whom are working together to make sure that the bits of info that the AI DJ drops are useful, accurate and relevant to the music you’re hearing.</p><p>Sultan stressed that Spotify’s usage was a lot different than implementations like free-form text, image generation and other such AI use cases. “We’ve built a very specific use case, and we’ve made a few choices about how it’ll be implemented,” he said. “The most important one is the creation of that writer’s room – we’re taking this [AI] tool and putting it into the hands of music experts.”</p><p>What’ll make Spotify’s DJ work or fail is whether it can pull up music you want to hear. From that perspective, Spotify isn’t doing anything wildly different than it already does: analyzing your listening history and finding stuff it knows you like and things it thinks you’ll enjoy. And as with everything else you do on Spotify, your DJ usage will be analyzed so that it can get better at serving you tunes you want to listen to. At the beginning, anyway, the AI DJ aspects are being used as small augmentations to a personalized music channel – and as long as Spotify can continue to know what songs you love and which ones you’re likely to fall in love with, DJ should be a useful addition.</p>

## The best Bluetooth trackers for 2023

<p>If you’ve ever been derailed from an on-time departure by a set of lost keys or misplaced wallet, you’ll benefit from a Bluetooth tracker. These small devices attach to your stuff and use your smartphone to keep tabs on where they are. There aren’t a ton of players in the field yet, but we tested out some of the most popular options to see what each tracker does well so you can decide which is the best Bluetooth tracker for you.</p><h2>What to look for in a Bluetooth tracker</h2><p>Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one to your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the tracker so you can find it. These devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few things to look for when deciding which to get.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3><strong>Device compatibility</strong></h3><p>Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> only work with other Apple products. The company has opened up <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjExMzMxIzp-OnRleHQ9U3VwcG9ydGVkJTIwdGhpcmQlMkRwYXJ0eSUyMHByb2R1Y3RzJnRleHQ9VGhlJTIwZm9sbG93aW5nJTIwcHJvZHVjdHMlMjBhcmUlMjBjb21wYXRpYmxlLHdpdGglMjB0aGUlMjBTREQlMjBGaW5kaW5nJTIwc3lzdGVtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcs6otxYTaPJkVFkCTdYh98uCdvHslF2hmlbiiNv9pbj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT211331%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DSupported%2520third%252Dparty%2520products%26text%3DThe%2520following%2520products%2520are%2520compatible%2Cwith%2520the%2520SDD%2520Finding%2520system">access</a> to its Find My network to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo, though. Its One Spot and Card Spot finders work with Apple's large tracking network, but only pair with Apple devices. Chipolo’s classic trackers will work with either Android or Apple devices, as will Tile trackers.</p><h3><strong>Finding network</strong></h3><p>Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/09/airtag-stolen-gear/">equipment</a> or tracking lost luggage <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/couple-tracking-lost-luggage-journey-apple-airtag-wow-viewers-1733614">across the globe</a>. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, Bluetooth trackers can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of range. Apple’s Find My network is by far the largest, with over a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-count-over-1-billion-045552737.html">billion</a> iPhones in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags.</p><p>While Android phones <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/android-dominates-globally-but-apples-gaining-ground-102346830.html">outnumber</a> iPhones globally, they don’t have a similar, unified “find-my”network. (Though, reports that Google may be working on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-working-on-location-tracker-grogu-airtag-204502566.html">AirTag rival</a> means such a system may be coming.) In the meantime, Tile offers the second-largest finding grid, with every smartphone that runs the Tile app acting as incognito locators. After Life360 <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7d4ad158-ef3c-4076-800c-a48ae1e8937e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Life360&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3ZDRhZDE1OC1lZjNjLTQwNzYtODAwYy1hNDhhZTFlODkzN2UiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlmZTM2MC5jb20vYmxvZy90aWxlLWpvaW5zLWxpZmUzNjAvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUTqZnrTq_j9lZCvmXv0wW7fTw_pRZ9WHKm3VdGluDyk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Ftile-joins-life360%2F">acquired</a> Tile, the 47 million users of that app were added to the 50 million existing Tile users, creating a sizable network.</p><p>In our tests, AirTags offered nearly real-time location data and were quickest to find items abandoned in spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shop in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Tile trackers were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same pin-point accuracy as AirTags. Chipolo’s Spot trackers operate on the same Find My network and perform on par with the AirTags. Chipolo’s classic trackers, on the other hand, don’t have much of a crowd-sourced network to speak of. Yet as we used the trackers, the size of the finding network started to feel less important in the face of typical, everyday use cases. It was their ability to out-perform in every other way that boosted Chipolo’s classic trackers to the top of our list.</p><figure><img alt="An assortment of bluetooth trackers arranged in a grid on a wooden background.

A separation alert lets you know when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items, which is useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, or jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house.</p><p>These notifications work when you’re out and about too. If you’ve got a tracker in your wallet and walk out of a restaurant without it, the separation alert should kick in, resulting in less lost stuff. This feature also tells you where your tagged item and phone were last paired, allowing you to retrace your steps if you happen to miss the alert.</p><p>Each tracker handles left-behind items differently. Both AirTags and Chipolo include the feature by default. Tile trackers require a yearly <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a27b27f-6486-47c7-9cdc-0c4040bd9690&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Tile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTI3YjI3Zi02NDg2LTQ3YzctOWNkYy0wYzQwNDBiZDk2OTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlsZS5jb20vZW4tdXMvcGxhbnMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYzYjEyNGY4LTI2NWQtNDlhNy05ZDExLTUyZTY3MWJlYzBjNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS3gS-ptxLvKi9M17Nfp7mkMV8Ej-2v8XP5fJ2qSd8Fr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fen-us%2Fplans">subscription</a> to enable the alerts (currently $30 per year). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. Chipolo doesn’t offer safe locations, but you can toggle out-of-range alerts on a per-item basis.</p><p>In our tests, the Chipolo sent an alert after we got between 250 and 450 feet away from our tagged item. AirTags alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. And Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet. The notifications were not consistent on an iPhone, but worked well when operating with an Android phone.</p><h3><strong>Connectivity, volume and design</strong></h3><p>The feature you may use most often is the simple “find my keys” function. If you have your phone, but no idea where your tagged keys are, you can tap a button in the tracker’s app to make the tracker ring. The ability to consistently and quickly connect with your phone is important for making it out the door with less stress. Tile and Chipolo classic trackers will also let you double click the device itself to make your phone ring, but AirTags and Chipolos running on the Find My app don’t offer this feature.</p><p>The volume of the tracker may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s keychain-style tags, both the Apple-only version and the device-agnostic version, and the Tile Slim wallet tracker were the loudest, measuring between 83 and 85 decibels.</p><p>Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that have no way of securing to anything without accessories, which are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">numerous</a>, but that is an additional cost to consider. Both Chipolo and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and both companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Batteries are replaceable for AirTags, Chipolo One and Tile Pro. Tile Mate and all card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies.</p><h3><strong>Stalking and stealing</strong></h3><p>AirTags have recently gotten a lot of attention for bad actors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-stalking-police-reports-190022315.html">planting</a> them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps both <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjEyMjI3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe9wp3dHWI77shmqqj-OBkY-SU2Wc70hbQ2fXQmBCFSp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT212227">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-tag-scan-and-secure-anti-stalking-175822554.html">Tile</a> have taken to address the issue. If an AirTag is detected moving with you and apart from its owner, the device will ring to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-update-hidden-airtags-easier-to-locate-092003140.html">alert you</a> of its presence. If you have an iPhone, as long as you have location services and Bluetooth turned on, you’ll automatically get an alert on your phone, with no further steps required. If you have an Android, you can download a special <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect">app</a> that can detect unknown AirTags. Tile offers a similar feature through its standard app, and it doesn’t require a Tile account to search for suspicious nearby trackers.</p><p>As far as combating theft goes, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be a good option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/exclusive-man-tracks-his-stolen-motorcycle-in-brooklyn-then-gets-in-fight-with-suspected-thieves/">cautionary</a>. Neither Apple nor Tile promote their trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our picks to Apple AirTag, Tile and Chipolo trackers.</p><p>Here’s the full list of every tracker we

I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing  and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use.</p><h2>Best Overall: Chipolo One</h2><p></p><p>Hands-on testing is great at smashing assumptions, and that’s what happened with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NoaXBvbG8ubmV0L2VuLXVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2NoaXBvbG8tb25lP3ZhcmlhbnQ9MTA5MTE0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQfkqeeZvBXcuomPJT61jsgt4i2cHkcRFhJyj21M8891&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fchipolo.net%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fchipolo-one%3Fvariant%3D109114">Chipolo One</a>. This tracker’s crowd-sourced finding network cannot compare with AirTag or Tile. In fact, when I left the Chipolo for 24 hours just outside the busy student union at UNM, I was never alerted that a member of the Chipolo <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NoaXBvbG8ubmV0L2VuLXVzL3BhZ2VzL2NvbW11bml0eSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjNiMTI0ZjgtMjY1ZC00OWE3LTlkMTEtNTJlNjcxYmVjMGM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATI2APUmcRWwTBLUMtXwsVojoxx3nxv3q3QP9ocvldHZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fchipolo.net%2Fen-us%2Fpages%2Fcommunity">community</a> had detected my item. But as I used it and pictured how most people would use a tracker on a daily basis, the device proved its worth and earned its spot on my keyring.</p><p>The One is a small and colorful plastic disc with a hole. It works with both Apple and Android devices and requires an app which is simple to use and easily pairs new trackers. The app and tracking experience on an iPhone and a Galaxy phone were nearly identical, working equally well on both platforms. It rang the loudest of all the trackers, so hidden items were quickly found around the house. Unlike other trackers, there was never a delay between pressing the Ring to Find button and hearing the trill. The ring delay for AirTag was never more than a few seconds and Tiles would generally connect and ring after no more than ten seconds. While that’s not a deal-breaking delay, it could add to the stress of rushing out the door.</p><p>Where the Chipolo One truly set itself apart was with its separation alerts. I would only get a half to two blocks away (or an average of 350 feet) before getting an alert asking if I’d forgotten an item. Neither AirTag nor Tile ever beat Chipolo to the punch. The alerts were consistent whether I was forgetting an item at home, at a coffee shop, or inside my car.</p><p>As far as losing stuff out in the wild, it will get you back to the spot where your phone and tracker were last paired. That means if you miss an alert or don’t have them turned on, Chipolo will give you directions (via your maps app) and take you right to where you left your item. In one test, I had a friend hide the tracker nearby when I wasn't looking. I left the area and returned hours later, using the last location information to lead me within a few feet of the tracker. Ringing the tracker then made it easy to find. Of course, if someone walks off with your tracked item, the Chipolo will be harder pressed to help you out.</p><p>If you’re concerned about lost <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-apple-airtags-allowed-in-checked-baggage-181915494.html">luggage</a> when you travel or if you worry you may lose things on trains or buses, this isn’t the tracker for you because of its much smaller finding network. But if you’re looking for a dead simple way to find your keys and make sure your jacket leaves the bar when you do, the Chipolo One is hard to beat.</p><h2>Best for iPhones: AirTag</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NWDUzMkFNLUEtQWlyVGFnL2RwL0IwOTMzQlZLNlQvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc5ZzLNwjJG6mIN9XaVHPNjo0oFXgfIKSOkLROnt2XGg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MX532AM-A-AirTag%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%2F">AirTags</a> work with the Find My app, so they don’t require any additional downloads. If you’ve used the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-share-location-iphone-143002231.html">Find My app</a> before, you’ll likely understand how this works. These are the quietest of the trackers we tested and each time you press the Play Sound button, the tags only ring for seven seconds. You’ll need to keep pressing if you don’t find your item right away and AirTags can’t be used to ring your phone.</p><p>As for separation alerts, AirTags were consistent, always delivering a “left behind” alert when I traveled about 1,200 feet away, or about three square blocks, without an item. You can turn off separation alerts for any given tracker, as well as designate certain locations, such as your home or workplace, as exceptions for the notifications.</p><p>One feature that AirTags have that no other tag offers is the ability to tap into the ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless protocol. This allows you to play a fun game of hot and cold with an item when it’s within about 25 feet of your iPhone. Directional arrows and a diminishing distance meter on your iPhone’s screen point you to an item without having to ring it. This worked reliably about 75 percent of the time in my tests; sometimes it was just easier to ring the item when the directional finding couldn’t keep a lock on the tracker. UWB is supported by iPhone models 11 and later and while newer Galaxy and Pixel phones also support UWB, no Android-compatible tracker has been released, though, Tile has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-pro-ultra-wideband-tracker-new-devices-100025451.html">announced</a> one that will.</p><p>AirTag’s ability to locate a lost item out in the city is almost eerie. I had someone (who was not carrying an iPhone) take my bike with a tracker hidden under the seat to a location a little over a half mile away. I set out a few minutes later and toggled on Notify When Found in the Find My app. Within three minutes, I received a notification that the bike had been “seen” near an address. Tapping on Directions navigates to Apple Maps, which took me to a spot about 30 feet from the bike. Had it been obscured from view, I could have then used the Find Nearby button to activate the UWB locating features. Ringing the tag was too quiet to hear on the sidewalk.</p><p>If you want the same scary-precise community finding features, but with a louder ring and a hole in the tracker, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaGlwb2xvLUNhcmQtU3BvdC1CbHVldG9vdGgtVHJhY2tlci9kcC9CMDlaVFo0N0s0P3JlZl89YXN0X3N0b19kcCZ0aD0xJnBzYz0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeFl8KreCE_w4Lj5S59_oP7B-RPSj1oVEOUvrPy8g3FF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-Card-Spot-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB09ZTZ47K4%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Chipolo One Spot</a> is a solid option. It doesn’t offer UWB capabilities, however, and the separation alerts are the same as with AirTags (letting you get 1,200 feet away before a ping, versus an average of 350 feet with our top rec, Chipolo One classic).</p><h2>Best for Android: Tile Pro</h2><p></p><p>Tile will work with either Android or Apple devices, but the experience is much better on Android. Certain connectivity issues and a lack of alerts that plagued the iPhone experience did not show up in tests with the Galaxy phone. One caveat to note is that Tile requires a subscription to enable separation alerts. Tile Premium goes for $3 per month or $30 per year and includes location history and item reimbursement of up to $100 on items that you register with the company, they’ll also send out a fresh battery once a year. Tile stands out as the only tracker company offering reimbursement — even without a subscription, they’ll pay out <a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051207613-Tile-Basic-Reimbursement">up to $25</a> for items that you register with them.</p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaWxlLVBvd2VyZnVsLUJsdWV0b290aC1XYXRlci1SZXNpc3RhbnQtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDlCMldMUldYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2M2IxMjRmOC0yNjVkLTQ5YTctOWQxMS01MmU2NzFiZWMwYzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdXOdxTBtCAHitdmq1AiKoc-LvadwEGqV7YICfAZdRqN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTile-Powerful-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09B2WLRWX">Tile Pro</a> is a key-fob shaped device with a metal keychain hole that feels sturdy. The Pro’s ring was just a few decibels quieter than the Tile Mate (78 versus 82 decibels), but the connectivity range was better with the Pro, and it was more accurate in finder network tests. On top of that, this is the only current Tile device with a replaceable battery, which lasts about one year.</p><p>For the lost-item tests, I had a friend take the Pro to random locations. After turning on the Notify When Found feature, an alert would arrive between five and ten minutes later saying my lost item was “found by the community.” The map details were typically accurate within about 100 feet or so, though it occasionally thought the Tile was at a business next door to where it actually was. Without the UWB feature, precision finding of an item was trickier. In one test, the tracker ended up in a noisy pub. While the directions pointed me to the right location, it would have been difficult to find the item if I hadn’t spotted my friend, as the ring function was useless among the din.</p><h2>Best wallet tracker: Tile Slim</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaWxlLTEtUGFjay1CbHVldG9vdGgtV2F0ZXItUmVzaXN0YW50LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjA5QjJOWUozVD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sYS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjNiMTI0ZjgtMjY1ZC00OWE3LTlkMTEtNTJlNjcxYmVjMGM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX3Nom_KP_hYwX1AS5BU_ZI5CO7F4TF2k3EiqENgBpfZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTile-1-Pack-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09B2NYJ3T">Tile Slim</a> is louder than both the Pro and the Mate, and nearly equals the loudest tracker we tested, the Chipolo One. It works with both Android and Apple devices and its thick credit card shape fits in the slots of a typical wallet (though it often won’t connect when inside an RFID-blocking wallet). The separation alerts you’ll get if you pay for a Tile subscription activate at about the same distance as the Tile Pro, letting you get around 1,500 feet away before pinging you about a left-behind item. When using an iPhone with Tile trackers, separation alerts rarely came and connectivity between the phone and tracker was spotty at best, even in close proximity.

<p>Amazon and Cochlear have teamed up on a new feature that streams audio directly from Fire TV devices to hearing implants, using the Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids (ASHA) protocol. It’s the first time a smart TV device can stream sound directly to a hearing implant processor.</p><p>Cochlear says television was the company’s natural next step after working on streaming audio from smartphones to hearing aids. “TV is a big part of our lives,” said Ryan Lopez, a product management and marketing director at Cochlear. “We get our news and information through television, our entertainment, sports, music. When we started to work with [Amazon], what really came to light was their dedication to accessibility, effective communication, and collaborating on how we can combine these technologies. At Cochlear, we were really proud to be a part of this.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature will work with the Cochlear Nucleus 8, Nucleus 7, Nucleus Kanso 2 and Baha 6 Max sound processors. You’ll also need a Fire TV Omni QLED Series, Fire TV Omni Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen) or Fire TV Cube (2nd Gen).</p><figure><img alt="The back left of a bearded man&#x002019;s head watching TV in his living room.

## Twitter’s 2FA paywall is a good opportunity to upgrade your security practices

<p>Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/an-update-on-two-factor-authentication-using-sms-on-twitter">announced plans to pull a popular method of two-factor authentication</a> for non-paying customers last week. Not only could this make your account more vulnerable to attack, but it may even undermine the platform’s security as a whole and set a dangerous precedent for other sites.</p><p>Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, adds a layer of security beyond password protection. Weak passwords that are easily guessed by hackers, leaked passwords or phishing attacks that can lure password details out of a user can all lead to unwanted third-party account access.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With 2FA, a user has another guard up. Simply entering a password isn’t enough to gain account access, and instead the user gets a notification via text message, or uses an authenticator app or security key to approve access.</p><p>“Two factor authentication shouldn't be behind a paywall,” Rachel Tobac, CEO of security awareness organization SocialProof Security, told Engadget, “especially not the most introductory level of two factor that we find most everyday users employing.”</p><p>Starting March 20, non-subscribers to Twitter will no longer be able to use text message authentication to get into their accounts. The feature will be automatically disabled if users don’t set up another form of 2FA. That puts users who don’t act quickly to update their settings at risk.</p><p>If you don’t want to pay <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">$8 to $11 per month for a Twitter Blue subscription</a>, there are still some options to keep your account secure. Under <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">security and account access settings</a>, Twitter users can change to “authentication app” or “security key” as their two-factor authentication method of choice.</p><p>Software-based authentication apps like Duo, Authy, Google Authenticator and the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/instead-of-sms-2fa-use-your-iphones-built-in-two-factor-authentication/">2FA authenticator built into iPhones</a> either send you a notification or, in the case of Twitter, generate a token that will let you complete your login. Instead of just a password, you’ll have to type in the six-digital code you see in the authentication app before it grants access to your Twitter account.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458935/two-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico">Security keys</a> work in a similar way, requiring an extra step to access an account. It’s a hardware-based option that plugs into your computer or connects wirelessly to confirm your identity. Brands include Yubikey, Thetis, and more.</p><p>Security keys are often considered more secure because a hacker would have to physically acquire the device to get in. 2FA methods that require a code to get in, like via text message or authentication app, are phishable, according to Tobac. In other words, hackers can deceive a user into giving up that code in order to get into the account. But hardware like security keys can’t be remotely accessed in the same way.</p><p>“Cyber attackers don't stand next to you when they hack you. They're hacking you through the phone, email, text message or social media DM,” Tobac said.</p><p>Still, putting any 2FA behind a paywall makes it more inaccessible for users, especially if the version put behind the paywall is as widely used as text-based authentication. Fewer people may be inclined to set it up, or they may be ignoring the pop-ups from Twitter to update their accounts so that they can get back to tweeting, Tobac said.</p><p>Without 2FA, it’s a lot easier for unauthorized actors to get into your account. More compromised accounts makes Twitter a less secure platform with more potential for attacks and impersonation.</p><p>“When it's easier for us to take over accounts, myths and disinformation increase and bad actors are going to increase on the site because it's easier to gain access to an account with a large following that you can tweet out whatever you like pretending to be them,” Tobac said.</p><p>Twitter CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1626782134248828929?lang=en">implied that</a> paywalling text-message based 2FA would save the company money. The controversial decision comes after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/tech/twitter-executives-resign/index.html">a privacy and security exodus at Twitter last fall</a>. In the midst of layoffs, high-level officials like former chief information security officer Lea Kissner and former head of integrity and safety Yoel Roth left the company.</p>

## The Morning After: The Kindle Store’s hottest new author is ChatGPT

However, the number of bot-written books is likely higher than that since Amazon’s policies don’t require authors to disclose their use of AI.</p><p>Brett Schickler published on the Kindle Store a children’s book written and illustrated by AI. Although Schickler says the book has earned him less than $100 since its January release, he only spent a few hours creating it with ChatGPT prompts like “write a story about a dad teaching his son about financial literacy.”</p><p>Science-fiction publication <em>Clarkesworld Magazine</em> has temporarily halted short-story submissions after receiving a flood of articles suspected of using AI without disclosure, which was reported by <em>PCMag</em>. Although Editor Neil Clarke didn’t specify how he identified them, he recognized the (allegedly) bot-assisted stories due to “some very obvious patterns.” He added that spam submissions resulting in bans hit 38 percent in February.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

Bungie will use this first victory in its argument during AimJunkies' countersuit, in which it accused the developer of violating its ToS for reverse-engineering its cheat software.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-wins-43-million-destiny-2-cheat-provider-aimjunkies-130644134.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-already-reversing-some-of-the-limits-it-put-on-bings-ai-chat-tools-212138986.html">Microsoft is already reversing some limits it put on Bing's AI chat tools</a></h2><h3>The company says it will restore long chats 'responsibly.'</h3><h3></h3><p>Microsoft limited Bing's AI chats early after launch to prevent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-limits-bing-conversations-to-prevent-disturbing-chatbot-responses-154142211.html?uuid=akwkEog6Bp804z7b1321"><ins>disturbing answers</ins></a>, but it now plans to <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/february-2023/The-new-Bing-and-Edge-Increasing-Limits-on-Chat-Sessions?uuid=eeH01U4E7hkpKI9m2321"><ins>restore</ins></a> longer chats.

## Uber's redesigned app puts all its services in one place

<p>Uber has given its app a major <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2cd8d8eb-701c-4377-94c5-920a8345ffac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Uber&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyY2Q4ZDhlYi03MDFjLTQzNzctOTRjNS05MjBhODM0NWZmYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWJlci5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vYXBwLXJlZGVzaWduLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjM2NmVmOTItZDM3NC00N2Y3LWEyZWEtYTM2NjgyNWJlZDQ2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeLiT8ECunETovzgUMEnvm0Ngi4sZFtXb3gpBYJjLWFa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fapp-redesign%2F">redesign</a> for the first time <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-02-uber-redesigned-app.html">in a long while</a>, and the new version reflects the massively expanded range of services in recent years. The updated <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368">iOS</a> apps center around a new home screen that puts ridesharing and Uber Eats deliveries in one place, with fewer steps needed to book trips or order food. There's also a dedicated tab for all the services available in your city, so you won't have to wonder which options are available.</p><p>The revamp promises more personalization as well. Tap the usual "where to?" button and you'll now see both saved locations as well as recommendations for destinations and ride types based on your habits. If you normally reserve rides instead of booking on the spot, you may see other scheduled options. An activity hub shows all your past and future Uber uses.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The upgrade also brings some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwdc-2022-new-features-coming-to-i-os-16-new-lockscreen-171715107.html">long-expected Live Activities features</a> to iPhone users. Anyone using iOS 16 can now see live ride progress on their phone's lock screen. And if you happen to have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max</a>, you'll see those ride updates around the Dynamic Island (read: front camera cutout) while the device is unlocked. You won't have to wait for notifications to know when it's time to head out the door.</p><p>The app is available today. Uber tells Engadget the Eats app "isn't going anywhere," and that the iPhone-specific upgrades will reach that software in the "coming months." The unified experience in the main app isn't exactly a shock, though. Uber now handles bikes, scooters, package deliveries, groceries and many other services beyond basic car hailing and restaurant orders. The app redesign might help you discover offerings you didn't realize were available, or encourage you to try features that previously felt like too much of a hassle.</p><p>A rework like this might be necessary. While Uber <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2023/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2022/default.aspx">touted</a> higher bookings and profit margins in 2022, its delivery business grew just six percent over the year. The harmonized app isn't guaranteed to improve Uber's bottom line, but it might encourage delivery orders from customers who otherwise wouldn't have tried a feature like Eats.</p>

## Samsung's Bixby now supports text-to-speech in English calls

<p>Last year, Samsung <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-5-release-date-personalization-security-privacy-200044860.html">introduced</a> a feature called &quot;Text Call&quot; for Bixby with One UI 5, which essentially transforms voice calls into written text and vice versa. It was initially available in Korean, but now the company has launched <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-enhancement-of-bixby?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=direct">support for the feature in (US) English</a>. The feature lets users answer calls by typing a message that Bixby will then read out loud to the caller. It can also transcribe what the caller says, making it a pretty useful tool for those hard of hearing or for anyone taking a call in a noisy environment.&nbsp;</p><p>While Bixby has several voice options, Samsung is giving users the capability to personalize the voice it uses to answer calls. They can use the new Bixby Custom Voice Creator to record a few sentences, allowing the assistant to analyze their voice and tone and then use artificial intelligence to mimic what they sound like. At the moment, though, both features come with limitations: Voice creator is only available in Korean on the Galaxy S23 series. Meanwhile, Text Call as a whole can only be accessed on Galaxy S23 devices, the Z Fold 4 and the Z Flip 4.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to English support for Text Call, Samsung has also rolled out the capability to customize Bixby's wake word into whatever the user wants. The assistant can now also play music that fits whatever workout is playing on Samsung Health and save schedules on the Calendar app. Finally, Samsung has expanded the things it can do offline, including setting timers, taking screenshots and switching on the flashlight.&nbsp;</p>

## Twitter will now alert you if a tweet you interacted with gets a Community Note

<p>Fake news can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-crisis-misinformation-policy-label-notice-ukraine-174550168.html">travel fast</a> on Twitter when amplified by likes and retweets, but now you'll be alerted if you've been an accessory to one of those lies. Starting today, you'll be notified if a tweet you've liked, replied to or retweeted receives a Community Note showing possible misinformation, the company said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CommunityNotes/status/1628158167006994436">tweet</a> spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/21/twitter-will-send-a-notification-when-a-tweet-you-replied-to-or-retweeted-gets-a-community-note/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Starting today, you’ll get a heads up if a Community Note starts showing on a Tweet you’ve replied to, Liked or Retweeted. This helps give people extra context that they might otherwise miss,&quot; Twitter's Community Notes account tweeted. CEO Elon Musk lauded the effort in a quote tweet, calling Community Notes a &quot;game changer for combating wrong information.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3ce71f7c24d64427b25c5857ce984914"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Starting today, you’ll get a heads up if a Community Note starts showing on a Tweet you’ve replied to, Liked or Retweeted.

Twitter now relies on it more than ever, though, as it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-lays-off-part-of-global-content-moderation-team-182048288.html">laid off</a> a large number of content moderators. Notes are viewable by all users across the globe, but only people from the US, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand can contribute them at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they're crowdsourced, Community Notes are far from reliable. In a recent example, a researcher investigating Twitter Blue noted that a number of high-profile accounts including Tesla had halted their subscriptions to the service. A Community Note insisted that was wrong, because Tesla was already a verified business, so it couldn't also be subscribed to Twitter Blue. However, Twitter's own data via its official API showed that Tesla did indeed unsubscribe from Twitter Blue, and the Community Note was subsequently removed.&nbsp;</p>
