This was an altogether more worrying display from Manchester City, who again huffed and heaved but somehow seemed to look less coherent as the game went on. For 45 minutes they simply toyed with their hosts, scoring through Riyad Mahrez and giving the distinct impression that they could raise the tempo whenever they wanted.</p><p>Instead the ignition came from Leipzig, so wan and timid in the first half, but a changed proposition in recent months under their new coach Marco Rose. Roared on by a deafening home crowd, they deservedly equalised through Josip Gvardiol, had chances enough to win it, and by the end were thoroughly dominating one of the best teams in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/22/rb-leipzig-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

After 21 years, 470 professional games, 142 Test matches (94 of them as captain), 15 Six Nations championships and five World Cups, Parisse had decided to quit at the end of the season. He still hasn’t given up hope of winning that one last valedictory cap for Italy, which he’s been waiting on ever since 2019. He lost out on it once because of the typhoon that washed out Italy’s match against the All Blacks at the 2019 World Cup, and then again when they postponed their Six Nations game against England during the pandemic.</p><p>“If the coach calls me, I’ll be happy to answer,” Parisse told the French press.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/22/for-players-in-wales-risk-v-reward-had-become-an-unfair-fight">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Shamima Begum: stateless and detained in Syria | Editorial

<p>Without being able to consider lived experience, the court came to the only judgment it could</p><p>Shamima Begum was a 15-year-old girl when she last set foot in Britain, in 2015. If the judgment of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/22/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-removal-british-citizenship" title="">stands</a>, Ms Begum will probably never return. Siac, the tribunal that hears immigration cases involving national security issues, upheld the right of the home secretary – Sajid Javid in 2019 – to strip her of UK citizenship because her presence was not “conducive to the public good”.</p><p>Many people will think this is a good thing. But Ms Begum makes a strong case that she was lured as a child to be a bride for Islamic State fighters in Syria. She went on to have three children, all of whom died. She lives now in limbo, stateless and detained in a Syrian camp. Her argument that she was not just groomed but trafficked ought to be taken seriously – not least after <a href="https://appgtraffickedbritons.org/press-release-inquiry-into-trafficked-britons-in-syria/" title="">MPs</a> found that systemic failures by UK public bodies enabled such a trade.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-shamima-begum-stateless-and-detained-in-syria">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To prevent millions of working-class patients being left behind in a two-tier healthcare system, we need a change from the status quo, says shadow health secretary <strong>Wes Streeting</strong></p><p>Patients are struggling to see a GP. Record numbers had to wait more than a month for an appointment last year, while millions couldn’t get an appointment at all. It means serious conditions are going missed. This is not the fault of GPs, but the Conservatives, who have cut thousands of doctors from general practice in the last decade. Labour will double medical school places, paid for by abolishing non-doms, but it will take time to train the GPs we need. Reform must also be part of the answer.</p><p>It won’t be news to most patients that the NHS could work better. Many people feel that they are passed from pillar to post, made to attend unnecessary appointments, or asked to inconvenience their lives for no good reason.

## ‘Is it antisemitic? Yes’: how Jewish actors and directors tackle The Merchant of Venice

<p>Tracy-Ann Oberman’s Shylock, who has been relocated to 1930s Britain, is inspired by her tough great grandma – while Henry Goodman felt shame after losing himself in Shakespeare’s most notorious character</p><p></p><p>‘This play has always fascinated and repulsed me and I don’t like it. I’ve never liked it.” It’s rare for an actor promoting their latest project to express revulsion. But nothing is simple for Tracy-Ann Oberman, playing Shylock in <a href="https://watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/events/the-merchant-of-venice-1936/">her own adaptation</a> of Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice. How do Jewish creatives approach English literature’s most notorious antisemitic archetype? Indeed, why return to the source of so many bloodthirsty, moneygrabbing slurs?<br /><br />Oberman first encountered the play aged 12. “It was taught in my school, very badly. In the playground afterwards everybody was running around, rubbing their hands, doing a ‘Jewish’ voice. It was cringe-making.” Nothing she saw as an adult reassured her. “I’ve seen productions where Shylock is mocked. I’ve seen versions where he’s a complete victim. I don’t know which is worse.”</p><p>Oberman gradually reimagined Shylock as a tough-as-nails widow, informed by her own family history. At 15, her great-grandmother came to England from her Belarus shtetl. Widowhood left her “a tough single mother in London’s East End. She lived in two rooms in a tenement flat near Cable Street until she was 98.” Oberman recalls other indomitable aunties: Machine-gun Molly (“men were terrified of her”) and Sarah Portugal, who “smoked a pipe, wore a slash of red lipstick – everything that was anathema to the aristocratic English. The very thing that made them survivors also made them outsiders – too loud, too brash, too strong, too opinionated.”<br /><br />It led her to set The Merchant in 1936, when the Jewish community in London’s East End was threatened by Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists. Antonio, the merchant who visits Shylock to secure a loan (penalty for defaulting: the infamous pound of flesh) is based on Mosley. Portia, who humiliates Shylock in court, is inspired by the aristocratic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/oct/17/looking-back-the-mitford-sisterslooking-back-the-mitford-sisters">Mitford sisters</a>. “There wasn’t a dictator the Mitfords didn’t love,” says Oberman, adding, “Portia is seen as the beautiful heroine but actually, she’s a fucking bitch. She destroys Shylock and doesn’t need to.”<br /><br />Mosley’s blackshirts attacked Jewish people and property, preparing to march through the district on 4 October 1936. “The police were beating up Jews and antifascists, not protecting them,” Oberman explains. “My great-grandmother always reminded me that their neighbours – their Irish neighbours, the small African-Caribbean community, the dockers, the working classes – all stood together. In our time, when nefarious sources try to pit minorities against each other, I hope this play shows we’re stronger, prouder and safer together.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/22/antisemitic-jewish-actors-directors-merchant-of-venice-shylock-tracy-ann-oberman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The lad from North Shields has come a long way since breaking down over breakfast one morning and now stands on the brink of Wembley glory and a chance to end a 54-year trophy drought</p><p>“Can I swear?,” inquires Sean Longstaff. The Newcastle midfielder has turned the clock back to 2020 and is searching for the right word to emphasise just how badly his career was unravelling at the time. “In training I was a bit of a tit,” he eventually explains. “I wasn’t nice to be around. I was miserable.”</p><p>Today Longstaff is a mainstay of Eddie Howe’s midfield, eagerly looking forward to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/newcastle-united-southampton-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report" title="">Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley</a>. Two and a half years ago, though, a difficult relationship with Newcastle’s former manager Steve Bruce and a slow recovery from an ACL tear had clouded everything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/22/newcastle-sean-longstaff-carabao-cup-final">Continue reading...</a>

But it is the female side of the Fendi family who have been in the driving seat throughout the 98-year-old history of their Italian luxury house, and the British designer Kim Jones is smart enough to realise that Fendi is not about him.<br /><br />“Fendi is a female-led, multigenerational house, and that is what I love about it,” said Jones backstage before the catwalk show, which opened Milan fashion week on Wednesday.</p><p>Silvia Venturini Fendi, whose grandparents Adele and Eduardo founded the house, now designs menswear and accessories; her daughter Delfina does the jewellery. “So with Silvia, Silvia’s mother, Delfina, and Delfina’s daughter, who is nearly 16, I have the point of view of many women.”<br /><br />The Fendi women are a tribe of “sophisticated working mothers who also enjoy having a good time”, said Jones. “They are a really fun family. They are women who like to do stuff. Women who are always evolving, who are interested in what’s new.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/22/fendi-designer-female-fashion-powerhouse-kim-jones">Continue reading...</a>

## Migrants go paddling 3,500km from the US border: Pablo Allison’s best photograph

<p>‘I joined a caravan of 2,000 people as they set off from southern Mexico, all risking death by machete or gun. After walking 50km in intense heat, we stopped at this river to rest’ </p><p>Although I was born in the UK, my mother is Mexican and I moved to Mexico City with my parents when I was three. I got into graffiti in the mid-90s while in my teens and started visiting a train yard in the Estado de México to look at the graffiti there and paint my own. That’s when I first saw people arriving on the tops of freight trains coming from Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico. I’d meet a friend who lived near the yard and remember him telling me these people were our enemies: he’d throw rocks at them. I didn’t really understand. Eventually, I became aware that these people were migrants arriving from countries in Central America.</p><p>It wasn’t until many years later, after I’d moved back to the UK, that I found out more. Having completed a photography degree – and a 19-month prison spell, related to my continued participation in the graffiti scene – I spent some time working for Amnesty International’s Central America team. I learned a lot about the human rights issues affecting the region. Today, especially in rich countries, I believe the word “migrant” has become synonymous with “enemy” or “invader”. Because of the way it dehumanises people, I feel uncomfortable using it. Often, those who make these dangerous train journeys to Mexico and beyond are fleeing extreme poverty, persecution and violence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/22/migrants--caravan-paddling-us-border-pablo-allisons-best-shot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A child’s gender identity crisis is mirrored by her mother’s crisis of identity as an artist in this warm, generously performed film</p><p>There’s gentleness and delicacy in this heartfelt family drama, a fiction feature debut from Basque film-maker Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren. It shows that the crises experienced by children, and by the adults coming to terms with those crises, are part of a larger ecosystem of emotional difficulty in the extended family.</p><p>Ane (Patricia López Arnaiz) is a sculptor living in south-west France. She has money worries and problems in her marriage to Gorka (Martxelo Rubio). They have three children, of whom the most troubled is Cocó (Sofía Otero). Eight-year-old Cocó’s worries and self-questioning emerge when Ane has to take the kids away for a summer break over the border in the Basque Country of Spain, staying with her widowed mother Lourdes (Ane Gaberain), who is now devoted to her beekeeping hobby but whose main occupation was once managing financial accounts for her husband, an artist, like Ane.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/22/20000-species-of-bees-review-trans-kid-struggles-to-find-a-place-in-family-eco-system">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While staying on a Welsh farm, I was given the task of feeding a bunch of ewes. It was the first time a sheep took notice of me</p><p>My relationship with sheep has changed. I must have encountered a million of them in my time as I strolled, rambled, ran, staggered and stomped my way around the countryside. They have always ignored me. Sometimes they would stare, utterly without interest. But, bar the odd baa, it was as if I wasn’t there. Fair enough.</p><p>I spent last week on a hill farm near Dolgellau in Snowdonia. One afternoon, the farmer sent me to feed several dozen ewes bearing twins. They were at the far side of a big field. I was told to wave the bag of feed in their direction. They didn’t even look up. Shake it and they will come, I was assured. None of them moved. Until one of them did. Then a couple fell in behind her, and soon the rest joined en masse, following like, well, sheep.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/22/flock-me-the-day-i-became-a-hero-to-some-disdainful-sheep">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The battle at the top of the table is unusually tight, but the idea that ‘anyone can beat anyone’ remains a fantasy</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/rcfoster">Richard Foster</a> for <a href="https://thefootballmine.com/">The Football Mine</a></p><p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/18/aston-villa-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Arsenal’s dramatic 4-2 victory at Villa Park</a> on Saturday, Jorginho was effusive in his praise of the English top flight. “That’s the Premier League,” he said. “That’s why it’s the best league in the world. It’s beautiful.” The Italy midfielder is not the first player or pundit to make such a claim and he will not be the last. The Premier League sells this narrative to its ever-increasing global audience and it is, by some margin, the world’s richest league, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/19/more-than-half-20-richest-clubs-in-world-premier-league-deloitte-report">revenues for its 20 clubs expected to exceed £6 billion this season</a> – as much as their two nearest rivals, La Liga and the Bundesliga, combined.</p><p>The Premier League prides itself on being the most competitive of the leading European leagues. The story goes that, on any given day, a team towards the bottom of the table can beat a team near the top. This David and Goliath narrative is undoubtedly attractive to broadcasters, introducing a sense of jeopardy to the continuous diet of televised matches. However, the evidence of the last decade shows that the strong are getting stronger, and the gap between them and the weak is getting much, much wider.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/22/premier-league-three-way-title-race-premier-league-unequal-as-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This tale of a middle-class Manhattan woman who vanishes, leaving her ex with the kids, is utterly addictive. It’s such a treat that when it’s over, you’ll feel bereft</p><p>It has become an increasingly common caveat to even the most enthusiastic of TV recommendations. “You must watch X!” a friend, who wishes you only happiness, says. “It doesn’t get going until episode two or three – but after that it’s <em>great</em>!” With an eight-episode series, this is the equivalent of being told you must plough through the first 80-130 pages of the new bestseller before your investment begins to be rewarded. This would be a cheeky stunt for an author to pull, but television gets away with it quite often – perhaps because the effort it takes to watch is so much less than reading.</p><p>So, let’s deal with the maths for Fleishman Is in Trouble, adapted for the small screen by Taffy Brodesser-Akner from her 2019 novel of the same name. This one only really gets going in its seventh episode (a rough correspondence with the book), when it performs the original’s outstanding pivot, which could be seen as testing an audience’s patience to the limit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/22/fleishman-is-in-trouble-review-jesse-eisenberg-divorce-drama-disney">Continue reading...</a>

The old-fashioned feel starts with a beautifully realised aerial ballet of the Prince swimming into Rusalka’s arms and continues once the lights go up with Chloe Lamford’s sets, grand and opulent to match the richly textured orchestral playing that the conductor <a href="https://www.semyonbychkov.com/">Semyon Bychkov</a> is conjuring up in the pit.</p><p>So far, so old-school – yet some of the visual opulence is unashamed stage trickery. For Yee and Abrahami, Rusalka is about humanity versus nature, the despoiling of natural beauty by human carelessness. Their previous work together has been ecologically conscious, and that continues here: you can be impressed by the lushness of the hanging fronds around Rusalka’s lake without guessing that they are made from metres of the wardrobe department’s old offcuts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/22/rusalka-review-royal-opera-house-junk-filled-staging-brings-magic-and-a-sombre-message">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Researchers say impact on attainment is small but medical teams should think carefully before artificially kickstarting labour</p><p>Children born after induced labour may score lower in school tests at age 12, research suggests. Although the impact on individual attainment is small, researchers said it should prompt medical teams to “think twice” before artificially kickstarting labour in otherwise healthy pregnancies.</p><p>Most pregnancies come to a natural end after 37 to 42 weeks with the spontaneous onset of labour, but approximately one in five births in the UK are artificially induced. Sometimes there are strong medical grounds for doing so, such as the mother or baby’s health being at risk, but in other cases women may be offered an induction because their baby is apparently healthy but overdue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/22/children-born-after-induced-labour-may-score-lower-in-tests-at-12">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>In 2016, when the first wave of virtual reality headsets hit the market after years of hype, I was sceptical. I was totally sold on VR, having had my mind blown playing a space dogfighting sim the previous year at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/24/internet-spaceships-are-serious-business">internet-spaceship convention Eve Fanfest</a>. But the original Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were just so unwieldy<em>. </em>They needed too many cables and so much space to operate that you had to dedicate a small room to them (which some of my more techy friends happily did). They were expensive, as were the PCs that you needed to run them. And having already played with VR several times at trade shows, the novelty was wearing off fast. Cool, sure, but the future of gaming? Nah.</p><p>The original PlayStation VR headset was the least technically powerful of that first wave of home VR tech, and also the least annoying to use. I was obsessed with Tetris Effect, which is a transcendental experience in VR, and its music-game cousin Rez. I played Moss, a charming storybook-style adventure about a mouse.

<p>This uncompromising classroom drama from director Ìlker Çatak initially tackles some insidious and uncomfortable truths, but never quite finds its full dramatic force</p><p>Ìlker Çatak’s new film is a nerve-janglingly painful and intense movie about an outbreak of stealing in a German secondary school. The uncompromising qualities initially coexist with something subtly insidious and unresolved, an unnerving demonstration of poisoned-herd mentality, all underscored by a disquieting musical score. This then gives away to a sort of melodrama which is less powerful and more generic. The dramatic tendons of the film slacken a little in its third act and I wondered if screenwriters Çatak and Johannes Duncker were sure how exactly to finish their story. Yet it hooks into the mind.</p><p>Leonie Benesch (who played Prince Philip’s ill-fated sister Cecile in The Crown) is Carla Nowak, a young, idealistic teacher of maths and PE at a school in which pupils are encouraged to think of themselves with something akin to citizens’ rights.

<p>Would you like to know which of his famously sardonic lyrics is his favourite, how Eels landed on their unique sound or what he’s looking forward to playing most on their upcoming tour? Now’s your chance to ask</p><p>As the frontman of seminal American band Eels, E – born Mark Oliver Everett – has released some of the most resonant and cultishly adored indie rock music of all time. Since launching Eels in 1996, E and his rotating cast of compatriots – including Jonathan “Butch” Norton and Kelly “Koool G Murder” Logsdon – have released 14 acclaimed, brilliantly witty albums, among them classics such as their 1996 debut Beautiful Freak, the sprawling double album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, and 2014’s Top 10-charting The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett.</p><p>Born in Virginia but a longtime resident of California, E is known for his sardonic, self-critical lyrical style as well as his bracing sense of humour, which makes many of Eels’ classic records jolting and affirming listens. Blending classic 90s rock sounds with samples, orchestral parts and elements of lounge-pop, Eels have carved out a distinctive sonic identity over the course of their 14 records, with a handful of their songs lending an acerbic, romantic sensibility to various film soundtracks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/22/post-your-questions-for-e-from-eels">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Haunting and poignant’: long-lost mass by Shirley Collins’ sister Dolly finally makes its debut

<p>A school-gate chat led to the rediscovery of the late composer Dolly Collins’ Missa Humana, as her folk star sister, the writer Maureen Duffy and medieval academic Lawrence Warner explain</p><p>In the liner notes for her 1969 folk album Anthems in Eden, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/shirley-collins">Shirley Collins</a> wrote about the musician with whom she made it: her big sister, Dolly. Dolly had arranged the ambitious song cycle about changes in rural England, weaving rare early music instruments such as sackbuts, crumhorns and viols around her sister’s stark English voice.</p><p>Anthems in Eden was a landmark album but Dolly’s next project was to be bigger. “Now she lives in a cottage in Hastings and is currently working on a full-scale secular Mass,” Shirley wrote. Dolly finally finished it decades later – not long before her sudden death in 1995 aged 62. Having gone nearly three decades unheard, the mass – titled Missa Humana – finally gets its world premiere next Saturday at London’s Conway Hall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/22/dolly-collins-shirley-collins-mass-missa-humana-debut">Continue reading...</a>

## Old God’s Time by Sebastian Barry review – a survivor’s song

<p>This sublime study of love, trauma, memory and loss explores the legacy of childhood abuse in Ireland’s Catholic institutions</p><p>There is a kind of writing so rare and accomplished that it seems to erase the very nuts and bolts of its own construction. Reading it can produce an experience that feels close to miraculous. Hilary Mantel’s Cromwell novels have it, for example; Virginia Woolf’s Jacob’s Room and Light Years by James Salter also spring to mind. It’s not merely a matter of technical mastery, though of course that’s a prerequisite. It can feel as though something sublime, almost uncanny, is going on.</p><p>In Sebastian Barry’s new novel it is the mid-1990s and widower Tom Kettle has been retired from the Garda for nine months. He spends his days sitting in a wicker chair in a slightly squalid flat annexed to a Victorian castle in Dalkey, smoking cigarillos and looking out to the Irish Sea, bobbing with fishing boats, and an island busy with cormorants. He is not unhappy, though his habits are ossifying and his life has lost all force and momentum; he is certainly lonely, although he perhaps hasn’t let himself understand that. That loneliness is clear in his longing for a visit from his daughter, or the eagerness with which he greets the unexpected appearance of Wilson and O’Casey, former colleagues in Dublin who have come to ask for his help with a case they’re working on.</p><p>Old God’s Time by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (£18.99).

<p>Khan’s creation for English National Ballet is filmed by Kapadia, and has an ambiguous intensity that should interest audiences beyond dance fans</p><p>Asif Kapadia returns with something unlike his previous acclaimed films … but maybe not utterly unlike. Kapadia has become known for intense documentary studies of agonised public figures including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/02/senna-film-review">Ayrton Senna</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece">Amy Winehouse</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/diego-maradona-review-asif-kapadia-documentary-cannes-film-festival">Diego Maradona</a>, for whom the glare of attention, and the claustrophobic crush of public adulation, was a kind of addictive ordeal. There are points of similarity in this new, fascinating and perplexingly ambiguous film, something without a clear story, but which admits of any number of readings.</p><p>Creature is a filmed theatre project, capturing Akram Khan’s English National Ballet work, also entitled Creature, starring the charismatic dancer Jeffrey Cirio as the Creature, thrillingly athletic and physical, every muscle and tendon visible. The Creature is apparently kept captive in some remote army research unit-slash-prison in the snowy wastes, overseen by a cruel figure called the Major (Fabian Reimair), experimented upon by the Doctor (Stina Quagebeur, who has a distinct Nurse Ratched look), but poignantly befriended by a lowly servant or cleaner called Marie, played by Erina Takahashi.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/22/creature-review-asif-kapadia-and-akram-khan-join-up-for-intriguing-dance-film">Continue reading...</a>

## A moment that changed me: I was vilified as a gay teenager – but Mariah Carey saved me

<p>At my boys’ school I was shoved, spat at and brutally bullied. Carey’s songs made me dig deep and keep going, even when I had a breakdown years later</p><p>I was 12 when it happened. Dad was parking the car and we were getting ready for a torturous hour of food shopping. Suddenly, over the radio, I heard a voice that today is one of the most recognisable in the world, but at the time it was new to me: a whispery, breathy voice that floated and fluttered over a slinky, laid-back track. It was Mariah Carey and the song was Honey. I instantly fell in love. What a voice!</p><p>The next weekend I rushed to HMV and bought the cassette tapes of two Carey albums, Butterfly and Daydream. This was when album covers would unfold into tiny books of song lyrics and photographs. I spent hours poring over Carey’s lyrics and listening to her in my room or on the bus. Her songs felt like an escape, a place of refuge. They took me away from the horror that I was experiencing. Because I was struggling. Really struggling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/22/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-vilified-as-a-gay-teenager-but-mariah-carey-saved-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The protected summits and valleys of the Tatras offer a return to the pleasures of traditional winter holidays – this time with all mod cons</p><p>The Tatra mountains in Slovakia had been touted as a great destination for a family skiing holiday. But as we stumbled out of the sleeper train from Prague at Poprad station at 6am, we were more anxious than excited. From the station we could see the jagged peaks of the High Tatras rising like black and white knives with a luminous pre-dawn glow against a pale blue night sky. Across Europe the news had been dominated by the lack of snow, that climate change was bringing about the end of the skiing industry as we know it.</p><p>As the mountain railway from Poprad climbed up through the foothills and wound its way through forests of spruce and larch, stopping at several mountain villages before arriving at the main resort of Tatranská Lomnica, we were slowly reassured. The snow was not deep, but deep enough, and above us we could see the sweep of pistes beneath the peaks and the lights of the snow tractors crawling about their tasks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/22/ski-holiday-slovakia-tatras-poprad-tatranska-lomnica-winter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Healthcare, corruption, union rights and gender violence are just some of many issues the world doesn’t get to see</p><p>After a year of war, audiences around the world are used to seeing news from Ukraine nearly every day. They have seen the horrors of the conflict, and the surprising resilience and success of the Ukrainian resistance. But sometimes the view of the actual people and society beneath the military conflict is lost. Ukraine is more than just a place where a war is happening. The country moves forward and faces corruption, emigration and economic issues, and questions of pay and gender-based rights, just like anywhere else.</p><p>I cover all these things as a reporter based in Kyiv. One change I’ve noticed over the past year is that people’s desire for justice at home has not diminished. If anything, it has got stronger – and rightly so, since most citizens are risking their lives to fight the genocidal threat posed by Russia. People have such a personal stake in Ukraine’s future, they are more sensitive than ever about what kind of country we are becoming, and how things should be after the war.</p><p>Kateryna Semchuk is Ukraine correspondent for openDemocracy, whose oDR project covers politics and society in post-Soviet states</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## David Warner exit leaves Australian Test team looking balanced in India | Geoff Lemon

<p>Management gets a convenient chance to try Travis Head at the top without being seen to have made a definitive call on Warner</p><p>So <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/20/australia-consider-sending-some-players-home-ahead-of-final-india-tests">David Warner is heading home</a>, arm busted and ambitions dented but that radiation-proof determination surely intact. Anyone who knows the feeling of broken bones could see what had happened as soon as he was hit by a Mohammed Siraj short ball during the Delhi Test. The way he yelped and flinched when the physio gently squeezed his arm reflects exactly that bright flash of pain that seems to start in the marrow and end between the temples.</p><p>It was strange then that the initial response from Australia’s captain and coach was that he might recover for the third Test a little more than a week away. The elbow fracture sustained is small – at the team hotel on Tuesday night Warner sat comfortably and only wore a light compression bandage around the injury. But even a tiny fracture hampers all movement anywhere near it. It radiates discomfort. It throbs like a bad tooth. He was never going to be able to hit a cricket ball so soon.<br /><br />Nursing him through the series might have made sense had Warner been the gun player in the line-up blazing runs, but this felt more like making a point that he remains firmly the first-choice opener. Now team management gets a convenient chance to try Travis Head at the top without being seen to have made a definitive call on Warner. The latter’s declining returns have been talked about plenty: his fighting 200 against South Africa’s pace in the Boxing Day Test ensured he would join this India tour, but it is also his only time past 50 in his last 15 innings. His career has never seen a streak that quiet.<br /><br />His two cheap dismissals in Nagpur helped set the tone for Australia’s substandard batting across the match. Those who only follow cricket from the scorecard will think the same of his 15 at Delhi, but that innings weathered a fierce opening hour, added a 50-run opening partnership, and gave the stability for Usman Khawaja to get set and go on to top score. Even the fetishists of hard noses and hard edges can’t credibly complain about getting out after your arm gets broken.<br /><br />Still. In a small sample size, Warner didn’t show a method for India that inspired confidence. He is a player that Australia want batting for a day, not an hour. With Cameron Green coming back, Peter Handscomb managing the conditions well and Head seeing the ball the way he is, Warner’s absence leaves the side looking balanced in these conditions.<br /><br />Head as an opener could work because he loves thrashing pace bowling, and the scant few overs of it that any Australian might see will come at the top of the innings. Even when the spinners follow up, a newer ball might suit his attacking shots. His style in these conditions is a gamble that could equally fail, but his bright start in the second innings in Delhi suggests he might pull off a couple more such efforts.<br /><br />That isn’t a viable option after this tour, though. Head’s propensity for thrashing the ball between cover and backward point would be a liability in England, where the ball swings and seams early while a cordon of catchers waits for the inevitable. His spot at number five has been perfect, facing an older ball while he either presses home an advantage or counterattacks in difficulty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/22/david-warner-exit-leaves-australian-test-team-looking-balanced-in-india">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hardcore fans build online lives around their favorite stars. But some behavior is too upsetting for them to endorse</p><p>This month, the self-proclaimed muse and New York it girl Julia Fox walked the runway for Alexander Wang’s first show since 2019. She wore a sheer mesh dress and oversized blazer, but the revealing outfit did not distract some viewers from what they see as a glaring hypocrisy: Wang was accused of sexual assault by multiple people in 2020. Though he denied the allegations at the time, Wang later said he would “set a better example” in the future. Months later, he reportedly <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/03/alexander-wang-responds-to-sexual-assault-allegations.html">apologized</a> to 11 of his accusers in a meeting orchestrated by the attorney Lisa Bloom.</p><p>On TikTok, where she has over 1.7 million followers, Fox – who has been outspoken in her support for victims of abuse and domestic violence – responded to criticisms of her support for the designer. “I love cancel culture but we do need to leave room for rehabilitation and for those who put in the work and heal and learn from their mistakes,” she wrote on the app.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/21/stan-accounts-julia-fox-matty-healy">Continue reading...</a>
