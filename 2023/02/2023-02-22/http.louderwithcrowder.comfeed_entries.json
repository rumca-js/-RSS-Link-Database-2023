The NEA (National Educators Association) said CRT is coming. Democrats have to think up a new lie about CRT being a Fox News myth. That makes videos like this all the more important to amplify. This father has an issue with the idea of white people being evil being promoted to his kids. I'm sure their white mother isn't thrilled about it either.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Amazing parent testimony on Critical Race Theory in our schools. <a href=\"https://t.co/Llbe0yBn4U\">pic.twitter.com/Llbe0yBn4U</a><br />\u2014 James Lindsay, uncitable (@ConceptualJames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1411882228423041024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><p>\"The problem with bringing [CRT] to the high school and grade school level is that we don't have the educators to properly teach these kids. Instead, they're using it as their own agenda to indoctrinate kids to hate each other. Whether you believe that to be true or not, the reality is that's what happening. Critical race theory is teaching that white people are bad. That's not true. That would teach my daughter that her mother's evil.\"</p><p>Hold on to your butts. That's NOT the bad part.</p><p>\"You already have an educator within your staff that has pulled my daughter aside and said, 'Well, you're a minority, so you know better than to engage in certain things.' When it was brought to the school's attention, nothing happened to the educator. Instead, my daughter was brought in and she was ridiculed.\"</p><p>Wow.</p><p>This dad is a better man than I am. If it were me, I'd be one of those crazy people the sergeant-at-arms was dragging out of the school. He realized the camera was on him and had a more important point to make. That STARTED with him pointing out what CRT was and who specifically it was meant for. HINT: not grade-schoolers.</p><p>The teachers' unions care more about their Marxist ideology than they ever did about students or parents.

Which I personally find to be pretty baller. But Joy Behar disagrees. She condemned McCarthy's action and called into question Tucker's credibility, before accidentally referring to the insurrection as an \"erection\". </p><p>That's right.

She whined that \"people died on January 6th\" and asked, \"Isn't McCarthy the real culprit here...How does he stand up straight without a spine?\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBEHAR: \"People were killed...People died on January 6th.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Daily Caller (@Daily Caller)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1628441973332881408\">1677085796</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBEHAR: \"Isn't McCarthy the real culprit here...How does he stand up straight without a spine?\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Daily Caller (@Daily Caller)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1628442919144226819\">1677086021</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Behar is correct that people died on January 6th. Four people, in fact. Ashli Babbitt is the only one mainstream media will report was killed by Capitol Police. But three other people died under <a href=\"https://taylerhansen.substack.com/p/capitol-offense-the-ugly-truth-behind\" target=\"_blank\">highly suspicious circumstances</a>, with some video evidence suggesting police may have played a role. </p><p>And Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes on January 7th. But before we knew that, the media claimed he was beaten to death by a fire extinguisher, then killed by bear-spray-yielding rioters. Neither claims were true. </p><p>I'm guessing Joy Behar knows none of this.

No? Well, what if the Clintons were involved? </p><p>This is exactly what happened to Mark Middleton, who passed away last May. Middleton was <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-epstein-bill-clinton-girls\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Clinton's</a> special advisor. Oh, and he also happened to sign <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-epstein-videos\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> into the White House several times. No biggie. </p><p>Middleton was 59 years old at the time of his death. His body was discovered at the Heifer Ranch in Perryville, Arkansas. Perry County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremy Lawson said of the scene,<em> \"</em><em>I could see what at first appeared to be a man sitting near a tree, as my eyes focused better, I could see a rope of some type going from the tree limb to the male.
