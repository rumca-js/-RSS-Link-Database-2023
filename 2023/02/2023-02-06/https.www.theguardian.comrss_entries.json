You might have heard her neurotic orchestral score for Munich: The Edge of War, her quirky period pastiches for Autumn de Wilde\u2019s adaptation of Emma and the abstract splurges of noise that soundtracked her sister Phoebe\u2019s series Fleabag, but tonight\u2019s show concentrated on her more low-key, personal work. Much of it draws from her recent EP VIII, a project with the 12 Ensemble which came out a couple of months ago. But you get the impression that Waller-Bridge is already itching to move on. She uses this show as a chance to rework some of that material, adding a saxophonist to the string quartet and also integrating her own piano playing into new pieces.</p><p>Some of the pieces really come to life on stage. On Trace, she alternates between a series of strident, baroque string arpeggios and creaky, atonal noises from the string section, as if manically toggling between the 17th and 21st centuries. A similar pattern occurs on Daylight, where lush, minor-key Romanticism collapses into polite avant garde freak outs. A jerky, minor-key composition called An Exercise in Restraint (Until You Go) \u2013 apparently a sonic representation of the \u201cwit of the staircase\u201d moments she experiences \u2013 starts to take on a shivery otherness, like a Renaissance chant put through an ambient filter. And the saxophonist locates new dimensions to these pieces \u2013 adding suitably ethereal textures on the baritone and curious countermelodies on the tenor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/06/isobel-waller-bridge-review-wit-and-emotion-in-abundance\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2023/feb/06/tottenham-manchester-city-harry-kane-everton-arsenal-football-weekly", "title": "Citizens Kaned by Spurs and Sean Dyche rides again \u2013 Football Weekly", "date_published": "2023-02-06 12:47:13+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxrushden\">Max Rushden</a> is joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kickback_nedum\">Nedum Onuoha</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonawils\">Jonathan Wilson</a> to review the weekend\u2019s action as the Premier League\u2019s top two both lost</p><p><strong>Rate, review, share on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/football-weekly-the-guardian/id188674007?mt=2\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly\">Soundcloud</a>, <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/football-weekly\">Audioboom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly/\">Mixcloud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/footballweekly\">Acast</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/guardianuk/football-weekly\">Stitcher</a>, and join the conversation on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianPodcasts/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaudio\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"mailto:footballweekly@theguardian.com\">email</a>.</strong></p><p>Today: Everton start life under Sean Dyche with a 1-0 win over Arsenal \u2013 a result that would have been far worse for the league leaders, had Spurs not beaten their title rivals Manchester City on Sunday.

In his SoHo studio, the air thick with cigarette smoke and whatever strange substance old paper quietly emits (the place groaned with books), he and I talked long and hard about <em>Maus</em>, then shortly to celebrate its 25th birthday, and every moment was \u2013 for me, at least \u2013 completely thrilling. I\u2019d long wondered about Spiegelman\u2019s daring in the matter of his famous comic. How on earth had he done it, committing to paper what felt at the time like a kind of blasphemy? But sitting opposite him, I think I understood. In conversation, certainty had only to appear on the horizon for ambivalence to wrestle it to the ground \u2013 and vice versa. He simply <em>had</em> to work stuff out. I doubt he could have resisted making <em>Maus</em> even if he\u2019d tried.</p><p>I guess there must still be some people out there who don\u2019t know about Spiegelman\u2019s masterwork. So perhaps I\u2019d better explain. The only comic ever to win a Pulitzer prize, <em>Maus</em> is a two-volume graphic novel about the Holocaust. Based on interviews with his father, Vladek, a survivor of Auschwitz, it depicts Jews as mice, Nazis as cats and Poles as pigs, though the source of the shock it caused when it came out (<em>Maus I</em> in 1986, and <em>Maus II</em> in 1991) lay more in its refusal to sanctify the survivor than in its anthropomorphism. The Vladek we see living in Queens with his second wife, Mala \u2013 the book has two time frames, past and present \u2013 is a parsimonious bully and a racist, a man his adult son can tolerate only when they\u2019re discussing the camps. As Spiegelman put it when he spoke to me: \u201cThis is the oddness of it. Auschwitz became for us a safe place: a place where he would talk and I would listen.\u201d (Vladek died in 1982; Spiegelman\u2019s mother, Anja, another survivor, had killed herself in 1968.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/06/maus-now-selected-writing-edited-by-hillary-chute-art-spiegelman-review-the-maus-that-made-history\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/06/a-car-free-break-in-west-cornwall-penzance-st-ives", "title": "Tin mines, art and subtropical gardens: a car-free break in west Cornwall", "date_published": "2023-02-06 07:00:14+00:00", "description": "<p>A shoreline-hugging bus route from Penzance and a cross-country one to St Ives come into their own in this exploration of the county\u2019s historic, cultural and natural riches</p><p>The fields ahead are yellow with daffodils and a soft ocean breeze smells of seaweed and smoked fish.
