<p>While going through my Outlook junk folder, I noticed that nearly all my Azure related mails are classified as such.<p>These e-mails are all real and also sent by addresses like azure@email.microsoft.com with the source SMTP server being in a subdomain of PROD.OUTLOOK.COM.<p>How comes that Microsoft would not just whitelist their own domains on their own e-mail service?</p>

## Ask HN: I’m falling out of love with coding

<p>I spoke to a lot of software engineers around me and the feeling seems common.<p>I remember the days I started coding, and how much I enjoyed that. I was able to create things with just the power of my thoughts, and it felt like a superpower.<p>Nowadays, I feel like I have to jump so many hoops and spend so much mental bandwidth just to get the permission to code. It would be fair to say that on avg I spend less than 20% of my time coding or solving problems.<p>Any project I work on is connected to a million different tools, workflows and services, that all do things their own way, and everything lives in a totally different place, where it’s hard to monitor what’s going on.<p>I feel like anything can break at any moment and ruin my day. I don’t understand any of the tools well enough to be confident that it’s stable, and the worst problems are the silent ones. This is giving me anxiety.<p>I work mostly with Javascript — and that doesn’t help. All the frameworks/libs I use insist on being too flexible, to the point where I don’t know where to start and how to do things. Just show me the “right” way, and let me figure out how to opt out if I want to. Oh and every 10 minutes there is a new tool that pops up that does things differently.<p>I wish I could go back to the days where I spent most of my day in the IDE and at the end produce something that was (to me) amazing. My most challenging moments were when I had a tough logic problem to solve — but I enjoyed those immensely. I’d rather fight with my brain than with the tools I use.<p>I wish I could just use an IDE that takes care of all the crap for me and just lets me code and write business logic.<p>I now understand why there’s a trend of developers who want to go live in a farm or take up woodworking: tough(er) problems, but with less variables & easier to reason about. If the wood breaks, you can see where and can probably guess why. Making a table is a mostly linear set of steps, and the basic tools you use don’t change much throughout the years. There is no invisible ghost that lives in a separate realm (dev environment) that can ruin your work at any time and leave no trace.<p>Any insights? Should I just switch careers?</p>

## Tell HN: DEI initiatives undermine the self esteem of PoC within a company

<p>As a black man, I have some issues with the DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) trend. As it exists within some (most?) companies, it seems to perpetuate imposter syndrome significantly. For example, I know I'm talented - I've got the projects, certs, and experience to back it up.<p>However, when I have to join a cheesy townhall once a month to discuss diversity hires, it makes me feel like I have no right to feel proud of any accomplishments I've made within the company.<p>"Why should I feel proud of my accomplishments, when the accomplishments were spoon-fed to me by the company because of my skin color? If I were a white man with the same experience, I might not even be here?"<p>In my opinion, it would be beneficial if DEI initiatives were confidential and kept "hush hush" within a company. Diversity is able to be seen. If you're actually a diverse company, then people will notice.<p>I could understand publishing a quarterly report, but creating townhall meetings and parading your black/brown employees around like show ponies is nothing short of corporate virtue signaling.<p>I realize this isn't the type of content posted to HN usually, and I realize it is in 'rant' territory, but I know a lot of managers in a lot of influential companies hangout here, so I figured posting this could spark some meaningful discussion.</p>

## Ask HN: Is anyone successfully self-hosting Firefox Sync?

<p>I use Firefox as my primary browser, and I would absolutely love to be able to use the Firefox Sync functionality to sync bookmarks, etc. across several devices.<p>However, I do not want to risk storing absolutely sensitive data (browsing history, auth cookies, credentials, etc) at some third party.<p>Everytime this comes up in HN comments, someone says that Firefox Sync can be self-hosted. And while this was true in the older versions of Firefox, it seems to me that self-hosting is currently neither supported nor documented. And it has been like this for at least since 2020[1][2].
It seems self-hosting is not a priority for Mozilla.<p>Is anyone actually self-hosting Firefox Sync?
If so, how do you do it? 
How is it working for you?

<p>Typical story I imagine-- ambitious, smart, promising career, was a technical co-founder at a small startup, and things seemed fine. Then I found myself wandering in the woods all day, crying for no reason and looking for non-existent fossils, which I found. I eventually saw petrified sea creatures everywhere and stopped going to work, or answering my phone, paying bills, etc. Things ended predictably, in horrible slow motion. Now I have a two year hole in my life, and I’ll never forgive myself for what I put my family through.<p>But nobody else will ever know that.
I’m functional and back in the industry, but it’s not the sort of thing people discuss at the water cooler.<p>So I’d like to ask if anyone else had a secret breakdown? I’m curious if my story is an outlier, or if this is one of those things that “just happens” to some people.</p>

<p>I have a pullup bar and a Lebert Equalizer kind of thing. I live in a small room at my university. I am planning on training bodyweight or calisthenics as it is called popularly.<p>HNers who train from home using minimal weights or equipments, can you suggest a path for me.<p>I am looking for some hints on:<p>1. What is the bare minimum balanced routine I can start with?<p>2. How long should I stick to it before I see or feel actual results from it?<p>3. Diet? Eggs are easily available for me.<p>4. A bit about your journey. How you started and how have you progressed on parameters of strength, routine, size, energy, etc.<p>P.S: I came across this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges where he suggests that to gain strength and general fitness you can train daily with 3 movements but not to failure. Is it possible?<p>My goals are to have enough muscle and strength so that I don't get tired doing chores lifting something for my household. I want this to go far into my old age so that I don't fall and spend my final years in a nursing home bed.</p>
