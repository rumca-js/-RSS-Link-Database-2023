<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/pc-shipments-record-decline-221737695.html">PC shipments are plunging</a> due to a tough economy and the pandemic recovery, and that's proving to be especially painful for Dell. The company is <a href="https://investors.delltechnologies.com/node/13991/html">laying off</a> about five percent of its workforce, or roughly 6,650 employees, to cope with a &quot;challenging global economic environment.&quot; Earlier cost reduction measures like an external hiring freeze weren't enough, according to operations chief Jeff Clarke. A market that &quot;continues to erode&quot; requires further action, he says.</p><p>The layoffs include organizational changes and &quot;resets,&quot; Clarke says. This includes streamlined sales and services, as well as engineering that focuses on &quot;priority offerings.&quot; <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-06/dell-dell-lays-off-about-6-650-employees-in-latest-tech-cuts?sref=10lNAhZ9">notes</a> the job cuts will bring Dell's employee count to its lowest in six years, and 39,000 below what it had at the start of the pandemic in January 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dell was one of the major beneficiaries of the pandemic as people rushed to buy PCs for remote work. Now that the boom is over, however, the firm's dependence on computers (approximately 55 percent of its revenue) is becoming a liability — particularly in an economic climate where purchasing power is dropping. Gartner and IDC both estimate that Dell's shipments plunged 16 percent in 2022 compared to the year before, and 37 percent in the last quarter. That's one of the worst declines among major PC vendors, and only Acer fared worse in the fourth quarter with a 41 percent drop.</p><p>This is just the latest in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-layoffs-183005204.html">series of layoffs this year</a>, and it comes just months after key rival HP said it would lay off as many as 6,000 workers. Few tech companies have avoided taking a hit in recent months, and even relatively successful brands like Apple are still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/applle-earnings-q1-2023-iphone-revenue-drop-215918997.html">grappling with falling sales</a>. Simply speaking, Dell might only recover once the industry as a whole has turned a corner.</p>

<p>I almost never leave the house without some device dedicated to exercising the creative part of my brain. Sometimes this is as simple as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t-30-camera-irl-153533230.html">camera</a> or a field recorder. Other times I bring my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-03-teenage-engineering-po-33-ko-sampler.html">Teenage Engineering PO-33</a> with me. It’s not that my phone and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-feature-drop-june-release-170036620.html">few apps</a> couldn’t accomplish the same thing. It’s just less satisfying. Less tactile.</p><p>I have also made no bones about my love of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/erica-synths-perkons-thunderous-drum-machine-review-140012827.html">strange</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chase-bliss-habit-review-guitar-effects-pedal-delay-looper-130017678.html">esoteric</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/make-noise-strega-review-a-wonderfully-weird-experimental-modular-synth-130019361.html">music gear</a>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-10-bastl-instruments-kastel-pocket-synth-aa-batteries.html">Bastl Instruments</a>’ Microgranny fits the bill for both these wants. It’s tiny, battery-powered and super weird. But I didn’t click with it immediately. I owned a Microgranny 2 briefly a few years back and ended up selling it. Yet, there was something about its crunchy lofi character that I couldn’t shake. So when Bastl Instruments launched the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJmZWN0Y2lyY3VpdC5jb20vYmFzdGwtbWljcm9ncmFubnktbW9ub2xpdGguaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODE2ZDc0OWEtNWQ3OC00ZDIwLTlhMTItNDk3MTMxM2M0ZjUzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcUtJDoDY0MH2tFgx-Xod5ldBKRL7ydKBsGOQtFMYt5Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.perfectcircuit.com%2Fbastl-microgranny-monolith.html">$246</a><a href="https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/microgranny-monolith">Microgranny Monolith</a>, I decided I should give it another shot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img alt="Rear view of ports on Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46bda440-a3f2-11ed-b3fa-93eee15c11f5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Monolith is the Microgranny in its “<a href="https://youtu.be/tDSY2bQHvNI">final form</a>.” Though, ultimately, it’s not terribly different from the Microgranny 2 that I slightly regret parting ways with. It’s a 5.5 x 3 x 1.8 inch monophonic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html">sampler</a> powered by a 9v battery (or 9v guitar pedal power cord). It has a built-in microphone for capturing the world around you in glorious 22,050Hz, 8-bit fidelity, as well as a line in and a microSD card preloaded with samples. There’s also a full-size MIDI in and audio out jack on the back.</p><p>The controls are pretty easy to figure out, though there is a slight learning curve to things like the recording and instant loop features. On the front are the six “big buttons” for playing back your samples, each of which also has a shift function. There’s also six smaller buttons and six knobs for controlling various parameters. All of this is in the exact same layout, with the exact same labeling as the Microgranny 2.</p><p>Physically, the only notable differences are in build quality. The Monolith is made out of dense PCB material instead of acrylic. And the knobs and buttons are all much more satisfying than the usable, but kind of toy-like ones found on the Microgranny 2. The text is also easier to read thanks to the brighter font and dark case. All-in-all, it’s a substantial physical upgrade.</p><section><img alt="Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith splayed open to change the battery." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/470b7620-a3f2-11ed-bfef-eec2b04be2b5" /></section><p>The one thing that hasn’t changed, that I really wish would have, is how you put batteries in the Microgranny. Bastl is a small company that makes instruments for weirdos, so I try to cut it some slack. But replacing the batteries on this thing is aggravating<em>. </em>You have to unscrew the bottom plate and take it off, which inevitably causes the sides of the instrument to also come off. Then, when you’re done shoving a 9v battery in there, you have to carefully realign all the pieces and hope everything stays in place while you screw it back together.</p><p>Fighting with the battery is really only an issue if you want to take the Microgranny out of the house with you. Otherwise you can use a standard 9V AC adapter, like the one most guitar pedals use. Thankfully, I happen to have plenty of those laying around. Obviously, this somewhat negates the portability factor, but as I’ll get to in a bit, that turned out to be less of a lure to me than expected. It’s also worth noting that the output is a little noisy when turned all the way up, so definitely stop at about 75 percent if you’re not into low constant whines.</p><h2>Granular</h2><figure><img alt="Sample rate and grain size control on the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46dfd240-a3f2-11ed-ad7b-33adc138ee50" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>What sets the Microgranny apart in a sea of portable and affordable music gear is that it’s a granular sampler. Now, Bastl is careful not to use the words “granular synthesizer” in most of its marketing materials. And that’s smart. Because if you’re coming here expecting the lush, alien and often ambient soundscapes usually associated with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-efx-fragments-granular-vst-effect-193053457.html">granular</a> synthesis you will be sorely disappointed.</p><p>For one, as mentioned earlier, the Microgranny is monophonic. That means you can’t play chords on it unless you’re sampling one. And two, the sound engine can only playback a single “grain” at a time. On something like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-lemondrop-and-fireball-nanobox-synthesizer-review-130035502.html">1010music Lemondrop</a>, for instance, you can get up to 16 bits of an audio file running simultaneously, creating complex and often unpredictable textures from the source material. The Microgranny, well, is more like a playable CD skip. But once you embrace that unabashed lofi nature, that’s when you can really connect with it.</p><div id="9fa3849a3bcd4a9abb5954e4b5350a7f"><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MTZkNzQ5YS01ZDc4LTRkMjAtOWExMi00OTcxMzEzYzRmNTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbaTBAERgY4dLvLLK-4mX0gThLYP091HjUOMZRKF8Wja&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Engadget">Engadget</a> · <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0L3NldHMvYmFzdGwtaW5zdHJ1bWVudHMtbWljcm9ncmFubnktbW9ub2xpdGgtc291bmQtc2FtcGxlcy9zLVZPNlJOYUFsdlE2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MTZkNzQ5YS01ZDc4LTRkMjAtOWExMi00OTcxMzEzYzRmNTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcVVDYzX16JJZ-qPV6PtT2Ep6XGf92yl1n-zaUWwXxYc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast%2Fsets%2Fbastl-instruments-microgranny-monolith-sound-samples%2Fs-VO6RNaAlvQ6" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith sound samples">Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith sound samples</a></div></div><p>Using the controls on the front, you can change the size of the grains, but you’ll never get smooth single cycle waveforms even at the smallest end. Instead the sound is broken and glitchy, like a corrupted MP3 you downloaded from Kazaa in 2002. You can control the speed and direction the playhead travels through your sample using the shift speed knob. It’s almost like very rudimentary time stretching. It doesn’t change the pitch of the sample you're playing back, but it can drag it out in an unnatural and artifact-riddled way.</p><p>Then there is sample rate, which changes both the pitch and speed of a sound, similar to an old school sampler. And crush – an absolutely unforgiving bit-crusher — that takes the already crusty character of the Microgranny to full meltdown even at lower settings. When cranked, crush turns any sample into what can only be described as an Atari 2600 trying to approximate the thunderous approach of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.</p><figure><img alt="The RNDMZR button on the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46e68900-a3f2-11ed-bffa-ebef01a28b39" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are also knobs for controlling the start and end points of a sample, as well as the attack and release. They’re basic things that you’ll need, but don’t impart much character. The other important controls are all shift functions found under the big buttons. Hold down FN and press those to turn on legato, set a sample to repeat, sync grain playback to a MIDI clock signal and randomly shift the playback head.</p><p>Then there are two other options – RNDMZR – which does what you’d expect: randomize all the parameters for the last played sample. This is the quickest way to complete aural chaos. And “tuned,” which has two different effects. For one it locks the sample rate options to semitones, instead of smooth pitch shifting. And two, when you connect a MIDI keyboard it will transpose the sample for melodic playback. When this is inactive, a keyboard will play back individual grains instead. The latter sounds great in theory, but I’ve honestly had a hard time finding a practical use for it.</p><h2>In use</h2><figure><img alt="Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46f7c710-a3f2-11ed-9fdb-8efeed0da241" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><p>Initially I was excited about the idea of the Microgranny as a go-everywhere, granular noise maker. Obviously everyone’s tastes and use cases are different, but I’ve found that it’s just not ideal for me in that role. For one, the limitations of the monophonic granular engine mean that it’s kind of hard to create something full and musical by simply snatching samples around me.</p><p>There’s no sequencer, so I can’t save a fun found-sound drum pattern for later use back in my home studio. I have to remember what I played and rely on my admittedly lackluster sense of rhythm. And the microphone just isn’t particularly sensitive. Even with the input cranked the source needs to be very loud. I turned my phone up all the way, placed the speaker less than half an inch away from the mic, and it was still pretty quiet. Your better bet is using the input jack directly connected to another audio source, like a synth or external mic.</p><div id="139dc832664645169452a6307a149548"></div><p>While the granular engine is definitely fun for getting glitchy stuttering sounds, I find it’s best deployed in moderation. Treating the Microgranny as a more traditional (if exceptionally lofi) sampler, though, delivers extremely satisfying results. Since there’s no way to play a sample chromatically in real time on the device itself, that does mean you’d need to sample individual notes or chords to create something melodic without the aid of a MIDI keyboard. Or, you could take one sample, copy and paste it across the six big buttons and adjust the sample rate of each to create a scale.</p><p>This isn’t to say that the Microgranny isn’t a fun or melodic instrument. It’s just that it feels more useful in the studio than out. I love it for creating rhythmic loops that I can import into my DAW or processing samples to get a nice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-sq-80-v-ensoniq-virtual-synth-hands-on-superbooth-160036483.html">digital patina</a> on them. And with a MIDI keyboard attached you can get that crispy pitched sound that makes the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e8c90726-6d93-44f8-97b0-21ecdf65b81e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Reverb&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlOGM5MDcyNi02ZDkzLTQ0ZjgtOTdiMC0yMWVjZGY2NWI4MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXZlcmIuY29tL3AvY2FzaW8tc2stMS0zMi1rZXktc2FtcGxpbmcta2V5Ym9hcmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgxNmQ3NDlhLTVkNzgtNGQyMC05YTEyLTQ5NzEzMTNjNGY1MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUdZT8YSvgdBe8fQ4n1P5V7cXFX-Hd0GUIFBXNj0lOGd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Freverb.com%2Fp%2Fcasio-sk-1-32-key-sampling-keyboard">Casio SK</a> series of keyboards so sought after (and insanely expensive) even 28 years later.</p><p>It’s not the easiest thing to do, but you can even chop up samples on the Microgranny by copying and pasting the same sound across multiple buttons and changing the starting point. It can be a little fiddly since you’re dealing with a really basic seven-segment LED display. But it can be done. This was honestly some of the most fun I had jamming with the Microgranny on its own. Load up some disco or house tracks and you can easily flip them into some lofi Daft Punk-type beats. Max out that crush knob and well, you’ve just created the ideal soundtrack for a rave at the end of the world.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="Large MG branding on the underside of the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/47000470-a3f2-11ed-bdfb-40dfe37ffc88" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>I think I probably gave up on the Microgranny too quickly the first time, since I was too focused on the mobile and granular aspects. When I couldn’t create otherworldly clouds of atmospherics or sketch out a song with multiple tracks, I went straight back to my PO-33 without digging any deeper. I failed to truly explore its potential as a more studio-bound instrument.</p><p>At $246 it’s not expensive, but it’s costly and quirky enough that it will only appeal to a particular niche that wants the most authentic lofi sampling they can get. Obviously you can change the sample and bit rate of a file on your computer. But – and this is my opinion – the Microgranny just imparts more character. And it’s the sort of character that’s hard to get without springing for a vintage sampler that might not be in perfect working order. So, if your preferred flavor of lofi grit is more cheap 80s digital than aging tape deck, the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith is definitely worth checking out.</p>

## The Morning After: Is Apple working on an ‘Ultra’ iPhone?

<p>Apple is considering a more expensive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-may-introduce-a-pricier-iphone-ultra-next-year-172301607.html">iPhone “Ultra”</a> that would slot in above the iPhone Pro, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. He says the device could arrive as early as next year. Gurman also pointed to recent comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook. “The iPhone has become so integral [to] people’s lives,” he told analysts when asked if the increasing average price of the iPhone was sustainable. “I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.”</p><p>Gurman hinted the iPhone Ultra could feature a faster processor, better camera hardware and an even larger display. “There also may be more future-forward features, such as finally dropping the charging port,” he adds. Apple already uses “Ultra” to tag its top M2 processors and Watches.

## Why I’m reviewing 'Hogwarts Legacy'
 - [https://www.engadget.com/hogwarts-legacy-boycott-editorial-110018998.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/hogwarts-legacy-boycott-editorial-110018998.html?src=rss)

<p>Five days ago, a review code for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> landed in my inbox. I’ve been thinking about this moment for more than a year, ever since the backlash against the game started gaining traction online. The author of the Harry Potter novels is transphobic and she’s targeted transgender women in particular. For this reason, some people in the LGBT+ community, and allies beyond, have decided to boycott <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>and admonish anyone who chooses to play or stream it themselves, sparking explosive arguments across social media, Twitch and YouTube. Those in favor of the boycott argue that playing the game benefits the author financially and indicates support for her beliefs. On the flipside, potential players point out that the author wasn’t involved in the creation of <em>Hogwarts Legac</em>y and her status as the world’s richest author won’t change regardless of the game’s success. Also, they really want to play it.</p><p>I fall into the second category. I’m currently about 15 hours into <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and I’m just barely scratching the surface; I’m having an incredible time. This feels like the RPG that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for, rich and alive and absolutely packed with magic.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s slightly frightening to write that down, knowing the condemnation I could receive. It’s an extra-light version of the dread I felt while publishing literally anything during Gamergate, but this time it’s more personal: The hate would be coming from people I actually care about.</p><p>I’ve been a video game journalist for the past 13 years, I’m a bisexual woman and I have a big ol’ Harry Potter tattoo next to an anti-TERF tattoo. I feel uniquely positioned to care about this particular topic, and to that end, I have a quick story to tell. It involves literary internet culture in the early 2000s, and I hope it illuminates factors that entwine the Wizarding World with the LGBT+ community, while demonstrating the vast divide that’s existed for decades between the fantasy and its creator.</p><p>As a pre-teen and throughout high school, I found solace in Harry Potter fanfiction, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-11-tumblr-fanfiction-fandom-purge-2018.html"><ins>bustling online ecosystem</ins></a> powered by Livejournal, FF.net, AO3 and other community-run sites. I cannot overstate how popular Harry Potter fanfiction was and still is, nor how queer it’s always been. Most stories in Harry Potter fanfiction center on LGBT+ characters, and for good reason – in the early aughts, media for and by gay people was ridiculously hard to come by, and then when you did find something, it was often campy, trashy, or both. It was a pre-streaming, pre-YouTube, pre-TikTok way of life. So we wrote our own stories as fanfiction. Long before the release of the final Harry Potter book, we infused the halls of Hogwarts with magically amplified, non-heterosexual and non-cisgender characters, and we wrote millions of words about them living full, fantastic lives. We made Dumbledore gay long before the canon did.</p><p>In those early days, an important part of the Harry Potter fanfiction process was critiquing the world and recognizing the limits of the author’s imagination. With each new book release, the forums would light up with praise and criticism, and our own stories would continue to evolve outside of the pages of the novels. These fics are more real to me than the source material; when I traverse the hallways of the Slytherin dungeons in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, my mind accesses memories from my favorite fanfics – not the books – and I’m infused with warmth. The halls of Hogwarts are my safe space, still.</p><p>I recognize my circumstances are incredibly specific, but I also know mine isn’t a unique experience. Fantasy worlds offer an escape for queer and non-queer people alike, and coming-of-age fiction can be powerful, formulative stuff. This particular fantasy universe was a place of belonging for me, and I think its latest iteration, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, could offer a similar slice of peace to young players today.</p><p>I understand the anger and protective energy from people who don’t want to play the game. It’s a terrifying time to be transgender: Ultra-conservative lawmakers are writing discrimination and blind hate into law, while neo-nazi rhetoric has found new life on mainstream social media platforms. Deadly violence against trans people, particularly Black transgender women, remains <a href="https://reports.hrc.org/an-epidemic-of-violence-2022"><ins>a pervasive epidemic</ins></a> in the United States. Among these real-world threats, we’re clashing over the virtues of playing or not playing <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. It’s been depressing to observe as this conversation sows division and sucks attention away from our shared goals, limiting our ability to celebrate new successes.</p><p>Harry Potter will outlive its author. She is not the future of the franchise. Avalanche, Portkey Games and Warner Bros. have been well aware of the pervasive disgust for the author’s ideology for years, and I believe it encouraged them to include more representation in the game than the series has ever seen. <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>allows for various expressions of gender identity in the character creator and casually drops “they” pronouns in conversation; all around, the cast is diverse and Avalanche writes non-white characters better than the original author did. There’s still room for improvement, and that’s why the conversation needs to be ongoing: Positive progress is our shared goal.</p><p>As someone who searched desperately for an example of my own identity in the pages of Harry Potter novels, I deeply appreciate the evolution and inclusion in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. This level of representation didn’t exist in AAA games 15 years ago, and it’s the result of all the progress made, through protest and education, since the books were published. Long before the in-fighting over a choice to play a video game.</p><p>If you don’t want to engage with <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, please, boycott the game – just don’t boycott the players. It’s us<em>&nbsp;</em>against the transphobic people in the world, not us against each other. Some of us will choose to play, some of us won’t. Even more will wonder why anyone even cares about this fictional kid and his heteronormative, whitewashed, multibillion-dollar franchise. These are all valid options. Playing <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>doesn’t automatically make you transphobic. Boycotting it doesn’t automatically make you an ally – supporting our community members does.</p><p>We’ll have a full review of <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>later in the week, once I’ve had enough time with this enormous game to fully form an opinion on it. Even if I catch hell for this perspective, I’ll be here, supporting local inclusion efforts, protesting discrimination, calling my lawmakers, loving my community and playing the gayest version of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> possible.</p>

## Elon Musk says Twitter will offer a free API tier for 'good' bots

<p>After announcing last week that all developers would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-charging-developers-api-access-104917093.html">have to pay</a> to access Twitter's API, CEO Elon Musk has walked that back a step. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1622082025166442505">tweet</a> yesterday, he announced that &quot;responding to feedback, Twitter will enable a light, write-only API for bots providing good content that is free.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Since August of 2020, Twitter has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-api-thirdparty-apps-201408959.html">offered</a> a &quot;basic&quot; free tier as part of its V2 API, designed for &quot;those just getting started, building something for fun, for a good cause, and to learn or teach,&quot; the company wrote at the time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c338617dd4234e1899b697b29ee32aca"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Responding to feedback, Twitter will enable a light, write-only API for bots providing good content that is free</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1622082025166442505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>In January, however, Twitter revoked API access to third-party apps citing &quot;long-standing rules.&quot; It then updated its developer terms banning third-party clients, effectively killing apps like Twitterific and Tweetbot. Finally last week, Twitter announced that all developers would have to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621259936524300289">pay to use its API</a>, starting at around $100 per month for the basic tier.&nbsp;</p><p>That resulted in an outcry that the new rules would kill many fun and useful bots that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/twitter-bot-api-changes-killing-fun">create quotes around tweets</a>, provide <a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechAlert/">alerts</a> for tech execs unfollowing each other, <a href="https://twitter.com/_weather_bot_">show the weather</a> in random parts of the world and more. Many of the folks who run the bots told <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/twitter-bot-api-changes-killing-fun"><em>Buzzfeed</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>they could never pay that amount to keep them running, so they'd simply disappear. &quot;It was a fun thing, a thing that actually provided Twitter with more value,&quot; said the person behind <a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechAlert">@BigTechAlert</a>, Álex Barredo.</p><p>It's unclear if Musk's Twitter will use something like the current basic tier. Also left unsaid so far is what might constitute &quot;good content.&quot; If approval is required for each bot, that could be a challenge considering the company's severely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-lays-off-part-of-global-content-moderation-team-182048288.html">downsized</a> moderation team.&nbsp;</p><div id="6b4abe1496454e93a2951eed91a4f36c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Last 3 months were extremely tough, as had to save Twitter from bankruptcy, while fulfilling essential Tesla &amp; SpaceX duties.

At the same time, Twitter has introduced subscriptions and detailed plans to share ad revenue with creators.</p><p>However, Musk recently tweeted that Twitter is &quot;now trending to breakeven,&quot; following several &quot;extremely tough&quot; months. The company still faces challenges, however, like advertisers reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-advertisers-media-finances-185425994.html">fleeing in droves</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-twitter-employees-file-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-224913407.html">class-action suits</a> from employees and potential <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-15/twitter-turmoil-sparks-close-privacy-scrutiny-in-eu">regulator scrutiny</a> in the EU and elsewhere.</p>
