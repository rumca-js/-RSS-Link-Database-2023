China's economy has also been revised upward significantly to 5.2 % from the 4.4 % forecast in October last year. Bloomberg said this is the first time in a year that the IMF has raised its growth forecast for the global economy. The reason for the upward revision is the rebound in demand in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the improvement in China's outbreak of Covid-19.\nThe report also claims that changes in China's outbreak control measures will boost global economic growth and that a weaker U.S. dollar offers a brighter outlook for emerging market countries with foreign debt. Economic growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to rise to 4.0% in 2023.\nHowever, local Chinese economists and professionals are far from being so optimistic. \n\nHave questions?
