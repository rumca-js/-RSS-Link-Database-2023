I was able to create things with just the power of my thoughts, and it felt like a superpower.<p>Nowadays, I feel like I have to jump so many hoops and spend so much mental bandwidth just to get the permission to code. It would be fair to say that on avg I spend less than 20% of my time coding or solving problems.<p>Any project I work on is connected to a million different tools, workflows and services, that all do things their own way, and everything lives in a totally different place, where it\u2019s hard to monitor what\u2019s going on.<p>I feel like anything can break at any moment and ruin my day. I don\u2019t understand any of the tools well enough to be confident that it\u2019s stable, and the worst problems are the silent ones. This is giving me anxiety.<p>I work mostly with Javascript \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t help. All the frameworks/libs I use insist on being too flexible, to the point where I don\u2019t know where to start and how to do things. Just show me the \u201cright\u201d way, and let me figure out how to opt out if I want to. Oh and every 10 minutes there is a new tool that pops up that does things differently.<p>I wish I could go back to the days where I spent most of my day in the IDE and at the end produce something that was (to me) amazing. My most challenging moments were when I had a tough logic problem to solve \u2014 but I enjoyed those immensely. I\u2019d rather fight with my brain than with the tools I use.<p>I wish I could just use an IDE that takes care of all the crap for me and just lets me code and write business logic.<p>I now understand why there\u2019s a trend of developers who want to go live in a farm or take up woodworking: tough(er) problems, but with less variables & easier to reason about. If the wood breaks, you can see where and can probably guess why. Making a table is a mostly linear set of steps, and the basic tools you use don\u2019t change much throughout the years. There is no invisible ghost that lives in a separate realm (dev environment) that can ruin your work at any time and leave no trace.<p>Any insights? Should I just switch careers?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34677194\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34677194</a></p>\n<p>Points: 68</p>\n<p># Comments: 64</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34677180", "title": "Tell HN: DEI initiatives undermine the self esteem of PoC within a company", "date_published": "2023-02-06 13:45:38+00:00", "description": "<p>As a black man, I have some issues with the DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) trend. As it exists within some (most?) companies, it seems to perpetuate imposter syndrome significantly. For example, I know I'm talented - I've got the projects, certs, and experience to back it up.<p>However, when I have to join a cheesy townhall once a month to discuss diversity hires, it makes me feel like I have no right to feel proud of any accomplishments I've made within the company.<p>\"Why should I feel proud of my accomplishments, when the accomplishments were spoon-fed to me by the company because of my skin color? If I were a white man with the same experience, I might not even be here?\"<p>In my opinion, it would be beneficial if DEI initiatives were confidential and kept \"hush hush\" within a company. Diversity is able to be seen. If you're actually a diverse company, then people will notice.<p>I could understand publishing a quarterly report, but creating townhall meetings and parading your black/brown employees around like show ponies is nothing short of corporate virtue signaling.<p>I realize this isn't the type of content posted to HN usually, and I realize it is in 'rant' territory, but I know a lot of managers in a
