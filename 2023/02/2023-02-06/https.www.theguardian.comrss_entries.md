## What is wokeness? A close shave with a 4x4 got me thinking | Zoe Williams

<p>Drivers are cast as anti-woke and cyclists as the opposite, when the reality is often quite different. But I would have enjoyed an apology from the driver who turned suddenly into my cycle path<strong><br /></strong></p><p>When I’m cycling with my 15-year-old, I like him to go in front so I can see him, and he likes me to go in front, so he doesn’t have to make a judgment call about whether to overtake buses. We both like to spend the first five minutes of any journey arguing this point, to the extent that we lose any time advantage conferred by the bikes in the first place. On shorter journeys, it would definitely be quicker to walk. It’s not a bad parable for the maternal experience: you worry about them and think of it as altruism, but to them, it looks like you are ferociously prioritising yourself, fuming, “You go in front, you nitwit”, before eventually surrendering. This is why people can’t stand their mothers, then feel bad about it. This is what keeps psychoanalysts in business, and also Moonpig.</p><p>Yesterday there was an additional complication in that we only had three lights between us, so we were also arguing about who would get the only front light. His position was that I should have it, being the one in front, and mine was that he should, being the next and more precious generation. I actually won that round, more fool me.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/06/what-is-wokeness-a-close-shave-with-a-4x4-got-me-thinking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An old legal comedy gives the bishop a bad name, in clue form, in our latest reading for puzzlers</p><p>Our author, AP Herbert, was a lot of things. An independent MP from 1935 to 1950; a head of various public bodies; a campaigner for reform of divorce laws. His blue plaque in Hammersmith, London, though, begins: “Author, humourist”.</p><p>Some of that humour takes place in the legal system, a world Herbert knew well, having studied jurisprudence and being the grandson of a lord justice of appeal. In his Misleading Cases series for Punch magazine, he offered accounts of fictional trials that became bestselling books in 1927 – and which remain funny almost a century later.</p><p>… as ‘a prosy humbug’, as ‘an intolerably hearty and overpaid clergyman’, ‘the world’s worst golfer’, ‘canting Tommy’, ‘the sniffing parson’, and other vile expressions of the kind.</p><p>… the names of mythical animals and biblical characters, prepositions, foreign towns, classical writers, obscure musical instruments, vegetables, little-known adjectives, and so forth.</p><p>… this unhappy victim of the defendant’s spite had not even the satisfaction of a principal (and horizontal) place in the puzzle, but was degraded to the position of a word in four letters, reading downward, an indignity intolerable, milord, to a man of his years and sensibility.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/crossword-blog/2023/feb/06/crossword-book-club-ap-herberts-uncommon-law">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The queen of pop broke records – though not for the big gongs, again. But if the Recording Academy has a history of unexpected choices, this year’s wins for Styles, Bonnie Raitt and Lizzo had substance behind them</p><p>Anyone looking for controversy about the winners of this year’s Grammy awards is likely to alight on the subject of Beyoncé: you could try and make a case that one of the big gongs should have gone to Kendrick Lamar, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/13/kendrick-lamar-mr-morale-the-big-steppers-review">Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</a> – a brilliant album, but a knotty, complex one, which furthermore achieved a fraction of the sales of its predecessor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/14/kendrick-lamar-damn-review">Damn</a> – was probably never in with a chance. Without wishing to cast shade on those doughtily toiling away in the areas covered by the best score soundtrack for video games and other interactive media and best new age ambient or chant album categories, the Grammys are ultimately about four awards: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist.</p><p>As a solo artist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce">Beyoncé</a> has only ever won one of them once – song of the year in 2010 for Single Ladies – which seems a fairly inexplicable state of affairs: you don’t need to be a rabid member of the Bey Hive to know that she’s had an immense cultural and commercial impact over the last 20 years. That nothing changed this year, making her an eight-time unsuccessful nominee in the record of the year category, is doubtless going to raise some thorny questions and provoke outrage – she had to make do with best dance/electronic recording and best dance/electronic music album, and with becoming the artist who’s won the most Grammys ever, presumably enough to stop her withdrawing from the awards in future as the Weeknd and Drake have done in recent years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/06/grammys-2023-if-someone-had-to-pip-beyonce-you-could-do-worse-than-harry-styles">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Deaf Institute, Manchester<br /></strong>The septuagenarian rock star’s songwriting is as sharp as ever, with new songs stealing the limelight from classic hits</p><p>“All my old favourites seem tired and old,” sings Chrissie Hynde, performing the Pretenders’ new song Losing Sense for the very first time. As far as opening salvos go, it amounts to a manifesto of what not to be – and during the 80 minutes that follow, they sound and look anything but worn out or jaded. Hynde is 71, but with her piled up hair, trademark kohl eyeliner, black faux leather waistcoat and guitar strapped on like a rifle, she’s still the epitome of an iconic rock star, a visible role model to the young women in the crowd who have copied her look wholesale.</p><p>Over their 44-year career, the Pretenders have never chased trends or followed fashions to stay relevant. But they didn’t need to. Their influential jangling sound – helpfully described on their T-shirts as “two guitar, bass and drums” – has become timeless. It’s also still the perfect vehicle for Hynde’s voice, an instantly recognisable mix of sand and honey, attitude and yearning which sounds all the more remarkable in such intimate surroundings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/06/the-pretenders-review-chrissie-hynde-is-still-the-talk-of-the-town">Continue reading...</a>

When McAlmont returned to England in 1987, after years spent living in his mother’s home country of Guyana, his first introduction to the notion of “alternative” music was seeing a video of Dickson and his old band the Soup Dragons on The Chart Show. Meanwhile, in the late 90s, before he came out as gay, Dickson remembers seeing McAlmont on television, performing in a catsuit trimmed with marabou feathers, makeup and heels, and “feeling kind of proud in a way that somebody was actually doing that”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/06/hifi-sean-david-mcalmont-happy-ending">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, the world heavyweight champion talks about the devastation of war and searching for signs of hope</p><p>“The walls were shaking and the dogs were hiding,” Oleksandr Usyk says quietly, a few hours after another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/26/ukraine-mass-missile-attack-kyiv-day-after-tanks-promise">wave of Russian bombs hits Kyiv</a> on a mid-winter morning. The world heavyweight champion is hard at work in his training camp outside the capital as he prepares for his planned unification bout with Tyson Fury in the coming months. But the greedy machinations of boxing matter little when set against the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Usyk, who looks lean and fit as he tugs thoughtfully at his close-cropped beard, wears a pristine white T-shirt. A beautiful black and white photograph of Muhammad Ali is printed on the front. The old promise of “Float Like A Butterfly” ripples below the photo and Usyk grins while Ali dances across my Zoom screen. A friend gave him the shirt for his 36th birthday on 17 January, but a Ukrainian flag, signed with messages for the champion by soldiers on the frontline, hangs behind him in a reminder that he is on the edge of a war zone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/06/oleksandr-usyk-interview-ukraine-world-heavyweight-boxing-champion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A welcome revival of a 1980s comedy prophesying the collapse of the Soviet Union</p><p>Here is a revival of a 1983 film from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/30/taming-the-garden-review-georgia-salome-jashi-bidzina-ivanishvili-tree-collecting-eco-vandalism">Georgian</a> director Eldar Shengelaia (still alive at 90) and it is revealed as an intriguing, and perhaps even remarkable creation: a dapper, droll satire on Soviet bureaucracy, a shaggy dog story of absurd humour that creeps up on you, culminating in a truly bizarre apocalypse. The satire was arguably lenient enough to get the film made and lenient enough to win it the USSR State prize, but we can see from our 2023 vantage point that it is a deadpan prophecy of the Soviet Union’s imminent collapse. If we could go back in time to this film’s first release and tell Shengelaia that just six years later the Berlin Wall would come down and with it the entire Soviet system, would he have been surprised? Perhaps only about the fact that it was going to take so long.</p><p>The scene is a state publishing company that also supervises printing and takes delivery of noisome chemicals in its basement courtyard. A would-be writer called Soso (Ramaz Giorgobiani) is scurrying about the building, desperately trying to interest its harassed or indolent functionaries in his novel, entitled Tian Shan, or The Blue Mountains – and therefore, we must assume, literally or metaphorically about the central Asian mountain ranges, although no one ever asks him about it or discusses literary matters in any way. No one definitively rejects him or accepts him. He is always referred to someone else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/blue-mountains-review-brilliant-georgian-shaggy-dog-satire-on-the-soviet-mindset">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two pocket-friendly one-pan pasta dishes: gnocchi in a creamy, cheesy tomato-and-basil sauce, and eggs nestled in pasta with spinach</p><p>One-tin baked gnocchi is something of a signature dish for me , and this version with a creamy tomato and basil sauce is a real ribsticker of a dish – perfect cold-weather comfort food. (If you are cooking for one or two, I’d encourage you to make the full recipe, because the leftovers are fantastic the next day.) And, for a fun baked pasta dish, my recipe for eggs florentine, in which, rather than baking the eggs in a spinach-enriched bechamel, I add cooked pasta for a balanced meal, and double cream for ease and speed.

## Isobel Waller-Bridge review – wit and emotion in abundance

<p><strong>Purcell Room, London<br /></strong>The film and TV composer uses the live setting to really stretch her wings, adding an invigorating extra dimension to recent works and debuting some thrilling new pieces</p><p>Isobel Waller-Bridge has become such an established composer for film, television and theatre that it seems astonishing that this short, low-key date is being trumpeted as her UK debut. You might have heard her neurotic orchestral score for Munich: The Edge of War, her quirky period pastiches for Autumn de Wilde’s adaptation of Emma and the abstract splurges of noise that soundtracked her sister Phoebe’s series Fleabag, but tonight’s show concentrated on her more low-key, personal work. Much of it draws from her recent EP VIII, a project with the 12 Ensemble which came out a couple of months ago. But you get the impression that Waller-Bridge is already itching to move on. She uses this show as a chance to rework some of that material, adding a saxophonist to the string quartet and also integrating her own piano playing into new pieces.</p><p>Some of the pieces really come to life on stage. On Trace, she alternates between a series of strident, baroque string arpeggios and creaky, atonal noises from the string section, as if manically toggling between the 17th and 21st centuries. A similar pattern occurs on Daylight, where lush, minor-key Romanticism collapses into polite avant garde freak outs. A jerky, minor-key composition called An Exercise in Restraint (Until You Go) – apparently a sonic representation of the “wit of the staircase” moments she experiences – starts to take on a shivery otherness, like a Renaissance chant put through an ambient filter. And the saxophonist locates new dimensions to these pieces – adding suitably ethereal textures on the baritone and curious countermelodies on the tenor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/06/isobel-waller-bridge-review-wit-and-emotion-in-abundance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Far upriver in the rainforest, the lure of rare pink river dolphins is creating jobs and promoting conservation and reconciliation after a 50-year war</p><p>“The dolphins are more playful than us,” says Diego Cifuentes, co-founder of Villa Lilia Agroecoturistico, a community dolphin-watching project on Colombia’s Lake Nare. “If you give off good energy, they may even touch you.”</p><p>Cifuentes is sitting on a boat in the middle of a lake surrounded by thick forest, a two-hour boat ride from San José del Guaviare. In the water, a dozen tourists bob in fluorescent lifejackets, waiting for the chance to meet a <em>boto</em>, the local name for the pink Amazon River dolphin (<em>Inia geoffrensis</em>). Soon enough, a plume of steam bursts from the water and the humped backs of three botos glide through the surface. The tourists giggle and squeal at the momentary encounter with the rare cetacean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/06/rainforest-colombia-farc-amazon-river-dolphins-peace-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

## The Damnation of Faust review – Berlioz’s exemplary evocations of heaven and hell

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong> <br />Edward Gardner and the London Philharmonic offered a timely reminder of Berlioz’s astonishing gifts as a choral and orchestral writer</p><p>Berlioz’s The Damnation of Faust has long been described as a work that resists classification. Berlioz eventually called it a “dramatic legend” after tinkering with the idea of “concert opera” or just simply “legend”. It was never intended to be staged, despite numerous attempts to do so, mostly unsuccessful. And though <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/edward-gardner">Edward Gardner</a> has frequently conducted it in the theatre, in this instance he gave us the work in concert with the London Philharmonic, a performance that reminded us first and foremost just how much the score is driven by Berlioz’s often astonishing choral and orchestral writing.</p><p>Gardner’s interpretation gained weight and momentum as it went, from the uneasy pastoral of the start to the metaphysical contrasts of the closing choruses in hell and heaven respectively, the ferocity of the former utterly terrifying, the latter finally achieving the timeless tranquility to which the music has previously aspired but never attained. Exemplary playing resulted in textures by turns broodingly introspective, beguilingly sensuous and eerily malign, with sinister brass and woodwind flickering like demonic fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/06/the-damnation-of-faust-review-royal-festival-hall-edward-gardner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The strategy behind this Republican battle is to fight off the federal state until they have re-established federal power themselves</p><p>Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been grabbing national headlines with his relentless attacks on so-called “woke”. In addition to his Stop-Woke (Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees) Act, which <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Committees/BillSummaries/2022/html/2809">prohibits</a> educational institutions and businesses from teaching students and employees anything that would cause anyone to “feel guilt, anguish or any form of psychological distress” due to their race, color, sex or national origin, he has barred <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/10/30/university-of-florida-prohibits-professors-from-testifying/">University of Florida professors</a> from giving evidence against the state’s voting law, claimed that <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/its-not-clear-whether-public-college-professors-have-first-amendment-rights-when-theyre-teaching">professors at public professors</a> have no right to freedom of speech, and organizing a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/ron-desantis-florida-university-new-college-woke-war">hostile takeover</a>” of the New College of Florida, one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country. But he is far from the only Republican politicians to attack the education system.</p><p>UCLA Law School’s <a href="https://crtforward.law.ucla.edu/">CRT Forward Tracking Project</a> has tracked 567 anti-Critical Race Theory (CRT) efforts introduced at the local, state, and federal levels. According to the <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/states-that-have-banned-critical-race-theory">World Population Review</a>, there are currently seven states that have banned CRT, while another 16 states are in the process of banning it. That constitutes almost all states with a Republican governor. While <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05">CRT</a> is a highly specific academic theory that is almost exclusively taught at some law schools, the anti-CRT laws are incredibly broad and vague and target all levels of education. In my state, Georgia, <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/61477">House bill 1084</a> bans the use of so-called “divisive concepts” (eg race and gender) from teaching. In a sentence that could come straight from Orwell’s 1984, the bill prohibits schools from “promoting concepts such as tolerance, mutual respect, cultural sensitivity, or cultural competency”.</p><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/06/what-is-behind-ron-desantis-stop-woke-act">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Savannah, 28, and Michael, 32, met in Barcelona in 2017 when she was a teacher and he was playing tennis. After a long-distance relationship, they married and now live in Sydney</p><p>When Savannah moved to Barcelona to teach English in 2017, meeting someone was the last thing on her mind. “It was a sort of Eat, Pray, Love experience,” she says. “I’d broken up with my ex and wanted to spend some time away. I left my job in London and went to Spain.”</p><p>As soon as she arrived, she instantly fell in love with the lifestyle. The school she taught at was near the beach and she quickly found a new group of friends. “I also used dating apps to meet new people,” she says. Soon, Michael’s profile caught her eye. He was living in Barcelona temporarily, to play tennis, while he took a break from his job as a mortgage broker in Sydney, Australia. “My profile said ‘Australian tennis player’ so I think Savannah had visions of me at Wimbledon,” he laughs. “In reality, I was paying for the opportunity to play at an academy.” Even so, they soon hit it off. “I liked the way he looked and he sent me a silly line about my favourite Skittles flavour,” says Savannah. “He’d been in London before Spain and had been staying in Islington, five minutes from where I grew up.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/06/how-we-met-he-sent-40-valentines-cards-with-all-the-different-things-he-loved-about-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This powerful Berlin prize winner mixes smartphone footage and allegorical segments to expose the trauma of the 2021 coup</p><p>The most eye-catching viral images of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/myanmar-coup-2021-explained-in-30-seconds">2021 Myanmar military coup</a> come from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/02/exercise-instructor-appears-to-unwittingly-capture-myanmar-coup-in-dance-video">a remarkable video</a> where a fitness instructor performs a spirited exercise routine while, in the background, army vehicles are en route to surround the parliament complex. The surreal contrast between an everyday task and a brutal political takeover distils what’s at stake when a military junta comes to power. The mundanity of life would soon be gone, replaced by an endless parade of state violence and oppression.</p><p>Made by a group of anonymous film-makers, Berlin prize winner Myanmar Diaries begins with this famous video, threading together civilian footage of military brutality with staged, fictionalised sequences based on real-life stories. Vertically shot on smartphones by those on the frontline, these guerrilla recordings capture a collective resistance to the stripping back of individual rights. To witness an older woman bravely berating a convoy of young soldiers for terrorising protesters, or a mother being dragged out of her home by military personnel, is gut-punching. Enfolded in a disorientating cacophony of gunshots and screams, every frame shakes with the barbarity visited on dissenting citizens, whose plight seems to have been forgotten by international media.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/myanmar-diaries-review-gut-punching-guerrilla-testament-to-military-coup-violence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A visit to the Italian lakes reveals new tips on how to make the perfect risotto …</p><p>The outline of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Lake+Maggiore&amp;ia=web&amp;iaxm=about&amp;iax=images">Lake Maggiore</a> looks like a dog: a spaniel with no front legs that’s standing on its hind ones. The head of the dog is in Switzerland. The rest – long neck, lean body, happy tail and legs – is in Italy and divided lengthways: half of the lake is in the region of Piedmont, the other in Lombardia. A friend, Francesca, lives in Colazza, a village behind the ankle in Piedmont. On the other side of Colazza, cradling it almost, is much smaller Lake Orta, which looks like a tadpole.</p><p>All this is written at my desk with a map. Dogs and tadpoles didn’t come to mind when Francesca took me to Lake Maggiore on a clear morning last December. Spread before us, it looked like a vast mirror: sublime and as if it might swallow us up. Colazza is on a hill (<em>colle</em>) , a possible reason for its name. Another hypothesis is the word<em> colare</em>, meaning to filter or drip, for the movement of countless natural springs. All this to say, there is water everywhere, and the reason thatthe “rice triangle” begins a few miles south, in an area between the provinces of Novara and Vercelli that accounts for 50% of Italian rice production.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/06/risotto-radicchio-gorgonzola-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff</strong> <br />Alice Zawadzki’s moving monodrama based on a poem by her grandmother is given depth and substance by the Manchester Collective in a perfect marriage of music and theatre<br /></p><p>A<a href="https://www.alicezmusic.com/">lice Zawadzki</a> has already established a reputation as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/26/alice-zawadzki-china-lane-album-review">jazz singer</a>, but this project with the <a href="https://manchestercollective.co.uk/">Manchester Collective</a> also engaged her talents as a violinist and composer. The concept for Bag of Bones, a monodrama in four sung scenas, stemmed from a poem by Zawadzki’s Polish grandmother, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09612025.2019.1681060?src=recsys">Irena Protassewicz</a>, written on the eve of the second world war, which Zawadzki uses to explore her own cultural roots while honouring her grandmother.</p><p>Walking slowly down the auditorium steps towards the stage, Zawadzki first appeared as an old woman, clutching the titular bag, from which she drew out bones, held tightly as though holy relics, sacred remains of a lost lover. Every utterance took on a ritualistic quality, as did her playing of a tiny violin, its neck and scroll fashioned from a humerus. The shock of it then being smashed on the ground was akin to the climax of Peter Maxwell Davies’s 8 Songs for a Mad King.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/06/manchester-collective-bag-of-bones-review-hauntingly-seductive-meditation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maria Caulfield urges Royal College of Nursing to call off action as NHS in England faces worst strike this winter</p><p>Robert Buckland has confirmed that he and Dominic Raab had “a disagreement” when they were both in cabinet, after it was reported Raab tried to get Buckland sacked as Welsh secretary last year amid a fallout over policy, my colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong> reports.</p><p>Good morning. Scotland and Wales have had devolved governments for more than 20 years, but it probably was not until Covid that people realised the extent to which, when it comes to health policy, the UK government is just an England government. Today England is seeing what is being described as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/06/nhs-strike-nurses-ambulance-england">worst day of disruption in health</a> this winter, with nurses and ambulance staff both on strike. But health workers are not on strike in Scotland, and there is only a limited ambulance strike in Wales by members of the Unite union. England is different because the Scottish and Welsh governments have made improved pay offers, but the <s>UK</s> England government is not doing the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/feb/06/nhs-strikes-nurses-ambulance-workers-government-union-pay-negotiations-conservatives-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At age 19 Mutlu Kaya overcame the trauma of attempted murder – but her story illuminates male violence in Turkey</p><p>Born and raised in Ergani, a small town in southeast Turkey, Kurdish singer Mutlu Kaya had the opportunity of a lifetime when, at the age of 19, she advanced to the final round of a popular TV talent show. Blessed with a melodic voice, Mutlu (whose name means happiness) was on the cusp of fame when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mutlu-kaya-shooting-veysi-ercan-15-years-jail">a jealous ex-boyfriend shot her in the head</a> out of jealousy over her burgeoning career. Following the aftermath of the horrific incident, Nick Read and Ayse Toprak’s inspirational yet sobering documentary confronts the shocking prevalence of femicide in Turkey.</p><p>Examining the conservative attitudes that exist in Mutlu’s local community, My Name Is Happy shows how patriarchal oppression is systematically established as the norm. Mutlu, for example, comments that, unlike other families who live in the same conservative neighbourhood, her parents love their daughters and sons equally; still, one of her sisters had to undergo an unhappy arranged marriage. Even more heartbreakingly, while Mutlu endured the disabling effects of her murder attempt, which rendered the aspiring performer unable to stand, walk or sing as before, <a href="https://bianet.org/english/print/246002-mutlu-kaya-s-silence-don-t-fear-ever">her elder sister Dilek</a> was actually killed in cold blood by her boyfriend, an army soldier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/my-name-is-happy-review-turkish-shooting-survivor-is-focus-of-femicide-study">Continue reading...</a>

But when she brings a swarm into her home, they cause havoc at a family meal – cue ladybirds in bagels and ants in her brother’s pants.</p><p>Evie braces herself for a telling off but, in a lovely twist, her fearsome great-gran gleefully flings open her fancy jacket to reveal an elaborate bug-collecting kit attached to the lining (this is one of illustrator Jenny Løvlie’s many luminous images: with her coat unfurled great-gran herself appears about to fly off). The pair set about building a minibeast zoo and, at the close of this joyous tale about following your passions, we learn that it’s inspired by the real-life entomologist Lucy Evelyn Cheesman, born 1881, who became London Zoo’s first female insect house curator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/06/picture-books-for-children-reviews">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grimsby’s owner on the sensible efforts to self-regulate – and why the outcome could benefit National League clubs</p><p>In the coming weeks, the government white paper that outlines the path to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/02/tracey-crouch-encouraged-football-regulator-introduced">independent regulatory body</a> is due to be released. With that in mind, the Premier League and the EFL have resumed negotiations on a range of topics, including but not limited to financial distribution, fixture congestion, and the potential to align the number of teams promoted and relegated from all divisions. It appears there is an effort to self-regulate before the new authority is established. It is logical and sensible for the leagues to discuss collective issues and come to agreements, rather than have their hands weakened by individual rule-making.</p><p>Regarding promotion, League Two is the obvious outlier, with four teams being promoted and two relegated for no discernible reason. I believe a revised system with three teams promoted and three relegated is worth exploring but only as part of the negotiations on the broad range of issues set out by the <a href="https://www.fairgameuk.org/">Fairgame </a>initiative, of which Grimsby are a founding member. This would have a knock-on effect of allowing three teams to be promoted from the National League, where many of the teams have the history, infrastructure, support and financial means to be in the EFL.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/06/promotion-and-relegation-changes-up-for-debate-as-premier-league-and-efl-talk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She has spent decades capturing what life is really like for Black Americans. The artist talks about Tyre Nichols – and why she wishes she could move on from this relentless subject matter</p><p>‘We are in a cycle of violence against Black bodies by the police,” says Deborah Roberts, a Texan born and bred. “As an artist, I have to speak up about it – and create images that speak to this violence.” Roberts is talking to me in the aftermath of the death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tyre-nichols">Tyre Nichols</a>, the 29-year-old father who died three days after being beaten by police officers in Memphis. Last week he was buried, surrounded by family, friends and cultural leaders.</p><p>Based in Austin, Roberts creates powerful collages of mostly Black adolescents. Splicing elements from varying sources – Michelle Obama’s hands, the eyes of James Baldwin – she uses heavily textured collages to explore “the multiplicity” of Blackness. “Do not think of people of colour as this monolithic idea,” she says, “but as individuals.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/06/black-kids-collage-legend-deborah-roberts-tyre-nichols">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wolves overrun Liverpool, Harry Kane’s record and doubts deepen in Nathan Jones</p><p>Within minutes of Everton securing a first Premier League win in almost four months a gif emerged of Sean Dyche as Superman. “My head’s been put on a few of them … usually wrestlers,” he said. “I think the period of earning respect is longer than that with the fans but it is nice to get off to a good start. They were terrific from the off.” As were Everton’s players as they pressed Arsenal into submission at a pulsating Goodison Park. Everton covered more distance in Dyche’s first game than in any match under Frank Lampard this season, with Amadou Onana and the recalled duo of Abdoulaye Doucouré and Dwight McNeil to the fore. The effect was striking, although it shouldn’t take a superhero to extract the basics from a relegation-threatened team. “I doubt many of the players I’ve worked with would say I am hardline,” added Dyche. “They would say hard professional standards and high demand. That doesn’t mean you are a tyrant.” <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/04/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Everton 1-0 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/04/wolves-quick-out-of-the-blocks-to-deepen-gloom-for-woeful-liverpool">Wolves 3-0 Liverpool</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/06/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Carl Olsson’s discreet documentary is an unfailingly human look at the funeral industry and those who work continually surrounded by mortality</p><p>This discreet yet gently ironic Swedish documentary encourages us to look at the bright side of death; that is, the attentive preparations for those passing, and the miraculous persistence of earthly matters around them. It’s shot in what you might call the European objective style, reminiscent of Ulrich Seidl and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/earth-review-an-eco-documentary-with-eerie-and-scalp-tingling-landscapes-berlin-film-festival">Nikolaus Geyrhalter</a>: largely static, square-on tableaux of activity in morgues, crematoriums, cemeteries, hearses and the like. But they’re filled with small talk that attests to the unstoppable flow of life, even in these most sombre of places.</p><p>The dead are conspicuous by their absence; shrouded in the back of a hearse or occasionally glimpsed hands as a mortician works on them. But a whole army from the funeral industry are at their disposal: embalmers, grave and urn diggers, chapel staff, musicians. Not quite on the threshold yet is Saga, a hunched pensioner we see on a tea date with a friend, or the bingo players waiting for their number to be up – literally and otherwise. Director Carl Olsson lets such existential wryness percolate, but unfailingly adorns it with humane touches, like the little bows the drivers and the undertakers give their charges.</p><p>Meanwhile on Earth is available on True Story on 13 February.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/meanwhile-on-earth-review-interesting-sympathetic-study-of-the-business-of-death">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new inquiry into the 1998 massacre may help the bereaved. But Rishi Sunak’s government wants to be rid of the legal mechanism that allowed it </p><p>It is hard to imagine anything worse than the Real IRA’s bombing of the market town of Omagh on 15 August 1998. It was the deadliest single atrocity of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The 29 people who were slaughtered that day included toddlers, primary school kids, teenage girls volunteering in the Oxfam shop and a young woman who was pregnant with twins.</p><p>Yet for those left behind, and for the 220 people injured that day, there was in fact one thing worse: the tormenting thought that it could all have been prevented. The bereaved and the survivors have had to live with the haunting possibility that the police and the intelligence services could have saved them from this unspeakable calamity. Only now, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/omagh-bombing-independent-inquiry-northern-ireland">announcement</a> by the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, of an independent inquiry into what the security services knew in advance of the attack, can they hope to lay those ghosts to rest.</p><p>Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our lack of Covid reckoning suggests history is repeating itself</p><p>My best friend has been ill and it’s taken both of us back to March 2020. For her, it’s reawakening the real trauma of getting very poorly and waiting, struggling to breathe, for an ambulance that never came.

My friend, who suffers badly from long Covid, struggles to understand the refusal of many people to think or talk about the pandemic; their reluctance to understand what it has taken from her and from so many others. She’s baffled by the apparent desire to pretend it never happened, or that it wasn’t a big deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/06/covid-was-devastating-why-are-we-pretending-it-didnt-happen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While Philip Pullman and Adam Gopnik illuminate Art Spiegelman’s towering graphic novel, few others in this collection succeed in capturing its spark and sophistication</p><p>This job has taught me to be wary of meeting my heroes, but when I interviewed Art Spiegelman in New York in 2011, it really was one of the great days. In his SoHo studio, the air thick with cigarette smoke and whatever strange substance old paper quietly emits (the place groaned with books), he and I talked long and hard about <em>Maus</em>, then shortly to celebrate its 25th birthday, and every moment was – for me, at least – completely thrilling. I’d long wondered about Spiegelman’s daring in the matter of his famous comic. How on earth had he done it, committing to paper what felt at the time like a kind of blasphemy? But sitting opposite him, I think I understood. In conversation, certainty had only to appear on the horizon for ambivalence to wrestle it to the ground – and vice versa. He simply <em>had</em> to work stuff out. I doubt he could have resisted making <em>Maus</em> even if he’d tried.</p><p>I guess there must still be some people out there who don’t know about Spiegelman’s masterwork. So perhaps I’d better explain. The only comic ever to win a Pulitzer prize, <em>Maus</em> is a two-volume graphic novel about the Holocaust. Based on interviews with his father, Vladek, a survivor of Auschwitz, it depicts Jews as mice, Nazis as cats and Poles as pigs, though the source of the shock it caused when it came out (<em>Maus I</em> in 1986, and <em>Maus II</em> in 1991) lay more in its refusal to sanctify the survivor than in its anthropomorphism. The Vladek we see living in Queens with his second wife, Mala – the book has two time frames, past and present – is a parsimonious bully and a racist, a man his adult son can tolerate only when they’re discussing the camps. As Spiegelman put it when he spoke to me: “This is the oddness of it. Auschwitz became for us a safe place: a place where he would talk and I would listen.” (Vladek died in 1982; Spiegelman’s mother, Anja, another survivor, had killed herself in 1968.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/06/maus-now-selected-writing-edited-by-hillary-chute-art-spiegelman-review-the-maus-that-made-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A shoreline-hugging bus route from Penzance and a cross-country one to St Ives come into their own in this exploration of the county’s historic, cultural and natural riches</p><p>The fields ahead are yellow with daffodils and a soft ocean breeze smells of seaweed and smoked fish. I’m on an open-topped bus above Newlyn harbour near Penzance, where I arrived by train this morning. Through window of that train, I passed a frozen wonderland of icy floods and frosty trees, but west Cornwall feels like another country: lush ferns, palm trees and bright pink camellias flourish in coastal gardens. There are ancient crosses where green lanes meet, and Cornwall’s tallest still-standing stones, the <a href="https://cornishancientsites.com/ancient-sites/the-pipers-standing-stones/#:~:text=The%20NE%20Piper%20is%20Cornwall%27s,m%20(131%E2%81%842ft).">Pipers</a>, cast afternoon shadows like a giant sundial. Just beyond them, there’s a perfect top-deck view of the <a href="https://www.cornwalls.co.uk/history/sites/merry_maidens.htm">Merry Maidens</a> stone circle. It may seem counterintuitive to explore by bus in a county known for twisty lanes and summer traffic jams, but it proves reliable and cheap as well ass sustainable.</p><p>One of many remarkable things about this spectacular three-hour journey on the <a href="https://www.firstbus.co.uk/adventures-bus/services/lands-end-coaster">Land’s End Coaster</a>, which runs round the tip of Cornwall to St Ives and then cross-country back to Penzance, is that it costs just £2. The bus is part of an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jan/05/england-best-scenic-and-discounted-bus-rides-cheap-tickets">ongoing scheme</a> across England, capping many single fares until 31 March. Even when the scheme ends, a <a href="https://www.transportforcornwall.co.uk/#tickets">day ticket in Cornwall</a> will be just £5 for unlimited travel across the county on buses run by any company. The circular Land’s End Coaster route helps cut down on traffic at honeypot sites and – as a year-round service – it’s useful for local transport. Several people get on and off with shopping bags, and three walkers with dogs climb on board at the saffron-walled <a href="http://www.gurnardshead.co.uk/">Gurnard’s Head Inn</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/06/a-car-free-break-in-west-cornwall-penzance-st-ives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country’s transformation into one of the world’s biggest pork producers is helping to accelerate rural depopulation, claim opponents of the industry</p><p>• Photographs by Pablo Blázquez for the Guardian</p><p>The village school shut down more than four decades ago. The two-storey stone hotel closed its doors in 2008.

The buildings are home to 3,900 sows, who produce approximately 100,000 piglets a year. “We’re at more than 800 pigs for every resident,” says Pérez García.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/06/pigs-spain-pork-revolution-backlash">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For 84 years, the Harvard Study of Adult Development has tracked the lives of hundreds of Americans. Now its director, Robert Waldinger, is explaining what it has taught him about health and fulfilment</p><p>In the 1980s, when data from the world’s longest-running study on happiness started to show that good relationships kept us healthier and happier, the researchers didn’t really believe it. “We know there’s a mind-body connection and we all pay lip service to it,” says Dr Robert Waldinger, the director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which has been running for 84 years. “But how could warmer relationships make it less likely that you would develop coronary artery disease or arthritis? How could relationships get into the body and affect our physiology?” Then, other studies started to show the same. “We thought: OK, we can begin to have confidence in this finding.”</p><p>It was still a surprise, says Waldinger, but so convinced is he of this fundamental truth that the new book he has co-written with Dr Marc Schulz, The Good Life, focuses mainly on relationships and how to improve them. There are other components, of course, and they tend to be similar across countries, cultures and social grades (he points to the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/">UN’s annual World Happiness report</a>). These include good health and a healthy life expectancy, plus the freedom and capacity to make significant life decisions. Trust is important, he says – not just in friends and neighbours, but also in governments. “One interesting thing that people mention around the world is generosity and opportunities to be generous,” says Waldinger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/06/how-to-have-a-happy-life-according-to-the-worlds-leading-expert">Continue reading...</a>
