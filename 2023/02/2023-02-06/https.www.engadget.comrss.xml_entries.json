Gartner and IDC both estimate that Dell's shipments plunged 16 percent in 2022 compared to the year before, and 37 percent in the last quarter.

Yet, there was something about its crunchy lofi character that I couldn\u2019t shake. So when Bastl Instruments launched the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJmZWN0Y2lyY3VpdC5jb20vYmFzdGwtbWljcm9ncmFubnktbW9ub2xpdGguaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODE2ZDc0OWEtNWQ3OC00ZDIwLTlhMTItNDk3MTMxM2M0ZjUzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcUtJDoDY0MH2tFgx-Xod5ldBKRL7ydKBsGOQtFMYt5Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.perfectcircuit.com%2Fbastl-microgranny-monolith.html\">$246</a><a href=\"https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/microgranny-monolith\">Microgranny Monolith</a>, I decided I should give it another shot.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img alt=\"Rear view of ports on Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46bda440-a3f2-11ed-b3fa-93eee15c11f5\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Monolith is the Microgranny in its \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/tDSY2bQHvNI\">final form</a>.\u201d Though, ultimately, it\u2019s not terribly different from the Microgranny 2 that I slightly regret parting ways with. It\u2019s a 5.5 x 3 x 1.8 inch monophonic <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html\">sampler</a> powered by a 9v battery (or 9v guitar pedal power cord). It has a built-in microphone for capturing the world around you in glorious 22,050Hz, 8-bit fidelity, as well as a line in and a microSD card preloaded with samples. There\u2019s also a full-size MIDI in and audio out jack on the back.</p><p>The controls are pretty easy to figure out, though there is a slight learning curve to things like the recording and instant loop features. On the front are the six \u201cbig buttons\u201d for playing back your samples, each of which also has a shift function. There\u2019s also six smaller buttons and six knobs for controlling various parameters. All of this is in the exact same layout, with the exact same labeling as the Microgranny 2.</p><p>Physically, the only notable differences are in build quality. The Monolith is made out of dense PCB material instead of acrylic. And the knobs and buttons are all much more satisfying than the usable, but kind of toy-like ones found on the Microgranny 2. The text is also easier to read thanks to the brighter font and dark case. All-in-all, it\u2019s a substantial physical upgrade.</p><section><img alt=\"Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith splayed open to change the battery.\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/470b7620-a3f2-11ed-bfef-eec2b04be2b5\" /></section><p>The one thing that hasn\u2019t changed, that I really wish would have, is how you put batteries in the Microgranny. Bastl is a small company that makes instruments for weirdos, so I try to cut it some slack. But replacing the batteries on this thing is aggravating<em>. </em>You have to unscrew the bottom plate and take it off, which inevitably causes the sides of the instrument to also come off. Then, when you\u2019re done shoving a 9v battery in there, you have to carefully realign all the pieces and hope everything stays in place while you screw it back together.</p><p>Fighting with the battery is really only an issue if you want to take the Microgranny out of the house with you. Otherwise you can use a standard 9V AC adapter, like the one most guitar pedals use. Thankfully, I happen to have plenty of those laying around. Obviously, this somewhat negates the portability factor, but as I\u2019ll get to in a bit, that turned out to be less of a lure to me than expected. It\u2019s also worth noting that the output is a little noisy when turned all the way up, so definitely stop at about 75 percent if you\u2019re not into low constant whines.</p><h2>Granular</h2><figure><img alt=\"Sample rate and grain size control on the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46dfd240-a3f2-11ed-ad7b-33adc138ee50\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>What sets the Microgranny apart in a sea of portable and affordable music gear is that it\u2019s a granular sampler. Now, Bastl is careful not to use the words \u201cgranular synthesizer\u201d in most of its marketing materials. And that\u2019s smart. Because if you\u2019re coming here expecting the lush, alien and often ambient soundscapes usually associated with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arturia-efx-fragments-granular-vst-effect-193053457.html\">granular</a> synthesis you will be sorely disappointed.</p><p>For one, as mentioned earlier, the Microgranny is monophonic. That means you can\u2019t play chords on it unless you\u2019re sampling one. And two, the sound engine can only playback a single \u201cgrain\u201d at a time. On something like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-lemondrop-and-fireball-nanobox-synthesizer-review-130035502.html\">1010music Lemondrop</a>, for instance, you can get up to 16 bits of an audio file running simultaneously, creating complex and often unpredictable textures from the source material. The Microgranny, well, is more like a playable CD skip. But once you embrace that unabashed lofi nature, that\u2019s when you can really connect with it.</p><div id=\"9fa3849a3bcd4a9abb5954e4b5350a7f\"><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;\"><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MTZkNzQ5YS01ZDc4LTRkMjAtOWExMi00OTcxMzEzYzRmNTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbaTBAERgY4dLvLLK-4mX0gThLYP091HjUOMZRKF8Wja&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Engadget\">Engadget</a> \u00b7 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0L3NldHMvYmFzdGwtaW5zdHJ1bWVudHMtbWljcm9ncmFubnktbW9ub2xpdGgtc291bmQtc2FtcGxlcy9zLVZPNlJOYUFsdlE2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MTZkNzQ5YS01ZDc4LTRkMjAtOWExMi00OTcxMzEzYzRmNTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcVVDYzX16JJZ-qPV6PtT2Ep6XGf92yl1n-zaUWwXxYc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast%2Fsets%2Fbastl-instruments-microgranny-monolith-sound-samples%2Fs-VO6RNaAlvQ6\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith sound samples\">Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith sound samples</a></div></div><p>Using the controls on the front, you can change the size of the grains, but you\u2019ll never get smooth single cycle waveforms even at the smallest end. Instead the sound is broken and glitchy, like a corrupted MP3 you downloaded from Kazaa in 2002. You can control the speed and direction the playhead travels through your sample using the shift speed knob. It\u2019s almost like very rudimentary time stretching. It doesn\u2019t change the pitch of the sample you're playing back, but it can drag it out in an unnatural and artifact-riddled way.</p><p>Then there is sample rate, which changes both the pitch and speed of a sound, similar to an old school sampler. And crush \u2013 an absolutely unforgiving bit-crusher \u2014 that takes the already crusty character of the Microgranny to full meltdown even at lower settings. When cranked, crush turns any sample into what can only be described as an Atari 2600 trying to approximate the thunderous approach of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.</p><figure><img alt=\"The RNDMZR button on the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46e68900-a3f2-11ed-bffa-ebef01a28b39\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are also knobs for controlling the start and end points of a sample, as well as the attack and release. They\u2019re basic things that you\u2019ll need, but don\u2019t impart much character. The other important controls are all shift functions found under the big buttons. Hold down FN and press those to turn on legato, set a sample to repeat, sync grain playback to a MIDI clock signal and randomly shift the playback head.</p><p>Then there are two other options \u2013 RNDMZR \u2013 which does what you\u2019d expect: randomize all the parameters for the last played sample. This is the quickest way to complete aural chaos. And \u201ctuned,\u201d which has two different effects. For one it locks the sample rate options to semitones, instead of smooth pitch shifting. And two, when you connect a MIDI keyboard it will transpose the sample for melodic playback. When this is inactive, a keyboard will play back individual grains instead. The latter sounds great in theory, but I\u2019ve honestly had a hard time finding a practical use for it.</p><h2>In use</h2><figure><img alt=\"Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/46f7c710-a3f2-11ed-9fdb-8efeed0da241\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><p>Initially I was excited about the idea of the Microgranny as a go-everywhere, granular noise maker. Obviously everyone\u2019s tastes and use cases are different, but I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s just not ideal for me in that role. For one, the limitations of the monophonic granular engine mean that it\u2019s kind of hard to create something full and musical by simply snatching samples around me.</p><p>There\u2019s no sequencer, so I can\u2019t save a fun found-sound drum pattern for later use back in my home studio. I have to remember what I played and rely on my admittedly lackluster sense of rhythm. And the microphone just isn\u2019t particularly sensitive. Even with the input cranked the source needs to be very loud. I turned my phone up all the way, placed the speaker less than half an inch away from the mic, and it was still pretty quiet. Your better bet is using the input jack directly connected to another audio source, like a synth or external mic.</p><div id=\"139dc832664645169452a6307a149548\"></div><p>While the granular engine is definitely fun for getting glitchy stuttering sounds, I find it\u2019s best deployed in moderation. Treating the Microgranny as a more traditional (if exceptionally lofi) sampler, though, delivers extremely satisfying results. Since there\u2019s no way to play a sample chromatically in real time on the device itself, that does mean you\u2019d need to sample individual notes or chords to create something melodic without the aid of a MIDI keyboard. Or, you could take one sample, copy and paste it across the six big buttons and adjust the sample rate of each to create a scale.</p><p>This isn\u2019t to say that the Microgranny isn\u2019t a fun or melodic instrument. It\u2019s just that it feels more useful in the studio than out. I love it for creating rhythmic loops that I can import into my DAW or processing samples to get a nice <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arturia-sq-80-v-ensoniq-virtual-synth-hands-on-superbooth-160036483.html\">digital patina</a> on them. And with a MIDI keyboard attached you can get that crispy pitched sound that makes the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e8c90726-6d93-44f8-97b0-21ecdf65b81e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Reverb&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlOGM5MDcyNi02ZDkzLTQ0ZjgtOTdiMC0yMWVjZGY2NWI4MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXZlcmIuY29tL3AvY2FzaW8tc2stMS0zMi1rZXktc2FtcGxpbmcta2V5Ym9hcmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgxNmQ3NDlhLTVkNzgtNGQyMC05YTEyLTQ5NzEzMTNjNGY1MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUdZT8YSvgdBe8fQ4n1P5V7cXFX-Hd0GUIFBXNj0lOGd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Freverb.com%2Fp%2Fcasio-sk-1-32-key-sampling-keyboard\">Casio SK</a> series of keyboards so sought after (and insanely expensive) even 28 years later.</p><p>It\u2019s not the easiest thing to do, but you can even chop up samples on the Microgranny by copying and pasting the same sound across multiple buttons and changing the starting point. It can be a little fiddly since you\u2019re dealing with a really basic seven-segment LED display. But it can be done. This was honestly some of the most fun I had jamming with the Microgranny on its own. Load up some disco or house tracks and you can easily flip them into some lofi Daft Punk-type beats. Max out that crush knob and well, you\u2019ve just created the ideal soundtrack for a rave at the end of the world.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"Large MG branding on the underside of the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/47000470-a3f2-11ed-bdfb-40dfe37ffc88\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>I think I probably gave up on the Microgranny too quickly the first time, since I was too focused on the mobile and granular aspects. When I couldn\u2019t create otherworldly clouds of atmospherics or sketch out a song with multiple tracks, I went straight back to my PO-33 without digging any deeper. I failed to truly explore its potential as a more studio-bound instrument.</p><p>At $246 it\u2019s not expensive, but it\u2019s costly and quirky enough that it will only appeal to a particular niche that wants the most authentic lofi sampling they can get. Obviously you can change the sample and bit rate of a file on your computer. But \u2013 and this is my opinion \u2013 the Microgranny just imparts more character. And it\u2019s the sort of character that\u2019s hard to get without springing for a vintage sampler that might not be in perfect working order. So, if your preferred flavor of lofi grit is more cheap 80s digital than aging tape deck, the Bastl Instruments Microgranny Monolith is definitely worth checking out.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sonys-wh-1000xm5-anc-headphones-are-348-right-now-131512394.html?src=rss", "title": "Sony's WH-1000XM5 ANC headphones are $348 right now", "date_published": "2023-02-06 13:15:12+00:00", "description": "<p>Sony's latest WH-1000XM5 wireless ANC headphones are among the best we've ever tested, thanks to improved sound quality, a comfortable fit and incredible active noise cancellation (ANC).

I\u2019ve been thinking about this moment for more than a year, ever since the backlash against the game started gaining traction online. The author of the Harry Potter novels is transphobic and she\u2019s targeted transgender women in particular. For this reason, some people in the LGBT+ community, and allies beyond, have decided to boycott <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>and admonish anyone who chooses to play or stream it themselves, sparking explosive arguments across social media, Twitch and YouTube. Those in favor of the boycott argue that playing the game benefits the author financially and indicates support for her beliefs. On the flipside, potential players point out that the author wasn\u2019t involved in the creation of <em>Hogwarts Legac</em>y and her status as the world\u2019s richest author won\u2019t change regardless of the game\u2019s success. Also, they really want to play it.</p><p>I fall into the second category. I\u2019m currently about 15 hours into <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and I\u2019m just barely scratching the surface; I\u2019m having an incredible time. This feels like the RPG that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for, rich and alive and absolutely packed with magic.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It\u2019s slightly frightening to write that down, knowing the condemnation I could receive. It\u2019s an extra-light version of the dread I felt while publishing literally anything during Gamergate, but this time it\u2019s more personal: The hate would be coming from people I actually care about.</p><p>I\u2019ve been a video game journalist for the past 13 years, I\u2019m a bisexual woman and I have a big ol\u2019 Harry Potter tattoo next to an anti-TERF tattoo. I feel uniquely positioned to care about this particular topic, and to that end, I have a quick story to tell. It involves literary internet culture in the early 2000s, and I hope it illuminates factors that entwine the Wizarding World with the LGBT+ community, while demonstrating the vast divide that\u2019s existed for decades between the fantasy and its creator.</p><p>As a pre-teen and throughout high school, I found solace in Harry Potter fanfiction, a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-11-tumblr-fanfiction-fandom-purge-2018.html\"><ins>bustling online ecosystem</ins></a> powered by Livejournal, FF.net, AO3 and other community-run sites. I cannot overstate how popular Harry Potter fanfiction was and still is, nor how queer it\u2019s always been. Most stories in Harry Potter fanfiction center on LGBT+ characters, and for good reason \u2013 in the early aughts, media for and by gay people was ridiculously hard to come by, and then when you did find something, it was often campy, trashy, or both. It was a pre-streaming, pre-YouTube, pre-TikTok way of life. So we wrote our own stories as fanfiction. Long before the release of the final Harry Potter book, we infused the halls of Hogwarts with magically amplified, non-heterosexual and non-cisgender characters, and we wrote millions of words about them living full, fantastic lives. We made Dumbledore gay long before the canon did.</p><p>In those early days, an important part of the Harry Potter fanfiction process was critiquing the world and recognizing the limits of the author\u2019s imagination. With each new book release, the forums would light up with praise and criticism, and our own stories would continue to evolve outside of the pages of the novels. These fics are more real to me than the source material; when I traverse the hallways of the Slytherin dungeons in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, my mind accesses memories from my favorite fanfics \u2013 not the books \u2013 and I\u2019m infused with warmth. The halls of Hogwarts are my safe space, still.</p><p>I recognize my circumstances are incredibly specific, but I also know mine isn\u2019t a unique experience. Fantasy worlds offer an escape for queer and non-queer people alike, and coming-of-age fiction can be powerful, formulative stuff. This particular fantasy universe was a place of belonging for me, and I think its latest iteration, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, could offer a similar slice of peace to young players today.</p><p>I understand the anger and protective energy from people who don\u2019t want to play the game. It\u2019s a terrifying time to be transgender: Ultra-conservative lawmakers are writing discrimination and blind hate into law, while neo-nazi rhetoric has found new life on mainstream social media platforms. Deadly violence against trans people, particularly Black transgender women, remains <a href=\"https://reports.hrc.org/an-epidemic-of-violence-2022\"><ins>a pervasive epidemic</ins></a> in the United States. Among these real-world threats, we\u2019re clashing over the virtues of playing or not playing <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. It\u2019s been depressing to observe as this conversation sows division and sucks attention away from our shared goals, limiting our ability to celebrate new successes.</p><p>Harry Potter will outlive its author. She is not the future of the franchise. Avalanche, Portkey Games and Warner Bros. have been well aware of the pervasive disgust for the author\u2019s ideology for years, and I believe it encouraged them to include more representation in the game than the series has ever seen. <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>allows for various expressions of gender identity in the character creator and casually drops \u201cthey\u201d pronouns in conversation; all around, the cast is diverse and Avalanche writes non-white characters better than the original author did. There\u2019s still room for improvement, and that\u2019s why the conversation needs to be ongoing: Positive progress is our shared goal.</p><p>As someone who searched desperately for an example of my own identity in the pages of Harry Potter novels, I deeply appreciate the evolution and inclusion in <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. This level of representation didn\u2019t exist in AAA games 15 years ago, and it\u2019s the result of all the progress made, through protest and education, since the books were published. Long before the in-fighting over a choice to play a video game.</p><p>If you don\u2019t want to engage with <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, please, boycott the game \u2013 just don\u2019t boycott the players. It\u2019s us<em>&nbsp;</em>against the transphobic people in the world, not us against each other. Some of us will choose to play, some of us won\u2019t. Even more will wonder why anyone even cares about this fictional kid and his heteronormative, whitewashed, multibillion-dollar franchise. These are all valid options. Playing <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>doesn\u2019t automatically make you transphobic. Boycotting it doesn\u2019t automatically make you an ally \u2013 supporting our community members does.</p><p>We\u2019ll have a full review of <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>later in the week, once I\u2019ve had enough time with this enormous game to fully form an opinion on it. Even if I catch hell for this perspective, I\u2019ll be here, supporting local inclusion efforts, protesting discrimination, calling my lawmakers, loving my community and playing the gayest version of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> possible.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/anker-charging-accessories-are-up-to-46-percent-off-in-amazon-sale-101840741.html?src=rss", "title": "Anker charging accessories are up to 46 percent off in Amazon sale", "date_published": "2023-02-06 10:18:40+00:00", "description": "<p>Anker's charging accessories can be even more versatile than what the original manufacturer offers, but they tend to be more costly than other options.
