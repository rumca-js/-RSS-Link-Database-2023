<p>A new poster for the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie has been revealed, and it follows a pretty traditional format. We see main characters like Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Peach, Toad, and Bowser front and center, with the image divided between good and evil color schemes and motifs.</p><p>As with many Mario games and media, the film will see Mario--voiced by Chris Pratt--embarking on a journey to defeat Bowser, or at least stop him until he can return again. It's a pretty slick-looking poster and does the job of helping drum up excitement for the long-awaited movie.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The countdown is officially on. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperMarioMovie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#SuperMarioMovie</a> <a href="https://t.co/OWHWL7CL2j">pic.twitter.com/OWHWL7CL2j</a></p>  — The Super Mario Bros.

<p>The next Destiny 2 raid will go live shortly after the launch of the game's next expansion, Lightfall. Bungie has announced that the Lightfall raid will go live on March 10, giving players enough time to familiarize themselves with all of the expansion's gameplay changes and the Strand subclass. As usual, there'll be a race to see which Destiny 2 fireteam can score bragging rights--and possibly some incredible real-world loot if previous raids are any indicator--for the title of World's First. Here's what you need to know about the raid, including when it starts.</p><p>According to Bungie, the Lightfall raid will kick off at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on Friday, March 10. One big change to the World's First race is an extension of Contest Mode, as it'll be extended by an extra day. <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1621594301531828225">Bungie says</a> that this is being done so that teams pursuing the emblem can take more breaks, as well as allow anyone who has commitments on Friday to still have time to participate.</p><p>Bungie is keeping details on the raid under tight wraps for now, but it did release an ominous description of the activity that hints at possible Vex involvement. "Ferried from an unknown time and place, a haunting presence has been detected. We must now confront the ancient threat growing at our doorstep."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-raid-start-time/1100-6511185/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Move over, The Last of Us. Saturday Night Live thinks HBO should tackle another video game property for prestige TV: Mario Kart. And who better to lead this spoof series than Joel actor Pedro Pascal?</p><p dir="ltr">SNL has released the HBO Mario Kart trailer on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiIRlg4Xr5w">YouTube</a>, which parodies the grittiness of The Last of Us and pairs it with Rainbow Road. Pascal--who hosted the NBC show over the weekend--portrays Mario. He's tasked with smuggling Princess Peach this time, and the two come across some familiar Mushroom Kingdom favorites.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Their first stop in the trailer pays homage to Luigi's Mansion, where Mario's brother is found. Luigi also gives the audience the breakdown on the new scary Goombas.
