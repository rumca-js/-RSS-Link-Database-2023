A bygone era where women would hold what was called a "Women's March" and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/smell-like-feminist-new-pussy-hat-perfume" target="_self">wear crocheted vaginas on their heads</a> until they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/womens-march-co-chair-calls-starbucks-racist-for-working-with-the-adl">got canceled</a> because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/womens-march-cancelled-white" target="_self">there were too many white people involved</a>. Now, not only are certain women being told they aren't allowed to speak, they are being protested...by furries.</p><p>Not just any Furries either. Furries Against Fascism.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">'Furries‚Äô sound cuddly but Wings Over Scotland‚Äôs Feb 1st blog shows what they really are.

These Furries Against Fascism were speaking out against the "Let Women Speak Rally" in Scotland.</p><p>You may be saying right now, "But Brodigan, shouldn't women be allowed to speak?" It appears not all of them. If you are a "TERF," that's a Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist, and the words you are saying are challenging the Democrat party's preferred radical gender ideology, you are NOT allowed to speak. Because you're transphobic. And while trans is the pound-for-pound #1 most marginalized on the left's rankings, women have fallen out of the top ten. At least, white women have.</p><p>So if you are one of these TERFs and attempt to talk about "rights" or "not being locked in a jail with someone who has a penis," you run the risk of someone dressing up as an animal and yelling at you.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">First furry spotted, someone is testing a loudspeaker in the background.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetWomenSpeak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LetWomenSpeak</a> <a href="https://t.co/81geXk8ngr">pic.twitter.com/81geXk8ngr</a><br />‚Äî R√≥is√≠n Michaux (@RoisinMichaux) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoisinMichaux/status/1622196035312402432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'm surprised this is the first time someone came up with "no TERFs on our turf." Imaginary, make-believe baby words notwithstanding... it does have a certain panache to it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">‚ÄúNo TERFs in our turf!‚Äù<br />Radical trans activists gathered to protest women‚Äôs rights campaigners in George Square, Glasgow.

In Scotland, being a woman who thinks boys and boys and girls and girls makes you less desirable than someone who dresses up as furry woodland creatures. It's 2023 and that's where we are as a society.</p><p><p>

Beating out such luminaries as Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, and former friend Patton Oswalt <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-oswalt-chappelle" target="_blank">who threw Chappelle under the bus</a>.</p><p>Yes, "The Closer" is THAT special...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a4a72" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32983555&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Dave Chappelle released "The Closer" on Netflix in 2021. Critics claimed without evidence <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/unfunny-hannah-gadsby-dave-chappelle" target="_blank">that the special was "transphobic."</a> Though, to be fair, critics have been claiming without evidence <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sjws-try-to-cancel-dave-chappelle" target="_blank">that Chappelle was transphobic since at least 2019</a>. Those critics succeeded in canceling the release of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-addresses-netflix-controversy" target="_blank">Chappelle's documentary on the George Floyd riots</a>, since "trans" outranks "black" on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings. But that was it.</p><p>They attempted to protest Netflix, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/netflix-employee-warning" target="_blank">and failed</a>. They protested <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-high-school" target="_blank">Chappelle's high school</a>. Comedy writers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl-boycott" target="_blank">protested writing comedy for Chappelle</a> (think about that one). And they protested Chappelle's performance at Prince's club, even as Chappelle's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-supporters" target="_blank">diverse group of fans attempted to show the haters love</a>. Chappelle keeps winning.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e2dfd" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32983611&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Last night's win marks Dave Chappelle's fourth Grammy for a comedy special. "The Closer" was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special, but he lost to Adele.</p><p>If anything Chappelle's wins prove what many of us assume. Grammy voters may be the wokest among us and love signaling their virtue as brightly as they can. But from the privacy of their own ballot, when no one is looking, they admit Chappelle a) is funny and  b) has a point.</p><p>Dave Chappelle celebrated his Grammy win by being Dave Chappelle. If he is like me, he didn't even know the awards were on last night.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Massive brawl erupts at Chinese restaurant and there is a lot to unpack

I don't know where this is. A Chinese restaurant somewhere on the planet. Where things were said, one thing led to another, and a bowl of hot water was thrown at someone. Never before have so few f*cks been squeezed into such a short clip.</p><p>The only context is that the video is at least two years, but it's going viral now with over 1.5 million views over the course of twenty-four hours. Twitter 2.0 seems to favor fight videos lately in the algorithm. On behalf of those of us who hustle content for a living, thank you Uncle Elon.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/cEs1XzQHHy">pic.twitter.com/cEs1XzQHHy</a><br />‚Äî Clown World ‚Ñ¢ ü§° (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1622425582171742209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Shout out to my man recording the video with nerves of steel. The camera wasn't shaky. He sat there, pressed play, and let the chaos unfold around him. If Martin Scorsese directed a viral video, this would be it. There is A LOT going on in the frame of this short sixteen-second video.</p><p>Like this poor woman who tried to stop a guy from stabbing another guy before giving up and getting the hell out of there.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e0d64" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32983443&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>There was a chair shot. Because...well, there should always be a chair shot.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="81009" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32983446&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>But the star of this video is this guy. Everyone in the restaurant was grabbing whatever they could as they brawled out. This dude grabbed a hot pot and threw it hoping to hit anyone. At this point in the brawl, it didn't matter. Everyman for himself.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="153ed" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32983449&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>I don't know how you say "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-tampa-viral" target="_blank">Waffle House</a>" in Mandarin, but after seeing this video the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-chair" target="_blank">Waffle Houses</a> in America need to step up their game. This video makes Waffle House brawls look like two kids having a slap fight in a playground. </p><p>The one lingering question is what set it off. If the video took place in 2021, there is a chance someone coughed and said they lost their sense of smell. And everyone else fought their way out of the restaurant before the government sealed the place off. </p><p><p>
