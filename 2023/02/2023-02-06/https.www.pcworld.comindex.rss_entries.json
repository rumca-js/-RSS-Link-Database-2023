Student and designer Owen Yin <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/3/23584675/microsoft-ai-bing-chatgpt-screenshots-leak&amp;xcust=2-1-1503274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">tipped off</a> The Verge and published his own findings on Medium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s new Bing will be located at Bing.com/new or at least the waitlist will, Yin wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, the Bing chatbot uses the same AI, corroborating the rumor to some extent. (Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t confirmed either as genuine.) In January, though, a report from The Information suggested that an AI-powered Bing could be <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446692/report-microsoft-is-making-bing-its-next-ai-app.html\">released as early as March</a>, with ChatGPT or a related technology powering Office, too. This was shortly before Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481398/chatgpt-may-charge-42-mo-for-a-paid-tier-as-microsoft-invests-again.html\">invested an undisclosed amount of money into OpenAI</a>, though reportedly the figure totals $10 billion over a ten-year period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the new AI-powered Bing appears to show its work a bit when parsing a query. In one example shared by user &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Nazmul60863192&amp;xcust=2-1-1503274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nazmul Hossain</a>,&rdquo; Bing broke down the query,&rdquo; Is Microsoft Bing opened the chat feature worldwide?&rdquo; into its component nouns, then strung together a response based upon what it drew some several sources, including Linkedin, MSN, and Techspot, among others. The response cited the sites providing the answers, and apparently linked to a response. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">This morning I was experiencing the CHAT feature of Microsoft Bing search and then a few moments later disappeared it. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/kSA7RMPmLy&amp;xcust=2-1-1503274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/kSA7RMPmLy</a></p>&mdash; Nazmul hossain (@Nazmul60863192) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Nazmul60863192/status/1621383142174248960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1503274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, that same behavior was not demonstrated on Owen Yin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://medium.com/@owenyin/scoop-oh-the-things-youll-do-with-bing-s-chatgpt-62b42d8d7198&amp;xcust=2-1-1503274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">post</a>.  Both Hossain and Yin posted the same screenshot of the &ldquo;new Bing,&rdquo; however, with an option to either field a chat as a traditional search or as a chatbot response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key difference between ChatGPT and Microsoft&rsquo;s new Bing, it appears, is that ChatGPT&rsquo;s &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; ends in 2021. Bing&rsquo;s knowledge will be current, Yin claimed, allowing it to answer contemporary questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the company plans to lead the &ldquo;age of AI&rdquo; and deploy its models &ldquo;across our consumer and enterprise products.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Microsoft&rsquo;s investment into OpenAI, the claims by Nadella, and the published leaks, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to push AI as a search tool in the near future.</p>\n\nProfessional Software</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502500/three-new-products-making-it-even-easier-to-build-a-pc.html", "title": "PCs reimagined: 3 radical new products that make building PCs dead simple", "date_published": "2023-02-06 11:45:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy to build a PC,&rdquo; says your friend who&rsquo;s built a dozen before. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like LEGO for grownups!&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s true that building your own desktop is probably easier than a lot of people think, getting over the jitters and the less user-friendly parts of your first build is always a bit daunting. But for the first time in a long time, multiple PC hardware vendors are trying to make it easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now to be sure, it <em>is </em>a lot more simple than it used to be. Take storage for example. What used to be awkward at best with a hard drive and an IDE cable became a little simpler with SATA, but you still had two cables going to both the motherboard and the power supply. Now you can <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/558324/nvme-vs-m-2-vs-sata-ssd-whats-the-difference.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">just plug in an M.2 drive</a> directly onto the motherboard, making it even simpler than RAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-twist-on-power-supplies\">A new twist on power supplies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar innovations are happening elsewhere. Take Corsair&rsquo;s latest power supply, for example. On a standard PSU, the inelegant positioning of the cable connections deep inside the case necessitates either cramming your hand deep inside space you can&rsquo;t easily see, or connecting everything externally &mdash; which might not be an option, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for clean cable routing. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Corsair RMx SHIFT power supply with cables attached\" class=\"wp-image-1499084\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CorsairRMxShift1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Corsair</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499073/corsairs-funky-new-power-supply-shorts-diy-pc-build-problems.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corsair RMx Shift</a> solves that problem, rotating the conventional power supply by ninety degrees. Combined with a compact casing for a little extra wiggle room, that makes the power rails easy to reach and route to your necessary components via the rear side of the case (with the underside of the motherboard). Even better, it&rsquo;ll work in any standard PC case, and it makes shoving all those loose power cables to the backside easy, preserving clean interior airflow. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keep-cables-out-of-sight\">Keep cables out of sight</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of clean cable routing, Gigabyte is doing its best to make the most annoying part of PC building more or less invisible. We&rsquo;ve seen case designs that have little raised blockers to make cable routing very nearly invisible, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier to set up. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450153/hate-pc-cable-management-gigabytes-slick-project-stealth-pc-is-back-with-a-key-improvement.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Project Stealth</a>, in its second revision at this year&rsquo;s CES, puts <em>all </em>the headers for power connections in the rear of the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That means the motherboard, the graphics card, the case&rsquo;s internal fans, even things like USB motherboard cables are all reversed, pointing to the rear of the case. Not only does that give you a super-clean interior for aesthetics and airflow, it means you can adjust any connections from the rear, without touching the primary chamber at all. Even the CMOS battery for retaining your motherboard&rsquo;s settings is mounted on the rear! The only downside is that you need to buy the case, motherboard, and GPU all at once in order for it all to work together. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-case-that-grows-with-your-build\">A case that grows with your build</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you want a little more flexibility in your case itself? What if you start with a mini-ITX build, but find out later your high-power parts really need a full ATX case? Then you might want to check out the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448368/inwins-mod-free-pc-case-can-shrink-and-grow-with-your-build.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">InWin Mod Free</a>, a radical departure for case design that nonetheless accommodates all modern ATX-compliant parts. The case is &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; style, allowing you a huge degree of access to the internal structure because it comes without any kind of siding. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not where the magic happens. The core case can be bolted onto other skeletal modules &mdash; a bigger chamber for a robust power supply, or extra height for a big all-in-one cooler, or a huge addition for a built-in NAS. You can even bolt on a new chamber for an entirely separate computer build, combining multiple machines into one. Both the core case and the add-on modules come in multiple sizes. When you&rsquo;ve settled on your size and installed your components, you can add in the exterior panels, which come in acrylic, tempered glass, or cooling-friendly mesh on the concept device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corsair&rsquo;s RMx Shift power supply is <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=corsair+rmx+shift&amp;nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm_mmc=afc-ran-com-_-http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=afc-ran-com-_-http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com&amp;utm_source=afc-http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com&amp;AFFID=3357371&amp;AFFNAME=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASUBID=&amp;ASID=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F1499073%2Fcorsairs-funky-new-power-supply-shorts-diy-pc-build-problems.html&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=3357371&amp;ranSiteID=.l6kYCuH720-HdseI_xgSggCYqZdcZnpAA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available now in 750, 850, 1000, and 1200-watt capacities</a>, and Gigabyte&rsquo;s Project Stealth can be <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5VX3JBJ/&amp;xcust=2-1-1502500-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">purchased as an all-in-one kit</a> with the case, motherboard, and RTX 3070 GPU. The only downside is that with Gigabyte&rsquo;s place in the market somewhat uncertain (especially in terms of graphics cards), there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the line will continue. The InWin Mod Free should hit the market sometime later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three products are examples of how PC hardware suppliers are trying to make it even easier to build your first PC. Heck, even if you&rsquo;re building your fiftieth, I doubt anyone will complain about it becoming much easier.  </p>\n\nDesktop PCs</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "PC world"}}
