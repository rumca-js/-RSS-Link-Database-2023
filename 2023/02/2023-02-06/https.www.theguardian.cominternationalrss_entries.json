Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence said Bakhmut was becoming \u201cincreasingly isolated\u201d, in its latest intelligence assessment which noted that Russia now had the two main roads into the city under threat from direct artillery fire, making it harder to supply the defending forces into the town.</p><p><strong>Iran and Russia are looking to build a factory in Russia that could supply more than 6,000 Iranian-designed drones for the war in Ukraine, according to reports.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/moscow-tehran-advance-plans-for-iranian-designed-drone-facility-in-russia-11675609087?mod=hp_lead_pos8\">The Wall Street Journal</a> claimed that the two governments are moving ahead with plans, and that an Iranian delegation went to Russia in January to visit the planned site.</p><p><strong>Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Iraq on Sunday</strong> for talks on energy and food security in view of the Ukraine conflict, an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesperson said. Lavrov will also visit Mali this week, in a trip that the west African country\u2019s government says will strengthen defence and security ties. It will be the first time a Russian foreign minister has visited Mali, and is part of a push by Moscow to extend its influence over countries in Africa.</p><p><strong>The EU-imposed ban on Russian seaborne oil products will come into force on Monday. </strong>The 27-nation bloc is banning Russian refined oil products such as diesel fuel and joining the US and other allies in imposing a price cap on sales to non-western countries.
