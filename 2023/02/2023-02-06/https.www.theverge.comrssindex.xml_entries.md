  <p id="M6kiFz">Computer manufacturer Dell is set to cut about 6,650 jobs representing 5 percent of its global workforce, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-06/dell-dell-lays-off-about-6-650-employees-in-latest-tech-cuts?sref=HrWXCALa"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Announced in <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/preparing-for-the-road-ahead/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a memo</a> on Monday, Dell Co-Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said that the company’s previous cost-cutting measures, such as a pause on hiring and limitations on travel, have proved insufficient, and that the company is experiencing market conditions that “continue to erode with an uncertain future.”</p>
<p id="F3ERTb">The layoffs were announced in the face of falling demand for PCs and laptops. Following a surge in PC sales during the global covid pandemic, most major computing manufacturers are now seeing a sharp drop in demand. Industry analyst IDC reported <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50031623">a 37 percent decline</a> in Dell’s computer...</p>

  <p id="bRTjkQ">Electric automaker Rivian is developing an electric bike, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/rivian-ceo-tells-staff-ev-maker-is-developing-an-electric-bike?leadSource=uverify%20wall">sources speaking to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. CEO RJ Scaringe apparently told staff about the e-bike effort during a company meeting on Friday, noting that a small team is currently working on it. </p>
<p id="a50ag8"><em>Bloomberg</em> says it’s unclear if Scaringe was talking about a battery-assisted bicycle (aka an e-bike) or an electric motorcycle. However, Scaringe has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23422664/rivian-ebike-cars-electric-motors-porsche-bosch">teased an entry</a> into micromobility in the past and the company has patents for e-bike designs and components.</p>
