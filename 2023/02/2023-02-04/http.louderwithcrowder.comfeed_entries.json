The lawsuit centered on Musk's tweets from 2018,  when he claimed he had  \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private for $420 per share, and that \u201cinvestor support\u201d for the deal was \u201cconfirmed.\u201d His tweets caused Tesla trading to halt for weeks and the share price was volatile for weeks. </p><p>Musk claimed he had a verbal agreement with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund at the time of the tweets, but the deal fell through. Yesterday, the jury found him not liable for the losses incurred by investors due to his tweets, a huge relief, given that Musk had tried to get the trial moved out of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-police-36-hours\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco</a> to Texas. He feared he wouldn't get a fair trial in California due to the outrage over his purchase of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-top-tweet\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. </p><p>And his fears weren't unfounded. In the questionnaire for potential jurors, one woman described Musk as \u201cthe next Trump\u201d and a \u201cdelusional narcissist.\"  Another said that Tesla's are \"beautiful\" but Elon was \"an idiot.\" </p><p>Throughout the trial, Musk <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/3/23584871/elon-musk-securities-fraud-trial-closing-arguments-jury\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> laughed when the Judge joked about whether it\u2019s \u201cmetaphysically possible\u201d for plaintiffs to prove a \u201cmaterial misrepresentation.\u201d He also offered his assistance when the court was struggling with tech issues.

Klain delivered his address from the East Room, detailing the \"best job\" he ever had. </p><p>Towards the end of his remarks, he began to weep...over a rock. Yes, it really is as weird as it sounds. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cRon Klain breaks down sobbing as he recalls being given a rock by a White House staffer:\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s always symbolized to me\\u2026 that this team has been rock solid.\\u201d\\u201d</div> \u2014 Addison Smith (@Addison Smith)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AddisonSmithOAN/status/1621174101196029952\">1675353000</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Klain was explaining that the rock was his most treasured souvenir from his tenure in the White House. He said, <em>\"This plain and simple rock was given to me a year ago on one of our darker days \u2014 by Louisa Terrell [head of White House legislative affairs]. And it\u2019s always symbolized to me the fact that this team has been rock solid in their support of our agenda and the president. We\u2019ve never wavered. We\u2019ve been as solid as a rock. And so I ask you today to continue to play that role. I ask each and every one of you to continue your jobs as the rock of this White House, this administration, and this presidency. That\u2019s our mission.\u201d</em></p><p>I cannot even fathom handing a coworker a small boulder as a present and uttering the words \"we're solid as a rock.\" And I <em>really</em> can't fathom receiving said rock from a coworker and treasuring it for years to come. As opposed to the natural response, which would be to ask, \"What am I supposed to do with this rock, Louisa?\" </p><p>But there's something even more alarming about Klain's speech. Before the emotional moment with the rock, Klain claimed,<em> \"I learned everything I know about how to be a good father from Joe Biden. He\u2019s the best father I know and the best role model I know.\u201d  </em></p><p>Yes, the same Joe Biden who allegedly took <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1621315204159082496?s=20&amp;t=nli8DwUX-jdMWPNx21YUpQ\" target=\"_blank\">showers with his daughter </a>and raised <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-movies-dad\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter Biden</a>. That Joe. He's the best father Klain knows. This makes me worried about Klain's state of mind. Even more than the weeping over the rock. </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Louder With Crowder"}}
