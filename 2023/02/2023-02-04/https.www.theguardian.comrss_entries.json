Le Guin asked the reader if even great happiness could justify suffering. Humanity\u2019s relationship to animals is predicated on a similar utilitarian calculus.

A Windrush-era arrival, remembered as a man of promising intellect, Castus turned out to be working in an East End off-licence. The older man berated the younger with his catchphrase: \u201cI\u2019m black so you can do all those white things. I\u2019m black so you don\u2019t have to be.\u201d The list of white things would stretch over the years to encompass cycling, drinking chardonnay, reading feminist literature and living in Brighton. But on that day in Mile End, Grant was being accused of almost the whitest thing possible: turning down an opportunity. By rejecting medicine he seemed to be distancing himself from the humiliations and privations his family had undergone in order to facilitate his place at the Royal London hospital. Picking the arts over medicine was a luxury \u2013 choosing to live a more precarious life was indulgent.</p><p>In Grant\u2019s previous book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/29/homecoming-colin-grant-windrush-betrayal-amelia-gentleman-review\">Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation</a>, we encountered many people like Castus.

(Normally I don\u2019t care too much about US productions taking egregious licenses with London geography and financial reality, but come on.) He sees a beautiful woman for less than 100th of a second through a window and falls utterly and completely in love with her in a way that somehow always ends up with a perspex cage. The point with You, though, is to just let it wash over you without thinking too hard \u2013 essentially it\u2019s a soap, just with higher production values and an incredible face and performance at the centre of it \u2013 and the schlockiness of it has always been a feature, not a bug. No more is this evident in season four, where Joe \u2013 doing the usual growling, menacing voiceover that Penn Badgley so excels at \u2013 is faced with a cavalcade of posh English people, all sounding more English than an English person has ever sounded on screen. Obviously, at some point, someone dies. The cogs whirr into motion. Bluffs and double-bluffs. Every character could secretly be a threat. Thrills and twists await.
