  <p id="H6gFxk">A California judge is allowing Meta to close its acquisition of virtual reality fitness startup Within despite an ongoing antitrust case by the Federal Trade Commission, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23598337-ftc-vs-meta-within-ruling?responsive=1&amp;title=1">according to an unsealed ruling</a>. On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/meta-wins-court-nod-to-buy-virtual-reality-startup-in-loss-for-lina-khan-s-ftc?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a> that the court denied the FTC’s request to block the deal but with a one-week delay that will give the FTC time to appeal. The orders were posted on Tuesday, and a status hearing on the case is set for February 7th.</p>
<p id="QMcjgd"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23281033/ftc-meta-within-complaint-block-acquisition-vr-fitness-beat-saber">The FTC sued</a> in July of 2022 to stop Meta’s acquisition of Within, which makes the popular VR app Supernatural. The agency argued that Meta’s purchase would expand its dominance in the consumer VR market, where Meta has staked many of its resources in recent years. The commission highlighted...</p>

  <p id="o17gKY">Happy Saturday, readers! During its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23577735/samsung-galaxy-s23-unpacked-book-3-announcements">Unpacked event</a> on Wednesday, Samsung introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23578596/samsung-galaxy-book-3-pro-360-ultra-14-16-inch-price">new line of Galaxy Book3 laptops</a> with better displays and Intel’s 13th Gen Core processors. However, if you don’t need an ultraportable laptop or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23580552/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-laptop-price-hands-on">a high-end machine squarely aimed at the MacBook Pro 16</a>, <strong>Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2</strong> is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097WD9P4K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop-links.co/ci3F4WJBNg9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> in its fiery, “fiesta red” colorway for $499 ($200 off), its lowest price to date.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="IfhmCP"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="ajTm7m">The midrange Chromebook 2 certainly isn’t the most powerful Chromebook you can get — blame it on the 10th Gen Intel Core i3-10110U processor — but it should suffice for everyday work use and multitasking, especially with the machine’s 8GB of RAM. Moreover, it touts decent battery life (when compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">o...</a></p>

  <p id="X40NOB">Twitter wants to cash in on businesses on the platform by charging them $1,000 per month to keep their gold checkmarks, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/twitter-considers-charging-brands-1000-per-month-to-stay-verified">a report from <em>The Information</em></a>. As noted by <em>The Information</em>, brands who don’t pay the $1,000 per month fee will lose their gold badges, although it’s unclear when that will happen. </p>
<p id="w3EZCc">Internal messages viewed by the outlet also reveal that Twitter’s looking to tack on an extra $50 per month charge to add badges to each account affiliated with the business. This aligns with a screenshot <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1621558412386476036">posted by social media consultant Matt Navarra</a>, which shows what appears to be an email between Twitter product manager Evan Jones and an unnamed business. </p>

  <p id="PlGa45">Over 40 contractors for YouTube Music are going on strike — a first at Google, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1621471743763423232">according to the Alphabet Workers Union</a> (or AWU). The action is in response to an order to return to in-person work next week, something that many of the workers say they can’t do. They’re demanding a return-to-work policy that’s “fair, flexible, and does not threaten the safety and livelihoods of workers,” according to an AWU press release.</p>
<p id="e5BI99">The workers are part of the YouTube Music Content Operations team via Cognizant, a subcontractor for Alphabet, Google and YouTube’s parent company. Their jobs are to “ensure music content is available and approved” for the platform, according to a <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/press/releases/youtube-music-rto-ulp/">prior press release from the AWU</a>. </p>
