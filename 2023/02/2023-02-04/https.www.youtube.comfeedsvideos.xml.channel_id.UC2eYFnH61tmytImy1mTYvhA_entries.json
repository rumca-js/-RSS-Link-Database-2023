They breed both false senses of permanence and of futility due merely to how episodic TV shows must be constructed. Plots never advance. Characters never really mature.\n\nIt's no leap to say there is a relation between that and the fact that now generations that watched these shows have notoriously matured little and create lives around non-progress, non-accomplishment and view their lives as repeating constantly their same unsolved psychological issues and personal hold-ups, over and over again.\n\nThis applies to the consumption of other media as well, like YouTube and even video games. Everything is small variations on a familiar and unadvancing theme on to eternity.
