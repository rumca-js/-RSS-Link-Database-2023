<p>The new chatbot is generating a lot of hype, but we would do well to consider its human and environmental cost</p><p>Sometimes, those who would forget history are condemned to repeat it. For those of us with long memories, the current fuss – nay hysteria – surrounding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/chatgpt-bot-excel-ai-chatbot-tech">ChatGPT</a> (and “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney">generative AI</a>” generally) rings a bell.</p><p>We have been here before: in January 1996, to be precise. That was the moment when Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at MIT, unveiled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>, which would have been called the world’s first chatbot if that term had existed at the time. Weizenbaum wrote the software (in a programming language intriguingly called MAD-SLIP) to demonstrate that communications between humans and computers were inevitably superficial. It did that by providing a text box in which one could exchange typed communications with the machine. Inside the program was a script (christened DOCTOR by Weizenbaum) which parodied the exchanges a patient might have with a psychotherapist who practised the <a href="https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Rogerian_psychotherapy">person-centred therapy</a> pioneered by Carl Rogers. (The program’s name came from Eliza Doolittle, the cockney lass who was taught to “speak proper” in Shaw’s play <em>Pygmalion</em>.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/04/chatgpt-isnt-a-great-leap-forward-its-an-expensive-deal-with-the-devil">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Challenge)<br />In its best moments, the Italian pianist’s tribute to the American classical-jazz pioneer is breathtaking</p><p>In the 1950s, an American band, the Modern Jazz Quartet, was the first to gain wide popular success by mixing the idioms of jazz and classical music. Pianist and composer <a href="https://www.steinway.com/artists/john-lewis">John Lewis</a> (1920-2001) was the leading spirit behind its delicate sound, attractive tunes and natural swing. Today, Europe is the home of the jazz-classical amalgam, with Italian pianist <a href="https://www.enricopieranunzi.it/">Enrico Pieranunzi</a> among its leading artists.</p><p>It was a good idea to record him revisiting some of Lewis’s best known pieces, such as Django, Concorde and Skating in Central Park. I’m not sure it was such a good idea for <a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/jazz/products/9397994--blues-bach-the-music-of-john-lewis">these eight tracks</a> to include, alongside the piano-bass-drums jazz trio, an orchestra made up of a string quartet, plus double bass, and a wind quintet, all arranged and conducted by <a href="https://michelecorcella.it/en/home-english/">Michele Corcella</a>. Pieranunzi is always a joy to listen to, but Lewis’s light-touch melodies do tend to get lost in the glory of it all. Nevertheless there are moments here when the affinity of interplay between orchestra and soloist is almost beyond belief. I can imagine them, unhampered by a ready-made programme, coming up with something really spectacular together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/04/enrico-pieranunzi-trio-and-orchestra-blues-bach-the-music-of-john-lewis-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A couple of French designers, helped by their son and two donkeys, have transformed a Moroccan chicken farm into a stunning family home</p><p>When French fashion art director Julien Tang met photographer and model Cyrielle Rigot in Paris, she was “longing for new air and far-flung adventures”. “Marrakech awaited us,” says Julien. Shortly afterwards, in 2014, the couple transformed a 16th-century townhouse in Marrakech’s medina into Riad Jardin Secret, an <em>hôtel particulier</em>. Once home to Yves Saint Laurent, who entertained his young lovers there, the house conjures up a 1970s <em>Hideous Kinky</em> design appeal.</p><p>Today, the couple also run an interior design studio specialising in a crafted, authentic aesthetic with a contemporary twist in their family home, a former chicken farm 25km outside Marrakech.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/04/marrakech-expressed-turning-an-old-farm-into-a-light-filled-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New manager’s sheer energy galvanises team with echoes of club’s history evident during momentous victory over Arsenal</p><p>There is a lot wrong at Everton. Vast sums have been spent very badly and again the board stayed away for its own safety, but just because there are a lot of things to put right it does not mean that you shouldn’t correct the things you can. And just because clubs are often unduly impatient with managers it doesn’t mean that a change isn’t sometimes necessary. Sean Dyche’s first game in charge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/23/sacking-lampard-was-the-right-decision-but-evertons-woes-dont-end-there">after replacing Frank Lampard</a> brought Everton’s best performance and best result of the season.</p><p>It says much about how well Everton played that Arsenal seemed so flat. It’s the performance as much as the result that calls their title credentials into question. Even Mikel Arteta, usually so energetic on the touchline, seemed subdued, as though recognising how his side had been overwhelmed, in part by the weight of Everton’s history, the ghosts that have been summoned over the past few days, and in part by Dyche and his sheer energy, his obvious relish at being back in a Premier League technical area.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/04/dyche-steps-back-in-time-with-nod-to-very-different-everton-era-in-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French director draws on her own experience in this story of a writer sitting in on the trial of a woman accused of murdering her own baby</p><p>The first fiction feature from director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/29/saint-omer-director-alice-diop-interview">Alice Diop</a>, who has previously worked in documentary (her films include the multi-award-winning <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/27/we-nous-review-a-tender-homage-to-the-unnoticed">We</a></em>), the French-language courtroom drama <em>Saint Omer</em> is as intriguing as it is intellectually rigorous. Inspired by Diop’s own experience of attending the trial of a woman accused of murdering her baby, it’s a meditative exploration of a complicated connection between the woman in the dock and the one who bears witness.</p><p>Rama (Kayije Kagame), Diop’s alter ego in the story, is a writer looking for inspiration. She is also pregnant and processing a tangle of emotions about what it is to be a mother. Laurence (the remarkable Guslagie Malanda), a charismatic and eloquent Senegalese immigrant, is serenely assured as a defendant in the murder trial, but jarringly discordant when it comes to her experiences of motherhood. Diop deftly depicts the two women as distorted mirror images of each other: Rama recognises something in Laurence even as she abhors her crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/04/saint-omer-review-alice-diop-compelling-courtroom-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>TK; Xbox<br /></strong>This music-centred adventure, an unexpected release, pits a teenage boy against robotic assassins in a colourful title for gamers of all talents </p><p>The video game industry’s hype cycles are typically measured in months and years, not minutes and seconds. So the simultaneous announcement and release in late January of <em><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/hi-fi-rush/9nftc552k3gj">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em> – the kind of “go and buy it right now” revelation Apple is known for – feels breezily countercultural. So too does its bright, cartoonish styling: this game is as brazenly colourful as a <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205950/Jet_Set_Radio/">Jet Set Radio</a></em> fever dream, and even as plastic <em>Guitar Hero</em> instruments clog up the nation’s cupboards, it’s refreshing to play a game that is so unashamedly music-centred.</p><p>This is a brawler set to the beat of a drum. You play as Chai, an ebullient teenage boy who enrols in a biological augmentation program with a shady pharmaceutical company. The operation goes wrong when an old iPod-style music player is fitted to Chai’s chest. Marked for extermination, you must guide Chai to safety, then help him to take down his oppressor. As you move through these Shibuya-inspired streets, the world and everything in it pulses to the rhythm of the game’s soundtrack (a blend of originals and licensed tracks from bands such as the Black Keys and Nine Inch Nails).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/feb/04/hi-fi-rush-tk-xbox-review-a-brawler-set-to-the-beat-of-a-drum">Continue reading...</a>

## Cool, understated chic … all hail the return of brown mascara | Sali Hughes

<p>This often overlooked classic eye-flatterer has made a comeback – thanks to TikTok</p><p>Whether or not you care about TikTok, you can thank it alone for rescuing brown mascara from the discontinued doldrums. Before Charlotte Tilbury’s berry-toned brown (“Dream Pop”) <strong><a href="https://pillow/%20Talk%20mascara">Pillow Talk mascara</a></strong> (£26) went viral last year, it had become pretty slim pickings for lovers of softer, more natural- looking lashes. Now, more than 20 million views of #brownmascara later, they are breeding like guppies. Which is good news for blondes, redheads and beauty minimalists of every hair and skin tone.</p><p>It seems off-message for Glossier, the “clean girl makeup” brand, to have ever been without brown mascara, but the oversight has been corrected with its new milk chocolatey version of <strong><a href="https://lash/%20Slick">Lash Slick</a></strong> (£16). This claims, like its black stablemate, to offer a “baby extensions” look – that is, subtle length and defined, separated lashes. Fans of thicker, draft-excluder style eye pelmets will find it too modest, but if you’re looking for an understated, cool, casual look for jeans and hoodie days, it’s spot on. And it has notably good staying power.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/04/cool-understated-chic-all-hail-the-return-of-brown-mascara">Continue reading...</a>

A whole piece of fruit, that is, taken from the bowl on the kitchen counter. What I absolutely love to do, however, is cook with it. The application of some heat and some sort of sugar to tease out the sweetness leads to all sorts of irresistibly rich and sticky results.
