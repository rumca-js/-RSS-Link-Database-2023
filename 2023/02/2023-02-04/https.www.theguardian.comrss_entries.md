<ul><li>England 23-29 Scotland</li><li>Winger’s two tries give visitors the edge in end-to-end thriller</li></ul><p>Steve Borthwick has only been in charge of England for one game but he already knows what a maddening job coaching can be at this level. One minute England were heading towards a morale-boosting victory in front of a reinvigorated home crowd, the next they were looking on as Scotland gleefully celebrated a hat-trick of Calcutta Cup wins for the first time since 1972 to leave the hosts contemplating another season of potential Six Nations angst.</p><p>Borthwick and his players must have thought they were in the box seat when they led 23-19 with 15 minutes remaining. Instead there was a tartan twist as Scotland’s Duhan van der Merwe finished off a flowing counterattack in the left corner to decide a contest that had see-sawed all afternoon. If it was rough justice on Max Malins, scorer of two sharp tries, and the tireless Ollie Chessum it was an outcome that had already threatened to materialise at various moments on a still, grey evening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/04/england-scotland-six-nations-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The mass clearing of Queensland tropics in the 20th century – and the force of cyclones – won’t deter an attempt to regenerate ancient growth</p><p>My relationship with Thiaki started with an ambush. It wasn’t your usual ambush, but it was an ambush, nevertheless. We’d crept along a narrow track that ran atop a volcanic ridge, the sound of crunching gravel under the car’s wheels muffled by a narrow strip of trees edging the track. We came to the back of a brick house, which had a neat lawn adorned with a cement girl holding a concrete birdbath. Sheds were stacked with rainforest timber, and cattle yards were perched further ahead at the end of the ridge.</p><p>Ridges with level ground were in short supply on the random boneless volcanic landscape of the Atherton Tablelands. A scruffy dingo-dog cross and a couple of cats lounged near the roller-door entrance, lazily observing the proceedings as their owners shook our hands in formal welcome and ushered us into a large living space: concrete floor, Laminex-surfaced table and metal chairs, no fuss.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/05/our-fate-rests-on-efforts-like-this-the-family-restoring-precious-rainforest-to-its-former-glory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The teacher and writer on a golden age for Caribbean writers, editing in bed, and his encounter with VS Naipaul</p><p>Kevin Jared Hosein, 36, is a teacher and writer from Trinidad, where he lives and works. He won the Commonwealth writers’ prize in 2018 for his story <a href="https://granta.com/passage/">Passage</a> and he has written two novels for young adults, <em>The Repenters</em> and <em>The Beast of Kukuyo</em>. His first novel for adults, <em>Hungry Ghosts</em>, is set in 1940s Trinidad and concerns the wife of an overseer who goes missing and the attempts by one of his employees to move up in a highly stratified society. Hilary Mantel called it “a deeply impressive book… and an important one”.</p><p><strong>What is a hungry ghost (a </strong><em><strong>preta</strong></em><strong>)?<br /></strong>It originated in ancient Hindu tradition, where if you commit certain sins, [when you die] you transform into a being where your mouth is very small and your appetite is extremely large. So you would have this unending hunger and no way to satiate it. I thought it was a good analogy to explain the character motivations in the book, especially where social mobility is concerned and whatever life you attain; it can never be enough.</p><p><em>Hungry Ghosts</em> by Kevin Jared Hosein is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

## Manchester United hold firm to beat Crystal Palace after Casemiro sees red

<p>Manchester United returned to winning ways in the Premier League yet what will be the cost of Casemiro’s 71st-minute red card? On Friday Erik ten Hag admitted that losing his midfield general would be a seismic blow and the United manager will no discover just how damaging his absence is after the Brazilian wrapped his hands around Will Hughes’s neck.</p><p>It occurred during a melee near the corner flag sparked by Jeffrey Schlupp’s challenge on Antony. The Crystal Palace midfielder was yellow carded but worse followed for Casemiro when Andre Marriner, under the VAR’s order, consulted the pitchside screen. It means he misses the home and away games against Leeds plus a meeting with Leicester but will be back for the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle. With the injured Christian Eriksen out until early May, the 30-year-old’s suspension will cause Ten Hag a significant headache.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/04/manchester-united-hold-firm-to-beat-crystal-palace-after-casemiro-sees-red">Continue reading...</a>

## Tetê and Dennis Praet give Leicester the edge in six-goal thriller at Aston Villa

<p></p><p>Given that Brendan Rodgers has spent much of a so-far miserable season <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/rodgers-eyes-january-shopping-spree-as-stale-leicester-look-for-a-refresh">highlighting the need for a refresh of his squad</a>, it seemed apt that all of his January signings played their part in a welcome win at Aston Villa. Tetê, the Brazilian winger signed on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk, scored to give Leicester the lead at the end of a jam-packed first half in which Villa twice squandered their advantage, before the substitute Dennis Praet sealed victory late on.</p><p>Victor Kristiansen, a 20-year-old left-back signed from Copenhagen, was a strong contender for player of the match while Harry Souttar, a £15m arrival from Stoke, rallied after his own goal helped Villa restore their lead and made an important second-half block to deny Ollie Watkins an equaliser. Souttar, the 6ft 6in Australia centre-back, was signed to bolster a brittle defence – before today, only Bournemouth had conceded more Premier League goals this season – but his presence was never going to make Leicester bulletproof overnight. Leon Bailey should have levelled from close range shortly after the hour but failed to arrange his feet after being located inside the box by Emi Buendía.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/04/aston-villa-leicester-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Wolves quick out of the blocks to deepen gloom for woeful Liverpool

<p>Liverpool’s winter of gloom continues to plumb new depths. Their third thudding away defeat in a row was nailed on once Craig Dawson put Wolves two up before Jürgen Klopp’s players could hit any sort of stride. Nothing about what happened before or after it flattered an excellent home side, who profited from an early Joël Matip own goal and rounded things off through Rúben Neves.</p><p>Perhaps Klopp will point to a smattering of second-half chances but the fact is that Liverpool only brightened up once the game had already happened to them. Reverses at Brentford, Brighton and Molineux within five weeks, nine goals conceded and one scored, are no coincidence. This is a crisis and there will be no easy way out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/04/wolves-quick-out-of-the-blocks-to-deepen-gloom-for-woeful-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarah Lancashire’s portrayal in the hit series is 10 times tougher than her TV predecessors</p><p>I can measure out my life, not with coffee spoons, but in female cops. First, there was Insp Jean Darblay (as played by Stephanie Turner) in <em>Juliet Bravo</em>, who had the young me dreaming of an adulthood in which every man in the vicinity was required to call me ma’am (some hope). Then there was DCI Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) in <em>Prime Suspect</em>, fighting institutional sexism one day at a time with a pair of black leather gloves, a good haircut and too much booze. Finally, there is Sgt Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) in Sally Wainwright’s <em>Happy Valley</em>, less highly ranked than either of her predecessors, but about 10 times as tough.</p><p>In Catherine’s hi-vis jacket and satisfying way with the word twat, we reach the apogee of the groundbreaking female TV police officer; I don’t believe, creatively speaking, she can go any higher, though I hope I’m wrong. Either way, I’m going to miss her. Every woman I know adores her, this walking, talking embodiment of the fact that the precise moment most women reach their zenith is the precise moment half the world stops listening to them. Excited as I am by <em>Happy Valley</em>’s tangled plots – what is the devilish Tommy Lee Royce about to do? – it’s Catherine’s determination in the face of her extreme weariness that I experience as pure energy: exhilarating, intoxicating, not-to-be-messed-with under any circumstances.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/04/happy-valley-catherine-cawood-is-top-of-the-cops">Continue reading...</a>

<p>British artist <a href="https://edfairburn.com/">Ed Fairburn</a> started his map portraits in 2012 while studying illustration at Cardiff School of Art and Design. “I was interested in ‘hijacking’ ordinary objects – a sort of off-road style of drawing using anything but plain paper,” he says. He started with envelopes, but switched after an experiment involving a portrait on a road map of Germany. He calls his technique topopointillism. “The portraits are often too subtle to spot up close on a map. Just like with a pointillist painting, you have to step back to allow the bigger picture to emerge,” he says. Fairburn doesn’t “see” people in the topography – like spotting animal shapes in clouds – instead, distinctive structural landscape patterns inspire him. “I hope people get lost in the details of my work; I want it to serve as a reminder that we are a product of the landscape, this place we call home.”</p><ul><li><a href="http://edfairburn.com/">See more at</a><strong><a href="http://edfairburn.com/"> </a></strong><a href="http://edfairburn.com/">edfairburn.com</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/feb/04/drawn-off-course-portraits-created-on-vintage-maps-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

Instead, new England coach Steve Borthwick will hope there will be more written about his side’s actual good performance than the nonsensical words his predecessor would use to pretend the showings in the last year were anything other than a bit crap.</p><p>The Cumbrian’s first task as he begins his international head coaching journey is to overcome an interesting Scotland selection from his opposite number, Gregor Townsend. In contrast, the Scots head coach is embarking on his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_of_a_Woman_(1992_film)">Frank Slade-esque tour of pleasures</a> as his time in the job heads to a definite end sometime this coming autumn.

## Everton burst into life under Dyche as Tarkowski header floors Arsenal

<p>Everton have remembered how to win. The Sean Dyche era started in victorious fashion as two Burnley old boys combined to lift the mood around Goodison Park and inflict only a second league defeat of the season on leaders Arsenal. Mikel Arteta’s title contenders were easily subdued by a classic case of new manager bounce.</p><p>James Tarkowski headed home a Dwight McNeil corner to give their former Burnley manager the perfect start in his attempt to preserve Everton’s Premier League status. Without a league win since October, Everton put in a prodigious shift to stifle an Arsenal team unbeaten in 14 league games and end their own sorry run of results. Amadou Onana and Abdoulaye Doucouré, superb throughout, sunk to their knees on the final whistle out of pure relief and exhaustion. Dyche had questioned whether Everton still knew how to win during Burnley’s victory over Frank Lampard’s team last season. Those doubts have been banished on day one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/04/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

My style as a chef leans towards elevated small plates, but, now that I am in London, the casualness of Brighton life and my St Lucian heritage come through in my cooking. Fish has been a staple throughout my back story and now at our new restaurant, Cannons Fish in north London. Today’s three dishes show the diversity of what a “fish dish” can be, and pull inspiration from family recipes, my life and the fish-forward dishes I’ve served over the years.</p><p>Liv Lionel is head chef at Cannons Fish, London N14, which opens later this month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/04/caribbean-prawn-curry-cod-risotto-crispy-hake-burgers-recipes-liv-lionel-fish-dinner">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Village Underground, London</strong><br />The francophone R&amp;B singer and model, dubbed a Belgian Beyoncé, brings swagger, mischief and slinky style to a compelling set that dances across genres and languages </p><p>Imperious and controlled, Marie-Pierra Kakoma – the Belgian artist who performs as Lous and the Yakuza – is singing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1nNlEBmO_s">“</a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1nNlEBmO_s">la money</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1nNlEBmO_s">”</a> to a rapt crowd. From her latest album, last year’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/13/lous-and-the-yakuza-iota-review">Iota</a>, </em>the track reflects on what happens when “<em>plus de money</em>” sours a relationship. Although peppered with English, the lyrics to Kakoma’s banging R&amp;B songs are mostly in French. Her meaning has no problem landing with this small but partisan London crowd. Its core message – more money, more problems – is driven home by Kakoma’s delivery and her emphatic live band.</p><p>Swagger and a certain cross-Channel sophistication are only part of her appeal, though. A great many artists are being forced to diversify their offering to make career ends meet. Kakoma is a something of an instinctive Renaissance woman, a 360-degree artist whose talent, savvy, cross-cultural breadth and sense of mischief call to mind artists such as Spain’s boundary-vaulting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/20/rosalia-motomami-review-energy-and-heartbreak-from-a-first-class-voice">Rosalía</a> – or a Belgian Beyoncé.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/04/lous-and-the-yakuza-village-underground-london-review-iota">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The teenage tearaway turned UK charts fixture is so much more than a ‘one-hit wonder on the radio’</p><p>Medway has given the UK a few cultural diamonds in the rough, Billy Childish, Adele songwriter Kid Harpoon and <em>Drag Race</em> contestants among them. Now there’s a new young upstart from Chatham putting Kent back on the musical map: 22-year-old Erin Doyle, AKA <a href="https://venbee.lnk.to/bio">Venbee</a>. Her delicate voice opens one of the most omnipresent dance tunes of the past year with the remarkable line: “I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out.” A collaboration with rising drum’n’bass producer Goddard, <a href="https://venbee.lnk.to/messyinheaven">Messy in Heaven</a> has spent 19 weeks in the UK charts. It’s a key tune in D&amp;B’s current renaissance, with newcomers such as <a href="https://www.niaarchives.com/">Nia Archives</a> nominated at the 2023 Brit awards.</p><p>And yet, Venbee’s vocals skew towards bedroom pop: intimate, melancholy – a world away from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/ella-eyre-rudimental-naughty-boy-debut-album">Ella Eyre</a>s and Rita Oras who belted out the D&amp;B hits of the 2010s. Messy in Heaven’s woi-oi attitude is catnip for Gen Z, although there’s more to Venbee than cheeky charm. On TikTok – where she first went viral with the 2022 track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMz6V7vwmrk">Low Down</a> – she talks about having down days and struggling with ADHD. Next single Gutter is another reality check, as she details being a teenage tearaway with Kae Tempest-style lyrical rawness. But she can laugh at herself too: her forthcoming tour promises songs that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@venbee.music/video/7187776067501837574">wittily send up</a> being a “one-hit wonder on the radio”. Here’s hoping she proves herself wrong.</p><p><a href="https://venbee.lnk.to/tickets">Venbee tours from 23 February</a>.

<p><strong>Royal Opera House; Queen Elizabeth Hall, St Martin-in-the-Fields, London</strong><br />Majestic Lise Davidsen and Gerald Finley carry the Royal Opera’s illness-hit Wagner revival; Isata Kanneh-Mason and co shine; and in the shadows with William Byrd</p><p>An orgy with the main stud out of action is – I’m guessing here – the ultimate frustration. Luckily, Wagner’s <strong><a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/tannhauser-by-tim-albery-details">Tannhäuser</a></strong>, which launches with a prolonged bacchanalian frenzy, is merely theatre, as the Royal Opera House production, directed by Tim Albery and new in 2010, emphatically reminds us. Centre stage is a proscenium arch, a replica of the ROH’s gold-and-crimson own. Art and life clash head on: literally here. Hhours before the opening of this second revival, an unwell Stefan Vinke pulled out of singing the title role.</p><p>Nobly he walked the part, which fortunately includes a good deal of sitting down, with the Austrian tenor Norbert Ernst singing from the side. Uneven dramatically, much tinkered with by Wagner himself, <em>Tannhäuser</em> relies on the quality of its singers to yank it out of the putrid bog of desire, or the swamp of religiosity. We must thank Ernst for enabling the performance, conducted by Sebastian Weigle, to go ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/04/tannhauser-royal-opera-review-tim-albery-lise-davidsen-gerald-finley-stefan-vinke-norbert-ernst-isata-kanneh-mason-maxwell-quartet-queen-elizabeth-hall-gesualdo-six-secret-byrd-fretwork-st-martin-in-the-fields">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The musicians discuss their military families, surviving a serious car crash, and being partners in life and in music</p><p>Bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz met at Rhode Island School of Design in the early 1970s. After they became a couple, Weymouth joined Chris’s band the Artistics, along with David Byrne. Together they would form Talking Heads, one of the most influential groups of all time. Weymouth and Frantz, who are also known for their new wave side project Tom Tom Club, have two sons and live in New England. They tour the UK in May to promote Frantz’s memoir, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/remain-in-love-9781474615143">Remain in Love</a>.</p><p><strong>Chris<br /></strong>This photograph was taken in early spring, but it was cold out so Tina was wearing a hat – the first gift I gave her. I’d been home for Christmas and said: “Mom, there’s this girl, and I’d really like to get her a present.” She said: “Whatever you do, don’t give her jewellery, that’s tacky!” So I went to a department store in Pittsburgh and bought a hat by a milliner called Adolfo. Tina really liked it. It was a little small for her head, but she wore it faithfully. Tina and I were serious about each other. When we met she had a boyfriend and I had a girlfriend, but I had a strong feeling that she was the one. I said: “Tina, when you’re finished with this boyfriend, come and see me.” And that’s what eventually happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/04/talking-heads-tina-weymouth-and-chris-frantz-look-back-when-i-first-asked-her-to-join-my-band-she-refused">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Of all the places to find a heartening queer love story: the apocalypse.

This inescapable reality underpins much of human culture: what is most art, music, theatre, cinema and television other than an attempt to grapple with the emotional turmoil that results?</p><p>A devastating new contribution to this artistic tradition finds an unlikely home in episode three of the new HBO series The Last of Us. Unlikely, because it is based on a popular video game, set in an apocalyptic alternative universe in which most of humanity has been reduced to zombie-like cannibals. What remains of our species is confined to totalitarian quarantine zones and desperate raiding parties.

They share both earth and plate, and it’s been that way for centuries. The Scots, French, Welsh and, to my knowledge, the Romanians, too, like to soup them. With no offence meant, I don’t. I prefer to feel the silky texture of the leeks awash with cream and dijon mustard on my tongue, and I enjoy the sound of the potatoes crunching under molars. I’m also fond of some crumbly pastry on the side and, well, there you have the story of today’s tart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/04/meera-sodha-recipe-vegan-leek-shallot-potato-tart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With 100m sales of its Switch console, a new Mario movie and even a California theme park, the Japanese tech giant is riding high again. What’s its secret?</p><p>Every Nintendo fan remembers the game that converted them. Perhaps it was running and jumping around as Mario in an abstract, toylike playspace, thrilling at the lightness and precision of his movement. It could have been becoming hypnotised by falling Tetris blocks on the Game Boy’s tiny monochrome screen, or choosing a first Pokémon, marvelling at how the little collection of fat pixels representing your chosen critter instantly assumed an imagined personality. Millions of people had their first Nintendo moment during 2020’s lockdowns, moving to a virtual deserted island full of quirky neighbours in Animal Crossing.</p><p>For more than 40 years, this Japanese giant of entertainment has been making video games that have shaped the tastes of the people who played them as children; there is surely no game developer working today who is untouched by its influence. Its latest console, meanwhile – the Nintendo Switch, released in 2017 – recently became the fastest ever to reach 100m sales, and stands a good chance of becoming the bestselling console ever. Barring an extremely unlikely sales slump over Christmas, the Switch will leapfrog to No 3 on the bestselling list when Nintendo announces its quarterly results this week.

When DeSantis and his growing number of acolytes present themselves as champions of civic education, however, they are in fact undermining the whole point of civics: not to make children “<a href="https://m.flsenate.gov/statutes/1003.44">patriotic</a>” or just fill brains with facts (how many branches of government are there again?), but to enable individuals to be fearless, critical citizens.</p><p>Jan-Werner Müller teaches at Princeton and is a Guardian US columnist.

<p>Some of the quirkiest, most picturesque villages are nestled in the outer reaches of the Irish countryside, which has helped preserve their character</p><p>Ireland’s most beautiful and well known villages are easy to love. Even their names – Doolin, Adare, Dingle, Kenmare – roll off the tongue in a smooth syllable or two, as if they are part of a jingle or the end word of a rhyming couplet. Some of them rocketed to fame when they caught the eye of a film crew – such as Cong in The Quiet Man (1952) or Trim in Braveheart<em> </em>(1995), while more places grew in prominence because of their proximity to large cities or popular attractions.</p><p>Yet dig a little deeper and you’ll discover some of the most charming in the more remote areas of the Irish countryside, where the past sits more comfortably with the present. Their obscurity – perhaps because of a limited bus service or their narrow country roads – has preserved their wonderfully idiosyncratic character. They might even be more beautiful than their high-profile counterparts yet perhaps less appreciated by tourists, because they are not as accessible. But, for me, that just adds to their allure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/04/10-of-irelands-most-charming-villages">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s the age of decanting – never before have household perfectionists removed so many things from packages only to put them in other packages. Extreme tidiness is a modern obsession. But is it healthy?</p><p>Strangers joke that Jacquelyn Rendall should stick a label on to Adam Rendall’s head. “Husband,” it would read, in the curved typeface Rendall designed based on her own handwriting, the Pretty Perfect Font. If Adam had a label on his head – some of the 400,000 people who follow Jacquelyn on TikTok say – then he would match everything else in the couple’s home in Rochford, Essex.</p><p>It starts at the front door, where the words “Thank you postie” are stuck on the silver letterbox, followed by a cartoon heart. There’s nothing too unusual about this, nor the drawers in the corridor that hold separated bits and bobs labelled “cables”, “batteries” and “tools”. It is Rendall’s six-doored pantry that has the power to inspire a thousand envious and incredulous comments online. Starting at the top left, there are nine transparent containers full of white, brown, pink and yellow powders, each marked by its identity: “sugar”, “hot chocolate”, “banana milkshake”. Below that are miniature acrylic drawers of stock cubes and tiered rows of spices. The word “cereal” adorns six canisters in the next cupboard; “tagliatelle”, “spaghetti”, “conchiglie” and “penne” are also spelled out on clear containers (use-by dates are written in chalk pen on the back).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/04/its-a-control-thing-why-are-we-so-fascinated-by-super-organised-homes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Aristotle to Iris Murdoch: what the greatest minds of the past 2,500 years have to tell us about the good life</p><p>The thing that separates human beings from other animals is our extraordinary capacity for complex, abstract thought. This is what has given rise to our diverse cultures, our scientific achievements, our ability to envisage the future and, hopefully, make it better than what has gone before. But our imperfect minds have also generated terrible mistakes and dangerous ideologies. If we don’t know how to distinguish bad thinking from good, we can end up believing what we shouldn’t, and behaving in ways that are harmful to ourselves, to others, and to the planet.</p><p>Philosophers are, of course, the archetypal expert thinkers. Their discipline is often portrayed as a kind of formal method that lists fallacies to be avoided and distinguishes between deductive and inductive reasoning, invalid and sound arguments. These things have their place. But philosophy cannot be reduced to mere technique. Thinking well also requires adopting the right attitudes and being prepared to nurture effective habits. Without these “intellectual virtues” even the cleverest end up merely playing theoretical games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/04/think-yourself-better-10-rules-of-philosophy-to-live-by">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An important contribution to the story of British-Caribbean identity, told with loving scrutiny</p><p>Shortly before dropping out of medical school in the early 1980s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/colin-grant">Colin Grant</a> stumbled upon his long lost Uncle Castus in London. A Windrush-era arrival, remembered as a man of promising intellect, Castus turned out to be working in an East End off-licence. The older man berated the younger with his catchphrase: “I’m black so you can do all those white things. I’m black so you don’t have to be.” The list of white things would stretch over the years to encompass cycling, drinking chardonnay, reading feminist literature and living in Brighton. But on that day in Mile End, Grant was being accused of almost the whitest thing possible: turning down an opportunity. By rejecting medicine he seemed to be distancing himself from the humiliations and privations his family had undergone in order to facilitate his place at the Royal London hospital. Picking the arts over medicine was a luxury – choosing to live a more precarious life was indulgent.</p><p>In Grant’s previous book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/29/homecoming-colin-grant-windrush-betrayal-amelia-gentleman-review">Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation</a>, we encountered many people like Castus. Their oral histories were marked by stories of dashed hopes, racist violence, stoic resignation and an uncertain sense of belonging. “Motherland” or “homeland”? Where were they <em>really</em> from? During the 1960s and 1970s, home for Grant’s family was Luton – and a now-vanished world of linoleum flooring, paraffin heaters, plastic pineapple ice buckets and The Black and White Minstrel Show.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/04/im-black-so-you-dont-have-to-be-by-colin-grant-review-where-are-we-really-from">Continue reading...</a>

## Videodrome at 40: David Cronenberg’s singular tech horror remains relevant

<p>The boundary-pushing auteur asks how far is too far in a smart and slimy film about sadomasochism and the potential dangers of technology</p><p>Early on in David Cronenberg’s masterpiece Videodrome, TV station programmer Max Renn (James Woods) brings radio host Nicki Brand (Debbie Harry) back to his bachelor pad for the seduction that’s been coming since they exchanged some heated words about the decline of western culture on a roundtable talkshow. She declared the “gorging on [overstimulation]” promoted by his channel Civic-TV to be a bad thing, only to concede a few seconds later that she can’t help living “in a highly excited state”. So as they enter his cluttered apartment, where most couples might put on Al Green, they instead set the mood with a videotape containing raw, context-free footage of a nude woman being flogged with a cat-o’-nine-tails by a hooded man. “I can’t believe this,” she says, but she stops Max when he offers to turn it off, purring, “No, I can take it.”</p><p>The power dynamic between these kindred sickos seesaws back and forth as she startles him by asking him to cut her shoulder with a knife – in the exact same spot Saul Tensor would give an erotic incision to his lover Caprice decades later in Cronenberg’s recent Crimes of the Future – and he then gets in touch with his inner dom while piercing her ear. On their next date, she stuns him by gently pressing a lit cigarette to her breast. Max invoked Freud in their earlier televised tete-a-tete; imagine what the good doctor would have to say about this little phallic symbol, crushed on the bosom of womanhood with ease, and yet also with enough pain to leave a scar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/04/videodrome-at-40-david-cronenberg-singular-tech-horror-remains-relevant">Continue reading...</a>

## You season four: Penn Badgley’s soapy murderfest pulls off an incredible trick

<p>The drama relocates to London, and ends up being a wild ride through bluffs, double-bluffs and its lead’s tremendous performance. After this long, it shouldn’t be so fun</p><p>It’s taken me long enough to realise it, but the Netflix series You – now entering its fourth season – is very close to being good. Although we have to be careful, throwing around words with traditional meanings such as “good”, don’t we. It’s not good, exactly, in that it’s good, but it’s very good at what it does, and I think in 2023 that’s close enough to good that we’ll take it. So: despite everything I have said about You since its inception, the Netflix series You is g – I can’t say it. It’s gooooo – I can’t. [Closes eyes, inhales deeply] it’s alright.</p><p>Where are we this time? After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/16/you-the-stalker-show-that-will-make-you-delete-your-social-media">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/07/you-on-netflix-the-awful-sociopathic-show-were-absolutely-addicted-to">LA</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/15/you-review-season-three-penn-badgley-netflix">suburbia</a>, Joe now finds himself murdering about in London, although in a way you may have to turn your brain off for: he teaches on a campus in Egham, exits on to a street in Spitalfields, then walks all the way to the expansive flat in Kensington that he lives in on a professorial salary. (Normally I don’t care too much about US productions taking egregious licenses with London geography and financial reality, but come on.) He sees a beautiful woman for less than 100th of a second through a window and falls utterly and completely in love with her in a way that somehow always ends up with a perspex cage. The point with You, though, is to just let it wash over you without thinking too hard – essentially it’s a soap, just with higher production values and an incredible face and performance at the centre of it – and the schlockiness of it has always been a feature, not a bug. No more is this evident in season four, where Joe – doing the usual growling, menacing voiceover that Penn Badgley so excels at – is faced with a cavalcade of posh English people, all sounding more English than an English person has ever sounded on screen. Obviously, at some point, someone dies. The cogs whirr into motion. Bluffs and double-bluffs. Every character could secretly be a threat. Thrills and twists await. And then, that beautiful woman wanders casually on to screen and – hello, you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/04/you-season-four-penn-badgley-london">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘There’s a savage beauty to the place’: the dark mystery of Ireland’s Connemara region

<p>The setting for Kathleen MacMahon’s new novel, The Home Scar, is a haunting expanse of lakes, bogs, heathland and mountains in County Galway</p><p>It starts at the top of a mountain. Not the novel itself, but the idea for the novel. The mountain is Errisbeg, on the coast of Connemara in County Galway. It’s an ugly lump of a thing, pocked with prickly yellow gorse and patches of swampy bog, but the landscape it commands is magnificent. The face of the mountain looks directly down on the back-to-back beaches of Dog’s Bay and Gurteen Strand. To the east is the lovely village of Roundstone. The Ballyconeely and Erislannan peninsulas are to the north-west, and beyond them lie the beginnings of the Atlantic, dotted with small islands.</p><p>So far, so normal. It’s only when you turn away from the sea and cast your eye inland that things get a little strange. The view travels across an expanse of desolation that stretches as far as the Twelve Bens mountain range in the distance. Not a thing lies between, only bog and scrub and pockets of water and the shadows of clouds travelling over the land. There’s a savage beauty to the place, but there’s also the feeling of something missing. This is a landscape strangely bereft of trees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/04/mystery-of-connemara-ireland-county-galway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Introducing the flummadiddle, a sort of cross between bread pudding, french toast and a fry-up, and an intriguing way to use up stale bread</p><p>James Ramsden’s latest cookbook, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/every-last-crumb-9781911663997">Every Last Crumb</a>, shows how bread is more than just the sum of its parts. He guides us through the life of a loaf, from a fresh, springy crumb to a tough crust, and demonstrates how, at each stage of its life, it can be made into a plethora of wildly comforting recipes. Every angle is covered, from traditional Spanish <em>salmorejo</em> sauce to quirky flummadiddle, a type of savoury bread pudding made with pork, warm spices, molasses and stale bread.</p><p>Ramsden’s flummadiddle features a whole piece of roast pork belly, but I’ve adapted it to make a lighter breakfast version using bacon and sausages, though if you do happen to have some cooked pork belly to hand, by all means shred it and add to the mix instead of the bacon and sausages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/04/how-to-turn-stale-bread-into-a-winning-savoury-pudding-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

But what was its purpose?</p><p>Nestled out of place among the fields and woods, next in a solid line after the church, manor house and farmhouse, is a derelict factory building. The cavernous shell of the main hall, with its high roof and part-open frontage, is redolent of an aircraft hangar, albeit one for a very small plane. A few desultory drums and barrels on the concrete floor testify to light use today as an agricultural store.</p><p>At the back, and down the left side, are doorways without doors. They lead into smaller rooms where there are light fittings without lights, benches unmanned, a fusebox unpowered, and window frames rimmed with icicles of grimy glass.
