It turns out, constantly taking a dooce on your audience doesn't bode well. Disney also just realized they need to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/disney-cut-7000-jobs-slashes-costs-reorganizes-rcna69817" target="_blank">slash</a> $5.5B in costs, so perhaps they decided to put the woke agenda on hold for financial reasons. </p><p>Tim Allen announced he will be returning as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in Disney's <em>Toy Story 5.</em> In case you forgot, Tim Allen did <em>not</em> voice Buzz in last year's <em>Lightyear</em>. Instead, Disney went with progressive actor Chris Evans. And it was a total disaster. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSee ya soon Woody, you are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. And off we go to a number 5! To infinity and beyond!\u201d</div> — Tim Allen (@Tim Allen)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ofctimallen/status/1623479040295456768">1675902540</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides cutting out Tim Allen, <em>Lightyear</em> also featured a controversial same-sex kiss scene. This is of course because, in 2023, no opportunity to sexualize a young audience can be passed up by our Hollywood overlords. As a result, the movie barely broke even. Yikes. </p><p>Amidst the fallout of Lightyear's dismal performance, Allen <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-allen-lightyear" target="_blank">lamented</a> the movie's lack of connection to the original character, saying,  “<em>It has no relationship to Buzz. It’s just no connection. I wish there was a better connection. [...] It just doesn’t seem to have any connection to the toy." </em></p><p>Actress Patricia Heaton also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lightyear-tim-allen-patricia-heaton" target="_blank">decried</a> the decision not to include Allen, tweeting,<em> "Tim IS Buzz! Why would they completely castrate this iconic, beloved character?"</em></p><p>We still don't have any solid answers as to why Tim Allen was stiffed. But we can infer, given that he has become an outspoken conservative over the past few years. He's previously said he "<a href="https://www.insider.com/tim-allen-liked-donald-trump-angered-critics-marc-maron-2021-3" target="_blank">liked</a>" how Trump "pissed people off," and dislikes paying taxes. Which is more than enough to get blacklisted these days.  </p><p>On the bright side, Allen's inclusion in Toy Story 5 could be signaling a new leaf of Hollywood not forcing <em>all</em> the woke on its audience. Still some woke, of course. But perhaps less. </p>

## Church of Satan Responds to Sam Smith's Grammys Performance: 'It Was Ok But We Prefer Lil Nas X'

As a refresher, Smith and Petras donned devilish costumes, were surrounded by female strippers, and sang about a man committing adultery behind his wife's back. Just your average Sunday night programming in America. </p><p>Most of us sane individuals saw this and immediately thought, "that's Satanic." Given the devil horns and all. But David Harris, a magister of the Church of Satan, told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/02/08/sam-smith-kim-petras-unholy-grammy-performance-church-satan-underwhelmed/" target="_blank">TMZ</a> the performance was "alright" and "nothing particularly special." </p><p>Harris said the imagery used by Smith and Petras is tired and has been seen by many artists. In other words, there's just so much Satanism out there that what used to be considered Satanism is no longer edgy enough to be considered Satanism. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThat entire demonic presentation at the Grammy\u2019s? Brought to you by Pfizer.\u201d</div> — Catch Up (@Catch Up)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1622485842660061184">1675665743</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Harris also addressed Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who called out the apparently-not-Satanic-enough-devil-worship. He lamented "politicians on a national stage [who] use someone's religion as a punchline."</p><p>The Church of Satan did, however, approve of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-lil-nas-vma-mandates" target="_blank">Lil Nas X's</a> "Montero" music video, and claimed it was more satanically proactive than Smith's performance. In case you've forgotten, in that music video, Lil Nas X slides down a pole to Hell before giving Satan a lap dance. The song was simultaneously released with a pair of Nikes that allegedly contained human blood.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cLil Nas X - MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) (Official Video) https://t.co/Wuu86ZPZQR\u201d</div> — i am reading all that (@i am reading all that)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1375266773646204929">1616724124</a>
</blockquote>

<p>What the Satanists really love about Lil Nas's video is how, in the end, he murders the devil and takes the throne for himself. This is in-line with the Church of Satan's assertion that everyone in their own god. So to gain the stamp of approval from the Church of Satan, you have to literally become your own personal Satan. And they're upset over "punchlines" about their "religion".  </p><p>Sir, when your religion embraces a pop star giving a lap dance to Satan as "proactive" to your cause...expect a few punchlines. At the very least. </p>

## Watch: Dude menaces Chik-Fil-A employees, yet bystanders are more concerned about stopping the guy filming it

God's chicken is the one fast food eatery where they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-australia" target="_blank">don't have meltdowns</a>. The closest we have is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chick-fil-a-chokehold" target="_blank">Chick-Fil-A employee choking out a carjacker</a>. But when you factor in this is a NYC Chick-Fil-A it makes sense. At least, I'm assuming it's NYC. There is a giant sign for "Eataly" which is an NYC restaurant. Also, my only confirmation this is a Chik-Fil-A is the narrator yelling "he's robbing the Chick-Fil-A."</p><p>Just watch the video.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/u06ZBP2SLX">pic.twitter.com/u06ZBP2SLX</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1623569276710912012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>What makes me think this is in fact New York City is the bystanders. They see a big dude menacing and attacking a bunch of women.  And instead of stopping him, they focus their attention to the guy filming the incident. HE'S the problem here. Not the guy having a meltdown and attacking people.</p><p>One of the employees even looks at security wondering if he was ever going to do security things.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f10ef" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33003942&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>My man took a break from attacking women to yell at his audience. Again, the AUDIENCE is the problem. Not the guy freaking out over a nugget order.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="8dbd5" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33003943&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Then. you have this schmuck. Yelling at the young king with his phone out remember to do it for the content. Remember, it's not the guy's fault attacking people. It's my man with his iPhone out. That's the guy at fault for "agitating" and "adding fuel to the fire."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="50cfc" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33003950&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>These people see a man attacking women, and their instinct is to let him have his episode while they yell at the people around him. The bad guy's feeling and situation garners more sympathy than the innocent people he's attacking.</p><p>If this isn't New York City, it's a pretty spot-on facsimile. Even the NYCs on alternate Earths are shitholes.</p><p><p>

## MSNBC guest calls Marjorie Taylor Greene "white trash" because anti-white attacks are a-ok on MSNBC

Turns out, the drama does stem from O'Keefe allegedly being a mean man to work for.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">SOURCE: "The board held a six and a half hour struggle session vs James where they subjected him to constant derision and insults. At the insistence of Tyrmand, O’Hara, and Hinckley;<br />— Swig 🇺🇸 (@OldRowSwig) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowSwig/status/1623528207327588352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>O'Keefe was subject to a six-hour kangaroo court where board members and employees were able to complain about him. It doesn't sound like he was given the opportunity to defend himself at all. He was just given his leave.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"It was literally a stalinesque kangaroo court trial. The thing that is so very profound to me that no one seems to grasp: John Garvey and the rest of the Board did NOTHING to stop it. Matt Tyrmand had it all scripted. All six fucking hours."<br />— Swig 🇺🇸 (@OldRowSwig) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowSwig/status/1623528210020601856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The timing of this happening after the release of the Schmizer video notwithstanding, it sounds like the coup was planned before that. The video is what gave the board members a perfect opportunity.</p><p>I would assume cooler heads will prevail. There is no way that Project Veritas board members believe there would be a Project Veritas left if they removed James O'Keefe as the head of the company he founded. And that's without getting into the shady-natured and bullsh*t reasons they appear to be doing so. </p><p>Though, the PV board members would hardly be the first "conservatives" in power to not know what the f*ck they are doing. They might honest to God believe the company would survive this. Good luck with that.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Guy with a sweet mullet gets DROPPED using a slur against the wrong hockey fan, and then it gets embarrassing

You're probably wondering how I got into this situation."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>When your corny uncle or grandpappy tells you that he went to a fight and a hockey game broke out, it's a joke about how common the fisticuffs are. But he's talking fisticuffs between hockey players on the ice. Now in these modern times, it pops off in the stands as well. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hockey-crowd-brawl-finger" target="_blank">One dude even had a finger bit off</a>.</p><p>Unclear is what started this disagreement. Our scene opens on some dude with a sweet-ass mullet puffing his chest out and trying to sound tough. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website believe that when there is a dude with a sweet-ass mullet, the dude with the sweet-ass mullet is usually in the right.</p><p>But I can't shake the suspicion he may have been the aggressor here.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Went to my first <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Stars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Stars</a> game of the season! Saw my first NHL fight 🥊 <a href="https://twitter.com/MitchellRenz365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MitchellRenz365</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nic_rohloff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nic_rohloff</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatSiepmanNFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PatSiepmanNFL</a> <a href="https://t.co/7KRChHDmII">pic.twitter.com/7KRChHDmII</a><br />— Jeremy Beadling (@JeremyChuggs) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyChuggs/status/1623544255133147136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Then came the punch, after mullet dude called the other guy a, quote, "dumb ass n***a." Obviously, not a racial thing since the dude it was directed to is also what critics call a Caucasian. But as it turns out, even dropping a "soft g" and even in the south...white people? Don't care much for the word either.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3d70b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33002506&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Then came the embarrassing part. His girlfriend needed to save him. She gets points for being a true ride-or-die. She didn't hesitate for a second before she started throwing hands. But I'd rather my girl <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-islanders-proposal" target="_blank">reject me as I propose to her shirtless</a> than have her try to save me from a beat down.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="216fb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33002507&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Here is hoping cooler heads prevailed. Mullet Dude calmed down, recognized where mistakes were made, and issued an apology. Then everyone had a beer together and continued to enjoy some hockey. As long as we get that sweet, sweet content, whatever happens after the video ends is for the players involved to discuss amongst themselves.</p><p><p>

## 'He has to deny it': Pamela Anderson doubles down on allegation Tim Allen whipped it out in front of her

The tell-all book author is now doubling down on her accusation the actor flashed his power tool in a comical -- but obviously inappropriate -- fashion. Still no word on if Allen grunted and said "MORE POWER" when he allegedly did what he's alleged to have done.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Let's recap. Anderson, a former Playboy centerfold (that means naked) has a tell-all book out where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pamela-anderson-tim-allen-book" target="_blank">she claims Allen flashed her his dingly dangly</a> and said, quote, "it was only fair because he had seen [Anderson] naked. Now we’re even." Allen of course denied the allegations ever happened. After the alleged incident, Anderson made twenty-two more appearances on the show.</p><p>Haters thought they had Allen dead to rights when video "surfaced" of Allen in a kilt showing TV wife Patricia Richardson what was under it. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-allen-tv-wife" target="_blank">But she issued a statement</a> explaining what boxer shorts and a live studio audience were.</p><p>Anderson now tells ET that there is no way anyone could have possibly made up such a story. Why would someone do that?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><blockquote><strong></strong>He has to deny it because look at the times we're in. If he said, "Oh yeah, I did that," he'd be ... a lot of these stories are just the tip of the iceberg.</blockquote><p>Look at the times we're in, that Pamela Anderson <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pamela-anderson-me-too" target="_blank">still doesn't believe in</a> and has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-pamela-anderson-knocks-third-wave-feminism-says-its-gone-too-far" target="_blank">been criticizing for four years</a>. Those times. The #MeToo times when she has been telling actresses to use common sense.</p><p>It's your basic "she said/he said/she keeps saying about him and other people because she has a book to sell" situation. We may never know the truth on if someone on the set of Home Improvement rocked out with their c*ck out."</p><p>Though "rock out with your c*ck out" would be more of a Tommy Lee thing. And a video I regret watching.</p><p><p>

## James O'Keefe might be REMOVED from Project Veritas, the internet has a guess as to the pathetic reason why

They were talking...because James O' Keefe wasn't in it. It turns out, the PV Board of Directors have put O'Keefe on paid leave while deciding whether they should keep him --- James O' Keefe -- as the head of Project Veritas.</p><p>The company released a statement about the news/rumor without mentioning O'Keefe. However, they didn't attempt to blame corporate media.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Project Veritas’ Official Response to Today’s News Reports<br /><br />Despite what the Corporate Media tries to portray about our organization, know this: We have never been more motivated and dedicated to our mission than now. <a href="https://t.co/sB7Cz97b5M">pic.twitter.com/sB7Cz97b5M</a><br />— Project Veritas (@Project_Veritas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Project_Veritas/status/1623478024841699329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The statement reads, “like all newsrooms at this stage, the Project Veritas Board of Directors and Management are constantly evaluating what the best path forward is for the organization" where "there are 65+ employees at Project Veritas dedicated to continuing the mission to expose corruption, dishonesty, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions."</p><p>Also, to their supporters, "we hear you, we care about you.” Though, not enough to address the issue at hand.</p><p>A leftist gossip rag today says, allegedly, according to people speaking on the condition of anonymity, O'Keefe might be a mean person to work for. Others, more accurately in my assessment, question the timing. O'Keefe <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-director-mutatiing" target="_blank">made a lot of news</a> in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-pharma-director-bananas" target="_blank">the past few weeks</a> with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-youtube-executive-locked-out" target="_blank">an expose of a company</a> that rhymes with Schmizer. Now...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The timing of James O'Keefe being put on paid leave by the Project Veritas Board after he exposes a Pfizer Doctor and Executive talking about mutating the Covid Virus to make more vaccines... <br /><br />What a coincidence...<br />— Matt Couch (@RealMattCouch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealMattCouch/status/1623525525162541058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">How much are Project Veritas board members being paid by Pfizer to remove James O’Keefe?<br /><br />He’s doing the job the legacy media is refusing to do, I stand with James.<br />— Mindy Robinson 🇺🇸 (@iheartmindy) <a href="https://twitter.com/iheartmindy/status/1623516256673624070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The timing is not hard to Pfigure out. <a href="https://t.co/4NZdHzuAH1">https://t.co/4NZdHzuAH1</a><br />— Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BonillaJL/status/1623520366801874948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">They’re coming after James O’Keefe right after he took down Pfizer <br /><br />We can all see what’s going on here<br /><br />Stand with <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JamesOKeefeIII</a>! <a href="https://t.co/akGGwV2ZvM">https://t.co/akGGwV2ZvM</a><br />— Jack Posobiec 🇺🇸 (@JackPosobiec) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1623482050165497857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>There is one of two things at play here. The first is that James O'Keefe is going DEEP undercover. This is going to be PV's most explosive expose of the left yet. And this story is but one of many chess pieces being moved.</p><p>The second is that there is a lawsuit from SCHMIZER that the public is not aware of yet, and the board of directors are a bunch of cowards.</p><p><p>
