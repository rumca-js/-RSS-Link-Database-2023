You can also listen and share clips to a specific part of the podcast audio, simply by highlighting the text of that part. Currently there are just over 25k podcast episodes and I\u2019m adding a lot more in the coming weeks (yes my GPU bill is painful).<p>In order to monetize it, I\u2019m building a sponsorship database to help sponsors find podcasts and vice versa. This will be sold in the form of a $99/month \u201cPodText Business\u201d subscription. I bet I could charge a lot more to large sponsors but I\u2019ll tweak that as I talk to potential customers.<p>Right now the UI is very bare bones (doesn\u2019t even have pagination) but I\u2019ll polish it once the data pipeline is working well. Please let me know if you run into any bugs or have any questions about the site or business model.<p>PS: I'm a regular on HN using my real name but can't post under that account since my employer will fire me if they found out about this project :-)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

We\u2019re excited to share it with HN! Our Github is  <a href=\"https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces\">https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces</a>, our website is <a href=\"https://www.activepieces.com/\">https://www.activepieces.com/</a> and there\u2019s a video that shows how to build a Pipedrive + Slack + Email flow in 2 minutes at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4TI6jGBwM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4TI6jGBwM</a><p>When we used automation tools like Zapier at my previous job, we found that it became incredibly expensive very quickly, and we had only too few options to self-host business automation when data had to reside on prem.<p>There are open-source automation tools that we think are too technical like Huginn and Node-RED or developed under less permissive open source licenses like N8n.<p>So we decided to build an open source automation tool under a permissive license (MIT) with a simple user experience that doesn\u2019t require technical knowledge, and can be self-hosted. We plan to make money from the cloud version and a future enterprise edition with advanced features - maybe advanced roles and permissions.<p>The current version includes a visual designer for automation flows which can run on schedules (Cron), by Webhooks, or by triggers from external apps\u201425 apps and counting, including Stripe, Calendly, Google Sheets and others (we\u2019re building these rapidly).<p>The app is customizable, you can add custom steps using HTTP requests or you can write Node.js code and bring in your npm packages.<p>If you\u2019re curious about how it works, here are the docs: <a href=\"https://www.activepieces.com/docs\">https://www.activepieces.com/docs</a><p>We\u2019d love to hear HN\u2019s thoughts on what we\u2019re building!<p>Thanks.</p>\n<hr

Ideally I'd like something that requires rigor, with a focus on software architecture or algorithms/optimization. I'd also like to minimize the type of workplace politics I've experienced at FAANG. I'm open to suggestions that don't exclusively have to do with software. Part of me is tired of spending so much of my life in front of a computer.<p>Here are some disorganized ideas that might give a sense of my interests:<p>- Cryptography and security (not cryptocurrency/blockchain): I have a math background and I was always an algebra/discrete math person, so this seems a potential fit.<p>- Formal verification / theorem proving<p>- Open messaging standards (e.g., Matrix): I find the current state with siloed proprietary messengers a travesty<p>- Open repositories of knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap)<p>- \"User-empowering\" software (e.g., Emacs, Ableton Live)<p>- Distributed systems<p>- Programming language development (compilers, libraries)<p>- Graphics (though the gaming industry isn't exactly the place to recover from burnout)<p>- Research in cognitive science, psychedelics (lots of hype here though), complex systems, physics<p>- Studying music composition or audio engineering<p>- Helping out with homelessness, loneliness, the elderly or disabled</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34719088\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34719088</a></p>\n<p>Points: 40</p>\n<p># Comments: 33</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34719088", "date_published": "2023-02-09 02:39:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "My 2022 self was wrong about meditation, monitors, and sleep", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://guzey.com/2022-lessons/\">https://guzey.com/2022-lessons/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34717876\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34717876</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://guzey.com/2022-lessons/", "date_published": "2023-02-09 00:25:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Andrej Karpathy Is Joining OpenAI Again", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1623476659369443328\">https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1623476659369443328</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34717866\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34717866</a></p>\n<p>Points: 64</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "link": "https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1623476659369443328", "date_published": "2023-02-09 00:24:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The entire prompt of Microsoft Bing Chat", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kliu128/status/1623472922374574080\">https://twitter.com/kliu128/status/1623472922374574080</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34717702\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34717702</a></p>\n<p>Points: 67</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>", "link": "https://twitter.com/kliu128/status/1623472922374574080", "date_published": "2023-02-09 00:09:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
