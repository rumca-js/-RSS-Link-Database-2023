<p>Twitter is making millions of dollars from just a handful of some of its most infamous users, according to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/02/09/yahoo-layoffs-2023-tech-media-companies"><ins>new report</ins></a>. New research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimates that Twitter “will generate up to $19 million a year in advertising revenue” from just 10 accounts that were once banned from the platform.</p><p>The report looked at the current engagement with 10 accounts that were previously banned for “ for “publishing hateful content and dangerous conspiracies.” The accounts were reinstated after Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. The group includes a number of high-profile accounts associated with extremism and conspiracy theories, including those belonging to influencer Andrew Tate, <em>Daily Stormer</em> founder Andrew Anglin, prominent antivaxxer Robert Malone and the Gateway Pundit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In order to estimate their reach and engagement, CCDH analyzed nearly 10,000 tweets from these accounts during a 47-day period in December and January. According to their analysis, “on an average day, tweets from the ten accounts received a combined total of 54 million impressions,” they write. “Projecting this average across 365 days, the accounts can be  expected to reach nearly 20 billion impressions over the course of a year.”</p><p>In order to determine how much ad revenue those impressions might generate for Twitter, CCDH says it created three new Twitter accounts that followed only the 10 users named in the report. The authors found that ads appeared about once every 6.7 tweets. Then, using data from analytics firm Brandwatch, which estimates that “Twitter ads cost an average of $6.46 per 1,000 impressions,” CCDH came up with “a total figure of up to $19 million in estimated annual ad revenues across the accounts.”</p><p>While the estimates aren’t a precise accounting of how much Twitter might be making from these users, it demonstrates how valuable a small number of highly polarizing accounts can be for the platform. It also underscores how much more Twitter stands to gain by bringing back even more controversial users.</p><p>All of the accounts named in the report were once permanently banned from twitter, but were reinstated after Musk said he would offer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-engineers-fired-holiday-pay-amnesty-elon-musk-210356513.html"><ins>“general amnesty”</ins></a> to users who hadn’t broken the law. Twitter also recently announced plans to allow even more previously banned users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-opens-public-appeals-for-suspended-accounts-203824268.html"><ins>to appeal</ins></a> their suspensions.</p><p>At the same time, Twitter’s advertising business has taken <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html"><ins>a major hit</ins></a> since Musk’s takeover. A number of high profile advertisers have pulled back from the platform, and revenue is down as much as 40 percent, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1615519936805482496"><ins>reporting from</ins></a><em>Platformer.</em></p><p>The report also points out several instances when ads from prominent advertisers appeared adjacent to offensive and inflammatory posts from these users. For example, a Prime Video ad directly underneath a tweet from Andrew Anglin that states “the only career a woman is actually capable of on merit is prostitution.” The report also highlights an ad from the NFL, which appeared directly underneath a tweet misinformation about  COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>“This work confirms that Twitter has been displaying ads next to every one of the toxic accounts we have investigated, despite the fact that the individuals behind them are known to promote hateful views and falsehoods,” CCDH writes.</p>

## SpaceX's first attempt to fire all 33 Starship engines at once ends with mixed results

<p>SpaceX has completed its first full static fire test for Starship, if not quite in a way that makes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-will-attempt-starship-orbital-test-in-march-says-elon-musk-195410384.html">first orbital test flight next month</a> sound realistic. The company hoped to fire all 33 Raptor engines at once, but Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1623793909959901184">noted </a>that two engines didn't make it — the mission team shut off one before startup, while the other &quot;stopped itself.&quot; The 31 that did fire lasted the full duration, however, and Musk claims that's enough to reach orbit.</p><p>While SpaceX's last static fire testing in November was a success, the company only ignited 14 of the booster's Raptor engines. It also to send Starship on multiple successful test flights before it can ferry astronauts to and from the Moon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e9c72511edcc45afb8ff891e92444c8a"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>As company president Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/spacex-prepares-test-fire-all-starship-engines-at-once.html">said</a> at the FAA's annual Commercial Space Transportation conference, Starship has to fly &quot;hundreds of flights before [it flies] people.&quot; She also reminded everyone that Starship's first flight &quot;is really a test flight&quot; and that &quot;the real goal [for it] is to not blow up the launch pad.&quot;</p><p>In mid-2022, SpaceX conducted a test that was designed to simultaneously spin up all 33 engines on the Super Heavy's Booster 7 prototype. The company was aiming to preview the vehicle's start-up sequence, but the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-booster-explosion-074522654.html">booster caught fire</a> during the process at its Boca Chica, Texas facility. SpaceX chief Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1546713443943825408">revealed</a> on Twitter that the issue that caused the explosion was &quot;specific to the engine spin start test,&quot; because the Raptor engine has a complex start sequence.&nbsp;</p>

## SpaceX doesn't want Ukraine using Starlink to control military drones

<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX may be willing to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-strikes-deal-with-space-x-to-receive-over-10000-more-starlink-antennas-143245809.html">supply Ukraine with Starlink service</a> as it repels the Russian invasion, but it's not thrilled with every use of the satellite internet technology. Operating chief Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/09/starlink-restricts-internet-drones-ukraine/">tells guests</a> at a Federal Aviation Administration conference that SpaceX objects to reported uses of Starlink to control military drones. While the company doesn't mind troops using satellite broadband for communication, it doesn't mean for the platform to be used for &quot;offensive purposes,&quot; Shotwell says.</p><p>The executive adds that SpaceX can limit Ukraine's ability to use Starlink with combat drones, and has already done so. The company hasn't explained how it curbs use in the field.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ukraine says it's not alarmed. National security council secretary Oleksiy Danilov tells <em>The Washington Post</em> the country doesn't rely solely on Starlink for military operations, and may only need to &quot;change the means of attack&quot; in some cases. Interior ministry advisor Anton Gerahchenko, meanwhile, argues that Ukraine &quot;liberate[s]&quot; rather than attacking, and that Starlink has saved &quot;hundreds of thousands of lives.&quot;</p><p>Starlink has proved important to life in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began last year. The country uses the service to connect civilians, government agencies and military units that can't rely on terrestrial internet access. For drones, this could let Ukraine coordinate reconnaissance flights, long-distance targeting and bomb attacks.</p><p>SpaceX has a contentious relationship with Ukraine. The firm was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sends-more-starlink-terminals-223512511.html">quick to provide Starlink terminals</a> soon after the war began, albeit with US government help. Musk complained that it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-ukraine-funding-defense-department-135027598.html">becoming too expensive</a> to fund service indefinitely, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-spacex-keep-funding-ukraine-starlink-satellite-internet-075616416.html">changed his mind</a> soon after. And while Ukraine struck a deal in December to get <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-strikes-deal-with-space-x-to-receive-over-10000-more-starlink-antennas-143245809.html">thousands more terminals</a> with EU assistance, that came just weeks after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-price-hike-in-ukraine-144623737.html">steep price hike</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-will-get-facebook-and-instagram-accounts-back-221702241.html">As promised</a>, Meta has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trumps-facebook-instagram-accounts-are-back-rcna69946">restored</a> former president Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> accounts, two years after it suspended him from both platforms. The company previously said it would apply extra &quot;guardrails&quot; to his accounts to &quot;deter repeat offenses.&quot;</p><p>Meta, like Twitter and other services, kicked Trump off of its platforms in January 2021 after he praised those participating in the Capitol Hill insurrection. The company initially locked the accounts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-locks-out-trump-24-hours-014550117.html">for 24 hours</a> over two policy violations before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html">suspended him indefinitely</a>. Meta's Oversight Board was among those who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">criticized</a> the handling of the ban.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company later said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-could-be-back-on-facebook-in-time-for-primaries-164200140.html">Trump's accounts would remain suspended for two years</a>, after which it would reassess things. In late January, it emerged that Trump would soon regain access to the platforms, not long after it was reported that he had pushed Meta to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-reportedly-asked-meta-to-reinstate-his-facebook-account-181751974.html">restore his accounts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2:30PM ET, Trump, who is running for the White House for a third time, had not posted anything on either platform. He has an agreement with his &quot;free speech&quot; app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/truth%20social/">Truth Social</a>, whereby he has to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/truth-social-trump-posts-6-hours-early.html">share social media posts there first</a> and can't plop them anywhere else for at least six hours. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">restored Trump's account on its service</a> late last year, but he hasn't returned to what was once his favored social media platform either.

## 1Password will soon skip passwords in favor of passkeys

<p>1Password is going all-in on passkeys starting this summer, as the company announced today that its users would soon have the option of using passwordless logins. The move follows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-passkey-support-android-chrome-164017230.html">Google's</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-passkeys-offer-even-better-protection-for-you-passwords-190334447.html">Apple’s</a> passkey support starting last year.</p><p>Passkeys can replace passwords by providing unique digital keys stored locally on your device. They are much less susceptible to theft in the case of data breaches or phishing attempts and can integrate with your device’s biometric security — including fingerprints and facial logins. 1Password’s passkey support will be “built on the same security foundation” as secret keys, the long recovery codes platforms generate as a fallback sign-in option.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“All you’ll ever need to sign in to 1Password, unlock your vaults, and securely access your data is your one passkey,” the company said in a <a href="https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-with-passkeys/">blog post</a>. “More and more sites and services are adding passkey support every week, but whether you’re first in line to start using them, or you need to rely on passwords for a while longer, we’ve got you covered.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/3d0e2860-a8ad-11ed-9fff-5730bc4274bf" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>“Unlike user-created passwords, passkeys are strong and unique by default. They’re generated and stored on your devices, and they’re never shared with our cloud service,” the company said. “Passkeys are also resistant to phishing, and they have a full 256 bits of entropy to prevent cracking — providing even more protection than our Secret Key. They’re safeguarded by biometrics and hardware-level security. And we’re building them to be portable between all your devices and platforms.”</p>

<p>It's easy for students to search the web when working on assignments, but Microsoft now wants to teach those students how to spot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bans-russia-state-media-193720376.html">misinformation</a> and otherwise think critically. In addition to an existing Search Coach, Microsoft is <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2023/02/reimagine-personalized-learning-with-new-category-of-tools-from-microsoft-education">introducing</a> a Search Progress feature in Teams for Education that helps teachers foster healthy online research habits through practice work. Educators can not only require a certain number of sources for an assignment, but check to see that students are searching responsibly — they'll know if pupils are only clicking the first site in the results, or using filters like NewsGuard to check source quality. Students can show their reasoning and work before turning in a project, too.</p><p>The Progress tool bolsters Search Coach (shown below), which encourages students using Teams to both search more precisely and watch out for falsehoods. They can limit searches to certain domains (such as .gov or .edu), date ranges and file types. They can even pass queries through fact checking sites to learn if a claim holds up under scrutiny. Bing's safe search is enabled by default, and the results are ad-free. Teachers can also use search trends to refine their lessons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ea8d81beaf714e98a5fc90c778b51ddf"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Search Progress will be available in preview form later in the year. Search Coach is already available in Teams worldwide. Both features will work with over 50 languages, Microsoft says.</p><p>Microsoft also wants to improve students' overall reading skills. The company's Reading Coach will be available in the Immersive Readers for Word Online, OneNote, Teams Assignments, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/minecraft-education-edition-chrome-os-130019234.html"><em>Minecraft Education</em></a> and other platforms, giving students more reading fluency experience both online and in the apps they use. Reading Progress, meanwhile, will add comprehension questions to be sure kids truly understand what they read. Both upgrades will be available later this year.</p>

<p>Microsoft announced new AI-powered classroom tools today. The company sees its new “Learning Accelerators” as helping students sharpen their speaking and math skills — while making teachers’ jobs a little easier — as children prepare for an even more technologically enhanced world.</p><p>Speaker Progress is a new AI classroom tool for teachers. Microsoft says it saves them time by “streamlining the process of creating, reviewing, and analyzing speaking and presentation assignments for students, groups, and classrooms.” It can provide tidy summaries of presentation-based skills while highlighting areas to improve. Additionally, it lets teachers review student recordings, identify their needs and track progress.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will be a companion for Speaker Coach, an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-hybrid-meetings-features-apple-carplay-intelligent-cameras-164625137.html">existing feature</a> Microsoft launched in 2021 that provides one-on-one speaking guidance and feedback. For example, it uses AI to give real-time pointers on pacing, pitch and filler words. “Speaker Coach is one of those tools that kind of was a lightbulb tool for a lot of students that I’ve worked with,” said an unnamed teacher in a Microsoft launch video. “Being able to practice and get real-time feedback is where Speaker Coach really comes in and helps our students, and it even helps us as adults.”</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot from Microsoft Teams, with a student using the Speaker Coach feature to improve their speaking skills.

Neither occupant was in the driver's seat when they were found, leading to questions about the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/autopilot/"><ins>Autopilot</ins></a>.</p><p>Based on information provided by Tesla, the NTSB <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Document/docBLOB?ID=15049832&amp;FileExtension=pdf&amp;FileName=HIR2302-Rel.pdf"><ins>found</ins></a> (PDF) that the car's rapid acceleration from 39MPH to 67MPH two seconds before the crash and a loss of control of the EV was likely due to &quot;impairment from alcohol intoxication in combination with the effects of two sedating antihistamines, resulting in a roadway departure, tree impact and post-crash fire.&quot; The NTSB says data indicated that Autopilot had not been employed &quot;at any time during this ownership period of the vehicle.&quot; Investigators did not find any &quot;evidence of mechanical deficiencies&quot; that could have contributed to or caused the crash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the occupants was found in the front passenger seat, while the other was in the rear. It's presumed that the driver was in the back seat because he was trying to escape. Security footage showed that the men were in the front seats as they set off, while data showed that both front seatbelts were buckled at the time of the crash — the car left the road around 550 feet from the driver's home. The men died as a result of the collision and post-crash battery fire.</p>

As it’s Fox’s year, you can watch the game on local Fox broadcast stations and on Fox channels offered through your cable or satellite TV provider, including Fox Sports 1 and the Spanish-language Fox Desportes.

## Lucid tries to keep pace with rivals with a $7,500 'EV credit'

## Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Photo and video take center stage

<p>Samsung's Ultra branding is typically reserved for devices that pack as many high-end features as you can fit in a single gadget. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS9idXkvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS01MTJnYi10LW1vYmlsZS1zbS1zOTE4dXprZnhhdS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZkNTE2NGUzLWU2ODItNGU5YS1iOGNiLWEwODIwNmFhZGZjYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUWFH3HoL-KrcEyz4qFayNADiVYUnJ5ojXapnTXDV3ll&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra-512gb-t-mobile-sm-s918uzkfxau%2F">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> starts at $1,200 and has a big, beautiful OLED screen, a new chip with even better performance, improved cameras and some revamped software. And, of course, there’s a built-in S Pen for all your drawing and notetaking needs. So while that sentiment still generally rings true for the new S23 Ultra, the company's latest flagship phone doesn't look or function all that differently from last year's.</p><h2>Display and design: You'll need to squint to spot the changes</h2><p>While the standard S23 and S23+ got a facelift this year, the Ultra appears to be a carbon copy of its predecessor — unless you look real close. You get a big 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a 3,088 x 1,440 resolution. And it looks awesome, even if those specs haven't changed much from the previous model. Colors are dazzling and brightness tops out a stunning 1,750 nits, with a typical max brightness of around 1,000 nits in my testing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="57c5de7d04df4907b504667108daf37d"></div><p>The rest of the phone is a nice combo of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and Samsung's durable Armor Aluminum. There are a few minor tweaks to the chassis, including slightly less curved edges on the screen to help prevent accidental touches. That said, I never really had an issue with that on last year's phone. The S23 Ultra's frame is also a bit flatter, which makes the whole thing feel boxier. And thanks to Samsung's continued focus on sustainability, small elements of the phone like the lock button are made from ocean-bound plastic. But that's about it. So, unless you're already familiar with the S23 Ultra's new color options (which include cream, lavender, green and black), even when you look at the S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra side-by-side, it's almost impossible to tell them apart.</p><h2>Performance: New chip means more speed</h2><p>The S23 Ultra is one of the first phones on the market to feature a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. However, Samsung didn't stop there. It worked with Qualcomm to create a custom version of the processor just for Galaxy phones. So what does that get you? Simply, a wealth of speed. In tests, the S23 Ultra posted multi-core scores in Geekbench 5 that were 40% higher than what we got from last year's phone. That's a huge jump, so it probably isn't a surprise when I tell you that everything feels smooth – apps, games, you name it.</p><figure><img alt="While the specs haven't changed much from last year, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's 6.8-inch 120Hz AMOLED display is still easily one of the best smartphone screens on the market. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/54f98de0-a87e-11ed-afd1-54c1e8d571fc" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now I should mention that the custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy platform that Samsung uses has a clock speed that's only around 150 MHz higher than the standard chip, which honestly, isn't a difference most people (including me) can discern in normal use. However, one of the biggest changes for 2023 is that every version of this year's Ultra will feature a Snapdragon chip, so people outside North America won't be saddled with a less powerful Exynos processor like in previous years. The base model features 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, but if you jump to the 512GB or 1TB storage options you get 12GB of memory.</p><h2>Software: One UI 5.1 is nice, but not essential</h2><p>Alongside the debut of the Galaxy S23 line, Samsung is also introducing One UI 5.1 which features some handy tweaks and customizations. That said, a number of additions like the new personalization options on the lock screen or a wider palette for the UI's accent colors are sort of things we've seen before in iOS 16 or Android 13's Material You. You can even do things like add info to the lock screen so it's easier for people to return your device to you if you lose it. However, out of the box, our review unit came with a message that said "Hi help me" which seems more like a cry for attention than an attempt to provide assistance.</p><figure><img alt="While there aren't any new features for 2023, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra still features a built-in S Pen along with a ton of handy drawing, notetaking and content creation tools. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/8c5faee0-a87e-11ed-bbfa-64d6f25d0e4a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung is also making it easier to create custom stickers from your photos, which you can do by simply long pressing on an object and then dragging it to another app for easy sharing. Unfortunately, some subjects are easier to clip than others. Faces and animals tend to work relatively well, but other things like flowers can often end up looking a bit off, so your results may vary. There's also a new Modes and Routines section in the menu that lets the phone adjust multiple settings for specific activities like exercising or relaxing. But aside from the Sleep mode option, I didn't find this new functionality all that useful. When I work out, all I need to do is find some good music and I'm ready to go.</p><p>Unfortunately, while the S23 Ultra comes with an S Pen and a handy storage slot, there aren't really any new notetaking or drawing features, which is kind of a shame. Samsung's top-end handset is still unmatched when it comes to stylus support on phones, so I wish there was something, anything new to mess around with. But I must admit even I'm struggling to think of a major feature I'd really like to see added.</p><h2>Cameras: More pixels better?</h2><figure><img alt="New for this year on the S23 Ultra is a huge 200MP sensor for the phone's main camera. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c92208f0-a87e-11ed-a7f7-ff81197607bc" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The biggest upgrade on the S23 Ultra is its new 200MP main sensor, which features twice as many pixels as before. At Samsung Unpacked, the company showed off snippets of short films from not one, but two, big-name directors to really drive home the phone's new cinematic capabilities. It sounds impressive, but in practice, it takes a bit of effort to really make the most of that new sensor.</p><p>In normal use, the S23 Ultra uses 16-to-1 pixel-binning to help gather more light and produce sharp, colorful images without the need for extra-large file sizes. And in most situations, it produces better-looking pics too. When I used the S23 Ultra to shoot photos of some pizza (which was extremely tasty might I add), images taken using the default 12MP mode featured more accurate colors and better details than those captured with the sensor's full 200 megapixels. In the right conditions activating the sensor’s full resolution may allow you to capture finer textures on some subjects, but you’ll need to zoom in to see them.</p><figure><img alt="While the phone defaults to a 12MP setting for standard photos, you can easily change the camera's resolution to shoot 50MP or full 200MP pics. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/eb27c070-a87e-11ed-bfde-7490ec1f297c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now part of this is because it seems Samsung's object detection and optimizer doesn't work in 200MP mode, but there were also noticeable differences in white balance and sharpness. On one hand that makes sense because pro photographers often prefer images with flatter color profiles which makes post-processing a bit easier. But that also means unless you're editing everything you shoot in an app like Lightroom or Photoshop, you're better off sticking with the regular 12MP setting. This is what I mean when I say you need to work to get the most out of the S23's new camera, and it applies to other stuff like Samsung's Expert Raw app too.</p><p>Designed for more advanced photographers, Expert Raw has a much wider array of settings and tools to tweak every aspect of your shot, from shutter speed, to exposure compensation and more. You also get a new astrophotography mode so you can take better pics of the night sky, that is unless you live in the city like I do. That's because between light pollution and cloudy skies, I couldn't get a single photo with the astrophotography mode that I was really proud of. And I even used a tripod to make sure things were super stable.</p><p>It's a similar story when it comes to video, where the S23 Ultra's improved OIS is a welcome addition for reducing shakes and vibrations while recording. But then there's the new 8K/30 fps mode (up from 8K/24 fps last year) which is nice because there's no more 2X crop like you got on the S22 Ultra. But at the same time, who records home movies in 8K, let alone has the proper display to watch those clips at full resolution? Sure, it's nice to be able to crop in when you want some extra detail. But this feels like overkill, especially when you consider that the file size for a two-minute 8K/30 FPS video is over one gigabyte, which means you're gonna run out of storage <em>real</em> fast.</p><p>At least when it comes to selfies, the phone has a new 12MP camera with dual pixel autofocus, and its pics look great despite a sensor that actually features a lower resolution than on the previous model. The 12 MP ultrawide cam and the two telephoto lenses (3x and 10x) are largely the same, which feels like a missed opportunity because that 10x optical zoom is still my favorite lens on the phone.</p><h2>Battery life: Just great</h2><figure><img alt="The bottom of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra features a USB-C port for charging and data transfer, one of the phone's stereo speakers and a storage slot for Samsung's S Pen. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/1e207530-a87f-11ed-a71f-3c0d7e790f41" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>While the S23 Ultra's smaller siblings both got upgrades in battery capacity, Samsung's flagship stayed pat at 5,000 mAh. But that's ok because there's plenty of juice to go around. On our video rundown test, the S23 Ultra lasted an impressive 19 hours and 26 minutes, which is similar to the OnePlus 11 (19:45), though not quite as good as the iPhone 14 Plus' 21:17. And that was with the phone's adaptive refresh rate turned on.</p><p>In the real world, you're looking at more than all-day battery life. Even on a day when I was doing heavy benchmarking and playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/niantic-nba-all-world-hands-on-bringing-gamers-back-to-the-streets-170037794.html"><em>NBA All-World</em></a> (which really gulps electrons due to constant use of GPS), I still had 25% battery left at the end of the day. And on days with more moderate usage, I often had 40% or more in the tank when midnight rolled around.</p><p>All this means you don't really need to worry about the phone dying during the day, which is a good thing because that gives the S23 Ultra leeway to donate some charge to other devices via Samsung's Power Share feature (aka reverse wireless charging). And with 45-watt wired charging, you can refuel the phone in a jiffy too.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="For those who want a truly premium Android phone, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is hard to beat. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/14e65b20-a87e-11ed-a6b7-0cbcfb78c833" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The tricky thing about recommending the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS9idXkvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS01MTJnYi10LW1vYmlsZS1zbS1zOTE4dXprZnhhdS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZkNTE2NGUzLWU2ODItNGU5YS1iOGNiLWEwODIwNmFhZGZjYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUWFH3HoL-KrcEyz4qFayNADiVYUnJ5ojXapnTXDV3ll&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra-512gb-t-mobile-sm-s918uzkfxau%2F">S23 Ultra</a> is that it's everything a super premium phone should be. It's got a gorgeous display, a great build and more power than you know what to do with. However, starting at $1,200, it's also really expensive and it's not that much better than last year's offering. I have no doubt you can film Hollywood-grade movies using its new 200MP sensor. But it's important to remember that even in Samsung's promos, we're talking about a crew with decades of experience, not to mention additional equipment like external mics, camera cages, gimbals and more. The S23 Ultra's camera has tons of potential, but it takes more than just a casual familiarity to make those features glow.</p><p>For those wondering if they should trade in their current handset after only a year: No, it's just not worth it. If you're simply looking for a premium device and don't care about taking notes with a stylus, I'd argue that the Pixel 7 Pro is a better value. But if you have an older phone and are looking for a major upgrade, the S23 Ultra is unlike any other Android phone on sale today. And with its fancy new sensor, Samsung's latest flagship might be the closest thing you can get to a pro-grade camera in a phone, just as long as you're willing to polish your content in post.</p>

## TP-Link's Tapo robot vacuums start at $230

<p>TP-Link briefly <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230105005297/en/TP-Link-Vastly-Expands-Smart-Home-Lineup-With-Tapo-Full-Home-Security-Solutions-Tapo-Robot-Vacuums-and-Various-Matter-Compatible-Products">teased</a> its entry into robot vacuums at CES, but today the company released more detail on its first pair of budget-minded cleaning machines. The Tapo RV10 is a $250 vacuum / mop combo, while the Tapo RV10 Lite cuts the mop, doubles the dustbin size and saves you $20.</p><p>Both models use gyroscope-based “zig-zag path planning,” which the company says will clean your floor more efficiently than random-path vacuums. In addition, the machines offer four suction levels (quiet, standard, turbo and max) with a maximum of 2,000Pa suction power. They also include noise suppression to keep the sound as low as 53dB in quiet mode. Both devices work with the Tapo app for iOS and Android; Alexa and Google Assistant voice control are also supported.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Marketing image (on white background) of a TP-Link robot vacuum / mop.

Additionally, the RV10 only has a 400ml dustbin, presumably to make room for its mopping hardware; the RV10 Lite’s bin doubles the size at 800ml.</p><p>The vacuums each have a 2,600mAh battery, adding up to an estimated three hours of cleaning per charge. TP-Link says if their batteries get low before finishing, they’ll dock automatically, recharge and pick up where they left off.</p><p>The vacuums are available today on Amazon. The Tapo RV10 costs $250, while the Tapo RV10 Lite is $230.</p>

## The Morning After: Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown begins

<p>Netflix is rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-account-sharing-rollout-countries-202340036.html">changes to account sharing </a>in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain after trialing the change in Latin America. If you live in one of these countries, you must set a primary location for where you use it. Then, if you have friends or family who want to share your account, you'll have to subscribe to either the Standard or Premium tier and pay a fee ($8 in Canada and New Zealand, €4 in Portugal and €6 in Spain) for up to two extra users outside of your home.</p><p>In Netflix’s words, “Today, over 100 million households are sharing accounts – impacting our ability to invest in great new TV and films.” It's not clear how new regions will take to the policy. Many rival services don't have account-sharing restrictions, and given how many options there are now, this could coax users elsewhere. Or maybe people will rediscover illegal streams, torrents and all the other methods we used to watch video before the streaming boom.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Realme's GT Neo5 phone can go from zero to 20 percent charge in 80 seconds

<p>Remember that Redmi phone which featured a whopping <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redmi-note-12-discovery-edition-210w-hypercharge-064020788.html">210W</a> charging? Well, another Chinese contender has made its next move with a 240W upgrade. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWFsbWUuY29tL3JlYWxtZS1ndC1uZW8tNSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGQxODY0N2MtZDUyOS00MjRkLTg5MzAtY2E2NzIwZjUyNmNiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeEJ1c1k8EkrR7WVqjg5XBVnUi51KNbutZqgSfW3cNy1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realme.com%2Frealme-gt-neo-5">Realme GT Neo5</a> can apparently charge its 4,600mAh dual-cell battery from zero to 20 percent in merely 80 seconds, or to 50 percent in four minutes, or to 100 percent in 9.5 minutes. On an mAh-per-minute basis, this actually beats the Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition's 9-minute record, considering that it has a smaller 4,300mAh battery.</p><p>Realme's 240W SuperVOOC rapid charging feat is enabled by a surprisingly compact dual-GaN power adapter, which is paired with a proprietary high-current USB-C cable to deliver 20V/12A of power. This is then converted to 10V/24A by three 100W power management chips before it reaches the battery — a similar implementation to the Redmi. The adapter is also compatible with USB-PD at up to 65W, as well as existing Qualcomm QC and Oppo VOOC-based solutions — the latter's previous record was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-150w-supervooc-oneplus-140004546.html">150W</a>. Realme further claimed that even after 1,600 cycles (about four years of usage), the battery health wouldn't go lower than 80 percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Realme GT Neo5" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/02bbecf0-a84a-11ed-9b45-2454cbe36215" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>Realme's GT Neo5 has a nice little gimmick on the back: an under-glass Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 decoration surrounded by an RGB light ring, which can be customized with 25 colors for scenes including charging, gaming, messages and more. This is all wrapped around an NFC circuitry positioned to the right of the camera island. Speaking of, you'll also find a 50-megapixel main camera (featuring a Sony IMX890 sensor and optical stabilization), an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera here.</p><p>On the other side, there's a 6.74-inch 2,772 x 1,240 AMOLED screen (supplied by China's Tianma) which not only runs at up to 144Hz, but also offers a sensitive 1,500Hz touch sampling rate — a plus for mobile gaming. This is complemented with an under-display fingerprint reader and a 16-megapixel punch-hole selfie camera. Other notable features include a infrared remote blaster at the top (a common feature on Chinese phones), a pair of stereo speakers and an 8-layer heat dissipation design for optimal gaming performance. All of these are packaged into a 199g-heavy, 8.9mm-thick body which comes in black, white or purple, and it's mostly covered with a piece of frosted glass on the rear side.</p><figure><img alt="Realme GT Neo5" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/482fc590-a84a-11ed-9ddf-55b80e6b20ac" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>The Realme GT Neo5 is already available in China with two flavors offered: the model with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage is asking for 3,199 yuan (around $470), but bumping it up to 1TB storage is just 3,499 yuan (about $520). Interestingly, there's also a 5,000mAh variant of the GT Neo5 which features "just" 150W charging, and it ranges from 2,499 yuan ($370; 8GB RAM and 256GB storage) to 2,899 yuan ($430; 16GB RAM and 256GB storage).</p><p>Realme has confirmed to Engadget that the GT Neo5 will be headed to international markets "soon." That said, the 240W SuperVOOC feature will actually be introduced to the global market by way of the company's upcoming flagship phone, the Realme GT3, later this month. Smells like an MWC special here.</p>

## Amazon secures key FCC approval to deploy its Project Kuiper broadband satellites

<p>Amazon is getting closer to being able to deploy Project Kuiper's broadband satellites. The company has just <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/international-bureau-grants-kuiper-satellite-modification">received key approval</a> from the Federal Communications Commission, which it needs to be able to officially send 3,236 satellites to orbit and to begin Kuiper's satellite internet operations. As <a href="https://spacenews.com/amazon-gets-key-fcc-approval-for-more-than-3000-leo-broadband-satellites/"><em>SpaceNews</em></a> notes, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fcc-approval-project-kuiper-065621687.html">secured an initial approval</a> from the agency in 2020. The FCC gave it permission to launch thousands of Low Earth Orbit satellites, so long as it later secures regulatory approval for an updated orbital debris mitigation plan.</p><p>In the <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-23-114A1.pdf">order</a> (PDF), the commission said the updated plan satisfies the condition it gave the company when it granted its request back in 2020. This additional approval &quot;will allow Kuiper to begin deployment of its constellation in order to bring high-speed broadband connectivity to customers around the world.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of its updated orbital debris mitigation plan, the FCC will require Amazon to submit a a semi-annual report &quot;concerning the number of satellites launched and disposal reliability.&quot; If Amazon experiences disposal failure with satellites within a single year, it has to report that fact to the FCC, as well. In addition, the commission is requiring Project Kuiper to ensure that it will be able to deorbit its satellites after their seven-year mission is done. Making sure the decommissioned satellites are out of orbit is necessary to prevent them from colliding with the International Space Station and other inhabitable stations.&nbsp;</p><p>Late last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prototype-project-kuiper-satellites-ula-vulcan-centaur-132457407.html">revealed</a> that the first two Project Kuiper satellites will head to orbit aboard the maiden flight of United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan Centaur rocket. Vulcan Centaur is still <a href="https://www.space.com/united-launch-alliance-stacks-vulcan-centaur-rocket-photos">currently under testing</a>, but if all goes to plan, it'll fly for the first time in the next few months.&nbsp;</p>

## DJI's $369 Mini 2 SE drone can fly up to 10km away

<p>The rumors were true, DJI is releasing a new Mini 2 SE drone that features a couple of upgrades over the company’s existing entry-level drone. Most notably, DJI has equipped the Mini 2 SE with its in-house <a href="https://store.dji.bg/en/blog/what-is-dji-ocusync-and-how-does-it-work">OcuSync 2.0</a> transmission system, meaning the drone can now effectively fly more than twice as far away as the original Mini SE. That model’s “Enhanced WiFi” system limited its range to up to 4km. The new system should also maintain a more stable video feed at greater distances. That said, the addition of OcuSync 2.0 might not be as valuable as the numbers suggest. Most jurisdictions require that you maintain a visual line of sight with your drone, and with a UAV as small as the Mini 2 SE, it’s very likely you’ll lose sight of it long before you get a chance to fly it 10km away.</p><p>Additionally, DJI says the Mini 2 SE can fly for 31 minutes on a single battery charge, a modest upgrade from the previous model’s maximum 30-minute flight time. Aside from those changes, the Mini 2 SE is nearly identical to the model it’s about to replace. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Like its predecessor, the Mini 2 SE weighs less than 249 grams, meaning you’re not required to <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone"><ins>register it with the Federal Aviation Administration</ins></a>. The new drone also carries over the aging but decent camera system found on the Mini SE. It comes with a three-axis gimbal and a 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor capable of capturing 2.7K video and 12-megapixel stills.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The DJI Mini 2 SE will cost $369 when it arrives next month. In addition to selling the drone on its own, DJI will offer the Mini 2 SE as part of a “Fly More Combo” bundle that comes with additional batteries, replacement propellers and a carrying case for $519.</p>

## Twitter says bots can use its API for free, with limitations

<p>Twitter has shared <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1623467615539859456"><ins>more details</ins></a> about the upcoming changes to its API that will require most developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-charging-developers-api-access-104917093.html"><ins>to pay</ins></a> in order to keep using its developer tools. In an update, the company said that there will be “a new form of free access” that will allow “Tweet creation of up to 1,500 Tweets per month.”</p><p>That clarification means that many of Twitter’s so-called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitter-will-offer-a-free-api-tier-for-good-bots-091022655.html"><ins>“good” bots</ins></a> — the automated accounts that tweet everything from historical photos to helpful reminders — will be able to continue on the platform. Previously, the future of these accounts was uncertain as many bot makers said they would not pay for API access.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="24433ae54ed340de8947ea8b3f95e6fb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A new form of free access will be introduced as this is extremely important to our ecosystem – limited to Tweet creation of up to 1,500 Tweets per month for a single authenticated user token, including Login with Twitter.</p>— Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1623467618400374784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>However, the 1,500 monthly limit on tweet creation could still impact bots that tweet most frequently. Fifteen hundred tweets a month works out to roughly 50 tweets a day, which could be problematic for Twitter’s most active bots. The company also granted a short reprieve for developers about to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html"><ins>lose API access</ins></a>, saying that it had extended the current version of the API until February 13th.</p><p>After that, developers wishing to access the “paid basic” tier of Twitter’s API will need to pay $100 a month, according to Twitter. The company also confirmed that it would be ending the Premium API, and that subscribers would have the option to apply for the Enterprise version of the service. The company still hasn’t weighed in on what, if any, options will be available <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research"><ins>to researchers </ins></a>currently using Twitter’s developer tools for their projects.</p>

<p>With the start of season two around the corner, Activision has shared what Call of Duty fans can expect from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwii-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-no-russian-170044023.html"><em>Warzone 2.0</em></a> come February 15th. As previously teased, the update will introduce <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2023/02/call-of-duty-warzone-2-0-ashika-island-resurgence-map-deep-dive">Ashika Island</a>, a new map for players to fight over. Pulling on Japan for inspiration, the battleground marks the return of <em>Warzone’s </em>Resurgence mode. The mode allows your operator to respawn more than once per match, provided at least one of your teammates is still alive. You can shorten the countdown before your squad member returns by doing things like taking out enemy players.</p><figure><img alt="Call of Duty roadmap" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/def76050-a7fa-11ed-bbef-ae4154909e77" style="height: 1080; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Activision</div></figure><p>Ashika Island landmarks include a feudal castle complete with springtime cherry blossoms and the wreckage of two cargo tankers. Continuing with the Japanese theme, Activision is adding Restore Honor, a map-exclusive feature that allows you to earn a bit of in-game cash and intelligence by picking up the dog tag a player leaves behind the first time they die during a match. A new “Path of the Ronin” seasonal event allows you to earn items, including a weapon charm, by completing challenges modeled after the samurai’s Bushido code.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can read the full list of changes coming to <em>Warzone 2.0</em>, as well as everything that Activision is bringing to <em>Modern Warfare II</em>, on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2023/02/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-warzone-2-0-season-02-launch-ashika-maps-modes#FORGE"><ins>Call of Duty blog</ins></a>.</p>
