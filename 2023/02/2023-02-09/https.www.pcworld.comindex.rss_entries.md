## Finally! Mozilla’s Thunderbird email client is getting a makeover

<p>For some people, offline email is still the way to go. Be it due to habit, mistrust of cloud services, or sensible prudence about backups, downloading email to a client still factors large in their routine. Mozilla Thunderbird is a key part of such setups thanks to its hefty set of features and zero-cost price tag. But Thunderbird has long been criticized for its outdated interface, and not without cause&mdash;it still looks like it&rsquo;s stuck in 2003.</p>



<p>That will finally change in July, with the upcoming launch of version 115. As detailed in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/&amp;xcust=2-1-1508751-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird blog post</a>, this year&rsquo;s update of the client will sport a &ldquo;simple and clean&rdquo; user interface friendlier to new adopters. Customization options will also be available, allowing the client to retain a familiar vibe for long-time users. (Though given the repeated references the team makes in the blog post to the questions they&rsquo;ve received about the UI, most Thunderbird veterans will welcome the refreshed look.)</p>



<p>In addition to revamping the software&rsquo;s user interface and experience, the Thunderbird team also plans to overhaul its code to make it leaner, rewrite old code, and otherwise clean up and modernize the code base. And, like Firefox, Thunderbird will move to monthly release schedules.</p>



<p>You can read more about the developers&rsquo; reasons for rebuilding Thunderbird (and why it&rsquo;s taken so long) in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/&amp;xcust=2-1-1508751-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the blog post</a>, which gives a wide overview of the email client&rsquo;s long history&mdash;including seminal moments that affected the software&rsquo;s direction, like the 2012 move to community-driven development. But the short of it is, long-time Thunderbird fans are finally getting what they asked for.</p>

## Intel kills off 11th-gen Rocket Lake CPUs you shouldn’t buy anyway

<p>Intel said this week that it&rsquo;s closing the book on its 11th-gen Core chips, code-named &ldquo;Rocket Lake.&rdquo; The company issued an end-of life notice that covers the entire Rocket Lake chip lineup as well as its supporting chipsets.</p>



<p>Intel said that it will accept orders for the chips up until August 25, shipping them through February 2024, so vendors and retailers will have a while to stock up if desired. The end-of -life notice for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://qdms.intel.com/dm/i.aspx/ADDB0AA6-278E-46AB-B187-40D42430CCD1/PCN119441-00.pdf&amp;xcust=2-3-1508661-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Rocket Lake family</a> as well as the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://qdms.intel.com/dm/i.aspx/B6DBBFDE-6ACF-477E-A8BE-E46F684ABAE2/PCN119439-00.pdf&amp;xcust=2-3-1508661-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">supporting chipsets</a> was noticed by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-goodbye-to-rocket-lake-cpus&amp;xcust=2-3-1508661-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>.</p>



<p>In reality, though, the Rocket Lake architecture won&rsquo;t be particularly missed. As our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394266/core-i9-11900k-review.html">original review of</a> Rocket Lake pointed out, Intel&rsquo;s 11th-gen desktop processor was the last vestige of Intel&rsquo;s 14nm manufacturing process, which at that time had endured seven whole years of Intel designs. Intel&rsquo;s 11th-gen <em>mobile</em> processors, however, had since migrated to Intel&rsquo;s 10nm process technology. Intel had migrated the Core i9-11900K to the new Cypress Cove CPU architecture, but had ended up sacrificing some of the CPU cores in the process.</p>



<p>Perhaps its greatest sin, though, was in power consumption. According to our tests, the flagship Rocket Lake chip consumed a whopping 68 percent more power, under load, then the Ryzen 9 5900X, its closest competitor. Though energy prices might not have been then what they are now, that&rsquo;s still a lot of juice.</p>



<p>In any case, if you&rsquo;re still desperate for an Intel Core chip from yesteryear, get your orders in soon. If you&rsquo;re looking for something much more potent, however, be sure to check out our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html">best CPUs for gaming</a>. The beastly new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">Core i9-13900K</a> absolutely trounces the 11900K in every possible way.</p>

## How to run ChatGPT or the new Bing as a Windows app

<p>AI-powered chat and search apps are smoking hot right now, but there&rsquo;s a small problem: They run in a browser, and that requires navigating to each site individually. But what if you didn&rsquo;t have to?</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">new AI-powered Bing</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">ChatGPT</a>, and (eventually) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html">Google&rsquo;s Bard search engine</a> can all be stored as an app in Windows and called up when necessary. We&rsquo;ll show you how.</p>



<p>Websites can either be pinned to the Windows Start menu, or saved as direct &ldquo;application&rdquo; at any location. The resulting application is still a web app, but it will load in its own separate window, and can be easily tucked away in a corner, minimized, or otherwise managed via Windows. We&rsquo;ll show how to do this in both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s the difference? If you simply pin a web app to the Start menu, the default behavior will be to open ChatGPT or Bing in a new browser tab. If you save it to Windows as an app, it will save as its own self-contained browser window, without tabs or favorites. Both methods will save the web page inside the main Start shortcut menu, but only the latter method will place the web page in the list of apps, where it can be can be quickly launched via a Win+R command. Our preference is to save ChatGPT, Bing, or any other AI program as an app.</p>



<p>All of these instructions should apply equally to Bing, ChatGPT, and even Google Bard once it launches.</p>

## Twitter expands character limit from 280 to 4,000 (and promptly breaks)

<p>Loquacious people, rejoice! Twitter just expanded its brief 280 character limit to an oversized 4,000&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a catch. </p>



<p>In order to use wall-o-text-length tweets, you have to be a member of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue&amp;xcust=2-2-1508421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twitter Blue&rsquo;s</a> monthly subscription service, which costs real money dollars. Talk about a buzzkill, yeah? You also have to be located in the United States, as other countries don&rsquo;t have access to this feature yet. You can peruse the details in the tweet below.</p>

<p>The idea is to eliminate Twitter threads, which are longer ponderings that get broken up into shorter tweets. Personally, I prefer shorter tweets because that&rsquo;s what drew me to this social media platform in the first place. I didn&rsquo;t have to sift through paragraphs upon paragraphs to get the information I wanted. Simple and to the point. That&rsquo;s what Twitter used to be. Nowadays, like most folks, I&rsquo;ve no idea what the hell is going on with it.  </p>



<p>Twitter has been a major trash fire for quite some time now. Whether they&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">leaking data from 200 million users</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479844/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-apps.html">slamming third-party clients with the ban hammer</a>, the social media platform is the virtual wild, wild west. Last night, shortly after rolling out the new character count and controversial API changes, Twitter suffered from widespread technical issues that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591755/twitter-outage-down-rate-limit-dm-tweetdeck&amp;xcust=2-2-1508421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">prevented folks from tweeting</a> or following new people for several hours. </p>



<p>Although the issue has since been resolved, Twitter appears to get more and more unstable by the moment. Will it eventually implode? Who knows. Either way, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html">Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter is awfully hard to trust</a> right now though.</p>

<p>Got a minute to spare? Let&rsquo;s add some extra pep to your Windows PC by preventing it from launching unnecessary apps at startup.</p>



<p>Slimming down your startup process will of course lead to faster boot times, but it can also help unclutter your taskbar or menu bar, while also freeing up processing power from programs you seldom use. (If you&rsquo;re still using a mechanical hard drive, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">an SSD will also improve Windows boot times</a> dramatically.)</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t even need expensive system cleaner apps for this brief bit of PC maintenance. All it takes is a quick trip to your Windows settings menu, where you can decide which apps to launch straight away. Here&rsquo;s how to disable start-up apps:</p>



<ul><li>In either Windows 10 or 11, click the Start menu and select the <strong>&#9881;</strong> Settings icon.</li><li>Head to Apps &gt; Startup.</li><li>Uncheck any apps you don&rsquo;t immediately need when your computer boots.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702039/10-tiny-windows-tips-to-power-up-your-pc.html">10 little-known Windows features that will blow your mind</a></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Which startup apps should you disable?</strong></h2>



<p>If you need help deciding which apps to disable, look for the ones that don&rsquo;t need to run in the background at all times. Ones that are labeled &ldquo;High Impact&rdquo; are especially strong candidates for disabling, as they&rsquo;re most likely to slow down your PC at startup.</p>

<p>In my case, I&rsquo;ve disabled Slack, Microsoft Edge, and Logitech&rsquo;s Options software, none of which I care about running as soon as my PC boots up. (This does mean I won&rsquo;t get any Slack desktop notifications until I actually launch the app, but that&rsquo;s okay. Slack&rsquo;s mobile app will still notify me of anything important.) Even if a program doesn&rsquo;t register as &ldquo;High Impact,&rdquo; you can still disable it if you don&rsquo;t need it to run right away.</p>



<p>Conversely, I&rsquo;ve allowed certain apps to run at startup because they need to be running the background at all times. For instance, I use to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/AutoDarkMode/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode&amp;xcust=2-2-918588-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AutoDarkMode</a> to switch between Windows light and dark themes automatically, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://justgetflux.com&amp;xcust=2-2-918588-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">f.lux</a> to adjust screen tone, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395007/beeftext-free-windows-text-tool-will-change-the-way-you-type.html">Beeftext</a> for text shortcuts. I want those programs to be available immediately, and have left them enabled regardless of their performance impact.</p>



<p>None of these options are permanently, of course. If you ever want to change an app&rsquo;s startup behavior, just head back to <strong>&#9881;</strong> Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Startup and toggle it on or off again.</p>

## One Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro feature we love (and one we hate)

<p>In general, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499055/samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-review.html">Samsung&rsquo;s new Galaxy Book3 Pro 360</a> offers a fascinating mix of stunning hardware and software experiences that try to elevate both work and play. But deep down we found two hidden features&mdash;one which we&rsquo;d love to see more of and another which we&rsquo;d be happy to never see again.</p>

<p>To be fair, it&rsquo;s not clear whether either of these features are ones that Samsung enabled or if they&rsquo;re simply a quiet tweak by Microsoft to push out new features we haven&rsquo;t seen before. Our Book3 Pro 360 review unit includes Windows 11 Home 22H2 build <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/january-26-2023-kb5022360-os-build-22621-1194-preview-f6973dbe-bcc4-402a-8b9a-0541b0959403&amp;xcust=2-1-1504420-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">22621.1194</a> and the default configuration of my personal PC is Windows 11 Home 22H2 22621.1105. </p>



<p>The feature I like most is the &ldquo;time to empty&rdquo; gauge that accompanies the actual battery percentage on the taskbar. Knowing how much battery you have left is handy, of course, but an estimate of exactly how long you have before you need to plug in is handier still.</p>



<p>This particular feature used to be more common in older versions of Windows with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/502950/get_a_better_battery_gauge_for_your_laptop.html">certain utilities dating way back to Windows 7</a>. Windows 10 added it, then subtracted it, and it hasn&rsquo;t really appeared since. Certain laptop makers&mdash;Lenovo comes to mind&mdash;have made this part of their standard utility configuration.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 battery saver" class="wp-image-1503190" height="818" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Battery-saver.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This is a handy little feature I wish was more common.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s the question of whether the gauge itself is accurate. We didn&rsquo;t set out to specifically test this feature, but even if it&rsquo;s not accurate to the minute, it does give you some idea as to how long you&rsquo;ll have. Fortunately, our tests show the Book3 Pro 360 provides well over 12 hours of battery life, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry too much. </p>



<h2 id="and-one-we-hated">&hellip;and one we hated</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;re a little less enthusiastic about a feature that showed up early in our review&hellip; and then somehow vanished later on.</p>



<p>When you configure a new PC, Windows assumes you want to migrate from an older PC by offering to reproduce your old setup. It does so because Windows and OneDrive attempt to back up files from three key locations&mdash;the Desktop, Photos, and Documents. It&rsquo;s also aware of whether or not you have a Microsoft 365 account keyed to your Windows account.</p>



<p>When we review PCs, we opt for a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; PC instead&mdash;just the default apps that the laptop maker provides. Otherwise, we&rsquo;d risk clogging up the laptop with a bunch of additional data that could slow down performance. To do so, we turn down Microsoft&rsquo;s request to set up the PC as an existing configuration and ask OneDrive to stop syncing with the cloud. The latter allows OneDrive to back up the laptop in question, but it also prevents OneDrive from sending down placeholder files from all of the documents and photos we&rsquo;ve previously backed up. Normally, this isn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>



<p>Initially, however, we were dismayed to find that this wasn&rsquo;t possible. OneDrive insisted on syncing all three locations, which happened to include a folder of storage-intensive applications that I had copied onto the desktop and immediately started backing up. When I tried to stop this behavior, Windows informed me that those folders were necessary and that I couldn&rsquo;t prevent syncing them. My only option was to prevent OneDrive from syncing, which it only agreed to do until I rebooted my PC&mdash;when syncing would begin again.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft OneDrive backup" class="wp-image-1504489" height="876" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot_20230206_090836.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This is the OneDrive settings screen, and what you should see when you try to manage your OneDrive cloud backup.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Not only would this unwanted syncing kick off a background task I had no desire to run, but it threatened to monopolize my broadband connection. My home broadband suffers from a data cap and if I lived in a rural area, chances are that backing up multi-gigabyte files would take several hours on a slow connection.</p>



<p>Fortunately, once I was able to install what I needed to test on the laptop, I was able to shut off OneDrive as well as isolate the laptop via its Airplane Mode. When I came back to document the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; further&hellip; the objection disappeared? As I sat down to snap a screenshot, I determined that I could disable the automatic backup of the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders once again. Unfortunately, the folder in which all my benchmark files were located was still designated for backup, so I&rsquo;ve disabled OneDrive for the time being.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not quite clear whether the OneDrive sync was a glitch, a test feature, or some weird interaction between the laptop, a Windows account, or maybe Samsung&rsquo;s own backup services. I certainly appreciate the improved battery gauge. OneDrive&rsquo;s heavy hand? Not so much.</p>

<p>Keychron started out making wireless, Mac-focused mechanical keyboards that were, at least for me, pretty underwhelming. Then the company shifted into high-end, enthusiast-focused keyboards, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html">Keychron Q5</a>, which has all the trappings of a small-batch boutique build, but at about half the price. This is the company&rsquo;s sweet spot, and it&rsquo;s been improving on that ever since. Now we&rsquo;ve come full circle: The Q1 Pro is Keychron&rsquo;s first high-end, all-metal board to add Bluetooth. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/835195/best-wireless-gaming-keyboards.html">best wireless gaming keyboards</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a wireless gaming keyboard, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron Q1 keyboard from the side " class="wp-image-1502770" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC00299.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>And damn it if it isn&rsquo;t just about perfect. The Q1 Pro combines the ultra-popular 75% layout, high-end materials like an all-aluminum case and a rotary dial, and boutique features like gasket mounting and VIA/QMK programming. And it&rsquo;s wireless. It&rsquo;s everything you want in a high-end build, with almost no sacrifices. And as usual, the value is beating the absolute pants off of the competition. </p>



<p>There are only two reasons I can think of to <em>not </em>recommend the Q1 Pro to a mechanical keyboard fan. One, you demand 2.4GHz, gaming-grade wireless. Or two, you simply want to wait for Keychron to bring Bluetooth to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1364305/keychron-q8-review-a-quality-keyboard-for-the-ergo-riche.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one of its other, many Q-series keyboard layouts</a>. For everyone else: go buy one. </p>



<h2 id="a-familiar-look">A familiar look</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve read any of our previous Keychron reviews here on PCWorld, you know what to expect. The Q1 Pro features a compact 75% layout with full arrow keys and function row, plus an optional rotary dial upgrade. It&rsquo;s clad in an aluminum case that feels like it could stand in for any of the murder weapons in a game of <em>Clue</em>. (Read: It&rsquo;s really heavy and tough.) And typing on it, especially with the included high-profile PBT keycaps, is heavenly. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron Q1 Pro right side dial" class="wp-image-1502760" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC00279.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>There are only two major departures from the main Q series. One, there&rsquo;s a very clear antenna section on the upper part of the case. This is basically just a hole in the aluminum to hold the Bluetooth antenna&mdash;you can see the cable going to the wireless chip if you crack it open. And two, Keychron replaced the metal support plate underneath the switches with a plastic one, presumably to boost wireless range yet again. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Typing on the Q1 Pro, especially with the included high-profile PBT keycaps, is heavenly. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The change makes the keys flex much more noticeably under heavy typing. That might be a plus if you really like the squishy give of a gasket mount, the little bits of foam that &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; the plate in between the metal parts of the board. If not, that might be the one change from the older Q1 that you really don&rsquo;t like in the Pro. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron Q1 Pro switches" class="wp-image-1502765" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC00424.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Other changes from the standard Q1 are harder to spot. There&rsquo;s a massive 4,000mAh battery hidden underneath everything, which you won&rsquo;t notice unless you disassemble everything. And Keychron removed the option for Gateron Pro switches, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k-pro-switch&amp;xcust=2-1-1502685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">instead offering K Pro switches</a> in linear Red (as in our review unit), tactile Brown, or stiffer tactile Banana (which also removes the stabilizing hall effect). The new switches feel a little less smooth than the Gaterons, but since Keychron offers the keyboard in a barebones kit without any switches at all, I&rsquo;m loath to complain about it. </p>



<h2 id="dedicated-antenna-for-bluetooth">Dedicated antenna for Bluetooth </h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the work Keychron did to facilitate Bluetooth in that massive metal case. Unlike similar all-metal wireless keyboards that just sort of deal with the lowered range, Keychron&rsquo;s dedicated antenna makes this a keyboard designed from the ground up for wireless. The Q1 Pro maintained its Bluetooth connection to my desktop two rooms away, and even when I stepped out on my front porch, a solid 40 feet and three walls from the computer. Keychron took the wireless upgrade seriously. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron Q1 Pro Bluetooth antenna" class="wp-image-1502762" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC00328.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>The other component in a wireless build is the battery, and Keychron didn&rsquo;t skimp there, either. The 4,000mAh unit hidden beneath the keys can handle a solid couple of weeks with the RGB lighting on, and with them off&hellip;I have no idea, because my review period doesn&rsquo;t last that long. Months, at the very least, if my experience building wireless boards is anything to go by. When you need to charge up, the package includes a handsome braided USB-C cord, along with alternate keycaps, extra gaskets, disassembly tools, and keycap and key switch puller. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron Q1 Pro with switches revealed" class="wp-image-1502763" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC00368.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>You might want to plug in if you&rsquo;re using the Q1 for gaming, by the way. While its wireless powers are perfectly fine, even for switching between multiple machines, they&rsquo;re not particularly fast. A typical lag and occasional stutter is noticeable, and entirely typical for Bluetooth. Plugged in, the keyboard operates at 1,000Hz, good enough for everyone except a &ldquo;pro&rdquo; gamer. A dedicate 2.4GHz dongle would have alleviated this&hellip;but to be fair, Keychron has never marketed its wireless boards as meant for gaming. </p>



<h2 id="incredible-features-incredible-value">Incredible features, incredible value </h2>



<p>There are just too many features in the Q1 Pro to describe in prose. Here&rsquo;s the bullet-point version:  </p>



<ul><li>All-aluminum chassis </li><li>Double gasket mount&mdash;this gives the keys a little flex and &ldquo;bounce&rdquo;</li><li>Doubleshot PBT KSA-profile keycaps&mdash;tall, old-fashioned keycaps that will never wear the legends down </li><li>Two layers of sound-absorbing foam</li><li>Hot-swappable switches&mdash;swap out the key switches for anything in the Cherry MX format</li><li>QMK and VIA programming&mdash;easy custom programming for all keys and lighting, no proprietary software necessary</li></ul>



<p>Most of this stuff is standard in the premium keyboard space at this point, minus the wireless option. For example, the GMMK Pro has pretty much all of these features, plus RGB side-lighting. But that board lacks wireless, and its barebones version is almost the same price as the non-tricked out Q1 Pro. With switches and keycaps, it&rsquo;s more than $100 more expensive, more in line with the boutique boards these designs are based on. Ditto for the Drop Sense75. Other alternatives in this form factor, like the Keydous NJ80 or the Epomaker TH80, use far cheaper materials, and programming is a chore if it&rsquo;s possible at all. </p>

<p>In short, Keychron once again has the most features in a premium keyboard for the lowest price. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of keyboards on the market that directly compete with the Q1 Pro, but even so, it stands head and shoulders above other options. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://cle/1479939/i-got-tired-of-waiting-for-a-wireless-gaming-pc-keypad-so-i-made-my-own.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1502685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">self-confessed keyboard snob</a>. I&rsquo;ve put hundreds of hours and an embarrassing amount of money into the hobby, including more than $500 on my primary, self-built board. And saying all that, the Q1 Pro is probably better than what I can build for myself. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s solid as can be, filled with high-quality hardware from top to bottom, stuffed full of premium features, and yet somehow is still cheaper than every comparable option. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40378281984089&amp;xcust=2-1-1502685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">barebones version starts at $179</a>, if you want to use your own key switches and caps. The fully assembled version is $200, and just about untouchable (figuratively&mdash;you can touch it all you want!) for a high-end wireless board. </p>

<p>Gamers who demand high-speed wireless will lament the lack of a dedicated dongle, and those who want a larger or smaller form factor might want to wait for new entries in the Q Pro series. But for everyone else, the Q1 Pro is simply the best premium Bluetooth keyboard on the market. </p>
