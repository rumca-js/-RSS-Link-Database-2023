We installed Retroarch and even overclocked a leapfrog LeapsterGS so we can run retro games like NES, SNES, Gameboy, GBA and even PS1 Sort Of. running emulators on a leap frog device is pretty cool but its not going to be a steam deck killer. If you have a leap frog Leapster GS laying around it makes a cool project.
