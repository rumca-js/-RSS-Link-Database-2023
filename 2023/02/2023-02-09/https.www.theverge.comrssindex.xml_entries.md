  <p id="Ez31nW">Google wants to make it easier for others to make powerful mixed reality experiences with the official release of a new Google Cloud tool, Immersive Stream for XR. The tool lets you scan a QR code or click a link to access a mixed reality experience, and behind the scenes, Google Cloud GPUs will host, render, and stream those experiences to your device, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/immersive-stream-for-xr-is-ga/">according to a blog post</a>. </p>
<p id="8l8j1c">Google says it’s already using the technology for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590667/google-maps-immersive-view-fly-3d-london-tokyo-nyc">new immersive view in Google Maps</a>, which lets you look at a 3D model of certain cities overlaid with details like traffic and nearby restaurants. But the company is also highlighting other ways to use Immersive Stream for XR, like for placing virtual furniture in augmented reality (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15526478/houzz-3d-ar-home-renovation-furniture-shopping-app-update">not exactly a new idea</a>) or...</p>

  <p id="ZKvNmw"><em>Metroid Prime</em> is my favorite game of all time. It was the <em>Super Mario 64</em> of <em>Metroid</em>, brilliantly ushering the sci-fi platformer series from 2D to 3D. Obviously, I was thrilled to hear about Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591768/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-launch">surprise release of <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a>, which you can play right now. But I’ll admit that I was a touch nervous to return to the game, which I hadn’t played in years. Would it hold up? In my first hour with <em>Remastered</em>, the answer so far is definitely yes. </p>
<p id="jpyQrw">I was overcome by waves of nostalgia from the moment I booted up the game. The glitchy, electronic, and somewhat spooky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42u0KB6f5eU">theme song</a> is just as effective at setting the tone of the game as it was when I first played <em>Metroid Prime</em> in 2002 on the GameCube.

  <p id="Sfm82d">With the way Nintendo tends to drip-feed retro releases, it’s easy to forget that it operates an excellent subscription service for fans of classic games. It’s one that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18185533/nintendo-switch-online-classic-nes-games-blaster-master-zelda-2">showed a lot of promise at launch</a>, and since then, it has steadily grown into something that largely fulfills that promise. There are still some issues, but it’s affordable and convenient — and with the recent addition of Game Boy games, it now has a very impressive library with plenty of room to grow.</p>
<p id="I8t4CL">In case you missed it, Nintendo both announced and launched Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games as part of its NSO subscription <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591422/nintendo-direct-february-2023-news-trailers">during its first Nintendo Direct of the year</a> last night.

  <p id="KZPPIV">If you don’t like emptying your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner">robot vacuum</a>, but also don’t like the idea of shelling out over $500 for an auto-empty model, TP-Link’s new budget robot vac might be for you. It doesn’t empty itself, but thanks to a large 800ml bin, the company says you only have to deal with that dusty mess twice a month. </p>
<p id="3JYAsz">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS8NLJDC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tapo RV10 Lite</a> is one of the first robot vacs from the brand known for its Wi-Fi routers. And, in line with TP-Link’s reputation for high-tech at low prices, it's a seriously budget bot. The Lite features the big bin and costs $229.99, while its mopping-capable sibling, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS8VKMY3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tapo RV10</a>, has a smaller bin but room for a 300ml mopping reservoir on board. It costs $249.99. </p>

  <p id="czfgZG">This is getting ridiculous. Realme has just announced a new smartphone, the Realme GT Neo 5, that supports up to <em>240W fast charging</em>. <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_launches_gt_neo5_with_240w_charging_cheaper_150w_version_arrive-news-57493.php">According to <em>GSMArena</em></a>, that will make it the fastest charging smartphone on the market, faster than the 210W offered by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428023/redmi-note-12-discovery-edition-210w-fast-charging-200mp-camera-release-date-price-features">Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition</a>, and almost 100W faster than the 150W charging offered by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/3/23288634/oneplus-10-price-release-date-specs-features-150w-fast-charging-alert-slider">OnePlus devices like the 10T</a>. 240W is in line with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23053867/first-240w-usb-c-4-power-delivery-cables-20-40-gbps">latest USB power spec</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr">announced by the USB-IF in 2021</a>.</p>
<p id="MMu4DG">In practical terms, we’re really hitting the point of diminishing returns with fast charging wattage this high on smartphones. Realme advertises that the GT Neo 5’s 4,600mAh battery can be charged to 100 percent in nine and a half minutes thanks to its 240W charging. That’s super fast, but...</p>
