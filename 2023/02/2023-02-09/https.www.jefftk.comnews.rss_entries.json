[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Make CoI Policies Public", "description": "<p><span>\n\nIf I'm interviewing someone for a position my job is to assess their\nsuitability as a potential employee, but if they're my cousin I might\nbe tempted to give them an overly favorable review.  Most\norganizations have Conflict of Interest (CoI) policies that describe\nhow to handle this sort of situation: it's common that someone might\nhave external relationships which lead to duties, interests, or\ndesires that conflict with what's best for their organization.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's reasonably common for non-profits to publish their CoI policies;\nfor example, here are ones for the <a href=\"https://www.hewlett.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Conflict-of-Interest-Policy.pdf\">Hewlett</a>,\n<a href=\"https://media.carnegie.org/filer_public/8c/20/8c2083c5-e5ad-49cd-8a89-3466d14974d5/2022coisigned.pdf\">Carnegie</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf\">Gates</a>\nfoundations.  Within effective altruism I do see some of this:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Animal Charity Evaluators has a <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/policies/\">great\npage</a> on their policies, which includes their full CoI policies.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Open Philanthropy shares their <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/relationship-disclosure-policy/\">Relationship\nDisclosure Policy</a>, though I (and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EooyY6XeebdtSaXz5/does-open-philanthropy-have-a-public-document-regarding\">others</a>)\ndon't see their full policy.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>GiveWell has a public <a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/ClearFund/Conflict_of_Interest_Policy_for_Board_Members_Offices_and_Key_Persons.pdf\">Conflict\nof Interest Policy for Board Members, Officers, and Key Persons</a>,\nthough probably also has an internal one for regular employees that\nseems not to be public?  They maintain a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/relationship-disclosures\">Relationship\nDisclosures</a> page, which I think is great.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nHistorically <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ESQS57Jn7kLsi5dc2/eas-write-about-where-they-give\">people</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/transparency\">organizations</a>\nwithin the EA movement have prioritized transparency, and while\nthere's been <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-how-were-thinking-about-openness-and-information-sharing/\">some\nshift away</a> from the most enthusiastic versions of this as we've <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/09/11/challenges-of-transparency/\">better\nunderstood the costs</a>, there are still a lot of benefits.  If\nyou're already going to the effort of drafting a policy like this,\nmaking it public seems pretty useful:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>EAs who are concerned about CoIs within the community and are\nthinking about what norms they might try to influence can see what's\nalready formally in place.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Other organizations can reference it in trying to figure out\nwhat sort of policy they want.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>People who are worried a situation can see what policy was\n(supposed to have been) followed.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, many EA organizations don't seem to have public\npolicies.  This includes ones that work in community building or\ngrant-making where they seem pretty important.  Here are a few I\nchecked:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>The Centre for Effective Altruism <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/our-mistakes\">mentions</a>\nthat they have a  \"written conflict of interest policy\", but it\ndoesn't seem to be public.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The Effective Ventures Foundation doesn't list anything on\ntheir site, but says in their <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/es8pp29e1wp8/719m3SIVrQSzDcUxrzo7dS/af10eed02339549672126b0e87f2776d/Final_-_2021_Form_990_signed_-_CEA.pdf\">2021\nIRS filings</a> that \"when a conflict of interest arises a plan for\nregularly checking in with the involved parties is done monthly as per\nthe policy of the handbook\".\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The EA Funds website repeatedly mentions their CoI policy\nwithout linking one (ex: <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/help/2NanQ5OYXTK5HzSMqEe9IK\">\"Potential\nconflicts of interest are governed by the EA Funds Conflict of\nInterest policy\"</a>).
