If I'm interviewing someone for a position my job is to assess their
suitability as a potential employee, but if they're my cousin I might
be tempted to give them an overly favorable review.  Most
organizations have Conflict of Interest (CoI) policies that describe
how to handle this sort of situation: it's common that someone might
have external relationships which lead to duties, interests, or
desires that conflict with what's best for their organization.

</span>

<p>

It's reasonably common for non-profits to publish their CoI policies;
for example, here are ones for the <a href="https://www.hewlett.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Conflict-of-Interest-Policy.pdf">Hewlett</a>,
<a href="https://media.carnegie.org/filer_public/8c/20/8c2083c5-e5ad-49cd-8a89-3466d14974d5/2022coisigned.pdf">Carnegie</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf">Gates</a>
foundations.  Within effective altruism I do see some of this:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Animal Charity Evaluators has a <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/policies/">great
page</a> on their policies, which includes their full CoI policies.

</p></li>
<li><p>Open Philanthropy shares their <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/relationship-disclosure-policy/">Relationship
Disclosure Policy</a>, though I (and <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EooyY6XeebdtSaXz5/does-open-philanthropy-have-a-public-document-regarding">others</a>)
don't see their full policy.

</p></li>
<li><p>GiveWell has a public <a href="https://files.givewell.org/files/ClearFund/Conflict_of_Interest_Policy_for_Board_Members_Offices_and_Key_Persons.pdf">Conflict
of Interest Policy for Board Members, Officers, and Key Persons</a>,
though probably also has an internal one for regular employees that
seems not to be public?  They maintain a <a href="https://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/relationship-disclosures">Relationship
Disclosures</a> page, which I think is great.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Historically <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ESQS57Jn7kLsi5dc2/eas-write-about-where-they-give">people</a>
and <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/transparency">organizations</a>
within the EA movement have prioritized transparency, and while
there's been <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-how-were-thinking-about-openness-and-information-sharing/">some
shift away</a> from the most enthusiastic versions of this as we've <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2014/09/11/challenges-of-transparency/">better
understood the costs</a>, there are still a lot of benefits.  If
you're already going to the effort of drafting a policy like this,
making it public seems pretty useful:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>EAs who are concerned about CoIs within the community and are
thinking about what norms they might try to influence can see what's
already formally in place.

</p></li>
<li><p>Other organizations can reference it in trying to figure out
what sort of policy they want.

</p></li>
<li><p>People who are worried a situation can see what policy was
(supposed to have been) followed.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

On the other hand, many EA organizations don't seem to have public
policies.  This includes ones that work in community building or
grant-making where they seem pretty important.  Here are a few I
checked:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The Centre for Effective Altruism <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/our-mistakes">mentions</a>
that they have a  "written conflict of interest policy", but it
doesn't seem to be public.

</p></li>
<li><p>The Effective Ventures Foundation doesn't list anything on
their site, but says in their <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/es8pp29e1wp8/719m3SIVrQSzDcUxrzo7dS/af10eed02339549672126b0e87f2776d/Final_-_2021_Form_990_signed_-_CEA.pdf">2021
IRS filings</a> that "when a conflict of interest arises a plan for
regularly checking in with the involved parties is done monthly as per
the policy of the handbook".

</p></li>
<li><p>The EA Funds website repeatedly mentions their CoI policy
without linking one (ex: <a href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/help/2NanQ5OYXTK5HzSMqEe9IK">"Potential
conflicts of interest are governed by the EA Funds Conflict of
Interest policy"</a>).  In the 2020-02-05 post <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Hrd73RGuCoHvwpQBC/request-for-feedback-draft-of-a-coi-policy-for-the-long-term">Request
for Feedback: Draft of a COI policy for the Long Term Future Fund</a>
one of their fund managers linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_tdG2F1xpPqGQKyCT1ij8cQSgEzHUt5y3TiJTGbAuhk/edit">this
document</a> ("EA Funds Conflict of Interest Policy") but in the
discussion on the 2021-03-23 post <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ek5ZctFxwh4QFigN7/ea-funds-has-appointed-new-fund-managers">EA
Funds has appointed new fund managers</a> they said it <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ek5ZctFxwh4QFigN7/ea-funds-has-appointed-new-fund-managers?commentId=jj9gJHd7toqE2pKbj">wasn't
yet public</a> and in follow-up on 2022-01-13 <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ek5ZctFxwh4QFigN7/ea-funds-has-appointed-new-fund-managers?commentId=KHgvFs43yP9epm49X">shared
a beta version</a> in a comment.

</p></li>
<li><p>Giving What We Can <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/transparency#we-acknowledge-conflicts-of-interest">lists
their major potential CoIs publicly</a>, which is great!  But it would
also be good to see the policy.

</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>
and the <a href="https://ea-foundation.org/eaf-usa/">EA Foundation</a>
say (<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6035868111c9bd46c176042b/t/628e492685fba013d74b6f0c/1653492006706/2021+RP+990+%28Public+Copy%29.pdf">RP</a>,
<a href="https://ea-foundation.org/files/2021-Form-990-EAF-US.pdf">EAF</a>)
that they have written conflict of interest policies available on
request, but don't put them on their websites.

</p></li>
<li><p>I can't find one for <a href="https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/about-us">Charity
Entrepreneurship</a> or <a href="https://founderspledge.com/about-us">Founders Pledge</a>.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

I'll write asking for policies, and will update this post if I hear
anything back.
