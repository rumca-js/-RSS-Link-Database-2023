I cover not just encryption, but installation for legacy BIOS and UEFI machines, but also what differences you'll encounter on Artix's different init systems. I also talk about automatic logons and such.\n\nhttps://artixlinux.org/\nhttps://wiki.artixlinux.org/Main/Installation\nhttps://archlinux.org/\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide\n\nNote that the only thing different between Arch and Artix are renamed commands (pacstrap vs. basestrap and genfstab vs. fstabgen and artix-chroot vs. arch-chroot). Artix can come with either runit, openrc, s6 or dinit as an init system and setup for all is the same except for the desired package is installed initially as is the command to enable the network interface.\n\nIf you want to lazily copy, the programs I installed with basestrap were:\nbase base-devel runit elogind-runit linux linux-firmware grub networkmanager networkmanager-runit cryptsetup lvm2 lvm2-runit neovim vim\n\n00:00 Intro and Background\n01:26 Download and Create and ISO\n05:05 On the Artix and Arch Install Scripts in the Repositories\n07:28 Reboot and Boot from the ISO\n08:26 UEFI vs Legacy Boot\n09:38 Formatting the Drive and Partitions\n14:34 Making an Encrypted Partition (luksFormat)\n17:37 Mount Partitions\n18:24 Choosing Mirrors for Speed (Optional)\n19:02 Install the Operating System and Programs\n22:06 Chrooting into the New Operating System\n23:03 Settings: Timezone, locale, LANG, hostname\n26:13 Enable NetworkManager and internet/wifi\n27:17 Passwords and users (optional autologin)\n29:30 Preparing decryption on boot, mkinitcpio.conf\n30:59 Grub configuration with UUIDs to decrypt\n32:08 Generating an fstab file\n32:28 Finishing up the GRUB configuration\n36:32 Grub installation and grub-mkconfig\n39:13 Finalizing\n39:47 Checking our work\n41:44 On graphical environments\n42:30 LARBS\n45:45 On xinit and starting desktop environments or window managers\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nClassical books reprinted by me: https://lindypress.net\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\nor Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.lukesmith.xyz\nBTC: bc1qd20r7phdct3t0e0z6jqs55ulectg25pngt7hyl\nXMR: 89yML3AtqnTNdo3wNuoaW44D94Zx1kBZNSBc9SyNxGdaKEZwZNdVzvy9zpbzJMzysiWZEU3b5LwjQ3XwWuQsknCF8JK73yv\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI3bGeT31Bo", "date_published": "2023-02-09 20:09:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
