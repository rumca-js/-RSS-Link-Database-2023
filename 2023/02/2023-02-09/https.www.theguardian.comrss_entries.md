## Funny Woman review – Gemma Arterton is absolutely captivating in this Nick Hornby adaptation

<p>The actor exudes star power in this take on the popular novel. It blossoms into a colourful romp through the swinging 60s that is very much TV as comfort food</p><p>Funny Woman (Sky Max) is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/24/the-ultimate-single-womans-icon-how-mrs-maisel-is-an-inspiration-across-the-years">a little bit Mrs Maisel</a> and a little bit Carry On. Over six episodes, this charming adaptation of the popular 2014 Nick Hornby novel Funny Girl has taken its new, more mature name and blossomed into a colourful romp through the swinging 60s. Gemma Arterton is Barbara Parker, a beauty queen from the rock factory who loves radio comedy and having a laugh with her dad. She may be in line to marry the best-looking butcher in Blackpool, but the trouble is that nobody is interested in what she has to say. “I am here, if you want to ask me anything?” she suggests to a local reporter, after she has just been crowned Miss Blackpool Belle, 1964. “No thanks, I’ll just make the rest up,” he says, sleazily, like the good fictional TV journalist that he is.</p><p>If this is the kind of world she is living in, then Barbara is having none of it. In the way that modern series about bygone eras often do, Funny Woman wages a gratifying, ahead-of-its-time war against sexism on all fronts. Barbara spreads her wings and flees to London, where she hopes to become a performer of some kind. She watches Lucille Ball on the television at the launderette, and dreams about her future. “I’d love to get paid to muck about,” she says, wistfully. It isn’t long before fate intervenes, though having the face of Gemma Arterton probably helps her along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/09/funny-woman-review-gemma-arterton-nick-hornby-adaptation">Continue reading...</a>

There was music aimed squarely at the recently discovered teenager that frequently seemed to have the specific intention of alienating their forebears. And then there was the music that carried on much as it had in the years between the end of the second world war and the appearance of Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Little Richard et al. Look at the charts from 1952 or 1953, and they’re packed with songs that seem to target an older demographic, who didn’t want shock or rebellion or white-hot excitement, but something to soothe or buoy them along, what eventually became known as easy listening.</p><p>The twain very seldom met: if anything, the divide became more pronounced as the 1960s wore on and a cocktail of new technology and new drugs meant the music aimed at teenagers became more adventurous, strange and innovative. Look at the charts from 1966 or 1967 and you’ll find a stark split: Strawberry Fields Forever and Purple Haze versus Engelbert Humperdinck and Ken Dodd’s Tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/09/burt-bacharach-an-astonishing-creator-of-impermeable-classics-and-super-smooth-adult-pop">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Zinnie Harris’s reworking has Macbeth’s wife driving the plot, rationalising a grisly campaign, while he becomes unbalanced by their murderous path </p><p>To summon up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/08/moonset-review-tron-theatre-glasgow-maryam-hamidi">witches</a> is to play with fire. Could the same be true about summoning up a dead playwright? That is what writer/director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy3euHyTEZM">Zinnie Harris</a> does in her audacious conjuring of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. It is not so much a revival as an exhumation, one in which she dares to speculate what the playwright might have done had he been true to his own instincts.</p><p>For this is a tragedy in which it is not Lady Macbeth but her husband who is mentally unbalanced by the couple’s murderous path to power. Now, Macbeth is the one who, having been told he will sleep no more, becomes ever more delusional. The man who thinks he sees the ghost of Banquo is the same man who goes on to cry, “out damned spot”.</p><p>Macbeth (An Undoing) is at the <a href="https://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/macbeth-an-undoing">Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 February.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/09/macbeth-an-undoing-review-zinnie-harris-reworking-nicole-cooper">Continue reading...</a>

## Qatari owners would take more from Manchester United than Glazers ever did

I’m thinking pre-season tours to Doha. I’m thinking an Mbappé/Rashford reality TV job-swap. I’m thinking luxury party barges on Manchester Ship Canal. A hologrammatic New Trafford to sit directly above the old one. A Phil Jones mural visible from space.</p><p>And so to the news that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani – a private Qatari individual with no direct connection to Qatar itself, unless you churlishly count the fact that he is its head of state – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/08/emir-of-qatar-interested-in-buying-manchester-united-for-45bn">is interested in purchasing United</a>.

I have been removed from all manner of jobs in a wide variety of careers.</p><p>From personal experience, a large part of the problem actually lies with employers.

<p>Big pharma has choices about where to make new investments and, increasingly it seems, it is not choosing Britain</p><p>Another day, another warning from the pharmaceutical sector that ministers’ ambitions to make the UK “a life sciences superpower” are in danger of falling flat. The comments from Sir Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, were different in one important respect, however. He offered a concrete example of how the UK is already losing out as an investment venue.</p><p>AstraZeneca had wanted to build a new $360m “state-of-the-art” manufacturing plant in the north-west of England near its existing facilities in Warrington and Speke. Instead, said Soriot, Ireland got the nod on account of the “discouraging” tax rate in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/feb/09/take-astrazenecas-warning-seriously-the-uk-is-missing-out-in-life-sciences">Continue reading...</a>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to London, Paris and Brussels is not only about fighter jets. It is about arming his country to resist Russian offensives</p><p>Russia is preparing for a long war in Ukraine. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-offensive.html?te=1&amp;nl=russia-ukraine-war-briefing&amp;emc=edit_ruwb_20230201&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Recent reports</a> put the number of Russian troops in Ukraine at about 320,000.

They are there to kill Ukrainians and take territory. Vladimir Putin wants to win the war. He is demanding “sweeping advances”. At the very least he wants to control the Donbas.

What is more, he knows that western European and US leaders now know it too. The logic of this recognition is that the western states have no alternative but to arm Ukraine to win some battles. Mr Zelenskiy’s trip to the west, like his trip to Washington at the end of last year, is designed to secure the weaponry which can make that possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/09/the-guardian-view-on-arms-for-ukraine-a-battlefield-race-against-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zara Aleena’s murder has shone a light on the failures in the system. Fixing them will require more than just funding</p><p>Zara Aleena, a law graduate from Ilford, was walking home from a night out last June when she was killed in a brutal attack. Seven<strong> </strong>months later, the chief inspector of probation concluded that Jordan McSweeney, who raped and murdered Ms Aleena, would not have been free to attack her that night had it not been for a series of blunders. McSweeney had previously been convicted 28 times for assaults on police and civilians, theft and racial harassment, yet his risk level was only classified as “medium”. The concern is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/24/probation-service-ministers-blood-hands-zara-aleena-family-inspector-report">dangerous offenders</a> are being let out with minimal supervision because the probation service in England and Wales is unable to cope.</p><p>Reports from the probation inspectorate point to a creeping internal malaise: officers feel overwhelmed and overworked, with large numbers of people off sick and inexperienced staff taking on complex cases. Most of the service is working beyond its capacity. Some officers have workloads <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64344284">twice as large</a> as they should. Planning for the release of sex offenders has been described as <a href="https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprobation/2021/10/04-october-2021/">“nowhere near good enough”</a>. It is alarming that figures from the <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/exclusive-majority-of-probation-service-currently-working-at-excessive-capacity">Ministry of Justice</a> since 2010 suggest that one person is murdered by someone on probation every week.

<p>Alison Brie plays a TV producer returning to her home town amid a midlife crisis in this oddly pitched and overly serious relationship drama</p><p>This stodgy relationship dramedy is directed by Dave Franco, who co-writes with his star (and wife) Alison Brie. I wonder if at some stage in the past one or both of them have seen Jason Reitman’s jet-black comedy Young Adult, scripted by Diablo Cody? There are some distinct similarities. The tone, however, is different: this is an odd combination of broad semi-satirical humour and deeply serious hugging and learning.</p><p>Brie plays Ally, a producer in LA who long ago abandoned her dream of making serious documentaries and now runs a silly TV reality show. When this gets humiliatingly cancelled by the network, Ally comes miserably back to her home town in a state of midlife crisis and discovers that she is still very much attracted to Sean (Jay Ellis), a handsome, sweet local guy whose heart she broke 10 years ago by leaving him to pursue her film-making career. Sean is now getting married to a stylish and supercool young musician called Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons). Poor, messed-up Ally hangs around, making everyone uncomfortable with her obvious desire to break up this relationship and get back with Sean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/somebody-i-used-to-know-review-dave-franco-directed-dramedy-alison-brie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Docuseries Stolen Youth takes us behind the Sarah Lawrence college cult and Lawrence Ray’s horrifying manipulation of several college students</p><p>In the fall of 2010, a group of sophomores at Sarah Lawrence College, a small liberal arts school 12 miles north of New York City, moved into a campus building called Slonim Woods 9. It was a laid-back college house – dirty kitchen, a lot of hanging out and being high, a half-thought plan to dump sand in one room and make a beach. So it was weird when one of the roommates, Talia Ray, invited her dad, Lawrence “Larry” Ray, to crash on their couch after he was released from prison on vague charges, but not, as several explain in a new Hulu docuseries, <em>that </em>weird. Ray made steak dinners, regaled his daughter’s friends with tales of his time in the marines and psy-ops for the CIA, promised to help some maximize their potential. It was off-putting to some, entrancing to others.</p><p>Over the course of several months, Ray seemed to gain control over several of the housemates – first his daughter Talia’s friend Isabella Pollok, then Talia’s boyfriend Santos Rosario, then another, then another. “Everyone thought Talia’s dad was weird, but then one by one he would get them alone, and suddenly he’s the greatest thing to happen to them,” says Raven Juarez, whose best friend and boyfriend both fell under Ray’s spell and cut off contact with her, in Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence. “I had a lot of theories, but none of them were are horrible as what was actually to come.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/09/stolen-youth-documentary-hulu-sarah-lawrence-cult">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Tetzlaff/Tetzlaff/Vogt<br />(Ondine, two CDs)<br /></strong>The late pianist is outstanding in these last recordings, accompanied by his longtime collaborators, the violinist Christian Tetzlaff and his cellist sister Tanja</p><p>The pianist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/12/lars-vogt-obituary">Lars Vogt</a> died in September last year. His cancer had been diagnosed in 2021, and he was already ill when, against doctors’ advice, he had travelled to Bremen to begin these Schubert recordings with his longtime collaborators, the violinist <a href="https://www.christian-tetzlaff.de/biography2/?lang=en">Christian Tetzlaff</a> and his cellist sister <a href="https://en.tanjatetzlaff.com/">Tanja</a>. They began with the death-haunted E flat Trio, D929, with its funeral-march second movement, and recorded the B flat Trio, D898 four months later. In the sleeve notes to the set, the Tetzlaffs discuss the background to the sessions, paying touching tribute to their friend and his music making: “I find that in the recording,” says Tanja, “one notices that deep inside he already knew that in all likelihood he wasn’t going to be able to live very much longer.”</p><p>And fine as the playing of the Tetzlaffs is, appropriately it is Vogt’s wonderfully unshowy, rhythmically crisp and never overbearing playing that seems to characterise these outstanding performances, from his whisper-quiet pianissimos to the most forceful triple fortes. The strings match his wonderful dynamic range, too; the music flows naturally, without a moment of contrivance or artificiality, or any hint of sentimentality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/09/schubert-piano-trios-etc-review-lars-vogt">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Nottingham Playhouse<br /></strong>Christy Lefteri’s novel is an account of a perilous journey from Syria to England that, despite renewed poignancy, makes for an uneven drama</p><p>Christy Lefteri’s bestseller The Beekeeper of Aleppo is a powerful story but does it make good theatre? Her 2019 novel, inspired by two summers spent working in a refugee camp in Athens, has now been adapted by Nesrin Alrefaai and Matthew Spangler. The tale of beekeeper Nuri and his wife Afra’s nightmarish journey from Syria to England may be harrowing in its components but Miranda Cromwell’s touring production doesn’t do enough to support the script’s gut-wrenching chronology; it feels formulaic and lacks finesse.</p><p>The dialogue is often rapid and expressive. We dart from Nuri’s once blissful life to the crowded camps of Greece and then on to meetings with uncaring immigration officers on British shores. The words paint a graphic, panoramic portrait of his shattered and traumatised mind. Memory, illusions and reality become one, with voices from his past bleeding into his present. As Nuri, Alfred Clay is aptly emotionally unavailable – when his wife (Roxy Faridany) tries to touch him, we feel her pain as he slowly backs away. With expert sound design by Tingying Dong, Nuri’s inner thoughts become glaring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/09/the-beekeeper-of-aleppo-review-nottingham-playhouse">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Roundhouse, London<br /></strong>The singer-songwriter’s secular hymnals and eerie psych-folk songs have an almost sacred quality when played live, leaving the crowd in a state of spellbound rapture</p><p>Weyes Blood has a way of transforming any old stage into a cathedral. Dressed in a white caped gown and backlit by soft light, she recalls the image of a religious icon. To borrow the words of Flannery O’Connor – whose novel Wise Blood is the origin of Los Angeles singer-songwriter Natalie Mering’s moniker – her voice is “Christ-haunted”: serene, yet heavy with experience that belies her years. Her sold-out performance at The Roundhouse has a congregation in silent rapture: scared to move, scared to raise a phone, in case it should break the spell.</p><p>She sings of love everlasting, curses and blessings, but also of James Dean, freeways and feeling alone at a party. Her spirituality is hard to name, but California runs through her veins. Mering’s otherworldly take on Americana has led her to collaborate with Perfume Genius and Lana Del Rey, and she shares their sense of longing. Her fifth record, And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow, is a lonely, hymnal collection and in a live space her songs take on a sacred quality. There are more than three thousand people here, but we might as well be friends gathered around a campfire. The eerie edge of Mering’s nostalgic psych-folk and soft-rock is softened by her gentleness. It feels like it’s just us, Mering and her guitar – to a degree, her band feels like part of the scenery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/09/weyes-blood-review-the-roundhouse-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Impressive dancer, authentic redneck and sensitive confidant – as the threequel Magic Mike’s Last Dance is released this week, we strip down Tatum’s back catalogue</p><p>In 2006, Channing Tatum broke out as a body-popping bad boy in the street dance movie Step Up, an ideal showcase for the limber skills he had honed while working as a stripper. But the same year this goofy boarding-school comedy – a loose adaptation of Twelfth Night, with Amanda Bynes disguised as a dude – helped to cement his future brand. As jacked soccer jock Duke, you might assume Tatum would be a sexist lug. Instead, he stands out as a sensitive confidant who can also land a serious scissor-kick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/channing-tatums-10-best-performances-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Atlantic)<br /></strong>The pop-punk band have progressed from teenage bile to thirtysomething angst, expressed with agitated drumming, angular guitars, big riffs and heartfelt lyrics </p><p>In 2007, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/paramore">Paramore</a> released their breakthrough hit, Misery Business. It’s a song the band have a complicated relationship with. A few years ago, singer Hayley Williams began offering caveats about it – “I haven’t related to it in a very long time”, “I wrote it … because I was a dick”, “let’s celebrate that we’ve all done a lot of growing up since then” – then, for a period, declined to perform it at all. She made an exception for a guest appearance at Coachella with Billie Eilish, and Paramore returned the song to their sets last year, after four years not playing it. A song that tears vicious strips off a love rival, Misery Business has been dismissed by Williams as an example of “internalised misogyny”.</p><p>It’s definitely a potent expression of raw, unfiltered teenage bile – the kind of emotion that feels all-consuming at the time, but which makes you wince when you recall it years later – and its increasingly troubled position within Paramore’s oeuvre is a perfect example of the difficulties that can face artists who grow up in public. You might not have expected a combustible band who made their name with temper tantrums such as Misery Business to last long, but they’re still here, still filling stadiums, godparents to a younger generation of angsty singer-songwriters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/09/paramore-this-is-why-review-deft-songs-of-millennial-malaise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As she scrambles her way to the top of the tabloid career ladder, May’s joyless, fearful Becky Sharp reflects the grim reality of how the world works</p><p>Mention William Thackeray’s Vanity Fair, and the image that comes to most people’s minds is that of young Becky Sharp flinging her copy of Johnson’s “Dixonary” – a school leaving present – out of the carriage window as it drives off. It’s a defiant gesture typical of this high-spirited heroine, who grapples her way up through society from poor-orphan status to financial and social security.</p><p>Becky’s story has been updated for the mass-media age by Sarah May, author of The Nudist Colony, as well as several lighter novels such as The Rise and Fall of the Queen of Suburbia, a blackly comic take on middle-class family disasters. Here, it seems May has roughly mapped the story of Thackeray’s heroine on to elements of Rebekah Brooks, the former tabloid editor turned CEO of News UK. Although May insists in her introduction that her characters are entirely fictitious, there’s the ambition, the “trademark restless hair”, the rapid ascent to the top of the tabloid career ladder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/09/becky-by-sarah-may-review-a-vanity-fair-for-the-mass-media-age">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour’s bowing to business contrasts with the boldness of the US president’s green industrial policies. There is an opportunity to be grasped</p><p>The severe crises humanity faces will not be solved by the outdated rules of the global economy. Keir Starmer came close to recognising this in his new year’s speech, when he spoke of his plans for “<a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/keir-starmer-new-years-speech/">mission-driven</a>” government. The phrase – borrowed from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mazzucato-mariana">Mariana Mazzucato</a> – implies governments setting economic goals (say, 100% renewable energy) and single-mindedly driving that goal forward through investment and regulation.</p><p>In essence, this is an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/04/keir-starmer-government-labour-leader">acceptance that government planning</a>, state intervention and public ownership, so derided over 40 years of neoliberalism, are necessary tools of government today, and it’s what makes Labour’s industrial strategy central to any progressive offer to the country.</p><p>Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/09/keir-starmer-green-economy-joe-biden-us-industrial-policies">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Octagon theatre, Bolton<br /></strong>An impressive cast featuring the former TV presenter and Mina Anwar deliver an affecting and funny revival of Bill Naughton’s tale about a suppertime spat</p><p>In Mog on Fox Night by Judith Kerr, the family cat would prefer an egg to the fish in her bowl but grumpy Mr Thomas insists Mog finish what she’s been given. This, bizarrely, is the same bitter dispute that motors Bill Naughton’s Bolton drama in which Hilda Crompton returns home tipsy on a Friday night and the prospect of herring for tea turns her stomach. Her father Rafe nixes an alternative from mother Daisy (“there’s no fried eggs coming on the scene!”) and the uneaten herring causes trouble all weekend.</p><p>Lotte Wakeham’s in-the-round production brings us snugly into Katie Scott’s 1960s living-room set, with clustered photo frames hanging above. They contain the kind of wedding snaps that grow familiar as wallpaper to a family but Naughton shows how long it naturally takes us to fully appreciate the daily ins and outs of our parents’ lives, especially before they had children. The most touching moment comes when the restrained Rafe says his offspring will understand his love when they tend a sick infant of their own.</p><p>At the <a href="https://octagonbolton.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/spring-and-port-wine/">Octagon, Bolton</a>, until 4 March.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/09/spring-and-port-wine-review-les-dennis-bolton-octagon">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s a movie about democracy’: Luis Moreno Ocampo on the Oscar-nominated Argentina 1985

In the trial of the juntas we learned to treat violent people not as enemies but as criminals, but when I moved to the ICC in 2003 the world was treating violent people as enemies to kill,” he says, with the same energy and enthusiasm at 70 as the fictional 32-year-old version of himself is portrayed on screen.<br /><br />The film’s Oscar nomination in the best international feature film category has put the spotlight not only on Moreno Ocampo’s dogged pursuit of human rights abusers but also on his stubborn faith that – when it comes to peventing genocide – reconciling ideological divides is as important as winning convictions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/argentina-1985-luis-moreno-ocampo-oscars-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## The stress secret: 12 ways to meditate – without actually meditating

<p>Many people struggle with classic forms of meditation, but its benefits are still available. From writing and drawing to pottery or singing, here are everyday ways to find peace</p><p>Meditation isn’t for everyone. Or at least not when life has taken you so far from calm that your brain is soup. “It’s the nature of the mind to have this ongoing conversation in the background,” says Joy Rains, a mindfulness practitioner and author of Meditation Illuminated: Simple Ways to Manage Your Busy Mind. “I call this ‘Stuff’, which is an acronym for stories, thoughts, urges, frustrations and feelings. When you’re in a meditative state, you’re in the here and now and you’re releasing your Stuff. You’re not getting caught up in judgments, thoughts about the past, worries about the future.”</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence that “releasing our Stuff” like this is an effective antidote to 21st-century life, helping us to concentrate, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24571182/">remember things</a> and become more <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26231761/">self-aware</a>, while <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772979/">reducing anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383597/">depression</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24395196/">stress</a>. The good news is that we don’t have to be brilliant at sitting still and focusing on our breath to get meditation’s recuperating benefits, says psychologist Suzy Reading. Despite also being a yoga teacher, Reading admits to having struggled with traditional meditation practices, “and they are inaccessible for a lot of people. But that’s not to say that meditation is not for them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/09/the-stress-secret-12-ways-to-meditate-without-actually-meditating">Continue reading...</a>

They include a variety of wearable sensors that read the brain’s electrical impulses and can show how fatigued you are, whether you’re focused on the task at hand or if your attention is wandering. According to Farahany, thousands of companies have hooked workers ranging from train drivers to miners up to these devices already, in the name of workplace safety. But what we are really discussing is workplace surveillance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/09/boss-spies-brainwaves-dystopian-future">Continue reading...</a>

One play later, from an identical formation, Philly’s quarterback took the snap and plunged forward to his left, forcing his way into the end zone with some help from tight end Dallas Goedert and running back Boston Scott behind him, shoving him over the line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/09/quarterback-sneak-jalen-hurts-rugby-super-bowl-eagles-chiefs">Continue reading...</a>

## Hooked on a feeling: why do certain songs go round and round – and round – our heads? | Emma Brockes

<p>Streaming of Linda Ronstadt’s Long Long Time rose by 4,900% the day after it featured on The Last of Us. It wasn’t all because of me</p><p>I’ve been here before, but not for a while. The last attack, from memory, was Cyndi Lauper’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdQY7BusJNU">Time After Time</a>, but that was quick – I was in and out in two days. Same goes for Petula Clark’s Don’t Sleep in the Subway. There was a weird period when the needle stuck – no judgment – on Dan Stevens (Dan Stevens!) singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diLa-gpHRKc">Evermore</a> from the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack, which must have had to do with my then very young children and had to be borne with patience until it worked itself out. There was Macca doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqQ5BPtuj4o">Golden Slumbers</a>. Which reminds me, oh God, of the week I lost to In My Life, except, crucially, it was the 1991 Bette Midler cover version not the Beatles’ 1965 original. All I can say is it made sense at the time.</p><p>Last week, like the return of a fever dream, I fell into a deep, unfightable obsession with a single song, that in the last seven days I have played on a loop probably hundreds of times. I have listened to it while I’m stacking the dishwasher and making the kids’ lunches. It has taken me round the supermarket, and back and forth to a doctor’s appointment. My apartment has never been so tidy, tidying providing me with an excuse to put off work for another five minutes so I can get in two more revolutions. At night, I’ve warned my children that if they fall off the sofa and start screaming I won’t hear them because I’ve got my Pods in and, for reasons I can’t explain but that they may one day understand, I am compelled to listen to Linda Ronstadt over and over and over and over until suddenly, just as abruptly as it started, it stops.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/09/songs-streaming-linda-ronstadt-last-of-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gregor Townsend’s side displayed courage against England: will they win their first two games for the first time since 1996?</p><p>Thirteen minutes to play at Twickenham, and Scotland trail by four. They have a penalty on England’s 22. It’s a straightforward kick to the corner if they want to take a crack at the lineout but their captain, Jamie Ritchie, doesn’t fancy it. He asks Finn Russell to take the shot at goal. If Russell makes it they’ll still be one point off England’s lead, but Ritchie believes there’s enough time left for them to win it yet, and Russell agrees with him. It’s a big call. This is a different England team to the one that started the match, they’ve made six replacements, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Ben Youngs and Anthony Watson among them.</p><p>England have well over 700 Test caps on the field now, almost 50 a man. Some of them, like Youngs, have been playing international rugby since Ritchie was trying to fight his way into the school first XV back at Strathallan. They know enough between them to pin Scotland back in their own half, and make sure the final stretch of the game is played right down by the visitor’s try-line. Only Scotland aren’t planning to wait for England to slip and gift them the match; they’re thinking they can rip it from them as soon as they win possession.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/09/rugby-union-scotland-england-six-nations-twickenham-gregor-townsend">Continue reading...</a>

## The Hero of This Book by Elizabeth McCracken review – all about my mother

<p>A bereaved daughter’s memories summon a vivid portrait of an indomitable woman </p><p>Reproduced on the first page of Elizabeth McCracken’s new novel there is a photograph. It shows a dedication scrawled in the front of her first book, Here’s Your Hat What’s Your Hurry. “For Mom,” it reads, “whose life history I will continue to mine, but who will never – no matter what she or anybody else thinks – appear as a character in my work, being too good for the likes of one of my characters.”</p><p>The unnamed narrator of The Hero of This Book has recently lost her mother, Natalie. (“I apologise if you hate such narrators and such novels,” the narrator writes, not very apologetically. “We have this in common. I hate novels with unnamed narrators. I didn’t mean to write one.”) It is 2019, “the summer before the world stopped”, and she is visiting London alone. As she walks around the city, a place her mother loved and which they had visited together three years earlier, everything reminds her of Natalie. She crosses the Millennium Bridge, looks at the Rothkos in Tate Modern, drinks a 10.30am prosecco in the cafe. Meanwhile her memories loop round on each other: some recent, some so old as to have become part of the family mythology. In fragments alternately profound and mundane (and, this being McCracken, often both at the same time), they summon her clever, wilful, witty, opinionated, indomitable, fiercely private and tirelessly optimistic oddball mother, who was “more fun than anyone I knew”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/09/the-hero-of-this-book-by-elizabeth-mccracken-review-all-about-my-mother">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Like Libby in Fleishman Is in Trouble, I never pictured myself here.

Watching alongside my own husband, a proud son of the Garden state, I noticed him taking in the scene with an expression of the purest contentment. That man loves New Jersey. And lately I’ve had to admit that I like it, too.</p><p>This is counter to expectation. Writing this week in New York Magazine, Cailin Moscatello <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/02/the-fleishman-is-in-trouble-effect.html">interviewed</a> a number of mothers for whom Libby’s plight triggered feelings about their own suburban New Jersey lives of desperation, shopping in Target amongst “pod people” and longing for the kind of money that pays for private school and luxurious bathroom renovations. I’m not without sympathy for them: I, too, look up people’s house values on Zillow. Much like Libby, I now live in the New Jersey suburbs near New York City and feel disconnected from the creative ambitions of my pre-parent life.

<p>This important film tells the story of a community battered by rape and patriarchal ideas, as a mainly female cast debate the repercussions of the brutality meted out to them<br /></p><p>Sarah Polley’s sober, sombre ensemble picture stars Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley and Frances McDormand, among others, as traumatised female members of a remote, patriarchal religious colony, and it’s a heartfelt new engagement with the #MeToo debate, reminding us that the world of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/24/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-unburnable-edition">really does exist</a> more literally than you think. The movie thinks its way intuitively into the darkest spaces of violence and survival, and attempts to give women a voice where they had none; it is, as the opening title says, “an act of female imagination”. And if the result is just a little stagey and verbose, telling rather than showing the rage and the fear, it is also a calm and focused way of addressing ethical issues.</p><p>It is based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/10/mennonites-rape-bolivia">a horrific real-life mass rape case from 2011</a> in a religious Mennonite community in Bolivia. Supposedly God-fearing men had over a period of four years or more been spraying farm-animal anaesthetic into the bedrooms of sleeping wives, daughters and mothers and raping them – and later blaming Satan or the women’s own imaginations. Seven perpetrators were finally arrested and convicted but the colony’s entire male population was arguably complicit in turning a blind eye. Women Talking is adapted from a novel by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/18/miriam-toews-interview-women-talking-mennonite">Miriam Toews</a>, who herself once took an acting role in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/07/romance.drama">Carlos Reygadas’s movie Silent Light</a>, set in a Mennonite community in Mexico.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/09/women-talking-review-ensemble-drama-forefronts-female-experience-of-violence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You thought spending six figures on a car might guarantee someone will fix it? Think again</p><p>Schadenfreude is a dark and powerful force, although, upon looking it up, it’s not quite what I thought it was. Malicious pleasure in the misfortunes of others, says Chambers. Mine’s not exactly like that – it’s better, and worse. Better in the sense that my pleasure isn’t malicious; it’s less about malice than amusement. But it’s worse in that it’s not all “others” I apply it to. Just my friends.</p><p>One of my closest friends has a Porsche Taycan, a reassuringly expensive electric sports car. To his distress, the heating has gone kaput. Now, I thought the whole point of spending six figures on a motor was that a) it would never break down and b) if it did, a quick phone call to a special number would be enough to get a helicopter full of German engineers dispatched to your home address to put things right. Maybe they’d abseil on to the drive if they can’t land in the garden.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/09/friend-freezing-cold-porsche-adrian-chiles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2016, artist César Aréchiga talked one of Mexico’s most dangerous maximum security prisons into letting him run art classes for its inmates, many of them violent gang members. Could he really change their lives?</p><p>After two decades working in some of Mexico’s toughest prisons, warden Ángeles Zavala thought she had seen it all. Then one morning in 2016, she arrived for work at Puente Grande prison to find a local artist waiting for her. The man had recently completed a few workshops with inmates in another part of the prison, and had a proposal. Speaking in rapid-fire bursts, the artist told Ángeles he wanted to move into the maximum-security prison and live there for six weeks, in order to teach some of the country’s most dangerous inmates how to paint. Through art therapy, he would help them change their lives. And he wanted to start with the veteran narcos of Mexico’s violent drug war.</p><p>“I was thinking: ‘What is wrong with him?’” Ángeles said later. “‘Everyone is trying to get out and César wants to live here?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/portrait-of-a-killer-art-class-in-one-of-mexicos-most-notorious-prisons">Continue reading...</a>

## The serious side of ‘mansplaining’ has been lost. That’s where the harm begins | Rebecca Solnit

<p>The key context of the word I coined in 2008 is that mansplaining is one part of a huge problem – of who gets listened to, and who gets believed</p><p>I have a file on my desktop titled Mansplaining Olympic Tryouts, mostly screenshots of some of the most epic specimens I’ve come across on social media or that people have steered my way. They’re grimly hilarious: a man explaining vaginas to a noted female gynaecologist, a man telling Sinn Féin adviser Siobhán Fenton to read the Good Friday agreement (she replied with a picture of herself with the book she wrote on that agreement), and the famous incident with Dr Jessica McCarty, about which <a href="https://twitter.com/jmccarty_geo/status/1361332337678639107?lang=en-GB">she </a>tweeted: “At a Nasa Earth meeting 10 years ago, a white male postdoc interrupted me to tell me that I don’t understand human drivers of fire, that I def needed to read McCarty et al. I looked him in the eye, pulled my long hair back so he could read my name tag. ‘I’m McCarty et al.’”</p><p>The word mansplaining was coined by an anonymous person in response to my 2008 essay <a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/rebecca-solnit-men-explain-things-to-me/">Men Explain Things to Me</a> and has had a lively time of it ever since.

By the end of season three, even she was too much of a killer for him, so Love had to go, taking with her the increasingly diluted gag about whether anyone was talking about love or Love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/09/you-season-four-review-penn-badgleys-frothy-thriller-is-awful-and-hugely-entertaining">Continue reading...</a>

Zelenskiy met with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, urging them to be “game changers” by sending modern planes and then “the quicker this Russian aggression will end”.</p><p><strong>Macron said Paris would “continue the efforts” to deliver arms to Kyiv</strong>, adding that France was determined to help Ukraine towards “victory, peace and Europe”. “Russia cannot and must not win,” he said, adding that “the future of Europe” was at stake in Ukraine. <strong>Scholz said it was clear that Moscow would not win</strong>, and assured Ukraine its future was in the EU, saying Ukraine was part of the “European family”. “Putin will not achieve his goals – not on the battlefield and not through a dictated peace.”</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said Macron had undergone a significant change in his stance towards Ukraine</strong> after the French president had sought to keep channels open to Russia in the early phase of the conflict. “I think he [Macron] has changed,” Zelenskiy said in an interview published in <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/volodymyr-zelensky-au-figaro-si-poutine-gagne-cette-guerre-il-recommencera-la-meme-chose-ailleurs-20230208">Le Figaro</a> on Wednesday night. “And he’s changed for real this time. After all, he opened the door to tank deliveries. He also supported Ukraine’s candidacy for the EU. I believe it was a real signal. We had a lot of conversations with France, Germany and other countries. I believe that trust is real today.”</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy also made an emotional appeal to the UK to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/08/volodymyr-zelenskiy-thanks-mps-and-address-in-speech-to-british-parliament">supply Ukraine with fighter jets</a> on a surprise visit to the UK earlier on Wednesday.</strong> “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircrafts – for Ukraine! Wings – for freedom!” he said. Rishi Sunak, previously opposed to handing over UK jets, has ordered a defence ministry review into whether Zelenskiy’s request can be met, saying “nothing was off the table”.</p><p><strong>Pledges of support by Sunak, the UK prime minister, included training Ukrainian pilots on advanced Nato fighter jets</strong> “to ensure Ukraine can defend its skies well into the future”. Sunak added: “The first step in being able to provide advanced aircrafts is to have soldiers or aviators that are capable of using them. That is a process. It takes some time, we’ve started that process today.”</p><p>The expansion of the UK’s training programme to include fighter pilots is significant as Zelenskiy has <strong>repeatedly called on western countries to supply planes</strong>. The UK has so far refused, arguing that the RAF’s F-35 and Typhoon jets take too long for pilots to train on. Sunak also confirmed that UK Challenger 2 tanks would be deployed in Ukraine next month.</p><p><strong>The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there was no sign of Russia preparing for peace.</strong> “On the contrary, Moscow is preparing for new military offensives,” he said during a joint press conference with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy was expected to travel to Brussels on Thursday, with leaders of EU countries due there for a summit.</strong> A senior Ukrainian official said the president would ask for more arms to fight Russia and for the EU to move quickly on Ukraine’s bid to join. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, would meet with Zelenskiy on the sidelines of a European Council meeting, a government source told Reuters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-351-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
