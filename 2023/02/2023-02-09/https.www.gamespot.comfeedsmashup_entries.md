<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>: The Witch Queen, Bungie introduced weapon crafting, and with that came a pile of new materials. Bungie eventually removed some of those materials but still required players to use Resonant Elements when Shaping and Reshaping weapons at the Relic. In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab-02-09-2023">this week's blog post</a>, Bungie shared changes players should expect with weapon crafting in Year 6 with Lightfall's launch.</p><p>Firstly, Bungie plans to remove Deepsight Resonance attunement progress from craftable weapons. Attunement progress was required on red-border weapons to get Resonant Elements and extract Weapon Patterns for crafting. With Resonance gone, Resonant Elements will leave Destiny 2 as well.</p><p>The developer's reason for this change is that it wants to "integrate weapon crafting into the broader core economy," according to the blog post. Common currencies like Glimmer and Enhancement Cores will replace the removed elements.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-will-remove-deepsight-and-resonant-elements-for-weapon-crafting/1100-6511395/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The second pair of games in Prime Gaming's February 2023 lineup are available to claim for free right now. Amazon Prime members can snag Aerial_Knight's Never Yield and Divine Knockout, which can be claimed by linking your Epic Games Store account to Prime Gaming. The pair of free games comprise the second of four batches that will be available throughout February. Prime Gaming is giving away nine free games in all this month as well as a bunch of in-game loot for popular multiplayer titles.</p><p>Unlike usual, Prime Gaming isn't giving away all of the free monthly games at once. Instead, the freebies are being released in waves that will be available every Thursday for the rest of February. Keep in mind that you can still claim freebies from previous weeks throughout the entire month of February. Here's the full schedule of Prime Gaming free games for February:</p><ul><li><strong>February 2</strong><ul><li><strong>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind GOTY Edition </strong></li><li><strong>Onsen Master</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>February 9</strong><ul><li><strong>Aerial_Knight's Never Yield</strong></li><li><strong>Divine Knockout</strong></li></ul></li><li>February 16  <ul><li>One Hand Clapping</li><li>BATS: Bloodsucker Anti-Terror Squad</li></ul></li><li>February 23  <ul><li>Space Crew: Legendary edition</li><li>Tunche</li><li>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</li></ul></li></ul><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">See all free games at Prime Gaming</a> </div><p>The nine freebies span across a multitude of genres. Morrowind GOTY Edition is undoubtedly the best-known of the bunch. It's the game that really catapulted Elder Scrolls to RPG stardom, and it's still worth checking out all these years later. This edition comes with a pair of huge expansions, and you could easily sink over 100 hours into the massive open-world RPG.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-weeks-2-free-games-for-amazon-prime-members-are-live/1100-6510888/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New Crime Boss: Rockay City Gameplay Trailer Is All About Protecting Drugs

<p dir="ltr">To be the top dog in Crime Boss: Rockay City, you've got to defend what's yours. The newest trailer for the first-person shooter shows Michael Madsen's Travis Barker expecting a shipment of blue pills. It's up to players to protect the drugs, but Vanilla Ice's Hielo and his gang are fixing to steal them.</p><p dir="ltr">That's the setup for this gameplay trailer, which shows players on a highway protecting the "candy." Hielo's gangs are swarming a truck with the drugs in the back. The perspective is from a character named Quarterback, who's wielding a pistol and submachine gun against the enemies. He's also working with Teddybear to stave off their rivals in the video below.</p><p dir="ltr">But unfortunately, this mission ends in failure. Thus, publisher 505 Games and developer Ingame Studios offer insight into how Crime Boss: Rockay City carries on when players don't succeed. In this case, a cutscene shows Barker and Kim Basinger's Casey getting updated in a bar about their drugs being stolen. Barker responds that he wants his candy back by dawn.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-crime-boss-rockay-city-gameplay-trailer-is-all-about-protecting-drugs/1100-6511392/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After the announcement of a The Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom Amiibo at the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-february-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6511344/">Nintendo Direct</a>, the company's official Twitter account has clarified how Amiibo will work in the upcoming game.</p><p>In short, Zelda-themed Amiibo will give the player materials and weapons, much like they did in Breath of the Wild. They can also provide various paraglider fabrics and which one you receive seems to be based on which Amiibo you use. Pictured fabrics include one based on Link's outfit in Tears of the Kingdom, one with a light blue pastel color and the symbol of Skyloft's Knights from Skyward Sword, and a glider fabric with a print of Majora's Mask from the game of the same name.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Scanning amiibo from The Legend of Zelda series will also give you helpful materials and weapons.

Amiibo from outside of the series may also grant useful items, like they did in the last game, but they will not provide Legend of Zelda-themed cosmetics or weapons. The Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo will release on the same date as the game, May 12.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amiibo-in-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-dispense-helpful-items-and-paraglider-cosmetics/1100-6511393/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/knockout-city/">Knockout City</a>'s days are numbered, but for Velan Studios, there's still a strong sense of optimism. Though the live-service PvP dodgeball game nears its second anniversary on May 21, it'll only exist in its current state for another few weeks beyond that. In a February blog post, Velan revealed that Knockout City will be taken offline on June 6, with the silver-lining exception being that Velan will enable private servers to be hosted on PC thereafter.</p><p dir="ltr">The news came as the latest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/">a series of live-service game closures that defined January 2023</a>, and looking back a few years proves this was no one-month trend. It's getting harder to stay afloat in the competitive and ever-changing world of live-service video games. As Knockout City is a personal favorite of mine, the news hit me like, well, a dodgeball to the face. I wanted to speak to the team to find out what it's like when a game you love working on is ending on the market's terms rather than your own. Though those I spoke to admitted there is a sadness to the situation, they weren't without hope for what's next, both within Velan and across the industry--even if it'll take a paradigm shift to get things where they need to be.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is my favorite game I've ever worked on," game director Jeremy Russo told me. "And it's also one of my favorite games I've ever played. Like, I still play this. And if you talk to most developers, none of them play their own game. But I still have a blast logging in and playing with my friends, grouping up, and going into these brawls."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-citys-closure-is-part-of-a-painful-truth-of-the-games-industry-studio-says/1100-6511390/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Before the launch of yearly expansions in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, some content enters the Destiny Content Vault, removing it from the game. In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab-02-09-2023">this week's blog post</a>, Bungie shared some items, currencies, and quests that will enter the Destiny Content Vault when Lightfall launches on February 28 as Destiny 2's Year 6 DLC, and it includes the bulk of the new seasonal content from the past year.</p><p>All bounties, missions, and quests from Season of the Risen--which launched with The Witch Queen expansion--up through the current Season of the Seraph will leave the game, except for PsiOps and Heist Battlegrounds activities. All Battlegrounds activities will be in the Vanguard Ops playlist in the upcoming season.</p><p>Additionally, Ritual weapons, Pinnacle weapon quests, and Ornaments earned from Season 16 to Season 19 will enter the DCV. However, such gear will be available at the Monument to Lost Lights Exotic Archive at the Tower by the Vault.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-seasonal-content-and-items-are-leaving-destiny-2-with-lightfall-release/1100-6511387/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nintendo is once again selling "game vouchers" on the Nintendo Switch eShop. The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">vouchers allow you to get two games for $100</a>, offering a savings of up to $30. Though most pairs of games you can pick will save you $20 total, the voucher program includes <a href="https://howl.me/ci5OoMYsejg?u1=subid_value">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which costs $70 on its own. If you don't mind going digital for your Switch games, this is a great opportunity to save some cash on your preorders.</p><p>There are currently five upcoming Switch exclusives in the voucher program:</p><ul><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - May 12</li><li>Pikmin 4 - July 21</li><li>Advance Wars 1 + 2: Re-Boot Camp - April 21</li><li>Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon - March 17</li><li>Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe - February 24</li></ul><p>Combining Tears of the Kingdom with any of the other four will save you $30 overall. Essentially, you're getting Switch exclusives for $50 a pop. Since Nintendo Switch exclusives aren't discounted as often as other games, this is a pretty remarkable deal.

The update will include a lot of cosmetic items, but also new maps and other content.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=189493">blog post</a> on Steam describes it as "a full-on update sized update" that will include items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and possibly other inclusions. While the past few summer updates have been exclusively item updates, this will be a broader and bigger addition to the game.</p><p>Primarily, the blog post is a heads up for Steam Workshop creators to work on potential items. The summer update does not have any particular theme yet, so creators are welcome to upload anything that strikes their fancy. The post urges Steam Workshop users to get their submissions in by May 1.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-will-receive-a-large-update-this-summer/1100-6511388/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger has revealed that Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige was nearly fired in 2015 before Iger stepped in to stop that from happening.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/09/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-disney-ceo-bob-iger-speaks-with-cnbcs-david-faber-on-squawk-on-the-street-today.html">Speaking to CNBC</a>, Iger said Marvel chairman and former president Ike Perlmutter wanted Feige gone, for reasons unknown. "In 2015 he was intent on firing Kevin Feige who was running Marvel... and I thought that was a mistake and stepped in to prevent that from happening," Iger said. "I think Kevin is an incredibly, incredibly talented executive that you know... the Marvel track record speaks for itself."</p><p>Iger made the call to shift the production of Marvel movies to fall under the purview of Alan Horn, who was heading up Walt Disney Studios at the time, taking it away from Perlmutter.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-kevin-feige-was-almost-fired-in-2015/1100-6511382/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Will there be a new Call of Duty game in 2023 or not? That's been the subject of a good amount of speculation in recent times. Now, a report says Activision is going forward with a "full premium standalone release" in 2023. It was previously reported that Activision would instead opt to release "premium DLC" for Modern Warfare II instead of a new game in 2023.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2023-will-have-a-beta-campaign-early-access-and-more/">Insider-Gaming</a> reported that this "appears to have been true at one point," but now Activision has decided to release a full game. Very little is known about what COD 2023 could be, but Insider-Gaming reported that it will be "heavily connected" to the Modern Warfare series.</p><p>Sledgehammer Games is the reported developer of COD 2023, but like with Activision's other Call of Duty games, development will be distributed between Activision's numerous other studios, the report said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2023-will-be-a-full-game-connected-to-modern-warfare-report-says/1100-6511385/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Pacific Drive Offers A Spooky Twist On The Roguelite Genre, And Takes Place Mostly In Your Car

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pacific-drive/">Pacific Drive</a> first caught my attention in 2022 during September's PlayStation State of Play presentation thanks to its intriguing concept. The debut title of Ironwood Studios, Pacific Drive is a run-based, first-person survival game in which you explore an anomaly-filled reimagining of the Pacific Northwest (called the Olympic Exclusion Zone) from behind the wheel of a car you discovered in a rundown garage. I attended a preview event for the game where I got to see a scripted build of Pacific Drive and toss out questions to Ironwood Studios founder and creative director Alex Dracott and lead gameplay designer Seth Rosen. Based on my time spent with the game, Pacific Drive looks like an enjoyably tense game to play.</p><p dir="ltr">In Pacific Drive, you find yourself trapped on the wrong side of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, a place beholden to a strange supernatural weather phenomenon and filled with government secrets, bizarre geography, and terrifying monsters. Stumbling upon an abandoned garage, you make it your home base and plot your escape. Your only way of navigating the Zone is via the station wagon you find in the garage. As you venture out into the Zone, you'll find that the environmental hazards and enemies shift and change with each run, meaning you'll have to adapt on the fly even if you explore a part of the Zone you've already visited. As you explore, you can find resources to repair the damage done to your car as well as scrap that can be taken back to the garage to permanently upgrade your home base and unlock new add-ons for your vehicle.</p><p dir="ltr">The Zone possesses some form of intellect and will do its best to push you out upon noticing your presence. This makes revisiting areas of the Zone you've just traveled to incredibly dangerous, encouraging you to constantly branch out and slowly explore in a wide net of directions instead of pushing straight for your goal on a single road. And when you want to return to the garage, the signal you put out to mark your path back alerts the Zone. To stop you, the Zone will create a dangerous storm of glowing red energy that slowly encloses around you--much like the ring in a battle royale. You can't die in the Zone, but if you or your car take enough damage, the car's emergency protocol activates and teleports the two of you back to the garage, a process that burns through most of the resources you recovered on that particular run.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pacific-drive-offers-a-spooky-twist-on-the-roguelite-genre-and-takes-place-mostly-in-your-car/1100-6511381/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Super Mario Bros. movie is two months away and Illumination and Universal are gearing up the hype with more posters and promotional footage. We've seen the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-movie-poster-revealed-and-it-looks-great/1100-6511191/">first full poster</a> showing all the characters, as well as teaser posters featuring individual characters. The latest one features Princess Peach on her Mach Bike racing down the infamous Rainbow Road from Mario Kart. </p><figure style="width: 960px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4097300-download%2826%29.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4097300-download%2826%29.jpg" /></a></figure><p>We knew Rainbow Road would be part of the movie as it was featured in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-super-mario-bros-trailer-is-a-full-on-mario-party/1100-6509555/">first full trailer</a>. She's being chased by what appears to be a gorilla gang on all sorts of karts from Mario Kart. It's unclear if we're going to see any of the Evil Kings from Donkey Kong Jungle Beat or if these are new characters altogether.</p><p>The new animated film is produced by Illumination, the company behind the Despicable Me and the Minions franchises, and is directed by animation veterans Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. The screenplay was written by The Lego Movie 2's Matthew Fogel.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-super-mario-movie-poster-races-down-rainbow-road/1100-6511383/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Vampire Survivors Patch 1.3.0, or "The Chaos One," is here, with new achievements, a new challenge stage, and a couple of new relics.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer poncle shared the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/5662747178708901034?l=english">latest patch notes</a> earlier today, February 9, detailing what you can expect from the latest update.

In terms of XP gain, it's on the lower end, but there's a higher density of enemies than normal. You won't find too many light sources on this stage, though items can be dropped by diamonds when they're broken.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-survivors-patch-1-3-0-adds-trippy-bat-country-stage-and-some-boney-relics/1100-6511378/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Texas Chain Saw Devs Went To Extreme Lengths To Recreate Leatherface's Chainsaw

<p>Sound design is sometimes overlooked during the development of a video game, but for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, developer Gun Interactive is focusing on making Leatherface's favorite human gardening tool sound as authentic as possible.</p><p>The studio managed to locate three of the same make and model chainsaws used by Leatherface in the 1974 film, and <a href="https://twitter.com/weskeltner/status/1623716085923979269">according to game director Wes Keltner</a>, spent<a href="https://twitter.com/weskeltner/status/1623721479161491460"> around six months</a> sourcing parts and rebuilding the tools into screen-accurate murder machines. The next step to capturing the sound involved firing up the chainsaw in the right environment, as the team spent time in the "blistering heat" capturing audio and perfecting their movements while using the tool.</p><p>"Yes we could have gotten a modern chainsaw, but that's not the correct chainsaw," Keltner said in the video below. "It doesn't have the same sound profile. To us, we think that matters."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-devs-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-recreate-leatherface-chainsaw/1100-6511374/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">In an effort to curtail more extreme cases of harassment that take place through its online games, Ubisoft is working with the British police force using a new alert system.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64476762">BBC</a>, Ubisoft has set up a new system at its Newcastle-based Ubisoft Customer Relationship Center. While the call center deals with simple things like purchasing issues, they also now handle online toxicity problems occurring in its games. To help staff be better prepared for more serious situations, Ubisoft has formed a deal with Northumbria Police to provide training related to online interactions. In extreme cases, like where someone's life is threatened or some kind of serious potential harm could occur, staff at the call center can fast track the information to the police.</p><p dir="ltr">Damien Gloriuex, a senior director at the center, explained, "We have millions of players, and tens of millions of interactions--so how can we spot incidents? It is daunting, but at the same time it is very important, which is why we wanted to sign this deal and try to make things right. We wanted to focus on the most extreme cases, make sure we do the right thing there because it gives us a solid foundation to build the rest of our work around."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-toxicity-system-has-a-fast-track-contact-to-local-police/1100-6511375/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">After years of rumors, Nintendo finally revealed Metroid Prime Remastered for Switch yesterday. But this updated version of the GameCube title isn't just a simple HD upscale of the original. Developer Retro Studios reworked the visuals, even creating new models for Samus Aran and boss characters.</p><p dir="ltr">You can see the improvements for yourself with our graphics comparison video below. The differences are apparent almost immediately with Metroid Prime's intro on the Frigate Opheon, which is orbiting Tallon IV. The ship sports more details and better lighting, with the planet in the background getting an upgrade too.</p><p dir="ltr">Samus looks dramatically better. The bounty hunter's suit shows off more colors and reflections, and maybe most notably, her arm cannon features pulsating yellow lights. Her gunship received a nice facelift as well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-how-metroid-prime-remastered-stacks-up-visually-to-the-original/1100-6511372/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Epic Games Store continues to give away free games each week, more than three years after the digital storefront launched its awesome weekly freebies program. Every Thursday at the same time 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET--Epic gives up between one and three free games. You merely need to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/id/register">create a free Epic account</a> and enable two-factor authentication to start snagging freebies.

<p dir="ltr">During this year's One23, NBCUniversal's annual developer conference, the mass media and entertainment corporation revealed the coming launch of In-Scene Ad Innovation--an ad technology that would allow for the insertion of signage and 3D products directly into scenes in Peacock programming. The long-rumored tech doesn't yet have a launch date, but the announcement confirms it is indeed coming.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're in build mode right now [with ad tech firm TripleLift] for this product," Jenny Burke, executive VP of advertising strategy, said in a release. "Our plan is that it not only is perfect and pristine for the consumer, but that it can scale, and that the machine learning for finding where the placements should be, are top notch… in-stream product placement, virtual private placement into streaming, we believe in it, but it needs to be done really well in order to be able to scale."</p><p dir="ltr">As announced and discussed so far, it sounds like the feature--a "dynamic experience"--will allow for different products to be swapped in and personalized based on other data provided by the viewer or their account. More details are still to come.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peacock-movies-and-shows-could-have-in-scene-ads/1100-6511345/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Death Stranding 2 actress Elle Fanning has said that the sequel is using some new technology to make the game look "so much better."</p><p dir="ltr">Fanning recently made an auditory appearance on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hGD5bhjvD7Xi0IHVIBnIv?si=9b7283f8bbc44930&amp;nd=1">an episode of Hideo Kojima's Brain Structure podcast</a> alongside The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, where she spoke of how impressive the game is looking to her (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/elle-fanning-says-death-stranding-2-is-taking-mocap-technology-to-a-new-level/">GamesRadar</a>). The actress described the process as a work-in-progress, noting that Kojima "always says 'this isn't done, this is not what it's gonna look like at all'. But then I look at it and I'm like 'it looks pretty amazing.' But in his mind it's 'oh my god it's going to be so much better don't even look at this.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Despite what Kojima says, Fanning thinks that Death Stranding 2 "already looks so outstanding, it looks so real, but I know it's going to get so much better." Kojima himself obviously had something to say on the matter, noting he "can't reveal too much right now. But we've been using a new technology this time around, so I think the scanning process was a bit difficult, but Elle had fun with it."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elle-fanning-thinks-death-stranding-2-looks-pretty-amazing-but-is-going-to-get-so-much-better/1100-6511370/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Guardians Of The Galaxy 3 Synopsis Sets Up A Story About Rocket Raccoon With Dire Consequences

<p>What looks to be the official plot synopsis for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has emerged online, and it appears Rocket raccoon is central the story--he may be in trouble. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-plot-revealed-marvel/">According to GamesRadar</a>, the synopsis for the third movie reveals that the team is getting back together to embark on a "dangerous mission to save Rocket's life."</p><p>"Our beloved band of misfits are settling into life on Knowhere, but it isn't long before their lives are upended by the echoes of Rocket's turbulent past," reads a line from the synopsis. "Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him on a dangerous mission to save Rocket's life--a mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3">synopsis on Marvel's own website</a> seems to have since been edited, as it leaves out the wording about Rocket specifically. Perhaps this information wasn't supposed to come to light just yet. It makes sense, though, as the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 trailer focused a lot on Rocket, featuring a flashback shot of him as a baby raccoon and another very sad sequence. Rocket looks beat up and sad, when he says, "We'll all fly away together, one last time." </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-synopsis-sets-up-a-story-about-rocket-raccoon-with-dire-consequences/1100-6511367/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Super Bowl 57 is right around the corner, with the big game slated for Sunday, February 12, in Arizona. It's the Philadelphia Eagles versus the Kansas City Chiefs for the title. Millions are expected to tune in to watch the big game, and a major part of the broadcast are the commercials. Given the size of the expected TV audience, advertisers are eager to show off their products and services, and they will pay top dollar. According to Fox, which is hosting the game this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-30-second-super-bowl-ads-cost-this-year/1100-6511187/">30-second spots sold for between $6 million-$7 million.</a></p><p>Years ago, Super Bowl commercials didn't appear online until the evening of the game, but these days, the advertisements show up days and weeks ahead of time to get the hype train rolling. 2023 is no different, as many of the big game spots are already out there. In this post, we're rounding up all the biggest and best Super Bowl commercials so far, including the reunions and spoofs of Breaking Bad, Caddyshack, Clueless, and more.</p><h2><strong>PopCorners Featuring Breaking Bad</strong></h2><p>One of the most talked-about advertisements for the big game is the PopCorners TV spot that brings back Walter White and Jesse Pinkman (and Tuco!) from Breaking Bad.

While you can carry over your preferences for your House and wand, the Patronus quiz, oddly enough, gets skipped. So, the question remains: Can you get a Patronus in Hogwarts Legacy?</p><h2>What is a Patronus and can you cast the spell in Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>A Patronus is a mystical, almost spiritual force that resembles an animal. Learned by mastering the Patronus Charm, it is, essentially, the embodiment of good and positive memories, able to banish the darkness brought about by Dementors. This was used to full effect in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban when Harry's Patronus, a stag that reminded him of his father's chosen animal, was able to drive away the Dementors looming in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Hogwarts Legacy, players will be able to acquire dozens of spells. And, in the Wizarding World quiz, you answer several questions that would lead to a particular result. That has led players to wonder if it's possible to have a Patronus in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-patronus-can-you-get-spell/1100-6511351/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>For a limited time, you can grab the entire Star Wars Jedi Knight series for PC in a single bundle from Fanatical for just $4 (normally $20). The bundle is discounted until 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday, February 10--or until sold out--whichever comes first.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/star-wars-jedi-knight-collection">See at Fanatical</a> </div><p dir="ltr">The bundle packs all five games in the Star Wars Jedi Knight series, which follows protagonist Kyle Katarn on his journey from rebel smuggler to powerful Jedi Knight serving under Luke Skywalker (with a short detour to the dark side along the way, of course). The series started in 1995 with Star Wars: Dark Forces, an old-school FPS similar to the original Doom but you’re blasting Storm Troopers instead of demons.</p><p dir="ltr">The sequel, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, and its expansion, Mysteries of the Sith, took the series into full 3D and added a lightsaber and force powers to Katarn’s arsenal. Later entries Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy feature an even heavier emphasis on lightsaber duels. Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy also lets players fully customize their Jedi padawan character’s appearance, lightsaber, and fighting style.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snag-5-star-wars-games-for-only-4/1100-6511328/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After February 8's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-february-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6511344/">Nintendo Direct</a>, Sabotage Studio dropped its demo for<em> Sea of Stars</em> on the Nintendo Switch eShop. The Canadian developer announced the turn-based fantasy RPG back in 2020 without revealing any details about when a demo would be available--until today.</p><p><em>Sea of Stars</em> puts the fate of the world in the hands of adolescent protagonists. Valere and Zale, two Children of the Solstice, are the only ones capable of performing Eclipse Magic, the kind needed to defeat a magical villain called The Fleshmancer. Its a prequel story that takes place in the same world as <em>The Messenger</em>, an action-platformer that Sabotage first released for PC and Nintendo Switch in 2018.</p><p>Sabotage's latest project pays homage to the classics through the vibrant pixel art and variety of settings featured in its brief trailer. It also seems to have many of the key ingredients needed to create a lovable RPG like a promising story, engaging combat system, and unique character designs. However, it riffs on the formula with features that aren't always present in retro-style RPGs, like the ability to choose which stats to invest in and seamless travel (the ability to walk, climb, and swim without barriers). In that sense, it's more true to its word about being a customizable experience.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-messenger-rpg-sea-of-stars-demo-is-out-now-on-switch/1100-6511364/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Bungie Addresses Complaints About Destiny 2: Lightfall's New Titan Super

<p>The new Destiny 2 Lightfall expansion is set to bring some major changes to the game, but one of the more exciting features being added is the new Strand subclass. A new set of powers that allows Guardians to manipulate the web of life, these new abilities culminate with an all-powerful Super attack that is unique to each Guardian class. Warlocks cast space magic, Hunters wield a deadly dart-rope, and according to some unimpressed Destiny 2 fans, Titans smash <em>yet again</em>.</p><p>Titans are usually seen as the muscle of Destiny 2, but for Lightfall, the new Berserker class is seen as being too similar to previous Supers such as the Arc-powered Fists of Havoc or the Behemoth subclass that coats a Titan's fist with Stasis power. Bungie says that it has been "monitoring recent impressions around the new Strand Berserker Titan" and it is confident that "the Strand Titan offers new gameplay opportunities to make it feel fresh" when compared to older subclasses.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">We've been monitoring recent impressions around the new Strand Berserker Titan. The team understands the landscape of our Titan supers during development, and has made sure the Strand Titan offers new gameplay opportunities to make it feel fresh compared to previous subclasses.</p>  — Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1623429201696296960?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">February 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p><span>In a preview of the </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-strand-before-lightfall-launches/1100-6511205/">Strand Berserker Titan</a><span>, Bungie described this new powerset for the subclass as an untamed and wild power fantasy. Once active, Titans can leap into danger and soak up more damage thanks to powerful attacks such as Frenzied Blade and Blade Fury. In comparison, Warlocks can use the Broodweaver Super to hurl Strand missiles and Threadlings at enemies, while Hunters use the Threadrunner Super to grapple between points and unleash a wide arc of lethal damage.</span></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-addresses-complaints-about-destiny-2-lightfall-new-titan-super/1100-6511359/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Has Big Plans To Make Titans Less Of A Menace In PvP

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> Supers, the ultimate Light and Darkness powers that players can wield, are getting an overhaul once the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-trailer-shows-off-new-and-deadly-exotics/1100-6510998/">Lightfall</a> expansion launches this month. Supers were split into two camps with the 30th Anniversary release back in December 2021, with one-off Supers generally having a quicker cooldown when compared to their roaming counterparts.</p><p>Bungie is still finalizing changes for how to tweak these abilities, and in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/ability-changes-lightfall-d2">blog post</a>, it detailed some of the changes on the horizon. The maximum number of Orbs of Power that roaming Supers can generate has been increased from five to seven, while one-off Supers will see their maximum number of Orbs of Power generated reduced from seven to five. Only Well of Radiance, Ward of Dawn, and both Shadowshot variants remain unchanged.</p><p>The good news --if you're not playing as a Titan--is that some Supers are being modified to be more effective and less of a crutch in high-level PvP activity. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-next-iron-banner-event-wont-be-a-huge-grind/1100-6510544/">Iron Banner</a> fans who have had to deal with Ward of Dawn bubbles can breathe a sigh of relief, as the maximum health of that barrier will be reduced from 13,500 to 8,000. Damage dealt to the Ward by PvE combatants has been reduced to compensate, so in that area of Destiny 2, the gameplay remains relatively unchanged.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-has-big-plans-to-make-titans-less-of-a-menace-in-pvp/1100-6511358/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Almost every part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Destiny 2</a> is getting a tune-up once the Lightfall expansion goes live on February 28, and sublcass abilities haven't escaped Bungie's attention. With all three Light subclasses receiving a 3.0 upgrade throughout 2022, Bungie plans to scale back the amount of ability regeneration that the discipline, strength, and class ability stats provide.</p><p>"Our goal with ability uptime in both PvE and PvP is to get back to roughly where we were when the 30th Anniversary Pack launched in December 2021," Bungie explained in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/ability-changes-lightfall-d2">blog post</a>. While this will see organic options for abilities dialed back, the good news is that the revamped buildcrafting system being introduced in Lightfall will still reward players for properly investing in their Guardian build.</p><p>Combined with the right Aspects, Fragments, Exotic armor, armor mods, and weapon perks, a well-planned loadout will still be a force to be reckoned with according to Bungie. Some of the changes that the studio has planned for Lightfall include the following tweaks to passive cooldown gains:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-scaling-back-organic-ability-spamming-but-buildcrafting-will-fill-that-role/1100-6511357/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">After separating from Ubisoft and striking out on his own, The Settlers creator Volker Wertich and his new studio Envision Entertainment have announced Pioneers of Pagonia, a brand-new city-building sim which will launch later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Pioneers of Pagonia will send players to the islands of the titular Pagonia, where they will build a new civilization using the game's 40 different building types and 70 different goods. Players can create alliances with NPCs, set up production chains to deliver goods to other areas, and explore procedurally generated islands in search of resources, fertile lands, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">The game was developed using a grant from the German government's <a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/games.html">Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection's general games fund</a>, which offers governmental support to game developers based in Germany.

## Hogwarts Legacy - All Demiguise Statues And Demiguise Moons For Alohomora Upgrades

<p>The Alohomora in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> isn't so much a spell, but a core gameplay function. With it, you're able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-how-to-unlock-doors-and-chests/1100-6511253/">unlock doors and chests</a>. Unfortunately, when you first get it, you'll only be able to fiddle around with level 1 locks since you still need upgrades. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you find the Demiguise Statues and Demiguise Moons to gain Alohomora upgrades.</p><h2>What are Demiguise Statues and Demiguise Moons?</h2><p>The Alohomora skill comes from Gladwin Moon, the caretaker of the school. When you initially obtain it, he shows you the first Demiguise Statue, a depiction of a strange creature that's carrying a glowing orb. The orb, known as a Demiguise Moon, is something you can only collect when it's nighttime. As such, if you want to look for these objects, you'll need to periodically advance the game's day-night cycle via the world map.</p><p>There are multiple Hogwarts Legacy Demiguise Statues in the game world. You'll locate two more as you're tackling Gladwin's quest (which requires you to complete the objectives stealthily). After that, he'll ask you to find additional Moons to gain Alohomora upgrades. There are a couple of tiers/quest phases:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-demiguise-statue-moons-alohomora-upgrades-guide/1100-6511362/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Hogwarts Legacy: How To Increase Inventory Size With Merlin Trials

<p>One of the biggest problems you'll have in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> is managing your inventory. By default, you only have 20 slots available. If you end up looting a bunch of items from chests, there's a chance that excess items would disappear forever. As such, you'll need to find a way to remedy that. Here's our guide to help you increase the inventory size in Hogwarts Legacy by completing Merlin Trials.</p><h2>Merlin Trials challenges and inventory slots</h2><p>As you progress further in the campaign, you'll receive a quest called <strong>Girl From Uagadou</strong>. You'll meet up with Natty in a village south of Hogsmeade, whereupon the objective will change to Trials of Merlin. After helping an NPC named Nora Treadwell, she'll provide you with Mallowsweet Leaves, a resource that's needed to begin each Merlin Trial in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>Merlin Trials are denoted by a leaf icon on the map. The best way to find them is by flying on your broom so you can check the countryside for these locations. A single Revelio activation to ping the map is enough to spot numerous points of interest in your surroundings.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-increase-inventory-merlin-trials/1100-6511360/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fall Damage Will No Longer Be Lethal In Destiny 2

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> is making physics collision damage and fall damage less lethal in Lightfall, its upcoming expansion. As announced in a recent <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/ability-changes-lightfall-d2">blog update</a>, physics collisions will no longer mean instant death once Lightfall releases, and fall damage will also be reduced in a mid-Season update.</p><p>While they may no longer be lethal, collisions will still do some hefty damage, but as the dev team explains, "will generally leave you at 1HP instead of outright splattering you." This will presumably be the same with fall damage when it's nerfed later in the season.</p><p>The adjustment should come in handy when navigating in Lightfall, with the new Strand subclass having a strong focus on grappling. Gameplay feature lead Eric Smith <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-strand-before-lightfall-launches/1100-6511205/">said in a recent interview</a> that much of the new campaign has been designed specifically around the new grapple. "There are sections of Lightfall where we're grappling to moving objects, vehicles to kind of pull ourselves around the environment," he explained.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-damage-will-no-longer-be-lethal-in-destiny-2/1100-6511356/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Developer Hyde is working on a Nintendo Switch and PC port of B.B. Studio's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-world-next-order/">Digimon World: Next Order</a>, which is set to launch next month. A roleplaying game with digital pet mechanics, Digimon World: Next Order is the sixth and most recent mainline entry in the Digimon World series. Its claim to fame is that it is the first Digimon World game to give you two Digimon partners at the start instead of just one. Below, we go over everything we know about Digimon World: Next Order, including when it's coming out and its PC system specs.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Hyde worked on 2022's Digimon Survive, taking over production of the game midway through development.

It's not enough to ruin an otherwise great visual novel, but it does put quite a damper on the whole experience."</p><h3 dir="ltr">Release date</h3><p dir="ltr">Digimon World: Next Order is already out in the wild, having launched solely in Japan in 2016 before then being released internationally in 2017. The game's Nintendo Switch and PC versions are scheduled to launch this year on February 22.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-world-next-order-everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-switch-and-pc-port/1100-6511350/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The promise of new jobs, exciting boss fights, and powerful gear will inspire you to poke around every corner, and there are no shortage of discoveries to strive for. And all the while, you're treated to one of the most interesting and effective re-imaginings of a retro aesthetic around."</p><h3 dir="ltr">Release date</h3><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler II is scheduled to launch on February 24.
