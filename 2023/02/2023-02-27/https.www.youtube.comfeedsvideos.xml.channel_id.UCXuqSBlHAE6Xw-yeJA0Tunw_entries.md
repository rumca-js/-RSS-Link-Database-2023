Thanks to OnePlus for sponsoring today’s video! Check out the OnePlus 11 Concept at https://www.oneplus.com/us/11-concept

Our phones, be it iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel, are pretty dang powerful. But as our desktop GPU friends have shown us, all that power, means a lot of heat. So what’s a smartphone to do? Well, maybe watercooling? OnePlus has given us a chance to look at their liquid cooled OnePlus Concept that makes use of their Active CryoFlux cooling technology. Could this be a game changer? Only one way to find out.
