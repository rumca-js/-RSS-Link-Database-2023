<p>Retaliatory rampage in Palestinian village likened to ‘Kristallnacht in Huwara’ with one dead and 350 injured</p><p>There is a large rolling gate at the entrance to the small Palestinian village of Za’atara, in the north of the occupied West Bank, but it is rarely closed. On Sunday afternoon, however, wary that Israeli settlers living in the area were seeking revenge for the murder of two brothers shot dead by a Palestinian gunman in nearby Huwara, Za’atara’s residents braced for retaliatory violence.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/27/biden-administration-under-pressure-as-israel-palestine-violence-escalates">settlers to arrive</a>. Villagers said that by dusk, about 100 armed Israelis, accompanied by a dozen Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers, had massed on the road outside the village entrance, and some began shooting. Sameh Aqtash, a 37-year-old blacksmith who had just returned from volunteering after the earthquake in Turkey, was shot in the stomach. Because the army would not clear the road for an ambulance to reach him, he bled to death, Aqtash’s nephew Fadi said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/27/israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank-escalates-huwara">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bristol City manager on owning woodland, the Mongol Rally and an England ‘certainty’ in his side preparing to face Manchester City</p><p>“An insight into my world,” Nigel Pearson says, stowing away his phone after digging out a video of him, Scott Murray, Bristol City’s universally loved kit man, and the player liaison officer, Matt Parsons, out in the sticks. The scene? Almost three acres of ancient woodland in the Somerset countryside which Pearson bought last year. For Pearson it is a welcome and picturesque sanctuary, full of biodiversity but clear of the turbulence and heat that come with life as a manager. “They went down to help me take a tree out,” he explains.</p><p>“Timber!” comes the call as the chainsaw bites. “My sister-in-law died two years ago of cancer so I have put a bench there,” Pearson says. “It would have been her birthday in October and her daughters have visited. I’ve built a footpath to the top – it is quite steep. The views are fantastic.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/27/nigel-pearson-interview-bristol-city-manchester-city-woodland-mongol-rally">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I thought the film was dead.

It wasn’t a high-concept book: the original idea was to write about a relationship from a guy’s point of view. I remember telling my agent about it and seeing her eyes glaze over as I mumbled about record shops and relationships. I’ve spent a lot of time in record shops but I have never worked in one, so I based it on people I’d seen and conversations I’d heard.

It has seemed for some time that this is his world and we are all just living in it, especially after his performances at the World Cup. But just as it looked like he could not burnish his status as the world’s best footballer any more, he showed again on Sunday evening that there is always another level to his game.</p><p>Not only did he score a brace for PSG in their 3-0 win against Marseille at the Vélodrome to go level with Edinson Cavani as the club’s joint all-time top scorer, but he also set up Lionel Messi for the other goal and terrorised the Marseille defence throughout. Admittedly, the absence of Samuel Gigot and Chancel Mbemba helped Mbappé slice through the hosts’ midfield and back three, but PSG were also missing key players.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/27/christophe-galtier-counterattacking-best-revive-psg-lille-saint-etienne">Continue reading...</a>
