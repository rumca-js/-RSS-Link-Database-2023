<p>About 10% of embattled social media giant Twitter’s remaining workforce, including staff charged with keeping the platform functional, discovered that they had been laid off over the weekend, according to a report published Sunday by the New York Times.</p><p>About 200 data scientists, product managers and engineers working on issues like site reliability were among those fired, days after the company took some of its internal communications infrastructure offline, according to the report. These cuts are the latest of several that have afflicted Twitter since Elon Musk’s takeover in late 2022. Fewer than 2,000 employees still work at Twitter, out of roughly 7,500 who were present before the company's go-private deal.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688938/twitter-stealthily-lays-off-10-of-remaining-workers-including-tech-staff.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Nearly every day, software updates of some kind roll out for our systems. From operating systems to antivirus software, to cloud services, to hardware devices, virtually none of the technology we use is static. And with these updates come side effects and problems that sometimes take a while to get fixed.</p><p>I recently found an interesting bug that hasn’t gotten a lot of attention when I purchased a Lexmark multi-function printer. As part of the installation process, I went online to download the latest printer driver. (I always recommend going to a vendor website to grab the latest drivers because, after all, the latest software should have the latest fixes, right?) I was able to set up the printer to print, scan, and electronically fax and figured I was done for the day.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3689155/software-bugs-that-bug-me-and-how-to-swat-them-down.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
