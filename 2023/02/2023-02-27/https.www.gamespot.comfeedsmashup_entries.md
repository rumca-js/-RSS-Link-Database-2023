<p>Amid raid leaks and spoilers, Bungie took to Twitter to announce the upcoming raid for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2: Lightfall</a> will be called The Root of Nightmares--which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-raid-the-root-of-nightmares-start-time-details/1100-6511185/">starts on March 10 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET</a>. Players will have 48 hours after its launch to complete the new raid under Contest mode.</p><p>Bungie's official description reads, "Ferried from an unknown time and place, a haunting presence has been detected. We must now confront the ancient threat growing at our doorstep." The image shows a Fireteam of six Guardians standing inside the Pyramid architecture, but the space is overgrown with strange, pointy flora. It's unusual to see something so bright and organic inside the Pyramid ship, but the growth of flora was hinted at when the Traveler shoots the Pyramid ship in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/destiny-2-lightfall-launch-trailer/2300-6460699/">Lightfall launch trailer</a>.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Ferried from an unknown time and place, a haunting presence has been detected.

Players first saw Nightmares on the Moon in Destiny 2: Shadowkeep when the Pyramid ship lying beneath the surface had woken. Several seasons later, Season of the Haunted brought back the Nightmares through Emperor Calus's Leviathan ship, where the Guardian and Eris Morn helped Zavala, Crow, and Caiatl cope with their grief and stop Calus from joining The Witness. Recently, Season of Plunder introduced relics of a powerful being named Nezarec and hinted at this Disciple's relation to the Lunar Pyramid.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-root-of-nightmares-raid-will-introduce-an-ancient-enemy-in-destiny-2-lightfall/1100-6511873/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Lightfall Patch Notes For Update 7.0.0.1 Include A Massive Set Of Changes

<p dir="ltr">The release of any new Destiny 2 expansion is always accompanied by a large set of patch notes, and Lightfall is no exception. Update 7.0.0.1 is now available for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-preloading-details-server-downtime-begins-install-size-confirmed/1100-6511142/">preloading ahead of Lightfall's launch</a> on Tuesday, and Bungie has now released the full patch notes. While they largely consist of details we've been hearing about for weeks or months, it does conveniently bring together all of the key changes in one place in case you haven't been scouring every one of the many blog posts in the lead-up to launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the key changes are adjustments to difficulty. Adept difficulty has been removed, and the activity levels for Hero (soft cap +20), Legend (+30), and Master (+40) have each been tweaked. "Each has a scaling combat delta that keeps you under level in the activity and provides a smoother pathway to Grandmaster," Bungie says. Alongside this is a division of the previous singes/burns system, where elemental damage you dealt and received would be subject to an increase based on a rotating modifier. Now, surges and threats, respectively, will dictate those independently, and a new "overcharged" system will allow for certain weapon types to deal additional damage, based on a combination of activity modifiers and upgrades you've unlocked on your seasonal Artifact.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Guardian Ranks system has been introduced, offering what should be a more guided experience. That should be particularly useful for newer or more casual players who may not know what to do at a given time. The Triumph tab, meanwhile, has been reworked into the Juorney tab, featuring much of the same information with a new design but also incorporating things like the new Commendations system (where players can praise one another in various categories) and seasonal challenges.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-patch-notes-for-update-7-0-0-1-include-a-massive-set-of-changes/1100-6511872/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last Of Us Episode 7 Was Reportedly Censored In Some Regions

<p>The newest episode of HBO's The Last of Us was reportedly censored for some of the show's audience, a move that has yet to be explained by those involved with the series. <strong>This post contains big spoilers for The Last of Us.</strong></p><div>          </div><p>The Last of Us episode seven, titled "Left Behind," adapts the game's expansion of the same name and follows the story of Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Riley (Storm Reid) before the events of the main show. It was another strong episode, culminating in a kiss between Ellie and Riley. Viewers in some regions, however, apparently didn't see the smooch. Reports on social media suggest that the kiss was edited out for the show's local streaming partner, OSN+, in the MNEA region.</p><p>OSN+ was previously criticized for editing out gay romance scenes from How To Get Away With Murder and House of the Dragon. As others have pointed out, this newest instance of censorship was strange in part because a previous episode of The Last of Us, "Long Long Time," was reportedly not edited at all on OSN+. That episode was focused nearly exclusively on the gay romance between Bill (Nick Offerman) and Frank (Murray Bartlett).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-7-was-reportedly-censored-in-some-regions/1100-6511869/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Assassin's Creed characters are coming to Summoners War: Sky Arena starting on February 28. If you log on during the event, i.e. before April 24, you'll receive a five-star Altaïr and a collaboration scroll for free.</p><p>Altaïr is not the only Assassin appearing in the event. The protagonists of the last three mainline Assassin's Creed games are also available. Origins protagonist Bayek wields a bow. One of Odyssey's two principle characters, Kassandra, uses the broken-off spear tip featured prominently in her game. The female Eivor, from Valhalla, wields double axes. Fan-favorite Ezio, himself the star of three main Assassin's Creed titles, employs a hidden blade, just like Altaïr. While Ezio appears younger, like in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, his outfit is taken directly from Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p><p>While you can get Altaïr just by logging in, you'll have to get other assassins by using collaboration scrolls. As part of the event, you can pick up collaboration scrolls that specifically summon Assassin's Creed characters. You can pick up Assassin's Creed scrolls by clearing the 50th floor of the Trial of Ascension. The event will also include a collab dungeon, where you will be able to try out the Assassin's Creed summons in various challenges. An Assassin's Creed headquarters will also appear, letting you clear themed missions to earn rewards.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-heroes-come-to-summoners-war-sky-arena-in-new-event/1100-6511866/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>There are certain items that are absolutely crucial to your survival in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a>. From a basic shelter to food and water, players' first few hours on the island in the new survival-horror game will be all about trying to find these items so they can stay alive. One of these tools is the <strong>Rope Gun</strong>, which allows players to access ziplines, which are required for several caves scattered around the island. If you're struggling to find the Rope Gun, don't worry, as you're certainly not alone. In this guide, we'll be going over all of the steps required to acquire the Rope Gun in Sons of the Forest.</p><h2>Sons of the Forest Rope Gun location</h2><p>Unfortunately, the location of the Rope Gun is not an easy place to reach. First, players will need to make their way to the western side of the map, right in between the ocean and the snowy mountain range. There, players will find a cave that leads them down a winding trek which will result in them finding the Rope Gun. You can see exactly where the cave is located on the map in the GPS screenshot below.</p><figure style="width: 1870px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4105239-rope1.jpg"><img alt="The location of the cave with the Rope Gun | Screenshot via MapGenie.io" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1745/17457013/4105239-rope1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The location of the cave with the Rope Gun | Screenshot via MapGenie.io</figcaption></figure><p>Once you're near this location on the map, you will see a green blip appear on your map. Head toward the green blip until you find a large boulder with three humans resting on spikes in front of it. This is the entrance to the cave. All you need to do is head into the entrance, press "E" to enter, and then bring out whatever light source you have on hand. We recommend a flashlight, but a torch works just as well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-how-to-get-the-rope-gun/1100-6511870/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft's Starfield showcase might be announced any day now. According to reporter Andy Robinson, the Starfield showcase announcement may be "imminent."</p><p>The announcement might be made "soon," <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1629237718776483841">according to Robinson.</a> Robinson reported this on February 24, but no announcement has been made as of yet.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">I hear the announcement for the Starfield showcase is imminent 👀</p>  — Andy Robinson (@AndyPlaytonic) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1629235956724162561?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">February 24, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Microsoft announced in January that Starfield <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-getting-its-own-xbox-showcase-to-dedicate-the-proper-amount-of-time-to-it/1100-6510477/">would get its own special showcase in 2023</a>.

Here's our guide to help you get the <strong>VIP Keycard</strong> in Sons of the Forest.</p><h2>Sons of the Forest VIP Keycard location</h2><p>To get the Sons of the Forest VIP Keycard, you'll want to go to a specific green marker on the island. Let's pretend that the mountain range is to the north. The green marker that you should head toward is further southwest. There, you'll discover a couple of golf carts with corpses inside them. There's also a tunnel entrance.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4105115-sonsoftheforestvipkeycardguidevirginiadressmutantladydress-1.jpg"><img alt="The entrance to the facility with the VIP Keycard is in front of two golf carts." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4105115-sonsoftheforestvipkeycardguidevirginiadressmutantladydress-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The entrance to the facility with the VIP Keycard is in front of two golf carts.</figcaption></figure><p>Follow the pathway and climb down.

## Sons Of The Forest - How To Get Virginia As A Companion

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a> has many surprises that await you. One of these is Virginia, a woman wearing a bathing suit, who shows up out of the blue. What's peculiar is that she has three arms and three legs, as she's a mutant. If you do the right thing, she might just end up joining you. Here's our guide to help you befriend Virginia, the Mutant Lady, so she can become your companion in Sons of the Forest.</p><h2>Where to find Virginia in Sons of the Forest</h2><p>If you want to make Virginia a companion in Sons of the Forest, the number one rule is to avoid attacking or killing her. She appears early in the campaign, around Day 2. You'll likely stumble upon her as you go back to the helicopter crash site. If you have a weapon in your hand, she'll raise her arms to defend herself, though she'll also run away. In fact, if you attempt to go near her, she'll simply escape.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4104703-sonsoftheforestvirginiacompanionbefriendromancemutantlady-1.jpg"><img alt="Virginia shows up near the helicopter crash site early in the campaign.

Don't attack or kill her. Don't even chase her around.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Virginia is the so-called "mutant lady" in Sons of the Forest, you might mistake her for a hostile. If you try to attack, she'll go down to a wounded state. You can revive her, but she'll still make a run for it. This may affect how she perceives you down the line. Conversely, if you end up killing her, she'll be gone for good.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-virginia-companion-mutant-lady-guide/1100-6511833/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a> has numerous points-of-interest for you to check out. One, in particular, has a rather nifty device. Here's our Sons of the Forest 3D Printer guide to help you find this machine so you can craft new items.</p><h2>3D Printer location in Sons of the Forest</h2><p>To find the 3D Printer in Sons of the Forest, you'll need to bring out your GPS Device by pressing the "M" key. The screen will rotate depending on your character's orientation. As such, to make it simpler, let's say that you're at the helicopter crash site and the mountains are to the north. You should see two caves: one directly south of that area and one to the southeast. Likewise, there should be a green dot close to the southeast cave.</p><p>You'll want to head to that green dot (which can be seen in the image below). Once you're close enough, you'll see that the place is overgrown with weeds and vines. However, there should be another opening here. Enter it and you'll arrive at a dark corridor. At the end of the hallway, you'll stumble upon a rather cozy spot: a rest area that has the Sons of the Forest 3D Printer.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-3d-printer-craft-items-guide/1100-6511832/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Sons Of The Forest Tips: 10 Important Things To Do If You Want To Survive

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a>, you'll brave harsh environments, delve deep into dark caverns, and battle tenacious foes. You'll need to keep your wits about you if you wish to make it all the way to the end. Here's our Sons of the Forest survival guide to help you with several tips that should, hopefully, keep your character alive.</p><h2>10 tips to help you survive in Sons of the Forest</h2><h3>1. Leave Kelvin near a shelter and don't babysit him</h3><p>Kelvin is one of the soldiers who was with you when the helicopter crashed. Due to an injury that has left his eardrums perforated, the only method to communicate with him is via written notes.</p><p>You might think that having a companion at the start of the campaign would be amazing, but it isn't. Kelvin is, without a doubt, one of the most useless companions in a survival game. He can neither carry weapons nor fight back. At best, he could pick up objects for you, which you'd probably do anyway. Worse, he tends to get distracted by enemy mobs, and you'll often have no choice but to babysit him.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-tips-survival-guide/1100-6511831/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a> is a survival game at heart, it's not lost on fans that horror plays a large part in the gameplay as well. From the jump scares that mutants can give you at any time to the dangerous creatures that are lurking around every turn, Sons of the Forest is not for the faint of heart. Of course, the scariest time during any part of the game will likely come at night, as this is when enemies can really sneak up on players and cause their hearts to leap out of their chests. To see exactly how to locate the flashlight in Sons of the Forest, check out the guide below.</p><h2>Sons of the Forest Flashlight location</h2><p>Luckily for players, there aren't real prerequisites to find the flashlight, unlike other items such as the shovel and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-maintenance-keycard-guide/1100-6511854/">Maintenance Key Card</a>. All you need to do is make your way to a specific location on the map, which is found in the northwest portion of the island.</p><p>If you're looking on your GPS, you need to zoom in on the northwest corner, but not too far. The flashlight is found more toward the center of the map than, near the northwest part of the snowy mountain range. You can see exactly where you need to go in the GPS screenshot below.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-flashlight-guide-and-location/1100-6511860/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The latest episode of HBO's The Last of Us included content from the first game's Left Behind DLC, where we learn how Ellie was bitten, but also shows us her first understanding of true, inconsolable loss. During this part of the game, Ellie has to fend for herself as Joel recovers from being impaled on broken glass, but also we flash back to her life before Joel and we see a slice of life as a teenager during the end of the world.</p><p>Ellie's best friend and crush Riley, played by Storm Reid in the series, sneak out to an abandoned mall where the two have an evening that's a quasi-date and get to live as teenagers did before the cordyceps outbreak. Tragically, the two are attacked and bitten by a formerly dormant Clicker. This is where Ellie finds out she is immune but also loses the person she loved most in the world.</p><p>Getting a mall built to recreate this moment wasn't an easy feat, but production designer John Paino was up to the challenge.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-production-designer-for-hbos-the-last-of-us-built-episode-7s-mall/1100-6511867/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>New expansions are on the way for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and while the focus for this DLC is on festivals, cultural exchanges, and going beyond the borders of the Paldea region, there'll also be new Pokemon to acquire. Hundreds of pocket monsters will be migrating over to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, as Nintendo has confirmed that over 230 creatures from older Pokemon games can be obtained in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-first-expansion-dlc-ventures-beyond-paldea/1100-6511838/">The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disc expansions</a>.</p><p>For anyone looking to complete their Pokedex in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, this new influx of critters will make the quest that much more challenging. Currently, there are 400 Pokemon to acquire, and catching all of them requires doing a significant amount of trading to get all the version-exclusive Pokemon. For Part 1, players can expect to encounter Shiftry, Vikavolt, Chingling, Ninetails, Yanma, and Milotic, while Part 2 will see wild Dewgong, Metagross, Espurr, Alcremie, Zebstrika, and Whimsicott roaming the land.</p><p>These are the only ones known of so far, but the good news is that if you've built up a sizable collection over the years through other Pokemon games, then you'll be able to make the task of filling up your Pokedex easier when Pokemon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-add-new-tera-raids-today-home-support-also-coming/1100-6511837/">Home functionality is added to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet later this year</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansions-make-filling-your-pokedex-even-more-challenging/1100-6511858/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104561-nickfuryandskrulls.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a very busy franchise for a long time, its scope expanded dramatically after Avengers: Endgame with a large slate of TV series to go along with the never-ending flow of mega-budget blockbuster films. New characters are flooding the franchise while only a few of our older heroes have exited--and now there's so much more MCU than anybody could have imagined a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">This glut of content hasn't been the best experience for fans, though, because they've set up so many things and paid off very little the past few years. Stories have rarely crossed over or even referenced each other, and so we're left with dozens of dangling, ongoing story threads and no sense of how they might interact with each other in the future. It's making it difficult to even care about it all, much less actually keep track of it.</p><p dir="ltr">But we can help with that. What you're about to read isn't a full recap of the MCU's story so far or anything like that--I have a life beyond writing nerd blogs. Instead, this is just a quick trip around the MCU to give a refresher about where each outstanding plot thread currently stands and what all the major characters were last up to as far as we know. That's up to and including Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania, so <strong>be warned that there will be spoilers here</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's dive right in, starting with the newest film.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kang the Conqueror</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104580-arc-106-18326_r_crop.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">An alternate version of He Who Remains from Loki season 1. He came to be because Sylvie killed He Who Remains in the finale. Now, the multiverse is ruled by many Kangs, but they don't all get along. The so-called "Council of Kangs" exiled the one we met in Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania, and then Ant-Man and the Wasp (the characters) apparently killed him. Whether that particular one is actually dead is immaterial at this point--there are plenty more Kangs where that one came from, and we're gonna meet them very soon. In addition to the previously mentioned Council, the Quantumania post-credits scene showed that Loki will have an encounter with a 19th Century version of Kang known as Victor Timely in season 2.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ant-Man and the Wasp and the rest of their family</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104579-ant-manfamily.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">After this Quantum Realm incident that we saw in Quantumania, Ant-Man and his family are once more living their normal lives in the real world.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ghost and Dr. Bill Foster</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104578-ghostfromant-man.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">These characters have never been referenced since they played key roles in the second Ant-Man movie. Last we heard they were in hiding, with Foster (Laurence Fishburne) attempting to stabilize Ghost, who had become a quantum entity because of experiments her father had done with Foster and Hank Pym decades earlier. It's possible they'll never return.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Loki and Sylvie</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104577-lokiandsylvie.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The MCU's primary Loki died in Infinity War, but the alternate version who stole the Tesseract in Endgame was pulled out of time and recruited by the Time Variance Authority to help keep the multiverse under control. This was all a trick of sorts by He Who Remains, the oldest man in all reality, to get Loki and Sylvie to kill him. Sylvie obliged, Kang the Conqueror came into existence and instantly took over the TVA, and Loki is still working in the TVA but nobody knows who he is. Sylvie is on the run.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Natasha Romanoff's family</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104576-blackwidowfamily.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While the Black Widow herself is dead, her family lives on and will continue to be a part of the MCU. The last time we saw her "parents"--David Harbour's Red Guardian and Rachel Weisz's Melina--was at the end of the Black Widow film, set between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. They helped Natasha take down Dreykov and the whole Widow program, and then they left with the rest of the surviving Widows. Their whereabouts are otherwise unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">Natasha's "sister" and fellow Black Widow Yelena Belova, on the other hand, has been active in the present, after being snapped by Thanos and being returned at the end of Endgame. Yelena showed up in Hawkeye to confront Clint, having been told by Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Valentina that he killed Natasha. But the truth came to light, and Yelena teamed up with Clint briefly before disappearing once again.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hawkeye and Kate Bishop</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104575-hawkeyeandkate.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Hawkeye's sins came back to haunt him on his Disney+ series, when some criminal elements he dealt with during the Snap are trying to take him out in the present. He teamed up with a young archer named Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), whose mother was also involved with these criminals, to deal with that threat and the one posed by Yelena mentioned above. Hawkeye is currently hanging out with his family and Kate, who he brought home as his protege/bonus daughter.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Captain America and the Winter Soldier</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104574-captainamericaandthewintersoldier.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Sam Wilson, once known as the Falcon, has taken on the mantle of Captain America, though without the super soldier serum that Steve Rogers benefitted from. To do that, he and Bucky Barnes--the Winter Soldier--had to take down a <em>different</em> Captain America. That man, John Walker, is still alive and has rebranded as US Agent and works for Valentina now.</p><p dir="ltr">We last saw Sam and Bucky hanging out with Sam's family in Louisiana.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wanda Maximoff</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104573-wanda.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Doctor Strange and the Scarlet Witch battled across the multiverse in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, all for control of the Darkhold, a book that offers the power to rule the multiverse for the greatest possible cost. Wanda was eventually defeated, and she fell on her metaphorical sword, so to speak, killing herself and destroying the Darkhold for good.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Doctor Strange and America Chavez</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104572-doctorstrangeandamericachavez.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>But Doctor Strange didn't come away unscathed--dabbling with the Darkhold left him with a third eye, and then a mysterious sorceress named Clea showed up and told him about a new dimensional incursion that he caused. And the multiverse-hopping America Chavez decided to stay in the prime MCU reality and train at Kamar-Taj with Wong.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Vision</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104569-whitevision.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After the original Vision was killed by Thanos in Infinity War, he was resurrected twice in WandaVision. One of them was Wanda's magical recreation of Vision using her Chaos magic that was unlocked by the Mind Stone that had given the original Vision life. The other was a government reconstruction of the original Vision's body that was intended as a weapon. But Wanda's magical Vision restored Vision's old memories to his rebuilt body, and the result was a new person that we know as White Vision.</p><p dir="ltr">The magic version of Vision was removed from reality when Wanda ended the hex on Westview, and White Vision is still at large.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mordo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104568-mordo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While we met alternate versions of Mordo in Multiverse of Madness, the Mordo from the prime MCU world--the one from the first Doctor Strange film--remains at large and presumably still wants to kill Strange.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Eternals</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104571-eternals.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>7,000 years ago, a group of super beings were created and sent to Earth supposedly to shepherd humanity and protect the world from monsters known as Deviants. But it turns out they were actually designed for a secret other job: to protect the Earth itself, which was actually the seed for a new Celestial. It partially emerged--a giant hand reached out of the ocean--but the surviving Eternals went against their programming and prevented this world-destroying birth from taking place. That hand is still sticking out of the ocean, presumably, but it has not been mentioned anywhere else in the MCU yet.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shang-Chi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104570-shangchi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Shang-Chi defeated his ancient father and the Dweller-In-Darkness that was locked away near Ta Lo, and now he possesses the powerful Ten Rings artifact. He was last seen in the company of Wong at Kamar-Taj, where he, Bruce Banner and Captain Marvel discussed the magical nature of the rings and what their origin might be.</p><p dir="ltr">Shang-Chi's sister Xialing took a different path. She chose to take control of the Ten Rings criminal organization that their father had been running for centuries. To be clear, there's the Ten Rings artifact that gives people magic power, and there's the Ten Rings organization, and these are completely separate.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Captain Marvel</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104566-captainmarvel.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The upcoming film The Marvels will focus on three characters. Captain Marvel is the one we've known longest, since she got her own movie and a featured role in Avengers: Endgame. She's appeared twice since the battle with Thanos, both times coming in post-credits scenes. The first was in Shang-Chi--Wong consults with Carol and Bruce Banner about the nature of the Ten Rings artifact, but none of them have a clue what its deal is.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ms. Marvel</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104565-msmarvel.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Carol's other post-Endgame scene was at the end of the Ms. Marvel series on Disney+, and of course the young Kamala Khan is herself one of the upcoming titular Marvels as well. This teenaged hero dealt with a lot over the course of her six-episode series, including a time travel adventure and an incursion from another dimension. But by the end of the finale she's still a kid who lives at home on Earth. Until the post-credits scene, anyway, when her cosmic bangle lights up and she switches places with Carol. Leaving Captain Marvel in Kamala's bedroom, and leaving Kamala who-knows-where.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monica Rambeau</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104567-monicarambeau.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The third Marvel is Monica Rambeau, the daughter of Carol's old best friend Maria, who died offscreen. Monica gained her cosmic abilities from Wanda Maximoff's hex on the town of Westview in WandaVision. At the end of that series a Skrull was attempting to recruit her on behalf of Nick Fury--who's been living in outer space. She doesn't have a code name yet in the MCU, but in the comics she's held a bunch of different titles--including Captain Marvel.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Thor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104564-thorandlove.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">After pursuing Gorr the God Butcher to the center of the universe and handling the threat that he represented, the being Eternity resurrects Gorr's daughter just as Gorr himself dies. Thor, wielding the reassembled Mjolnir, gives the young girl his axe Stormbreaker, and the two now patrol the universe as the new superhero duo Love and Thunder.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Thor's old girlfriend Jane Foster has died of cancer after her own stint as Thor and now resides in Valhalla with Heimdall and the other Asgardian dead. Valkyrie, after being injured in the fight against Gorr, once again rules New Asgard on Earth.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Guardians of the Galaxy</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104584-guardiansfothegalaxy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After Endgame, the Guardians left Earth with Thor, and they had some adventures together between movies. Near the beginning of Thor: Love and Thunder, the Guardians parted ways with Thor and returned to the space station Knowhere, previously owned by the Collector, and bought it to use as their headquarters. And then they celebrated Christmas with Kevin Bacon there in the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, there's a Gamora from an alternate universe out there somewhere.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Spider-Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104585-spider-mansad.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Thanks to all the multiversal shenanigans that occurred during Spider-Man: No Way Home, Spider-Man's secret identity is fully secure--meaning Peter Parker is fully on his own in the world with no friends and nobody who knows he's a superhero. MJ and Ned are now dating each other, and Peter's whole family is dead.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nick Fury and the Skrulls</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104586-nickfuryandskrulls.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After being returned to life in Avengers: Endgame, Nick Fury took a "vacation" to outer space with his Skrull pals from Captain Marvel, with the shapeshifter Talos taking his place on Earth during the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home and WandaVision. His last scene was the Far From Home post-credits scene, where he said it was time to get back to work. The last update we got on what he was doing was at the end of WandaVision, when a Skrull recruits Monica Rambeau on Fury's behalf.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Black Panther, Namor, and the Wakandans</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104587-blackpanther2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>With T'Challa dying of an unknown illness at the beginning of the film--a nod to the late Chadwick Boseman--his sister Shuri has taken over the mantle of the Black Panther. But she decided to travel the world instead of staying in Wakanda, leaving the throne to M'Baku. In Haiti, Nakia raises the secret child she had with T'Challa, a boy named Toussaint.</p><p dir="ltr">And Namor still rules Talokan, but now in alliance with Wakanda, as he expects they'll need to unite against the nations that would exploit them.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>War Machine</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104589-samandrhodey.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After being quite prominent in Phases 2 and 3, Colonel James Rhodes has made only one MCU appearance since Endgame: in the premiere episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, when he questioned Sam Wilson's decision not to take on the Captain America role. Sam did eventually become the new Captain America, but we haven't seen Rhodey since--he's set to appear next in the Disney+ series Secret Invasion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pepper Potts and Morgan Stark</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104590-pepperandmorgan.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Neither Pepper nor Morgan, her daughter with Tony Stark, have been seen since Avengers: Endgame. But they aren't necessarily gone for good--Lexi Rabe, the actress who played Morgan in Endgame, apparently had some kind of appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home that ended up being cut.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Moon Knight</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104591-moonknight.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Moon Knight, whose real name is Marc Spector (or Steven Grant or Jake Lockley, depending on the circumstances) and who suffers from dissociative identity disorder, remains trapped in the service of the Egyptian god Khonshu after defeating and killing the villainous Arthur Harrow and his genocidal patron deity Ammit. And in a similar fashion, his romantic interest Layla now serves the god Tawaret and has become the hero Secret Scarab. Moon Knight featured no connections to the rest of the MCU, but if this version of Khonshu is like his comics counterpart, then he should be very well acquainted with Kang the Conqueror.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>She-Hulk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104592-she-hulk.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When we last saw Jennifer Walters, she was physically bursting through the fourth wall to make the computer that runs the MCU rewrite the ending of her series finale while it was happening in order to prevent her billionaire stalker Todd from also becoming a Hulk. Then she started dating Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil).</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>He-Hulk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4104593-hulkandskaar.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>With Jennifer Walters being his cousin and sharing his green affliction, Bruce Banner naturally popped up multiple times on the She-Hulk series. In the final scene he shows up, having freshly returned once more from Sakaar, the planet he was living enduring Thor: Ragnarok. It turned out he fathered a muscular green son, named Skaar, while he was there and had just found out about it. Bruce remains in his Professor Hulk form, meaning he's big and green but with Bruce's mind intact.</p></h3></p><br />

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4091477-doompatrol.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">All good things come to an end. Then again, so do bad things. If you need proof of that, take a look at the list of TV shows canceled every single year. In 2022, over 100 shows were either canceled or announced as ending. Some of them were excellent; others weren't so great and met their ends early. Now, in 2023, cancellations by networks and streaming services are off to a massive start.</p><p dir="ltr">With the year still young, plenty of TV shows are already meeting their end. Some, like Vampire Academy, failed to attract the audience to necessitate a second season. Meanwhile, long-running shows like Mayans, Titans, and Doom Patrol have announced they are entering their final seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">It can sometimes be hard to keep up with which shows have gotten the axe. Luckily for you, GameSpot has your back. Take a look below at all of the shows canceled or announced as ending in 2023 so far below. We will continue to keep this updated as the fates of more shows are announced throughout the year. And while you're at it, take a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-110-tv-shows-canceled-or-ending-in-2022/2900-3928/">everything canceled in 2022</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-20-netflix-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022/2900-3977/">special look at what Netflix cut last year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Don't be sad your favorite shows are leaving us--be glad you had them in the first place. And given that a lot of these are on streaming services, be glad you can continue watching them over and over again until your eyes bleed Hopefully, they don't get pulled at some point.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. 1899 (Netflix)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4091462-1899_s1_e3_00_38_54_03.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Premiered on: November 17, 2022</p><p>Canceled after 1 season.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2.

<p dir="ltr">The ongoing saga of the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger continued to unfold this week, as Xbox boss Phil Spencer jetted over to Europe to face UK and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-activision-deal-reportedly-faces-yet-another-major-hurdle/1100-6510605/">EU regulators</a> who have yet to pronounce judgment on the blockbuster deal. In an interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/microsoft-makes-its-last-stand-in-69bn-battle-for-call-of-duty-5s0ff575x">The Times</a>, Spencer said that he doesn't want the market for video game consoles to end up like smartphones, which only has two major manufacturers.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer also said that Xbox will continue to exist regardless of whether or not the deal goes through, though it is an "important acquisition." Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft are the current players in the console space. Regulators have <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63e3e9aee90e0762692b970a/Microsoft_Activision_-_Provisional_Findings_Report_3.pdf">noted</a> that Nintendo's consoles compete less closely with Microsoft than Sony's, however.</p><p dir="ltr">In recent weeks, Spencer and Xbox have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-defends-proposed-activision-blizzard-buyout/1100-6510631/">expressed frustration</a> with some of the questions being asked by regulators, claiming in the interview that PlayStation controls 70% of console gaming's global market share. Spencer has also stated that Activision Blizzard's mobile division (the company owns King, one of the largest studios in the space) is one of the major reasons for the deal.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-defends-activision-blizzard-deal-after-key-eu-hearing/1100-6511848/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The latest box office numbers are in, and Ant-Man, cocaine, and Jesus led the way in the US. According to<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/box-office-cocaine-bear-jesus-revolution-ant-man-and-the-wasp-1235269877/"> Deadline</a>, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ruled the weekend with another $32.2 million, bringing its total box office figures for the US to $167.3 million after its first two weekends.</p><p>Quantumania won the weekend but it came up short compared to every single MCU movie before it. That's because the film's 69% drop from its debut box office result was the biggest percentage decline for an MCU movie dating back to the first one, 2008's Iron Man.</p><p>Coming in second this weekend was Cocaine Bear, which debuted with $23.09 million. And in third place was Jesus Revolution with $15.5 million. So in one weekend, movies about ants, cocaine, and Jesus collectively earned more than $70 million.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ant-man-cocaine-bear-and-jesus-dominate-latest-box-office-numbers/1100-6511840/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Has Ellie met new friends, or foes? That's the main thrust of the Episode 8 trailer for The Last of Us, which also sees Joel still struggling to survive after suffering a brutal abdomen laceration. Warner: Major spoilers ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">HBO released the newest teaser on YouTube, and it previews one of Ellie's most impactful encounters from The Last of Us video game. A leader named David is offering her a place within their group. These new survivors seem very religious, though Troy Baker's James thinks it may be God's will for her to die. (Baker voices Joel in the game series.)</p><p dir="ltr">So David obviously doesn't have the full support of his survivor group to bring Ellie into the fold. And for her part, she's not just going to trust total strangers while Joel fights for his life in the basement of an abandoned house.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-8-trailer-sees-ellie-encountering-new-survivors/1100-6511836/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">A long-dormant Pokemon game has finally arisen from its slumber, as Pokemon Sleep--which was first announced in May 2019--re-emerged during the Pokemon Presents livestream earlier today. A new device compatible with the game, Pokemon Go Plus +, was also revealed for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Sleep is a game centered around the player's sleep habits, which will be measured and analyzed in order to progress through the game. A slumbering Snorlax appears on the screen when the player first goes to sleep, but it will be joined by other sleeping Pokemon throughout the night, and multiple "sleep styles" can be collected based on the Pokemon that appear during the night.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The game will make use of the new Pokemon Go Plus + device, which was also unveiled in the Pokemon Presents video. Players can press the button when first going to bed, after which a Pikachu living inside the device will sing lullabies and help the player fall asleep. Once awake, pressing the button will log sleep for the night and send the data to the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sleep-new-pokemon-go-plus-device-launching-in-2023/1100-6511839/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sunday's latest episode of HBO's The Last of Us takes a slight detour from the main story to do a quick flashback on not only how Ellie got bit but takes us back to show her first sense of loss with Riley (Storm Reid), her best friend and first love. </p><p>The episode is based on DLC content that is a flashback sequence that takes place after the incident at the University of Eastern Colorado where Ellie finds herself having to fend for herself as well as see Joel back to health after getting stabbed (in the game, he fell and was impaled). There was a lot the episode took out from that part of the game, but cut to the core of what makes Ellie and Joel so similar in their experiences of losing the most important person to them. </p><div>          </div><p>"In this world, it's often the case that the happiest moments are interrupted by the worst moments," explained showrunner Craig Mazin during the episode's behind-the-scenes featurette. "And there's this wonderful moment where Ellie realizes that Riley feels the same way about her that she feels about Riley and they kiss...they're attacked and they're both infected."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-7-go-behind-the-scenes-of-ellies-first-love-and-how-she-got-bit/1100-6511842/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Crime Boss: Rockay City Feels Like A Celebrity-Stuffed Payday 2

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crime-boss-rockay-city/">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> seems to be trying to fill a Payday-sized void I'm not sure exists. Payday 2 will be a decade old this August but it's still getting new content in 2023, with the latest expansion, Hostile Takeover Heist, releasing in February 2023. Much like the Payday games, Crime Boss is a co-op first-person shooter where groups of four tackle heists and have to mow down waves of cops whenever things go wrong. Unlike those games, however, Crime Boss doesn't seem to offer as much freedom in how you plan a heist--it makes for a not-very-engaging experience, though I'm hopeful the story-driven campaign rectifies that shortcoming with its roguelite inspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Ingame Studios and published by 505 Games, Crime Boss is an organized crime game you can play solo with bots or in a group of up to four. Prior to the start of a mission, you select your team of four from a roster of several characters, each with their own skills, expertise, and weapon loadout. There's some customization in terms of gadgets--you can switch out a collection of guard-distracting rocks for explosive frag grenades or information-gathering scanner grenades, for example--but the characters themselves cannot be altered. You work with the pros and cons you got.</p><p dir="ltr">At a preview event, I got to play about an hour of the game's Urban Legends mode, in which a group of four tackle small, three-part stories. The first thing I noticed about the mode was a lack of a planning stage, which felt like an odd omission. There are no maps to pour over, security cameras to hack into, or intel to discuss with your team. Each mission does feature a briefing during character selection, but they're not very informative beyond detailing what task you're attempting to do, whether that's stealing bags of cocaine from a yacht or shooting your way across a bridge.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crime-boss-rockay-city-feels-like-a-celebrity-stuffed-payday-2/1100-6511829/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom DLC Might Be Coming

<p>It appears The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will receive DLC. However, Nintendo has yet to officially announced any post-launch support for the game.</p><p>The highly anticipated RPG's <a href="https://www.zelda.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/">website contains a line of text at the bottom</a> that states: "**Full version of game required to use DLC.
