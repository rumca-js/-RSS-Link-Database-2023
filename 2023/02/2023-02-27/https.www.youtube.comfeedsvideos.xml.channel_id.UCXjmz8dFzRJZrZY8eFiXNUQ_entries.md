Through out all the insane stunts in the Mission Impossible franchise, we see Ethan Hunt risking his life to save the world.  But one big difference between Mission Impossible and other films in the genre is that it keeps it's lead human.  We remain on the edge of our seats because we see a frailty in Ethan Hunt that he overcomes with each installment.  Mission Impossible keeps it's characters grounded while pushing them to their limit.
