It's currently investigating helpers for multiple media formats. You could see advanced chat features in Messenger and WhatsApp, or unique Instagram filters and ads. Video and \"multi-modal\" content could also benefit, Zuckerberg says. In the near future, you'll see an emphasis on tools for creation and expression.</p><p>The social media giant is also pooling its generative AI teams into a single group to help \"turbocharge\" efforts in the emerging field, the executive adds.  He doesn't provide more details, and cautions that there's a \"lot of foundational work to do\" before the most advanced projects come to fruition.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company isn't new to some level of user-facing AI. It <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-12-chatbots-arrive-on-facebook-messenger.html\">introduced chatbots to Messenger </a>in 2016, for example. This represents a significant expansion, however, and isn't surprising given the industry's growing focus on generative AI. Internet behemoths like Google reportedly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-chatgpt-ai-chatbot-search-170007802.html\">feel competitive pressure</a> from OpenAI's ChatGPT, as it could theoretically undermine search and other key businesses. Zuckerberg said during Meta's latest earnings call that he wanted the firm to be a \"leader\" in generative AI, but this may also represent a defensive tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The shift doesn't come at a great moment, however. Meta's revenues are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-billion-meta-q4-2022-earnings-223814979.html\">still shrinking</a>, and its pivot to the metaverse is costing billions of dollars at its Reality Labs unit.

WBD claims Paramount &quot;blatantly intended&quot; to steer users toward its service by not only offering new specials, but by shortchanging the HBO service on promised regular season content.</p><p>HBO Max was reportedly promised three new seasons with 10 episodes each. However, the provider says it only got eight episodes across the two delivered seasons, and that the next season's six episodes also fall short. On top of this, Paramount supposedly used &quot;verbal trickery&quot; to rebrand content as movies or events to avoid sending video to its competitor.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In a statement to Engadget, Paramount claims the lawsuit is &quot;without merit.&quot; It also maintains that it's still honoring the contract despite Warner supposedly failing to pay licensing fees for already-delivered <em>South Park</em> episodes. We've asked WBD for comment.</p><p>The lawsuit isn't shocking. WBD, previously WarnerMedia, was determined to amass as much content as possible for HBO Max ahead of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-availability-movies-shows-140049904.html\">2020 launch</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-hbo-max.html\"><em>Friends</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-doctor-who-hbo-max-streaming-bbc-the-office.html\"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>. Whether or not Paramount violated its contract, the <em>South Park</em> content on Paramount+ diminishes HBO Max's content advantage \u2014 you no longer have to use that service if you want to stream the recent adventures of Cartman and crew.</p><p>Paramount, meanwhile, has multiple reasons to contest the lawsuit. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-subscribers-grow-152820376.html\">Paramount+ is thriving</a> even as rivals like Netflix run into trouble, having topped 43 million users as of last spring. While it's unclear how much of a role <em>South Park</em> is playing in that growth, the company may not want to give up streaming rights for one of its best-known shows (Paramount owns Comedy Central, remember) without a fight.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/south-park-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-lawsuit-211615299.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-27 21:16:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Kindle Scribe update adds new brushes and better organization", "description": "<p>Amazon is adding new features to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-scribe-review-e-ink-reader-tablet-pen-drawing-price-battery-life-140019784.html\">Kindle Scribe</a>.

But if you can't drop $350 or so on a new set of headphones, they can get you much of the way there at a far lower cost.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Both pairs offer a comfortable fit that doesn't clamp too tight on the head and offers ample padding. Both have superb battery life, lasting between 40 and 50 hours at moderate volumes. Both can connect to two devices simultaneously. Both come with a 3.5mm cable for wired listening, though only the Space Q45 can still use ANC when that's in use. Both come with a transparency mode, which is serviceable, though not as clean as what you can get on pricier alternatives. And while the ANC on each pair isn't top-of-the-line, it's still good, particularly when it comes to muting bass-range noises like a plane or bus engine.</p><p>Sound quality is where the Life Q30 and Space Q45 might require some tweaking. Both headphones offer a strongly v-shaped profile out of the box, so their default sound is particularly boosted in the bass and highest parts of the treble. The Life Q30's low-end is especially boomy. Some may like this more excited sound, but it's not exactly natural. With either headphone, you may want to adjust the sound through Anker's companion app, which offers a graphic EQ tool and a few alternative sound profile presets. Just note that, like many cheaper ANC headphones, the signature will sound slightly different depending on what ambient sound mode you use.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can afford the Space Q45, it's the better headphone of the two. Its design feels a bit less flimsy (though both pairs are mostly plastic), and it has an adaptive ANC mode that can automatically adjust the headphone's ANC strength based on your surroundings. The Life Q30, on the other hand, just offers three preset ANC levels. For Android users, the Space Q45 also supports the higher-quality <a href=\"https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/\">LDAC</a> audio codec. That said, finding any good ANC headphones for less than $100 is difficult; at these deal prices, both the Life Q30 and Space Q45 perform well enough to offer good value.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-noise-canceling-headphones-are-up-to-33-percent-off-right-now-160747643.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-27 16:07:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Pok\u00e9mon Sleep' will finally arrive this summer", "description": "<p>Almost four years after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-28-pokemon-sleep.html\">it was announced</a>, <em>Pok\u00e9mon Sleep </em>is finally on the way.

The OnePlus 11 Concept centers on &quot;Active CryoFlux&quot; liquid cooling that mimics what you see in some gaming PCs. The system uses a piezoelectric ceramic micropump to send cooling fluid throughout pipelines in the phone (visible on the outside) without &quot;significantly&quot; increasing the phone's bulk.</p><p>The result is a slight but tangible performance improvement, OnePlus claims.

It was a Chinese-market prototype with several rough edges, but even so, it made a fairly compelling case for its own existence. Now, three months later, the company has rocked up to MWC with the finished version that\u2019s intended to be sold on this side of the equator. The big news is the price, which is pegged at \u20ac1,599 (around $1,690) for the one model, with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage, the same as Samsung\u2019s Z Flip 4. The only difference is that, with Samsung\u2019s handset, you\u2019ll get 12GB RAM but only 256GB storage.</p><p>When I spent a few days with the handset, I found plenty of features that merited praise, like the fact it folds flat. Certainly, Honor feels that its second-generation hinge, which keeps the handset tidy in your pocket, is worthy of shouting about. And it has promised that the hinge will withstand 400,000 folds before conking out, and you\u2019ll find yourself gravitating towards that internal screen more than you might expect. While not as well-equipped as the 6.45-inch exterior screen, the 7.9-inch foldable OLED is good enough to sit back and enjoy a movie, or your emails, with. And it\u2019s fast enough to run pretty much anything you\u2019d want to throw at it without breaking much of a sweat.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If there\u2019s one wrinkle, it\u2019s that these devices may not be the future of foldables as much as the narrower, more fashionable clamshells. Devices like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-hands-on-fixing-the-foldables-shortcomings-150021728.html\"><ins>Oppo\u2019s Find N2</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html\"><ins>Samsung\u2019s latest Z Flip</ins></a> are both more pocket-and-wallet-friendly than their swole counterparts. And that counts for a lot for folks who don\u2019t feel the need to whip out a small tablet when they\u2019re scrolling Instagram. But for the sort of people who, like me, are nerdy enough to want a machine they could theoretically do some work from while on the go, the meatier versions are still king.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-vs-europe-price-availability-133824755.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-27 13:38:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Honor\u2019s Magic 5 Pro offers a polished alternative for Android connoisseurs", "description": "<p>After breaking from Huawei, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/huawei-honor-sold-024435704.html\">Honor</a> has made the case that, in Europe at least, it is Samsung\u2019s true rival in the Android space. In the last three years, it has offered flagship phones that are spec-for-spec the equal of whatever that year\u2019s S-series is packing. Sadly, it\u2019s also doing this at a time when the spec arms race is all but done, and it\u2019s harder than ever to actually stand out amongst the crowd. The Magic 5 Pro doesn\u2019t deviate from the template laid down by its two predecessors, so Honor can\u2019t play on your neophilia as a reason to buy it. But there might be something in the sheer muscularity of its offering that could tempt you into making the switch.</p><p>The Magic 5 Pro is making its debut at MWC in Barcelona, and will be sold in both Europe and China. Design-wise, it\u2019s close to its predecessor, but Honor says the new handset apes the sweeping, organic curves favored by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. Where the Magic 4 Pro had a fairly hard line around its camera hump \u2013 sorry, Eye of Muse \u2013 here the back cover pours itself into the bump quite seamlessly. It\u2019s comfortable enough in your hand and light enough to hold, but you\u2019ll need the case to keep things pristine. It\u2019s available in fingerprint-magnet piano Black and Meadow Green, which looks nicer in person than it does in photos.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Render of Honor's Magic 5 Pro in Meadow Green, stood monolithically in a pastoral scene.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/dccf7940-b68a-11ed-bbff-9e5f48aa7b84\" style=\"height: 1013; width: 1800;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Honor</div></figure><p>A sense of evolution, rather than revolution, continues along the rest of the spec list, with little major difference between the Magic 4 and its replacement. The \u201cQuad Curved Floating Screen\u201d is, like the Magic 4, a 6.81-inch, 120Hz, LTPO OLED display with a 2,848 x 1,312 resolution that curves into the frame. Honor says that the enhancements are mostly behind the scenes, with a new discrete display chipset for better video quality and better brightness. Whereas the Magic 4 could muster up 1,000 nits, its successor can crank out 1,300 nits, or 1,800 nits at peak.</p><p>Nestled inside is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, up from the Gen 1 found on the Magic 4, matching the silicon inside the S23, which is paired with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage. Although Honor can\u2019t call upon the same overclocking magic found in Samsung\u2019s handset, it does say its AI-infused performance software will do a similar job. Sadly, I had all of ten minutes to spend with the handset and so there wasn\u2019t the chance to do any serious stress testing. But history tells us that a handset this chock-full of gear is hardly going to be a slouch.</p><p>A 5,100mAh battery is powering the show here, a significantly bigger battery than the 4,500 found on the 4. This, I suspect, is the reason this handset is four grams heavier than the last one, but what\u2019s a couple of grams between friends, eh? That cell will accept 66W wired or 50W wireless charging, if you have the necessary Honor SuperCharge stand in your home. As I said above, this is more or less what you\u2019d expect with any Android flagship these days.</p><p>The major selling point for a handset like this is the camera, and Honor is doing its usual job here. Magic 5 Pro comes with a \u201cStar Wheel\u201d version of its \u201cEye of Muse\u201d camera ring, packed with three beefy lenses jutting out from the back. First is a 50-megapixel, f/1.6 lens with a custom 1/1.12-inch sensor, the manufacturer of which I don\u2019t yet know. That\u2019s paired with a 50-megapixel, f/2.0 ultra-wide camera with a 122-degree field of view and a 50-megapixel, f/3.0 periscope telephoto with a 3.5x optical zoom and 100x digital zoom connected to Sony\u2019s IMX858 image sensor. Less attention is given to the forward facing camera, which is probably the same 12-megapixel, f/2.4 unit paired with a 3D depth camera as found in the Magic 4 Pro.</p><p>(Those with long memories, or access to Google, will recall that the Magic 4 Pro\u2019s telephoto lens had a quoted resolution of 64-megapixels. An Honor spokesperson said that the switch is down to an improvement in sensor size, and the new image engine will offer \u201cfar better light sensing.\u201d)</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of both colorways of Honor's Magic 5 Pro side-by side, including the fingerprint-smeared piano gloss black (which I'd wiped seconds before) and the green version, which looks more petrol in the images.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/a74d5790-b376-11ed-b75f-5f65b6c8bceb\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Supporting the headline trio is, again, an 8x8 Direct Time of Flight Sensor for laser focusing, a multi-spectrum color temperature and flicker sensor. Those will all add muscle to the handset\u2019s upgraded image engine, promising faster capture, better HDR and higher quality computational photography. The company hinted about further improvements to the stills shooting, and while the video-shooting abilities garnered nary a mention, it\u2019ll still output (compressed) \u201cLog\u201d footage using Honor\u2019s proprietary Magic-Log format.</p><p>As for what you can do with those lenses, Honor is making the same noises it\u2019s always made about its class-leading imaging. As well as a Dxomark score of 152, the company \u2014 before the handset was even announced \u2013 bragged that the Magic 5 Pro\u2019s camera was good enough to capture a Guinness World Record in the making. And that its AI smarts were capable of plucking a single, perfect frame of a basketballer mid-dunk that was worthy of sharing.</p><div id=\"2c7d0bb087654c88981e13a89a91fd4a\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Congrats <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Honorglobal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HONORGlobal</a>!

As we learned last year when we really tested the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-4-pro-2022-130056532.html\">Magic 4 Pro\u2019s promise of 4K video shooting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic4-pro-camera-test-log-filming-160055384.html\">promises are cheaper than delivering</a>.</p><p>One thing that\u2019s clear about so many handsets these days is that companies are looking for marginal gains all over the package. For instance, Honor says the Magic 5 Pro has discrete Bluetooth and WiFi antennas which should boost download speeds and improve the reliability of your Bluetooth connection. It\u2019s hard to see if those are current gripes with a wide number of users, but it\u2019s good to see some thought put to improving matters.</p><p>And Honor has also revived a much-ballyhooed, rarely-loved <del>gimmick</del> feature in the form of air gestures. Now, you can control elements of your phone\u2019s UI from a foot over the top of the front facing camera, when you\u2019re trying to browse recipes with messy hands. Honor says that their return is thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\u2019s additional power, which is capable of watching your hand movements without putting too much pressure on the system-on-chip.</p><p>Now, I only had about ten minutes of time with the handset, and there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of stuff I could do to put it through its paces. I will say that I\u2019m expecting the imaging performance to be a lot snappier than what was available on the demo unit, which felt a little sluggish. And that while nobody\u2019s expecting any smartphone maker to reinvent the wheel, there\u2019s fewer marks on offer for polish. As I said at the top, my initial impression of Honor\u2019s Magic 5 Pro is of a handset that doesn\u2019t deviate from the template laid down by its two immediate predecessors, but one that\u2019s been polished to a very high shine.</p><p>Sadly, Honor was keeping details of the Magic 5 Pro\u2019s price a secret until the conclusion of its press conference. And so, this section will be fleshed out as soon as we have the information about how much this thing will cost, and when you get it. But I suspect that Honor will need to trim its asking price if it wants to tempt away folks who, right now, have sworn their brand allegiance to Samsung.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-5-pro-mwc-2023-first-look-133059255.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-27 13:30:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Scientists confirm a fifth layer inside the Earth's core", "description": "<p>Tear down the middle school geology posters: We have an update.

This year, the Android giant is <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2023/\">unveiling</a> a raft of minor additions to Android and Wear OS designed to further smooth the bumps in your digital life. That includes a new widget for Google Keep that\u2019ll let you check-off to-do lists from the comfort of your home screen. You\u2019ll also get the ability to, with a compatible watch, let you dictate notes and to-do list items from your wrist.</p><p>Another more notable change is improved noise cancellation in Google Meet when used on some Android devices. The company says that, much like the feature as it already exists, you\u2019ll find the noise of nearby construction or other distractions will be crunched to oblivion while you chat. And, on the audio front, Google says that you\u2019ll soon be able to use Chrome OS' <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-27-google-android-chromebook-fast-pair-bluetooth-sync.html\">Fast Pair</a> feature to connect new Bluetooth headphones to your machine with a single tap.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Less notable additions include the ability to mash together different emoji to offer a more topic relevant response.

(<em>This</em> user would like to disagree, speaking from experience that <em>anything</em> over 100g pressing on your nose is still too much to take for extended periods of time.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As for the displays, the headset is packing a pair of microOLED displays hooked up to a pair of \u201cfree-form, light-guiding\u201d prisms so pixel-dense, your eyes won\u2019t spot the squares. The company says, too, that you\u2019ll experience less brightness loss than with other close-up displays, and can crank out a peak brightness of 1,200nits. And, for immersion\u2019s sake, the front of the lenses are electrochromic, automatically dimming when you need to focus on the virtual world.</p><div id=\"ccb8a6f9e65d48bfb53e7b58e172f379\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Boasting a retina-level near-eye display for AR glasses, Xiaomi Wireless AR Glass Discovery Edition delivers a truly immersive visual experience.

In a concept video, a wearer looks at a smart light and deactivates it by flicking a virtual switch hovering over the device itself.

At $250, it'll run all day, has a nice bright display and its processor is still plenty snappy for gaming and general multitasking. Its wide-angle camera with Center Stage makes it easier for the family to video call friends and loved ones by bundling everyone into the frame.

They announced the collaboration at last week's E-Class event and revealed more details at Mobile World Congress. &quot;This partnership will help people get work done safely, securely and comfortably in their vehicles,&quot; the companies said in a press release.

Meetings and calls are audio-only unless you're parked, in which case you'll have access to video meetings, AI-powered transcription, content sharing functions and emoji reactions. There'll be a Webex app in the Mercedes Benz Car App Store, while the built-in WiFi and cellular data connection mean you don't need your phone at all to hop into a meeting. At least for someone, I'm sure that's the embodiment of living the dream.</p><p>In fairness, there are some use cases where Webex in a car may make sense. Mercedes and Cisco suggested that an architect might need to check in with their colleagues immediately after leaving a work site, while someone might have to jump into a meeting right after dropping off the kids at school. Conference calls certainly happen in cars.</p><p>This isn't exactly the first time that a meeting app has invaded cars.

Webex is available in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-f150-lightning-ev-video-conference-cisco-144524364.html\">some Ford models too</a>.
