There was Jadon Sancho, who came on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Manchester United in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/26/manchester-united-newcastle-united-carabao-cup-final-match-report" title="">their 2-0 Carabao Cup final victory</a> against Newcastle, leaving Wembley on Sunday night with a blaring ghetto blaster, which was quite the change from the usual chunky headphones.</p><p>For a few seconds, Wout Weghorst, holding court, was drowned out.

<p>The last time he was let out of jail, Charles Bronson robbed a jeweller’s and fought a rottweiler. Will this time be different for the inmate now known as Salvador?</p><p>The prisoner formerly known as Bronson wants the world to know he has changed. “I’ve done some mad things, I’ve been a nasty bastard,” he says from his maximum security cell in one of the many prisons where he has been incarcerated since being jailed in 1974 for armed robbery (with only a brief spell of freedom in the late 1980s). “I have found my true self through my art. I’ve swapped the sawn-off shotgun for the sawn-off paintbrush.”</p><p>These days he calls himself Charles Salvador. He even has a Dalí moustache. Auctioneers of his pictures of prison and psychiatric hospital life call him an outsider artist. Nonsense. He’s an insider, though that may change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/27/bronson-fit-to-be-free-review-has-britains-most-violent-criminal-really-been-saved-by-art">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The much-loved gaffer was killed off at the end of the last series, but Chris Lang’s show is as taut and tense and pleasurable as ever</p><p>I love Unforgotten wholeheartedly. It’s the meat and two veg of television crime dramas. Every one of its four series so far has served up a rock-solid mystery, establishing a historical murder case and solving it within six tense, taut weeks. It may not have an HBO hiss at the start, or an A-lister in a leading role, but this is television to savour.</p><p>Of course, the drama begins its fifth series under a giant cloud in the shape of Nicola Walker. It ended its last run by bumping off the much-loved gaffer, Cassie Stuart, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/29/unforgotten-series-four-finale-recap-the-final-curtain">killing her in a car crash</a> after a bout of work-related burnout and exhaustion. Hers is such a big chair to fill that many thought the series would end for good, but the creator, Chris Lang, has chosen to continue, taking a grieving Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) into a Cassie-less future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/27/unforgotten-series-five-review-still-cracking-drama-even-without-nicola-walker">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak’s deal shows that nowhere does the promise to slash red tape ring more hollow than in Northern Ireland</p><p>Rishi Sunak is right to think that securing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/27/rishi-sunak-deal-eu-brexit-northern-ireland-protocol" title="">new deal</a> on Northern Ireland’s trading arrangements with the European Union is a “turning point”.

That is likely to be the stick waved at the prime minister by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/brexit-sunak-von-der-leyen-rees-mogg/" title="">hardline</a> Brexiters in his party. Yet these are the MPs – led by Boris Johnson – who claimed that the Irish border would be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35692452" title="">unaffected</a> by leaving the EU. It is the Conservative party’s failure to confront this thinking head on that has done so much damage to the country.</p><p>The prime minister is taking a calculated risk. Mr Sunak plainly desires a better working relationship with Brussels. The Tory leader wants to be able to get on with reviving the UK economy and ensure that his summit with the French president <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/british-pm-sunak-meet-frances-macron-paris-march-10-elysee-2023-01-11/" title="">next month</a> gets a deal on small boat crossings.

<p>The surprise victory of Elly Schlein can galvanise the demoralised Democratic party</p><p>On the eve of last autumn’s crushing election defeat for Italy’s Democratic party (PD), one of the party’s youthful rising stars addressed a <em>cri de coeur</em> to a rally in Rome. “I am a woman,” <a href="https://news.italy24.press/news/383689.html" title="">said Elly Schlein</a>, “I love another woman and I am not a mother, but I am no less a woman for this.” The words were a clever liberal rejoinder to Italy’s current prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who had famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEovvFeyWis" title="">signalled</a> her social conservatism on LGBT+ rights and abortion with the formulation: “I am Giorgia, I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, I am a Christian.”</p><p>This weekend’s surprise <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/27/elly-schlein-voted-leader-of-italy-democratic-party-surprise-win" title="">election</a> of Ms Schlein as the first female leader of the PD ensures that this radical clash of perspectives – along with similarly clear blue water on inequality, the green transition and the migration crisis – is now front and centre in Italian politics. A startling turn of events, for a previously moribund centre-left it is also a potentially galvanising one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-leader-of-italys-left-a-feminist-fresh-start">Continue reading...</a>

## Nine tomatoes for fifteen pounds? How the very basics became more expensive than oysters | Zoe Williams

<p>Welcome to the ‘hungry gap’ – the time of year when salad days are months away, and there simply isn’t enough food. To confront this in 2023 forces a reckoning</p><p>I don’t even like tomatoes, especially, but I seemed to have nine in a paper bag, and had picked them up with my own hands – this detail will be important later. I had a couple of other things – a single onion and some herb that I could have just as easily stolen from a front garden – and my plan was to make salsa for assorted teenage fusspots, as well as tomato soup. Fifteen quid? I thought the decimal point was in the wrong place. Then I thought it must be a language barrier, and “15” was Portuguese for £4.50. I didn’t really want to interrogate the shopkeeper, who I know by name, though she doesn’t know my name, so there’s a world in which I could have just dropped the lot and run. Obviously, I couldn’t just get fewer tomatoes, because I had handled them all. But I had embarked on work to outsource to Doritos and Heinz at one seventh of the cost and a 70th of the time, and it felt mad, obscurely vain, like Marie Antoinette milking a goat on her fake farm, a spoilt pantomime of the simple life.</p><p>I realise I’m not the only person to have noticed this, though I may be the first person to notice it only after I was locked in to a massive nine-tomato deal. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/feb/23/uk-shortages-fruit-vegetables-supermarkets-bae-systems-inflation-stock-markets-business-live#:~:text=ago%2008.16%20EST-,Theresa%20Coffey%20suggests%20people%20would%20be%20eating%20turnips%20right%20now,buy%20tomatoes%2C%20without%20overseas%20imports.">Thérèse Coffey had already suggested we replace tomatoes with turnips</a>, cue government cheerleaders suddenly full of enthusiasm for what we now call “winter salad” and previously called “coleslaw”.

<p>British jumping stables face another almighty pasting at the hands of their Irish counterparts at the Festival next month</p><p>The 2023 Cheltenham Festival opens two weeks on Tuesday, the significant trials have all been run and the ante-post markets suggest that British jumping stables face another almighty pasting at the hands of their Irish counterparts in the west country next month.</p><p>Ireland left Cheltenham with “just” 18 of the 28 winners last year, five down on their record haul of 23 in 2021. Any lingering hopes on the home side that Irish dominance might be waning, however, now seem woefully premature. Just six of the 28 races at next month’s meeting have a British-trained favourite, while Willie Mullins alone has the favourite or joint-favourite in 13. Ireland’s perennial champion is quoted at around 7-4 to either equal or extend his own record of 10 winners at a single Festival, which he set 12 months ago, and could conceivably get the dozen he needs to become the first trainer to saddle 100 Festival winners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/27/talking-horses-britain-v-ireland-at-cheltenham-could-be-one-sided-battle">Continue reading...</a>

First, that the film, which is finally getting limited and on-demand release this week in the US, was one of most evocative depictions of suburban adolescence that I’d seen – a languid summer of couch hangs and knobby knees, afternoon ice cream and sex jokes, a whole lot of lying around and talking about nothing. And second, that the portrayal of the relationship between 17-year-old Lea, played by the 22-year-old yet younger-looking Lily McInerny, and 34-year-old Tom, played by a convincingly thirtysomething Jonathan Tucker, was a remarkably tricky balancing act, one that has stuck with me for over a year.</p><p>Writer/director Jamie Dack’s feature debut accomplishes a fraught double vision: you can see, in the film’s entrancing first act, why Lea is attracted to Tom, a construction contractor she first encounters at a late-night diner. You can also see he’s manipulating her. Lea is bored and isolated, frustrated with her working single mother and the tight hems of her world. Tom has a car and a job and answers to no one. He takes her fledgling interests – in singing, in worrying about the future, in herself – seriously. The boys she hangs around, who crudely rank attractiveness and fumble at sex in the backseat of a car, are fresh-faced and adolescent-metabolism thin. Tom has muscles and moves with assurance. He’s a thrill, his attention both intoxicating and validating. He’s also clearly, to anyone watching, ridden with red flags. (Lea can see it a little, too – she hides the truth from her friends, who half-jokingly call him a “perv”.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/27/palm-trees-and-power-lines-sundance-jamie-dack-grooming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These two moreish weeknight curries – the first light and fresh and the second indulgent and richly spiced – rely on store-cupboard ingredients with fresh veg thrown in</p><p>Chickpeas are a store-cupboard staple for me – they’re such a helpful starting point for dinner when there’s not much else in the house. Both of today’s incredibly moreish curries rely on store-cupboard spices and ingredients, with lovely fresh veg thrown in for added flavour and interest. The richly spiced one-tin malai chickpea curry feels really indulgent, thanks to the addition of fresh cream, while the vegan chickpea, cauliflower and coconut curry is fresh and light, and finished with lime juice to balance the coconut milk.</p><p>Rukmini Iyer is the author of The Roasting Tin series.

<p>Drama about a mother and daughter’s struggle to stay afloat in the pandemic holds on to a warm optimism</p><p>This pandemic-set drama exudes frustration and exasperation, but always remains in touch with an essential openness and optimism. It’s anchored in a smart performance from co-director Kalley Kali who, as bereaved gig-economy hustler Danny, seems in a permanent state of sadness and mild distraction – though possibly the latter is something to do with the fact she performs most of the time on rollerblades.</p><p>Danny is living in a tent in the scrub somewhere on the edge of Los Angeles (presumably Pacoima, where this was filmed) with her eight-year-old daughter, Wes (Wesley Moss). She tells her kid that it’s just for fun, trying to shield her from the harsh truth: they’ve become homeless following the death of her partner and Wes’s father.

First female speaker of the Commons known for her brisk, good-humoured style, and as a shrewd political tactician<p>Betty Boothroyd, Lady Boothroyd, who has died aged 93, overturned more than 700 years of parliamentary tradition in 1992 when she became the first woman to be elected speaker of the House of Commons. She was a successful and popular speaker who acquired international fame for her brisk, good-humoured style and for the warmth and wit she exuded, along with a whiff of glamour.</p><p>Boothroyd was the Labour MP for West Bromwich from 1973 and for West Bromwich West – when the seat was split in two the following year – until her retirement in 2000. She played a leading part behind the scenes as a rightwing party loyalist in the power struggles within the party during the 1970s and 80s. She was a shrewd political tactician, as was shown by her success in winning the speakership. She was only the third Labour MP ever to take the chair and she did so by defeating the Conservative candidate, Peter Brooke, by 372 votes to 238 in the first contested election for speaker in over 40 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/27/lady-betty-boothroyd-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## Napoli are champions elect but does a lack of competition take the gloss off? | Nicky Bandini

<p>Luciano Spalletti’s side are now 18 points clear in their Scudetto quest, with Milan, Inter and Juventus nowhere to be seen</p><p>The Stadio Carlo Castellani held some unhappy recent memories for Napoli. It was here that their title challenge unravelled last April, as a 2-0 lead over Empoli in the 80th minute became a 3-2 defeat. They were authors of their own demise back then, the equaliser arriving when goalkeeper Alex Meret dallied in possession and allowed Andrea Pinamonti to block an attempted clearance straight into his net.</p><p>Could they self-destruct a second time? They held an identical 2-0 advantage on Sunday when Mário Rui earned a pointless red card, kicking out at Francesco Caputo. Instead of wobbling, Napoli became even more dominant down a man, enjoying a solid five-minute stretch inside the final quarter-hour when they did not allow Empoli a touch outside of their own half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/27/napoli-are-champions-elect-but-does-a-lack-of-competition-take-the-gloss-off">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 37-year-old captain has ‘scars everywhere’ but is ready to fight on, with the record as the most capped Saint of all time in his sights</p><p>“I don’t mind a bit of pain every now and again as it reminds you that you’re alive,” James Roby says with a smiley little grimace on a sun-kissed winter afternoon in St Helens. The 37-year-old captain of the Super League champions will soon reflect on Saints’ remarkable victory against Penrith Panthers in Australia this month when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/18/penrith-panthers-st-helens-world-club-challenge-rugby-league-match-report">won the World Club Challenge</a>. As the first British team to win the competition away from home since Wigan in 1994, St Helens have built a sustained success exemplified by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBmALu8EppY">Roby’s astonishing consistency</a> after 20 years at the peak of a brutal sport.</p><p>“I’ve played it for a long, long time,” Roby says in his quietly compelling way. “As you age you get a bit stiffer and more sore in the morning. I come into training and we’ve got lots of young lads bouncing around, without a care in the world. I walk in like I’ve just been in a car crash. I’ve got scars everywhere and I’ve probably injured every part of my body. Fingers, hands, broke my nose loads of times, fractured ribs, sternum and I’ve had seven operations – both ankles done, clean out on my shoulder, elbow and knee but they’re relatively small. I’ve had two groin surgeries which were the biggest ones. If we hadn’t got to the bottom of the problem with the groin surgery in 2019 it would have been the end at 33-ish. So I am lucky to still be playing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/27/st-helens-james-roby-england-rugby-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Environmental changes have had far greater impact than kings and battles</p><p>Historians often rely on new discoveries in order to make breakthroughs. Every now and again, a fresh document, a set of papers or a whole manuscript is found by chance. Maybe something unexpected and surprising will pop up from an archaeological dig or – in the case of inns and oasis towns along the Silk Roads – from the declassification of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia">CIA</a> satellite images taken during the cold war, which revealed sites that had long fallen out of use and been forgotten on the ground.</p><p>Researchers used to dream about such treasure troves. They do not have to any more. We are living not so much in a golden age of new evidence, but in one of hyper-abundance. Almost all of this comes from the physical and natural sciences. Politicians often talk crudely about “choices” between the humanities and Stem subjects, but in today’s world, cutting-edge history is all about understanding, assessing and integrating materials from sources that would have been completely alien to most historians writing just a generation ago. These materials are transforming ideas about the past – often in radical ways. And climate is central to that transformation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/the-big-idea-why-you-cant-leave-climate-out-of-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dried broad beans soften into a miracle ingredient with a smooth and comforting texture that’s perfect for a winter soup</p><p><strong><br /></strong>About 14 miles west of Leicester there is a hamlet called Barton in the Beans. I have visited only by Google <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yew+Tree+House/@52.6538498,-1.4116192,3a,75y,339.03h,103.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sBnwQ03rngV-w5hSV8YhILw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x487757a6de09d695:0x2e3ae187ab3362db!2sBarton+in+the+Beans,+Nuneaton!3b1!8m2!3d52.65428!4d-1.4122081!3m4!1s0x48775778a7744293:0xa510ee7381b0215b!8m2!3d52.6537885!4d-1.4114293">Street View</a> but it is mentioned in the Doomsday Book as Bartone, which signified a barley enclosure or farm owned by the lord of a manor. It is noted as having a population of three households in 1086, putting it in the smallest 20% of settlements recorded (although, rest assured, the lord of the manor, Hugh of Grandmesnil, and his family had oodles of other land). Bartone became Barton in Fabis, <em>fabis</em> being the latin for beans, in this case <em>vicia faba –</em> broad, fava or faba beans – and then later Barton in the Beans: production perpetuated in a name. Importantly, though, bean cultivation in the area – and the consumption of broad and field beans by humans and animals – predates the name, going back to the iron age, and possibly even the bronze age.</p><p>170 miles south, in Somerset, a variety of broad beans took the name of the village where they originated; Martock beans became a staple not only for fasting and bean feasting, but were a fundamental part of the medieval survival diet. They were eaten both fresh and dried, meaning simmered for soups and stews, baked in the oven or ground into flour. According to Marwood Yeatman, in his book The Last Food of England, the Martock bean was mentioned in the manorial rolls of 1273, and also in a saying that goes: “If you shake a Martock man, he rattles.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/27/broad-bean-potato-and-fennel-soup-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Republican leaders draw on Reagan-era nostalgia to unite their party, but a 21st-century cold war would not end well for anyone</p><p>Events surrounding the first year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have had a cold war-esque feel, with America and its allies lined up on one side and China and Russia on the other. Some politicians in Washington – and perhaps Beijing – seem comfortable with this. But they should be careful. There’s no reason to believe a cold war re-run in the 21st century would turn out well for anyone, above all the US.</p><p>This past week, President Biden paid a dramatic visit to Kyiv and then addressed a crowd in Warsaw, pledging unwavering US support for Ukraine. President Putin gave a speech of his own in which he stubbornly insisted that Nato was to blame for the war and suspended Russia’s participation in a vital nuclear arms control treaty. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, meanwhile confronted his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Munich, warning China not to supply Russia with weapons. Yi then flew to Moscow and stood alongside President Putin for a photo opportunity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2023/feb/27/new-cold-war-russia-ukraine-biden-republicans-china">Continue reading...</a>

## Old God’s Time by Sebastian Barry review – a cop you can’t trust

<p>A murder investigation leads a retired policeman to confront his past in a stately, often dreamlike novel about the impact of trauma on memory</p><p>Sebastian Barry has been acclaimed as a novelist, playwright and poet, twice winning the Costa book of the year for his novels <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-scripture-9780571323951">The Secret Scripture</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/06/days-without-end-sebastian-barry-review-love-letter-to-american-west">Days Without End</a></em><em>,</em> and serving as laureate for Irish fiction from 2018-21. It’s heartening, then, to see him continuing to take risks, as he does in his new novel, his 11th. Here, Barry’s cogent, often glossy prose looks to reproduce the backtracking of false testimony, feeding the reader dead-end leads and disinformation.</p><p>Its protagonist and narrator, Tom Kettle, is a retired policeman living among the gothic wilds of the Irish coast in a lean-to attached to a Victorian castle. He’s “the orphan of his former happiness”; a crushing set of personal losses – his wife and two children are dead but hauntingly present – having left him isolated and confused. His hard-earned peace is disturbed when two former colleagues knock at his door, asking for help on a cold case concerning “the fecking priests”. Barry’s introduction of this shameful chapter of recent Irish history, the covered-up crimes of the “empire of the Irish priesthood”, which caused so much suffering to infants in its care, energises his stately writing, resulting in a book that addresses the impact of trauma on memory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/old-gods-time-by-sebastian-barry-review-a-cop-you-cant-trust">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After deciding it’s time to seek help with his cleaning business, despairing Chak meets the zanily upbeat Candy</p><p>Set in Hong Kong during the early days of the pandemic, Lam Sum’s tender drama pictures a city haunted by economic and political uncertainty. Storefronts are plastered with foreclosure and bankruptcy notices, while talk of moving abroad hovers amid everyday conversations. Plagued by faulty equipment, the one-man sanitary service operated by world-weary Chak (played by Cantopop star Louis Cheung) is on the verge of breaking down. When asked by his ailing mother if God is telling him to give up the business, Chak self-deprecatingly describes himself as a speck of dust, so tiny that even the deities would not take notice.</p><p>Reluctantly hired as an extra pair of helping hands on his cleaning rounds, single-mom Candy (Angela Yuen) enters Chak’s life like a whirlwind of chaos. With her impossibly sunny attitude and colourful fashion sense, Candy could have come off as a manic pixie archetype; Yuen instead manages to lend an emotional weight to the character’s capricious quirkiness. A particularly devastating sequence finds the pair scrubbing the human-shaped stain left by a nameless soul who has died alone in squalor, another speck of dust forgotten by the outside world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/27/the-narrow-road-review-tough-times-for-the-downtrodden-in-pandemic-hong-kong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As her catalogue is reissued, the Chicago club kid dishes on why Windy City’s DIY scene outshone NYC, and how she hit out against Reagan and hustled for the spotlight</p><p>When a record label contacted her wanting to reissue her 35-year-old debut single, Kate Fagan thought it was a prank call. She had released the track, I Don’t Wanna Be Too Cool, on her friends’ DIY imprint; it had made the rounds in the underground clubs and bars of Chicago’s punk scene before fading into obscurity. Now, Fagan is based in New Orleans, where she still performs and plays shows – but she says that nobody knew who she was when she got the call in 2016. “The call stunned me, it tickled me,” she laughs. “Who knew that all these years later that song would still mean something to people?”</p><p>The song was written in response to the “hipster culture” she had come of age around in New York; over a skippy drum machine and a jangly bassline, Fagan tears apart the materialism and commercialism she had seen in the late 1970s. It became an anthem for those disillusioned with the scene. “I felt Studio 54 was based on status, money, being able to get on to the list, things like that,” she says, describing the “cocaine glamour” and designer clothes that were in vogue. “I didn’t wanna wear a logo on my shirt, I didn’t wanna wear Calvin Klein on the back of my jeans.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/27/kate-fagan-i-dont-wanna-be-too-cool">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This weird, hilarious multiverse fantasy has more fresh ideas than the rest of Hollywood’s output put together, plus buckets of heart and phenomenal performances from Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan</p><p>It’s a testament to how far Hollywood has come in recent years that a mind-scrambling sci-fi action comedy, about a stressed Chinese American immigrant who has to save the multiverse, is leading the Oscars race with 11 nominations and is the favourite to win best picture – a standing reinforced by its sweep at the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday.

## Macbeth review – neon-tinted remix plays like a cinematic thriller

<p><strong>Harrogate theatre<br /></strong>Adding their own flashbacks, narration and expletive-laced modern language, Imitating the Dog reimagine the Macbeths as damaged teens killing their way to the top of a criminal hierarchy</p><p>For many productions of Macbeth, the witches pose a problem. These supernatural beings can easily become unwittingly comedic, or simply fail to convince. Imitating the Dog come up with a striking solution: in their version the witches become the storytellers. With nightmarish clown grins painted on their faces, these three tricksters circle the Macbeths, stepping in and out of all the other roles in the drama. They not only prophesy the future, they manipulate it.</p><p>The company has taken a gleefully irreverent approach to the play, chopping up the text, adding in chunks of narration and jamming Shakespearean verse alongside contemporary, expletive-laced speech. The action is relocated from Scotland to Estuary City, a fictional, neon-tinted gangland. The focus is still firmly on the Macbeths, who are reimagined as damaged teenagers who just want to escape the gutter but, no matter what they do, remain trapped within the world of violence projected on the imposing screens behind them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/27/macbeth-review-neon-tinted-remix-harrowgate-theatre-imitating-the-dog">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Graham Potter pleads for patience, Trent Alexander-Arnold’s form a worry and Pep Guardiola wary of being ‘punched’ on run-in</p><p>Casemiro wins things. Before arriving in Manchester he had claimed five Champions Leagues, three La Liga titles, one Copa América and 15 other trophies for club and country. He’d won 10 of the 12 major finals he’d played. Now he has a Carabao Cup. Manchester United signed a player with an intimate knowledge of that winning feeling. But would any of that experience count in a team that had forgotten what was required to get over the line? Without him they had lost three finals in five years while finishing second in the league on two occasions. How fitting that his headed goal began the win against Newcastle. But beyond this single act, his greatest contribution is the way he has lifted those around him; especially his countryman Fred, who could be the most-improved player in English football.

It was primarily a case of endurance, the 61.3 overs he sent down dwarfed only by the 69.5 mustered on a heartbreaking pitch in Barbados a year ago.</p><p>Add in the 17 overs, three for 80 first time around, and the fact the two innings were made back to back by Ben Stokes enforcing the follow-on, the left-armer’s fatigue was understandable, and his role as the seam attack ran out of gas significant.<br /><br />“I feel like I have come on a lot,” said Leach, a cricketer who admits his previously fragile confidence has been alloyed by the ever-encouraging captaincy of Ben Stokes.<br /><br />“Stokesy has talked about wanting to challenge me in lots of different situations. I feel I have learned a hell of a lot and things I will take forward – how I prepare, thinking about county cricket and bowling longer spells.”<br /><br />Asked about his captain’s message after sticking New Zealand back in, Leach replied: “He said: ‘give everything you have got. Sometimes it is just hard graft. You have to keep going, give that bit more and enjoy the graft rather than worry about things not happening’.<br /><br />“That was the message – to enjoy being out there, you are playing for England and trying to win a Test match. What we have seen is, the more we enjoy it the better we play. And it worked.”<br /><br />Leach’s returns from five Tests this winter are 285 overs, 25 wickets at an average of 40 apiece. The 31 year-old revealed at the start of this tour he no longer sweat the last of those digits, Stokes having consistently set attacking fields and placed the focus solely on making breakthroughs.<br /><br />At the Basin Reserve, not renowned for aiding the spinners, he admitted to struggling with the winds at times but had a strong sounding board in Jeetan Patel, the England assistant coach who spent the best part of two decades playing for Wellington.<br /><br />“He is always throwing ideas at me and over that period our relationship has really grown,” said Leach. “He is helping me a lot. He is someone who had a very strong action and could keep going, bowling long spells.<br /><br />“His message is: if the opportunities are not there in certain [domestic] games, it is about me doing that in my practice. It’s a really good learning curve from me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/27/jack-leach-has-learned-a-hell-of-a-lot-and-thriving-for-england-under-stokes">Continue reading...</a>

## Hags by Victoria Smith review – welcome to the age of rage

<p>This rigorous defence of middle-aged women, who are ignored and vilified, is an often painful read and a future classic</p><p>When I went to university in 1988, feminism was wildly unfashionable; if students of both sexes happily queued around the block to hear Germaine Greer lecture on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/nov/13/aphrabehnstillaradicalexa">Aphra Behn</a>, it was considered deeply uncool to own a copy of <em>The Second Sex</em>, let alone to go on about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/16/why-andrea-dworkin-is-the-radical-visionary-feminist-we-need-in-our-terrible-times">Andrea Dworkin</a> or the<em> Sun</em>’s page three. I guess we thought – even those of us who <em>did</em> call ourselves feminists – that progress was inexorable, an optimism that strikes me as blackly comic now. Sometimes, as I sit at my desk in front of a machine that can, with a single click, provide access to every possible kind of sexual image, no matter how graphic, I suddenly see myself at 19, marching angrily into WH Smith to remove its porn mags (we used to dump them on the pavement outside). Such sweet innocence! How badly I miss it.</p><p>Given all this, I should be glad that in 2023, most young women – and many young men – throw the word feminism around like confetti. Thirty years ago, I longed for others to see the world as I did, and after all, there is still so much to be done. But, alas, this isn’t how I feel. Such talk sounds increasingly hollow; a question only of clever marketing. While the pressures on young women are greater than ever, many of their rights terrifyingly under threat, the bigger surprise is that I find myself on the receiving end of as much sexism and misogyny now as I did when my bum was pert and my breasts very bouncy – and nearly all of it comes from those far younger than me. Was the harassment I experienced when I was young better or worse than the dismissive contempt that’s aimed at me today? I’m not sure. All I know is that I’m far angrier now – and far more clear-sighted about the cause of that anger – than I ever was in the days when I campaigned for every female student to have a free rape alarm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/hags-by-victoria-smith-review-welcome-to-the-age-of-rage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This documentary follows Sami families as they fight the Norwegian government for the right to take animals along routes used for generations</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/10/indigenous-sami-reindeer-herders-sweden-green-transition">Indigenous Sami people</a> have lived in Scandinavia for thousands of years, making a living from hunting, fishing and herding reindeer. This mild-mannered but often moving documentary charts one community’s fight to continue herding its reindeer along routes that have been used for generations. The film isn’t doing anything very new: it’s a classic David and Goliath story that pits its plucky Sami underdogs against a big, bad foe (in this case the Norwegian government); but it looks ravishing and is never less than completely engaging.</p><p>Much of the film is spent with herder Simon Marainen, a lonely figure who has taken over the family flock after his two brothers killed themselves and is now passing his skills down to his children. As summer looms, the Marainens’ reindeer migrate to Norway, then mooch back to Sweden for the winter. Herding them, it turns out, isn’t a Christmassy lark, but tough work for tough people, requiring stoutness in bad weather and serious physical strength. Yet it’s beautiful work, too, done on snowmobiles beneath huge pink skies that will make you yearn to jack in your old routines and find simpler ones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/27/radji-review-moving-depiction-of-sami-herders-and-their-reindeer">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Second Test, day four: NZ 209 &amp; 483; England 435-8 &amp; 48-1</li><li>England need 210 runs to win second Test in Wellington</li></ul><p>Was Harry Brook, a £1.3m signing by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the recent Indian Premier League auction, possibly undervalued?<br /><br />At the end of the fourth day at the Basin Reserve, one which witnessed a Kane Williamson masterclass and an England fightback, and set up an intriguing conclusion to this two-Test series, it somehow wasn’t an entirely ridiculous question.<br /><br />Brook scored that eye-watering deal on the basis of his incendiary batting and yet the young Yorkshireman, it transpires, has another string to his bow: partnership breaker, catalyst for a collapse and, most remarkably, kryptonite to a superman performance from Williamson on the day he became New Zealand’s record run-scorer.</p><p>Anyone who rocked up after tea unaware of the match situation was soon given a fair indication when, over the PA system, came the words “from the Adelaide Road End ... Harry Brook”. New Zealand were 442-5 following on – a lead of 226 – and with Ben Stokes unable to bowl due to that long-standing knee issue, and his seamers cooked after 147 overs in the dirt, the point of desperation had been reached.<br /><br />And yet 18 balls into Brook’s array of 65mph dobblers – they’re reasonably accurate, it must be said, sent down off the wrong foot – Williamson possibly feathered a catch to wicketkeeper Ben Foakes down leg. Foakes didn’t appeal, Joe Root at mid-wicket wondered whether he had heard something and Stokes took a good while to decide if he was seriously going to hand Brook a review.<br /><br />As soon as the big screen showed a tremor on Snickometer, hysterics broke out among the England huddle. In fairness, this was Brook’s ninth first-class wicket. But on a day of chasing leather, Williamson having batted beautifully across seven and a half overs of defiance for 132 from 282 balls, it was both an oasis in the desert for the tourists and the spark for a surprising New Zealand collapse.<br /><br />Michael Bracewell soon added to the slightly village feel to proceedings, dozily run out with neither bat or foot grounded despite being physically over the line, with Jack Leach then bringing out the fire extinguisher on the innings to finish with five for 157 from 61.3 gruelling overs. New Zealand, with Tom Blundell the last to fall for a resolute 90, were all out for 483 and had set England 258 to win.<br /><br />Needless to say these days, the target was attacked during the 11 overs before stumps. Zak Crawley was once again streaky in a 30-ball 24 that ended with him jack-knifed by a ball from Tim Southee that tickled the off stump. But Ben Duckett reached the close unbeaten on 23, the promoted Ollie Robinson alongside him, and England, chasing their seventh successive victory, reached 48-1.<br /><br />While doubtless still baffled by his earlier demise, Williamson could at least reflect on his 26th Test century and having overtaken Ross Taylor’s record 7,683 Test runs for New Zealand first thing - not that he seemed remotely fussed by the latter.<br /><br />When Lebron James nailed a signature jumper in Los Angeles three weeks ago to become the NBA’s all-time highest points-scorer, breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 39-year-old record, he peeled off in celebration, arms aloft, crowd in raptures, and the match was stopped for a ceremony on court.<br /><br />And Williamson? After finessing Jimmy Anderson’s fourth ball of the morning across the deep-midwicket boundary rope to claim the record, he took a stroll down the pitch and brushed away a few specks of dirt like a man tending to his allotment.<br /><br />Amid generous applause from the crowd, and with Taylor soon tweeting congratulations from afar, the great Martin Crowe’s prophecy all those years ago that Williamson would one day reach the country’s summit had been fulfilled – even if the man out in the middle, humbly raking pebbles away from his prized parsnips, was anything but.<br /><br />Resuming on his overnight score of 25, and with his side still 24 runs in arrears, Williamson buried the ego he almost certainly doesn’t possess and settled in for the long haul. Henry Nicholls fell early for 29, Robinson extracting possibly the last bit of movement from the pitch as an edge flew to slip, but impetus came from the hard-handed Daryl Mitchell pumping a run-a-ball 54 in a fifth wicket stand worth 75 runs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/27/harry-brook-halts-williamsons-record-run-as-new-zealand-set-england-target">Continue reading...</a>

Almost immediately, he got pneumonia. While he convalesced, he went to live with a foster family, who were curious about his background and decided to get his DNA tested through a service called Embark.

<p>In its terror of jeopardising slow, marginal change, the party has sacrificed its ambition. It has stigmatised hope</p><p>I am often asked why I hate this country. Whenever I criticise our political culture (which has been rather a lot recently, for obvious reasons), I am asked by various pleasant people on the internet why I am so ungrateful to the country that naturalised me. The simple answer, of course, is that you don’t have to hate a country to point out what is wrong with it. The more complicated answer is that sometimes, you point out what is wrong with the country precisely because you believe – because you know – it can do better. Because you have hope.</p><p>My own hope was cultivated in a country that doesn’t exist any more. It grew every time I found solace in times of precariousness – which I did, over and over again. I arrived in the UK in the mid-noughties, with little money and even fewer connections. I went to night school and survived by finding the cheapest canteens and supermarket deals, and taking temping jobs all over London. I stuffed envelopes and answered phones (badly – I was told I was too curt, and was not invited to return). And when cracks did inevitably appear, in jobs or homes or immigration applications, I came to depend on a growing network of friends and partners who came through for me.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/27/labour-britain-change-hope">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’ll always be a bad feminist!’: Roxane Gay on love, success – and upsetting Piers Morgan

<p>The writer, academic and cultural critic has had a tumultuous few years, full of love, grief and phenomenal creativity. She discusses women’s rights, writer’s block and why every day with her wife remains an adventure</p><p>Once upon a time, almost a decade ago, a funny, fearless, and frank writer from Nebraska <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-sisterhood-fake-orgasm">described herself as a bad feminist</a>. “I am failing as a woman,” she wrote. “I am failing as a feminist. I am a mess of contradictions.” The resulting book of essays, Bad Feminist (2014), heralded a more intersectional era in the movement, calling for less essentialism in feminism and more pluralism. It showed what it was like “to move through the world as a woman”: specifically a Haitian-American in her late 30s, who loathed Django Unchained and loved Scrabble. Perhaps, more than anything it was a manifesto of human imperfection. Thus was Roxane Gay propelled into the literary stratosphere and – as such fairytales tend to go – destined to be forever after probed about the current state of feminism.</p><p>So, nine years on, does the writer, editor, professor, podcaster, cultural critic, and Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University, New Jersey, still consider herself a bad feminist? “I think I’m a better feminist now than I was,” says Gay when we meet on Zoom. “But I’ll always be a bad feminist. I don’t think the term has changed. When I coined it, it was partly serious and partly tongue in cheek: if good feminism is the feminism that overlooks the intersections of identity that we all inhabit, then I’d rather be a bad feminist. Most of the issues I wrote about are sadly just as relevant today. And, in many areas, such as reproductive freedom, we have lost ground, which is a bitter pill to swallow.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/ill-always-be-a-bad-feminist-roxane-gay-on-love-success-and-upsetting-piers-morgan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pompous, sherry-sipping, opera-loving Freudian will soon return. But with Niles out, Seattle abandoned and the star an avowed Trumpist, how can the beloved show recapture its magic? We asked the sitcom’s superfans</p><p>Two decades after his beloved character signed off the airwaves, Kelsey Grammer is finally serving up second helpings of tossed salad and scrambled eggs. The Frasier revival is now in production, after nearly a decade in development – despite some crucial absences. David Hyde Pierce has declined to return as Frasier’s neurotic brother Niles, while John Mahoney, who played their irascible but charming ex-cop father Martin, died in 2018. Factor in Grammer’s outspoken Trumpism, which complicates the legacy of his defining role, and fans may be forgiven for feeling trepidatious. But early reports suggest there may be reasons for optimism over the return of TV’s favourite Freudian.</p><p>After 11 seasons set in Seattle, in an apartment overlooking the city’s Space Needle no less, Frasier is returning to Boston, to reconquer his old Cheers-era stomping ground. “He left with his tail between his legs a little bit,” Grammer said in a recent interview. The 80s bar-room sitcom’s co-creator James Burrows, who also directed the original Frasier pilot, is confirmed to direct the first two episodes of the revival – but the rest finds the good doctor on pastures new.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/27/frasier-reboot-kelsey-grammer-elon-musk-seattle-niles-trumpist">Continue reading...</a>
