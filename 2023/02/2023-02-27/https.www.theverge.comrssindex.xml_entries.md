  <p id="HxbRyO">On the field, things didn’t get off to the best start for the opening weekend of Major League Soccer, which kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/14/23167555/apple-tv-mls-live-sports-streaming">a new 10-year-long streaming deal with Apple</a>. The weekend’s marquee match between crosstown rivals Los Angeles FC and the Los Angeles Galaxy was postponed due to “inclement weather,” and later on, Italian superstar Lorenzo Insigne (the league’s most expensive player) was forced off early with an injury. The opening matches were thusly a little less star-studded — but the product off the field was surprisingly solid, even if it points to a very expensive future for sports fans.</p>

<p id="FaCkDW">Set to The Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” the trailer largely jumps between shots of recognizable characters and places that presumably all appear during season 3. One of the two moments of actual dialogue in the trailer features the gruff Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) saying “great job” — Apple is clearly trying to keep some mystery around what’s to come in the third season.

  <p id="ZADl9x">Spotify’s heart icon is changing to a “plus” button that lets you save music <em>and</em> add songs to specific playlists. The music streaming app <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-27/save-your-favorite-songs-podcasts-and-more-with-spotifys-plus-button/">announced the change in a post on its blog</a>, noting that you’ll now have to tap the new “plus” icon once to save a song or podcast to your library and then tap it again to add it to a playlist of your choosing.</p>
<p id="2o3Vtd">Some users already have the combined “plus” button on their app, as it seems <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/iOS-iPhone-iPad/Exploring-new-ways-of-adding-items-to-quot-Your-Library-quot/td-p/5439116">Spotify has been testing the change</a> since late last year.

  <p id="Bwul8S">Snapchat is introducing a chatbot powered by the latest version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. According to Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, it’s a bet that AI chatbots will increasingly become a part of everyday life for more people.</p>
<p id="9CKHly">Named “My AI,” Snapchat’s bot will be pinned to the app’s chat tab above conversations with friends. While initially only available for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/20/23414867/snapchat-plus-new-features-subscription-announced">$3.99 a month Snapchat Plus subscribers</a>, the goal is to eventually make the bot available to all of Snapchat’s 750 million monthly users, Spiegel tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p>
<p id="QcQoED">“The big idea is that in addition to talking to our friends and family every day, we’re going to talk to AI every day,” he says. “And this is something we’re well positioned to do as a messaging service.”</p>

  <p id="epCQXV">The McDonald’s McRib’s last seasonal appearance in 2022 was said to be its last. McDonald’s marketed last fall’s release as its “farewell tour,” encouraging customers to get it before it was gone forever. Despite this, Alan Klein, creator of the <a href="https://mcriblocator.com/">McRib Locator</a>, will continue to keep up his self-made website that reports and tracks McRib sightings. “I’m helping a larger community,” Klein says. “It’s fellow fans like myself, and that really is what keeps me driven to keep doing it.” </p>
<p id="ozb0jz">Since McDonald’s introduced the McRib in 1981, an avid fan base has developed around the sandwich — and dealt with its inconsistent availability ever since. Despite its popularity, McDonald’s has removed the McRib from its menu numerous times over the past 40...</p>

<p id="knQjvt">The first event, entitled Go/Get, will be held May 17th in New York City and will focus on “family and travel,” the company said.

  <p id="BW7nfC">Tesla is convening its first Investor Day event on March 1st at its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, at which Elon Musk is expected to unleash upon the world his latest Master Plan for the company’s future. Expectations are high, but given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590796/tesla-master-plan-3-date-elon-musk-investor-day">Musk’s penchant for leaving past Master Plan promises unfulfilled</a>, keeping those expectations in check may be a wise move.  </p>
<p id="cTsAuC">Musk has said the event is for “people and life of earth,” adding that “it will be a message of good hope &amp; positivity for the future.” That certainly sounds affirming, but the reality facing Musk and Tesla today undercuts a lot of the optimism of that message. </p>

<p id="MgCL3H">While you can force one of Keep’s current widgets to show just a single note using the tags system, doing so isn’t as simple as just selecting one to display on your home screen. Plus, Keep’s existing widgets don’t have the level of interactivity that Google’s promising with its new widget; if you try to mark off checkboxes, it’ll just open the app instead of actually checking it off like the single note widget will.</p>

<p id="a0pkDA">Yes, it’s designed to look flashy, but OnePlus argues the cooling system serves an important practical purpose. By keeping the phone cooler under load, the company claims you can get better performance from games, and faster charging speeds.
