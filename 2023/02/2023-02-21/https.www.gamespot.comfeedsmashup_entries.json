The character is one of DC's biggest heroes. He stands just outside the DC trinity of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, but he's had two live-action shows to his name, and appeared in a number of DCEU films. He's never had a live-action movie, though, until one was announced alongside the other Justice League-connected movies that followed Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. Ezra Miller initially appeared as the character in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, before having a far more prominent role in 2017's Justice League (as well as the 2021 release of Zack Snyder's Justice League).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once the standalone Flash movie was announced, it went through a veritable <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flash-movie-production-is-tragic-relay-race-of/1100-6445217/\">crowd of potential directors</a>, including The Lego Movie's Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flash-movie-director-leaves-citing-creative-di/1100-6439367/\">Seth Grahame Smith</a> (writer of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcs-the-flash-movie-loses-second-director-delay-no/1100-6444983/\">Rick Famuyiwa</a> (Dope), writer-director duo <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcs-flash-movie-will-reportedly-be-directed-by-spi/1100-6456160/\">John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein</a> (Game Night), before finally landing on <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yet-another-director-is-reportedly-attached-to-dcs/1100-6468200/\">Andy Muschietti</a> (It and It: Chapter Two). Each director (or pair of directors) lasted a while before leaving the movie due to creative differences.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Flash movie also went through <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcs-the-flash-movie-is-being-entirely-rewritten/1100-6447277/\">multiple scripts</a> during this time, with Miller even penning one draft along with comic writer Grant Morrison. Then, members of the Justice League cast (among many others) began to speak out <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyborg-actor-shares-more-comments-about-joss-whedo/1100-6480179/\">about Joss Whedon</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flash-latest-trailer-new-cast-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6511446/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flash-latest-trailer-new-cast-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6511446/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-21 21:40:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Winnie The Pooh: Blood And Honey Review - Not A Very Silly Old Bear", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The good news about Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is that if you have fond memories of Winnie the Pooh from childhood, this movie probably won't ruin those memories for you, as there is not much in this movie that ties it into Winnie the Pooh, other than the names. Unfortunately, Blood and Honey needed more than just names to hold it all together, because all it is is a subpar slasher film with a killer in a Winnie the Pooh mask.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The film opens with an animated prologue, explaining that Christopher Robin befriended Owl, Piglet, Eeyore, and of course, Winnie the Pooh, in 100 Acre Wood. He was the animals' best friend, and he provided for them\u2026 until he went away to college to become a doctor. In that time, food became scarce and Pooh and Piglet resorted to eating Eeyore to survive. (Owl is never mentioned again, nor are any of the other creatures.) This apparently caused Pooh and Piglet to become feral, savage, and psychopathic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Christopher Robin returns five years later to introduce his new wife, Mary, to his animal friends, they are in for a rude surprise: Mary is killed almost immediately, and Christopher Robin is kidnapped and tortured. This all happens before the title sequence. The bulk of the movie is a traditional slasher film: A group of twentysomething girls head out for a weekend at a cabin adjacent to 100 Acre Wood. Pooh and Piglet hear the girls, and the killing begins.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/winnie-the-pooh-blood-and-honey-review-not-a-very-silly-old-bear/1900-6418035/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/winnie-the-pooh-blood-and-honey-review-not-a-very-silly-old-bear/1900-6418035/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-21 21:35:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla Final Update Fixes Inventory Issues And Eivor's Hair", "description": "<p>Ubisoft has announced the final update for its open-world RPG <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/\">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.

As the <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/bringing_challenge_back\">blog post</a> announcing the changes notes, they are intended to bring the difficulty level of Legend to that of the Legendary Campaign activity, and the Master experience to that of day-one raids.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The specifics are too numerous to list exhaustively here, but the removal of the Adept difficulty level is perhaps the most notable. Hero difficulty will now be available at 1750 Power, and Legendary and Master difficulties at 1800, which is the current power cap of the game. Hero, Legend, Master levels will receive a -5, -15, and -20 power level adjustment, while Grandmaster Nightfalls will receive a -25 debuff.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, burns in these high-level activities will now be split into two new categories, \"surges\" and \"threats.\" Surges will increase your outgoing elemental damage by 25%, and there will be a \"featured surge\" every season, as well as one that rotates every week. Threats will increase elemental damage coming from enemies by 25%. Bungie will also introduce \"overcharged\" weapons, which increase damage by 25% and can further increase kinetic damage by 25% if your subclass is surging. However, surges and overcharges do not stack, meaning that you only need and can get one for each damage source.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-getting-major-difficulty-changes-to-raids-dungeons-and-more/1100-6511702/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-getting-major-difficulty-changes-to-raids-dungeons-and-more/1100-6511702/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-21 20:55:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Microsoft Signals It's Unlikely To Divest Call of DutyTo Help Activision Blizzard Deal Pull Through", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft attended a closed hearing to address the European Union's concerns over the Activision Blizzard deal.

For newcomers, this heartfelt action game comes packed with systems and mechanics, so many that it can feel a bit overwhelming. This spin-off stars Sakamoto Ryoma, who looks and sounds like the main protagonist for most of the Yakuza series, as he attempts to get revenge on the man who killed his adopted father. All of this happened during the 1860s, when Japan was experiencing a cultural shift after The Black Ships arrived.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even with the older setting, the main gameplay loop stays the same, with you beating down on random ruffians in the streets as you navigate between the dramatic main plot and some more comical side stories. While beating up random enemies might make the combat feel easy, there are plenty of over-the-top boss fights to keep you on your toes. There is also a small homestead for you to care for and maintain, a fighting arena for you to dominate, and many more small side activities that offer fantastic rewards, if you know where to find them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Like A Dragon: Ishin might not share any narrative beats with the rest of the series, its shared DNA makes it a strong point to jump into the series, especially for people who like historical settings. For those looking to get the most out of this historical epic, here are some tips to help you find your way in 1860s Kyo in Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pick fights frequently</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102256-arena.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>As you roam the streets in Like A Dragon: Ishin, you will frequently run into ruffians, outlaws, or bored samurai, all of whom are looking for a fight. While you can easily avoid these fights by running-- and you might feel a little worn down by how frequently these happen--it's incredibly important to beat these dudes down whenever possible. You will want the XP to empower your different fighting styles, plus you will always receive some money and crafting materials by winning.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Live virtuously</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102262-virtuemenu.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Shortly into Chapter 2, you will be introduced to the Virtue system. You are rewarded Virtue points for winning fights, eating at local establishments, and helping local people. There is also a list of tasks in the menu called the Diligence Records that provide large amounts of Virtue for completing. These points can be exchanged at shrines for a number of different rewards, offering permanent upgrades to your homestead, inventory, and sprint, among many other beneficial bonuses. It's important to regularly exchange your Virtue for these permanent upgrades</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Eat frequently and stock up on healing items</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102263-donquiote.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Eating will refill your health when it's low, in addition to providing Virtue points and endearing you to the local business owners. Keeping your health topped off is important as you run around Kyo, and eating in-between fights can save you precious healing items. You should make sure you always have at least five healing items in your inventory. The reason is that you never really know when you might have to fight a boss-like enemy, who hits harder and has far more health than the usual thugs you take down. If you get caught off guard by a boss fight without healing items, you will have to try and finish the fight or retreat to an old save.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Live like Indiana Jones</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102264-gun.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>On the topic of tough fights, sometimes it pays to behave like Indiana Jones and just shoot your opponent. The Gunman fighting style arms you with only a pistol, which has unlimited ammo and never needs to reload. This allows you to put distance between you and your enemy, while repeatedly dealing high damage to them. Some tough enemies will have attacks that can't be interrupted, and if you aren't prepared for a fair fight, you might just struggle to take them down. Relying on the Gunman fighting style exclusively will likely come back to haunt you, but using it in a pickle will save you a few headaches. This will be especially true for a few early-game fights that might catch you off guard.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Money, money, money</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102265-secondhomefarm.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like many games, you're going to need to keep your coin purse full in Like A Dragon: Ishin. As you progress you will want to upgrade equipment, something that becomes fairly costly, so here are some of the best ways to make money. First up is your homestead, where you can farm and cook. You can sell the items you make via a store log, netting you a decent amount of cash for an activity that is fairly hands off. Another great way to earn money is to do the battle missions you unlock once you become a captain in the Shinsengumi during Chapter 5. These missions require you to run through a short dungeon, collecting items and beating up enemies. There is typically a cash reward upon completion, and you can gather a decent amount of crafting materials as well, which will also be important for upgrading equipment.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Refresh your equipment frequently</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102266-craftingmenu.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Equipment plays an important role in Like A Dragon: Ishin, drastically impacting the amount of damage you can deal and take. Because of its importance, you will want to regularly refresh your gear, making sure that it is the best available to you at the moment. This can be done by visiting one of the arms dealer shops located in Kyo or by visiting the blacksmith located in the western part of the city. At the blacksmith you can upgrade your current gear, including weapons and armor pieces, using money and materials gained from fights. If you find yourself short on materials, the blacksmith sells a limited selection of materials.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Other tips</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4102267-jar.jpg\" /><br /><h3><ul><li> You can find healing items and other random things in jars around the city; just look for the ones with the lids still on.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">You can check the status of your farm from the main menu by navigating to the Other Life section.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">You can find items on the ground by spotting sparkles. Many of these are prize tickets, which can be exchanged for a random prize at the prize stand in the central market in Fushimi.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">If you have unwanted goods, the Pawn Shop in Fushimi is one of the few places you can sell unwanted goods.</li></ul></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/like-a-dragon-ishin-beginner-tips-making-money-upgrading-equipment-and-more/2900-4654/", "date_published": "2023-02-21 19:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Mega Man X Joins Minecraft In New DLC", "description": "<p>Mojang has announced a crossover with Capcom to bring <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/mega-man-x/\">Mega Man X</a> and his friends to the world of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/\">Minecraft</a>.
