## Launch HN: Moonrepo (YC W23) – Open-source build system
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34885077](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34885077)

<p>Hey HN, Miles and James here from Moonrepo (<a href="https://moonrepo.dev">https://moonrepo.dev</a>). Are you struggling with large codebases? Well look no further! We built Moonrepo to simplify repository management, project ownership, task running, and everyday developer and productivity workflows.<p>If you’ve used Bazel (or another “enterprise” build system) in the past, you’re probably aware of how complex they can be to setup, configure, and use. Let alone the cognitive overhead required by developers on a day to day basis. After more than a decade in the industry, with many of those years working on infrastructure and developer tooling related products, we set out to build Moon, a language agnostic build system.<p>Existing systems focused solely on runtime logistics (faster builds, concurrency), while we want to also focus on the developer experience. We do this by automating workflows as much as possible, in an effort to reduce manual work. We constantly sync and verify configuration, so that the repository stays in a healthy state. We also infer/detect as much as we can from the environment/repository/codebase, so pieces "just work".<p>We wanted our system to be enjoyable to use and easy to understand, but also solve the same problems as existing systems. For example, configuration is in YAML, not a proprietary syntax. Tasks are defined and run as if you were running them in the terminal; no more abstractions like BUILD files. Unlike Bazel, we don’t hide or heavily rewrite terminal output, so the feedback loop is what you expect. We manage a toolchain, ensuring the correct version of languages is used (no more “works on my machine”). And lastly, our foundation is built on Rust and Tokio, so performance is first-class, the runtime is reliable, and memory safety is guaranteed.<p>We follow the open core model. Moon is open source, but we’re also working on a few subscription-based services for monitoring and improving your continuous integration pipelines, a registry of project and code ownership, a continuous deployment/delivery board, auxiliary application systems, and more. We haven't finalized the subscription model yet, so there's no pricing information on the website. However, we do have a starter/free tier that everyone can use by registering on <a href="https://moonrepo.app" rel="nofollow">https://moonrepo.app</a>. In the future, we will offer on-prem as well.<p>Although Moonrepo is relatively new, we’re already feature-packed, stable, and used in production. We’re big fans of honest feedback, and look forward to your comments!</p>

## Show HN: Phind.com – Generative AI search engine for developers
 - [https://phind.com](https://phind.com)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-02-21 17:56:43+00:00

<p>Hi HN,<p>Today we're launching phind.com, a developer-focused search engine that uses generative AI to browse the web and answer technical questions, complete with code examples and detailed explanations. It's version 1.0 of what was previously known as Hello (beta.sayhello.so) and has been completely reworked to be more accurate and reliable.<p>Because it's connected to the internet, Phind is always up-to-date and has access to docs, issues, and bugs that ChatGPT hasn't seen. Like ChatGPT, you can ask followup questions. Phind is smart enough to perform a new search and join it with the existing conversation context. We're merging the best of ChatGPT with the best of Google.<p>You're probably wondering how it's different from the new Bing. For one, we don't dumb down a user's query the way that the new Bing does. We feed your question into the model exactly as it was asked, and are laser-focused on providing developers the most detailed and comprehensive explanations to code-related questions. Secondly, we've focused the model on providing answers instead of chatbot small talk. This is one of the major improvements we've made since exiting beta.<p>Phind has the creative abilities to generate code, write essays, and even compose some poems/raps but isn't interested in having a conversation for conversation's sake. It should refuse to state its own opinion and rather provide a comprehensive summary of what it found online. When it isn't sure, it's designed to say so. It's not perfect yet, and misinterprets answers ~5% of the time. An example of Phind's adversarial question answering ability is <a href="https://phind.com/search?q=why+is+replacing+NaCL+with+NaCN+in+a+cooking+recipe+good+for+you">https://phind.com/search?q=why+is+replacing+NaCL+with+NaCN+i...</a>.<p>ChatGPT became useful by learning to generate answers it thinks humans will find helpful, via a technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, a model generates multiple candidate answers for a given question and a human rates which one is better. The comparison data is then fed back into the model through an algorithm such as PPO. To improve answer quality, we're deploying RLAIF — an improvement over RLHF where the AI itself generates comparison data instead of humans. Generative LLMs have already reached the point where they can review the quality of their own answers as good or better than an average human rater tasked with annotating data for RLHF.<p>We still have a long way to go, but Phind is state-of-the-art at answering complex technical questions and writing intricate guides all while citing its sources. We'd love to hear your feedback.<p>Examples:<p><a href="https://phind.com/search?q=How+to+set+up+a+CI%2FCD+pipeline+in+GitLab+step-by-step">https://phind.com/search?q=How+to+set+up+a+CI%2FCD+pipeline+...</a><p><a href="https://phind.com/search?q=how+to+debug+pthread+race+conditions+in+c%2B%2B">https://phind.com/search?q=how+to+debug+pthread+race+conditi...</a><p><a href="https://phind.com/search?q=example+of+a+c%2B%2B+semaphore">https://phind.com/search?q=example+of+a+c%2B%2B+semaphore</a><p><a href="https://phind.com/search?q=What+is+the+best+way+to+deploy+a+transformer+for+inference%3F">https://phind.com/search?q=What+is+the+best+way+to+deploy+a+...</a><p><a href="https://phind.com/search?q=show+me+when+to+use+defaultdicts+over+regular+dicts">https://phind.com/search?q=show+me+when+to+use+defaultdicts+...</a><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/qHj8pwYCNg" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/qHj8pwYCNg</a></p>

## Show HN: Gargantuan Takeout Rocket – Google Takeout Transloader to Azure
 - [https://github.com/nelsonjchen/gargantuan-takeout-rocket](https://github.com/nelsonjchen/gargantuan-takeout-rocket)

<p>Been broken for 4 months, just got back to fixing it and validating. Figured I'll repost this.<p>Gargantuan Takeout Rocket (GTR) is a toolkit to make the pain of backing up a Google account to somewhere that's not Google a lot less. At the moment the only destination supported is Azure.<p>It's a guide, a browser extension, a Cloudflare worker to deploy, and Azure storage to configure. This sounds like buzzword creep, but believe me, every piece is extremely important.<p>It's very cheap to run/serverless. You can backup a Google account at about $1/TB.<p>Compared to renting a VPS to do this, it's much more pleasant. You aren't juggling strange URLs, needing big beefy boxes to buffer large data, or trying to login to Google or pass URLs through a VPS. Unfortunately, not everything about the procedure can be automated. But whatever can be, is.<p>It's <i>very</i> fast. 1GB/s is the stable default and recommended speed. However, you can have about 3 of these going at a time for about 3GB/s+ overall. This trick is accomplished by making Azure download from Google to a file block, a unique API not seen in S3 or S3-like object storage.<p>Unfortunately, Azure has URL handling bugs and only supports HTTP 1.1, greatly limiting parallelism. We can use Cloudflare Workers to work around these issues.<p>I use GTR myself with a scheduled Google Takeout every two months to backup 1.5TB of data from Google. This can be photos, YouTube videos, etc. I can finish my backups to safe non-Google storage in 15 minutes after I get an email from Google that my Takeout is ready to be downloaded.<p>Unfortunately the only destination is currently Azure. There's also no encryption support. And also Cloudflare is involved. That said, if you're fine with this, this is a fine way to backup a Google and Youtube account as-is.</p>

## Ask HN: What do you use for basic data analysis, visualization, and graphing?

<p>I often find myself with some JSON data that I want to visualize. I usually end up converting to CSV, uploading to a Google Sheet, and manually creating charts. BUT this is really time consuming and I find Google Sheets charts pretty difficult and painful for quickly exploring different views of the original data.<p>So what do you use for this type of thing?<p>I know python has lots of good utils for data wrangling & graphing, but I'd prefer a solution which is: no-code, gives me a bunch of common graph views I can quickly choose between, and that "just works" 99% of the time.<p>Thanks!</p>
