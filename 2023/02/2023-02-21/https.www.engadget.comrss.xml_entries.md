<p>Microsoft was quick to limit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">Bing's AI chats</a> to prevent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-limits-bing-conversations-to-prevent-disturbing-chatbot-responses-154142211.html">disturbing answers</a>, but it's changing course just days later. The company now says it will <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/february-2023/The-new-Bing-and-Edge-Increasing-Limits-on-Chat-Sessions">restore</a> longer chats, and is starting by expanding the chats to six turns per session (up from five) and 60 chats per day (up from 50). The daily cap will climb to 100 chats soon, Microsoft says, and regular searches will no longer count against that total. With that said, don't expect to cause much havoc when long conversations return — Microsoft wants to bring them back &quot;responsibly.&quot;</p><p>The tech giant is also addressing concerns that Bing's AI may be too wordy with responses. An upcoming test will let you choose a tone that's &quot;precise&quot; (that is, shorter and more to-the-point answers), &quot;creative&quot; (longer) or &quot;balanced.&quot; If you're just interested in facts, you won't have to wade through as much text to get them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There may have been signs of trouble considerably earlier. As <em>Windows Central</em><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-rolled-out-its-deranged-bing-chat-ai-in-india-4-months-ago-and-no-one-noticed">notes</a>, researcher Dr. Gary Marcus and Nomic VP Ben Schmidt discovered that public tests of the Bing chatbot (codenamed &quot;Sidney&quot;) in India four months ago <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/this-ai-chatbot-sidney-is-misbehaving/e3d6a29f-06c9-441c-bc7d-51a68e856761?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-DbePEXEkI2OprnLrhwLi1w&amp;epi=kXQk6.ivFEQ-DbePEXEkI2OprnLrhwLi1w&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__tnvetj13ygkfbhh0p13fnnet9v2xcf6e63qy3czo00)(7593)(1243925)(kXQk6.ivFEQ-DbePEXEkI2OprnLrhwLi1w)()&amp;irclickid=_tnvetj13ygkfbhh0p13fnnet9v2xcf6e63qy3czo00">produced</a> similarly odd results in long sessions. We've asked Microsoft for comment, but it says in its most recent blog post that the current preview is meant to catch &quot;atypical use cases&quot; that don't manifest with internal tests.</p><p>Microsoft previously said it didn't completely anticipate people using Bing AI's longer chats as entertainment. The looser limits are an attempt to strike a balance between &quot;feedback&quot; in favor of those chats, as the company says, with safeguards that prevent the bot from going in strange directions.</p>

## The Kindle Store has a prolific new author: ChatGPT

<p>ChatGPT is listed as the author or co-author of at least 200 books on Amazon’s Kindle Store, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-launches-boom-ai-written-e-books-amazon-2023-02-21/">according</a> to <em>Reuters</em>. However, the actual number of bot-written books is likely much higher than that since Amazon’s policies don’t explicitly require authors to disclose their use of AI. It’s the latest example of AI-generated writing flooding the market and playing a part in ethically dubious content creation since the November release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">OpenAI’s free tool</a>.</p><p>“I could see people making a whole career out of this,” said Brett Schickler, a Rochester, NY salesman who published a children’s book on the Kindle Store. “The idea of writing a book finally seemed possible.” Schickler’s self-published story, <em>The Wise Little Squirrel: A Tale of Saving and Investing</em>, is a 30-page children’s story — written and illustrated by AI — selling for $2.99 for a digital copy and $9.99 for a printed version. Although Schickler says the book has earned him less than $100 since its January release, he only spent a few hours creating it with ChatGPT prompts like “write a story about a dad teaching his son about financial literacy.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other examples of AI-created content on the Kindle Store include children’s story <em>The Power of Homework</em>, a poetry collection called <em>Echoes of the Universe</em> and a sci-fi epic about an interstellar brothel, <em>Galactic Pimp: Vol. 1</em>.</p><p>“This is something we really need to be worried about, these books will flood the market and a lot of authors are going to be out of work,” said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild. “There needs to be transparency from the authors and the platforms about how these books are created or you’re going to end up with a lot of low-quality books.”</p><figure><img alt="Three magazine covers of " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/6b127820-b225-11ed-adbf-32155c047ba9" style="height: 738; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Clarkesworld</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, science-fiction publication <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/"><em>Clarkesworld Magazine</em></a> has temporarily halted short-story submissions after receiving a flood of articles suspected of using AI without disclosure, as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sci-fi-mag-pauses-submissions-amid-flood-of-ai-generated-short-stories">reported</a> by <em>PCMag</em>. Although Editor Neil Clarke didn’t specify how he identified them, he recognized the (allegedly) bot-assisted stories due to “some very obvious patterns.” “What I can say is that the number of spam submissions resulting in bans has hit 38 percent this month,” he said. “While rejecting and banning these submissions has been simple, it’s growing at a rate that will necessitate changes. To make matters worse, the technology is only going to get better, so detection will become more challenging.”</p><p><em>Clarkesworld </em>currently prohibits stories “written, co-written or assisted by AI,” and the publication has banned over 500 users this month for submitting suspected AI-assisted content. <em>Clarkesworld</em> pays 12 cents per word, making it a prime target. “From what I can tell, it’s not about credibility. It’s about the possibility of making a quick buck. That’s all they care about,” Clarke <a href="https://twitter.com/clarkesworld/status/1627773927811436551">tweeted</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a keynote address announcing ChatGPT integration for Bing at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, on February 7, 2023. - Microsoft's long-struggling Bing search engine will integrate the powerful capabilities of language-based artificial intelligence, CEO Satya Nadella said, declaring what he called a new era for online search.

Additionally, they’re trained on human-created content — almost always without the original author’s knowledge or permission — and sometimes use identical syntax to the source material.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting last year, tech publication <em>CNET</em> used an in-house AI model to write at least 73 economic explainers. Unfortunately, apart from the initially cagey approach that only revealed it was written by AI if you clicked on the byline, it also included numerous factual errors and nearly identical phrasing from other websites’ articles. As a result, <em>CNET</em> was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html">make extensive corrections</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-pauses-ai-written-stories-211548131.html">pause</a> its use of the tool — however, one of its sister sites has already at least experimented with <a href="https://futurism.com/cnet-bankrate-restarts-ai-articles">using it again</a>.</p>

## Microsoft is putting Xbox games on GeForce Now in an attempt to win over regulators

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has struck a 10-year deal with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nvidia/">NVIDIA</a> to bring Xbox games to the GeForce Now streaming service. The company's president, Brad Smith, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-microsoft-press-briefing-on-activision-blizzard-deal-future">made the announcement</a> at a press conference in Brussels, where he, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan, Activision Blizzard head Bobby Kotick and other prominent figures attended <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-opens-phase-two-investigation-microsoft-activision-blizzard-175758027.html">a European Commission hearing</a> over Microsoft's proposed takeover of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Smith said that, if the deal goes through, Activision Blizzard games like the Call of Duty series will be available on GeForce Now as well. The publisher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-activision-blizzard-geforce-now.html">removed its titles</a> from the cloud gaming service in 2020. Smith's GeForce Now announcement came hours after he confirmed that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html">Microsoft will bring Xbox games to Nintendo platforms</a> like the Switch under a binding 10-year deal — and Activision Blizzard titles if the acquisition closes. NVIDIA is now supporting the Activision Blizzard deal, Smith said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Xbox remains committed to giving people more choice and finding ways to expand how people play,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/microsoft-and-nvidia-announce-expansive-new-gaming-deal">said in a statement</a>. “This partnership will help grow NVIDIA’s catalog of titles to include games like Call of Duty, while giving developers more ways to offer streaming games. We are excited to offer gamers more ways to play the games they love.”</p><p>Users will need to buy copies of games from the Xbox PC, Steam or Epic Games stores to play them on GeForce Now. It's not clear when Xbox games will be available to stream through the service, which has more than more than 25 million users. However, NVIDIA said it and Microsoft &quot;will begin work immediately to integrate Xbox PC games into GeForce Now.&quot;</p><p>The agreement will afford players another way to stream Microsoft's games from the cloud almost anywhere that they have a sturdy enough internet connection. Currently, Xbox Cloud Gaming (which requires a Game Pass Ultimate subscription) is the main way to do that. The NVIDIA deal is an attempt by Microsoft to placate regulators' concerns over the Activision takeover by showing that Xbox Cloud Gaming won't be the only exclusive way to stream its games.</p><p>Earlier this month, the UK's competition regulator said that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html">proposed $68.7 billion Activision acquisition</a> could result in a &quot;substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles&quot; and &quot;harm UK gamers.&quot; The Competition and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uks-competition-watchdog-says-microsofts-activision-merge-could-harm-uk-gamers-132410352.html">found that</a> Microsoft already had a 60-70 percent share of the cloud gaming market and that, should the deal go through, it would &quot;reinforce this strong position.&quot; In December, the US Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">sued to block the merger</a>.</p>

## YouTube Music's redesigned radio experience allows you to create totally custom stations

<p>Almost every music streaming service on the market offers a radio feature, allowing you to create an automatically generated playlist around a song or artist you love. For the most part, however, those features don’t offer a lot of flexibility. You pick a single song or artist and the platform does the rest – as is the case with Spotify and Apple Music.</p><p>Google has begun rolling out a redesigned radio feature on YouTube Music the company claims provides users with a lot more control over their listening experience. Among the new features the refreshed experience includes is the ability to pick up to 30 artists when creating your own radio station. You can also decide how frequently those artists repeat and apply filters that change the mood of the resulting playlist. For instance, a few of the selections include “chill,” “downbeat” and “pump-up.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s also possible to adjust the parameters you set after creating a station by tapping the “Tune” option that appears at the bottom of the interface once you’re listening to your new playlist. Naturally, you can save the station to revisit it later. Once the new experience is available on your device, you will see a prompt in the main interface that says “Create a radio.” As with many of Google’s rollouts, it may take some time before you see the feature on your client.</p><p>On its own, it’s fair to say the feature won’t be enough to convince some to ditch Spotify and Apple Music for YouTube Music, but if you’re among the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-music-50-million-subscribers-154109155.html"><ins>50 million subscribers</ins></a> Google says has access to the service, it may prompt you to use it more frequently or convert the free trial you got with your phone into a paid subscription.</p>

## Sony’s new midrange headphones borrow the premium WH-1000XM5's V1 chip

<p>Sony is launching a pair of midrange headphones that borrow some tech from the company’s $400 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">WH-1000XM5</a>. The new WH-CH720N is an over-ear pair using the same V1 chip from Sony’s flagship model, which should help provide high-quality sound and active noise cancelation (ANC) for a much lower price.</p><p>The company says the WH-CH720N’s battery will last up to 35 hours with ANC enabled. The headphones also include Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) support, Sony’s audio upscaling tech that may improve the sound of compressed music files on services like Spotify. It also has multipoint connectivity and two microphones in each ear cup, which assists it in offering 20 levels of noise-canceling / ambient sound. Of course, you can tweak its settings with the companion Sony Headphones Connect app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sony has a good track record with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-sony-wh-ch710n-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability.html">mid-range headphones</a>. Like with this model, the company typically carries over a few features from its premium cans while skimping in enough places to keep the price down. (In this case, it lacks the second ANC processor from the WH-1000XM5.) So although they’ll have lesser noise canceling than their more expensive siblings, the V1 chip should still make for terrific ANC for their $150 price. The WH-CH720N will be available in black, blue and white when it begins shipping this spring.</p><figure><img alt="Marketing photo of the Sony WH-CH520 headphones (black) against a plain white background" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/f970b150-b20b-11ed-ab83-c2169d25a53e" style="height: 607; width: 1089;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Sony also announced a new entry-level pair of on-ear headphones, the WH-CH520, which will skip ANC but offer an impressive 50 hours of battery life. They will also include DSEE and multipoint connection. The WH-CH520 will also launch this spring in black, blue and white. They will cost a mere $60.</p><p></p>

## 'M3GAN' and 'Get Out' producer Blumhouse is moving into horror games

<p>Horror movie powerhouse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/blumhouse/"><ins>Blumhouse</ins></a> is getting into video games. The company behind hits like <em>M3GAN</em>, <em>Get Out, The Purge </em>and <em>Insidious </em>is opening a production and publishing division that will work on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23608319/blumhouse-games-get-out-halloween-the-purge-insidious"><ins>original horror games</ins></a> for PC, consoles and mobile.</p><p>“We’re in the scary story business. We do films, we do TV and there is this massive, growing segment in media and entertainment called gaming,” Blumhouse president Abhijay Prakash told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-21/horror-movie-maestro-jason-blum-enters-the-video-game-business?leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. “The space is hundreds of billions of dollars; we’re in a great position to try and access it.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with the film side of the production company, Blumhouse Games will keep the budgets modest. It plans to release games that cost under $10 million to make. Rather than adapting its own movies (something Blumhouse has tried in the past) into games, the company will look for projects that are in development and offer studios financial support, creative insight and the Blumhouse name to slap on their titles.</p><p>Veteran game producer Zach Wood — who was recently involved in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-10-bethesda-prey-dlc-mooncrash-typhon-hunter.html"><em><ins>Prey: Mooncrash</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/redfall/"><em><ins>Redfall</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>— will run the creative side of Blumhouse Games. Don Sechler, a former PlayStation executive who <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/horror-filmmaker-blumhouse-expands-into-games/"><ins>worked closely</ins></a> with indie studios, will oversee the operational and financial aspects.</p><p>It's hardly the first time that a movie studio has opened a gaming division. Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-12-disney-infinity-avalanche-closure-surprise.html"><ins>used to have one</ins></a>, as did Lucasfilm (which now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-delayed-to-april-28th-220058242.html"><ins>licenses</ins></a> its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/return-to-monkey-island-gameplay-trailer-185357435.html"><ins>properties</ins></a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bethesda-machinegames-indiana-jones-game-164516126.html"><ins>external developers</ins></a>). Annapurna Interactive has perhaps set the template for Blumhouse Games to follow, though. The games division of Annapurna Pictures has an excellent track record as an indie publisher, having released the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-ios-release-date-192428137.html"><em><ins>What Remains of Edith Finch</ins></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-14-florence-game-ios-love-ken-wong-interview-mobile.html"><em><ins>Florence</ins></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-20-donut-county-los-angeles-love-doughnuts-kachina-indie.html"><em><ins>Donut County</ins></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/outer-wilds-ps5-xbox-series-native-release-date-2022-191626093.html"><em><ins>Outer Wilds</ins></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/if-found-switch-interview-dreamfeel-162757627.html"><em><ins>If Found...</ins></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/neon-white-switch-steam-ben-esposito-interview-183854914.html"><em><ins>Neon White</ins></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/stray-review-ps5-cyberpunk-adventure-cute-cat-173018571.html"><em><ins>Stray</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-best-games-2019.html"><em><ins>Sayonara Wild Hearts</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>over the last six years.</p>

The 85-inch version has yet to be priced. If you value 8K but don't need the full feature set, the QN800C begins at $3,500 for a 65-inch screen and tops out at $6,000 for an 85-inch panel. The 75-inch edition also hasn't received pricing.</p><p>You're more likely looking at a 4K TV, and you'll be glad to hear those are considerably more affordable. At the high end, the QN95C ranges from $3,300 for a 65-inch display to $5,800 for an 85-inch beast. The lowest-priced sets are in the mid-tier QN90C series, however — that starts at $1,200 for a compact 43-inch design, with five other sizes that culminate in a $4,800 85-inch set. If you're looking for (relative) value for money, the QN85C is available for $1,500 in 55-inch form and climbs to $3,800 for the QN85C. Samsung hasn't yet shared details of the 4K-capable QN935C, which offers thinner bezels and top-firing speakers that enable Dolby Atmos without external speakers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All 2023 Neo QLED TVs fit better into your smart home.

<p>There is no such thing as the "best game console,"  but figuring out which one is right for you is more in reach. There are seven systems that you could reasonably call “current gen,” and others, such as Valve’s Steam Deck, further muddying the waters. Engadget staffers play games on pretty much every console you can think of, and a few that you might not have thought about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-atari-lynx-30-year-anniversary.html">for a very long time</a>.</p><p>For some, nothing but the highest-specced system will do; others just need the cheapest way to play the latest games; maybe you value portability over everything; or maybe you haven’t played in years and are looking for a system for your family to enjoy together. There are endless use-cases for a games console, and that’s why we’ve put together this article.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reviewed and evaluated every console in here, some more than once, and tried to categorize the “best gaming console” for specific needs. You’ll find 10 picks in here, with all of the big players represented, and two best "high-end consoles," each for different reasons. We hope by the end of this guide, you’ll be much closer to deciding on the perfect console for you.</p><h2>Best high-end console: PS5</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL2NvbnNvbGVzLWhhcmR3YXJlL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUvY29uc29sZXMvcHJvZHVjdHMvc29ueS1wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LWNvbnNvbGUvMTExMDgxNDAuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTYwNWQ3NDUtZjU0Mi00NGQwLWJmZjctM2RhOWJjMGU4NzQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeUGezdyXhQwWAY0O_Wad3FVwWP87zACzb6Zur-48eLS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fsony-playstation-5-console%2F11108140.html">PlayStation 5</a> delivers the most stunning graphics and seamless performance of any current-gen gaming console. Sony stuck with the traditional hardware-upgrade cycle for the PS5, significantly improving processing power and visual fidelity over the previous generation, and introducing a new gamepad packed with immersion mechanics. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EdWFsU2Vuc2UtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ29udHJvbGxlci1QbGF5U3RhdGlvbi01L2RwL0IwOEZDNkM3NVk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2MDVkNzQ1LWY1NDItNDRkMC1iZmY3LTNkYTliYzBlODc0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ4JhfboL0XrldAS9pA6OlemuhP0Wc5ayVyagUEci7x2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC6C75Y">DualSense</a>, Sony’s latest controller, is a standout feature: It offers intense and precise haptic feedback along the grips, and has adaptive triggers, meaning tension in the R2 and L2 buttons changes as players equip various weapons and tools. This is something that the Xbox Series consoles simply don’t have.</p><p>Meanwhile, the PS5 offers a library of console exclusives including <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>, <em>Returnal</em>, the <em>Demon’s Souls </em>remake, Insomniac’s Spider-Man series, every <em>The Last of Us</em> game and re-release, and a litany of Final Fantasy titles. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0f845666-5cc0-42c7-863d-d873ae1b6087&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=PlayStation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZjg0NTY2Ni01Y2MwLTQyYzctODYzZC1kODczYWUxYjYwODciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGxheXN0YXRpb24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3BzLXBsdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNjA1ZDc0NS1mNTQyLTQ0ZDAtYmZmNy0zZGE5YmMwZTg3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdjkii3KgcxDuw2nUj5Qg9PVudYh5KkEe8dEKkH5BCce&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fps-plus%2F">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, the highest tier of Sony’s monthly subscription service, adds cloud streaming, freebies and a catalog of games to download at any time. Premium costs $18 a month or $120 annually, and there are cheaper tiers with fewer perks in the Plus ecosystem.</p><p>The PS5 may look a little <em>funny</em> sitting next to your TV, but truly, it’s what’s inside that counts.

While we'd still like to see more exclusives on Xbox, there are major titles on the horizon like <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Redfall</em> and the revamped <em>Forza Motor Sport</em>. PC gamers may also appreciate cross-purchases between Windows and Xbox titles, as well as the ability to stream games from the cloud using Game Pass. Sure, Sony still has a stranglehold on big-budget narrative games, but the sheer wealth of offerings on Microsoft's platforms — including small indies, classic franchises and a ton of great games via EA Play (included with Game Pass for PCs and Ultimate) — is staggering.</p><p>It used to be that you'd have to stick with the same console all of your friends are using, but these days the availability of cross-play multiplayer on most titles makes that consideration moot. If you want to play <em>Call of Duty </em>with your friends, it doesn't really matter if you get an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5. So the best advice now? Base your choice on the exclusives you'd like to play, as well as the potential subscription benefits. If you want to see where Master Chief goes next, or are just tired of paying full price for first-party games and some indies, you'll probably be happiest with a Series X and Game Pass. <em>– Devindra Hardawar, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2>Best budget console: Xbox Series S + Game Pass</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9YYm94LVMvZHAvQjA4RzlKNDRaTj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTYwNWQ3NDUtZjU0Mi00NGQwLWJmZjctM2RhOWJjMGU4NzQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5tvXXcxcwzqSc_8BjIFCPFrrzKNgDPICXIq19zzS0L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXbox-S%2Fdp%2FB08G9J44ZN">Xbox Series S</a> packs enough power to play the latest and greatest games, but it truly shines as a semi-portable Game Pass machine. The Series S is a disc-less, compact console that typically costs $300, though it’s frequently on sale for $250 to $270. This little rectangular baby can play games at resolutions higher than 1080p, though it won’t hit 4K, and it’s less powerful overall than the Series X. The Series S also has less storage space than its big sibling, and this is its main drawback.</p><p>That’s where <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMveGJveC1nYW1lLXBhc3MiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2MDVkNzQ1LWY1NDItNDRkMC1iZmY3LTNkYTliYzBlODc0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVvIL8LgGNKPwAb1IjZmE-d_9mtPgypHn-bbCJaYFzzv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> comes in.

Microsoft has the most reliable cloud network in the business and it’s committed to releasing all of its big new Xbox Game Studios titles on Game Pass day-one. Sony has yet to make such a promise with in-house launches on PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Even without Game Pass, the Series S is the cheapest way to participate in the Xbox console ecosystem and it’ll play every game the Series X can.

Chalk it up to Nintendo's legacy: It's a company that's always prioritized the simple beauty of playing with your friends and family on the couch. Be it four players racing against each other locally in <em>Mario Kart</em>, or diving into an assortment of mini-games in <em>Mario Party</em>, you can have a blast using a single Switch hooked up to a TV. It's a cinch to connect other controllers to let your friends join — something they'll likely have on-hand if they have their own Switch. And since it's a portable console, you can always play against others over local networks, giving you the beauty of being together with friends while also having your own private screen. Just try doing that with a PS5. <em>– D.H.</em></p><h2>Best couch portable: Valve Steam Deck</h2><p></p><p>The idea of a portable console that’s primarily used at home might feel counterintuitive, but this is actually how a lot of people prefer to play games, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a> helped prove it. The Steam Deck came out in February 2022 and quickly emerged as a popular PC portable for people who wanted to spend time away from their desks, but not their Steam libraries. It’s a chunky handheld gaming console with dual analog sticks and trackpads; standard face buttons, bumpers and triggers; four rear clickers, and a 7-inch LCD touchscreen. It’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html">big and strangely beautiful</a>, and plays most PC games just fine.</p><p>The Steam Deck starts at $400 and tops out at $650, making it relatively affordable in the world of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/handheld-gaming-pc-retro-indie-handhelds-steam-deck-playdate-150038001.html">PC portables</a>. The Steam Deck is a little too big and battery-sucking to be a must-have carry-on while traveling, but it’s perfect for cuddling on the couch – with a supportive pillow and power outlet nearby. <em>– J.C.</em></p><h2>Best for first time gamers: Nintendo Switch Lite</h2><p></p><p>Nintendo has a history of making tank-like portable consoles, and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtTGl0ZS1CbHVlL2RwL0IwOTJWVDFKR0Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2MDVkNzQ1LWY1NDItNDRkMC1iZmY3LTNkYTliYzBlODc0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeJyPYLs3KmIeIWKy3q0sgGuVHaOVdgPGgNqqeIyd729&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Blue%2Fdp%2FB092VT1JGD">Switch Lite</a> is no exception. It's just as fast as its larger sibling, but since it has integrated controls, you won't have to worry about any Joy-cons flying away if it's dropped. The Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen and smaller frame always makes it easier for tiny hands to hold, something I've found particularly useful as my four-year-old daughter is finally getting into games. There's a wide variety of child-friendly content available on the Switch, but we'd recommend diving into the classic of library Nintendo titles via the console's online service. Kids will ultimately figure out <em>Minecraft </em>on their own, but it's up to the older generation to instill the value of proper platforming with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. <em>– D.H.</em></p><h2>Best for commuting: Nintendo Switch Lite</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtTGl0ZS1CbHVlL2RwL0IwOTJWVDFKR0Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2MDVkNzQ1LWY1NDItNDRkMC1iZmY3LTNkYTliYzBlODc0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeJyPYLs3KmIeIWKy3q0sgGuVHaOVdgPGgNqqeIyd729&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Blue%2Fdp%2FB092VT1JGD">Switch Lite</a> is by far the cutest handheld gaming console on the market today and this is just one reason it’s ideal for use in public. The Switch Lite is a tiny, lightweight handheld with a 5.5 inch LCD touchscreen and basic gamepad buttons, and it’s sold in a variety of colorways and special editions.

The Switch should also survive for several hours of gameplay, and it's easy to charge for longer journeys. While the Steam Deck may be tempting, it's also so large it'll likely fill up much of your backpack. The Switch can still fit alongside your computer and other gear, and its game library is so vast, you'll never be left wanting for things to play. <em>– D.H.</em></p><h2>Best handheld gaming console for nostalgia: Retroid Pocket 3</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZXRyb2lkLVBvY2tldC1IYW5kaGVsZC1NdWx0aXBsZS1FbXVsYXRvcnMvZHAvQjBCOFM5R0g4VD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTYwNWQ3NDUtZjU0Mi00NGQwLWJmZjctM2RhOWJjMGU4NzQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVsnRqtesX7qDfs4kLbW-WqJzsbmsnuUUYD3njwurA23&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRetroid-Pocket-Handheld-Multiple-Emulators%2Fdp%2FB0B8S9GH8T">Retroid Pocket 3</a> is an accessible, streamlined <a href="https://www.engadget.com/retroid-pocket-3-irl-153508438.html">emulation machine</a> that’s capable of handling games from the sixth generation down – that’s anything up to the GameCube and PlayStation 2.

## TikTok opens data to US researchers in its bid to be more transparent

## Bungie wins $4.3 million in case against 'Destiny 2' cheat provider AimJunkies

<p>Bungie has been embroiled in a legal battle with cheat provider AimJunkies since 2021, with both sides slapping the other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aimjunkies-destiny-2-bungie-countersuit-hacking-210847166.html">with lawsuits</a>. Now, the game developer has walked away with $4.3 million in damages and fees after a victory in an arbitration proceeding, according to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/bungie-wins-4-3-million-award-against-cheat-seller-in-arbitration-230220/"><em>TorrentFreak</em></a>. Bungie first sued AirmJunkies in 2021, accusing it of copyright and trademark infringement for hosting &quot;Destiny 2 Hacks&quot; on its website.&nbsp;</p><p>US District Court Judge Thomas Zilly ruled mostly in favor of AimJunkies last year, deciding that Bungie had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove its claim. However, he gave Bungie the chance to present more evidence. That copyright infringement lawsuit is still headed to trial, but Zilly apparently referred the non-copyright-related aspects of the case to arbitration.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>TorrentFreak</em> says arbitration Judge Ronald Cox has decided that AimJunkies and &quot;Destiny 2 Hacks&quot; developer James May violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Cox based his decision on May's previous testimonies that he connected reverse engineering tools to the game in order to create cheats for it. May also said that Bungie caught and banned him several times for doing so, but that he looked for methods to circumvent the bans.&nbsp;</p><p>Since AimJunkies sold and profited from May's creation, the judge found it liable. Cox also found AimJunkies and its parent company Phoenix Digital Group liable for selling not just game cheats, but also the loader used to inject cheats into games. Based on evidence presented, AimJunkies sold over 1,000 copies of the cheats and over 1,000 copies of the cheat loader. In addition to the evidence and May's statements, one other reason why Cox sided with Bungie was because AimJunkies owner David Shaefer underreported the website's cheat sales. &quot;Given respondents' egregious and willful conduct, including their ongoing concealment of sales, Bungie is entitled to the full statutory damages available,&quot; he wrote in his decision.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Bungie was awarded $3.65 million for all DMCA-related violations and an additional $700,000 for fees and other costs. According to <em>TorrentFreak</em>, Bungie will use this victory as part of its argument in AimJunkies' countersuit in which it accused the developer of violating its ToS for reverse-engineering its cheat software. AimJunkies also previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aimjunkies-destiny-2-bungie-countersuit-hacking-210847166.html">claimed that Bungie illegally hacked</a> May's computer, but the court <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/aimjunkies-countersuit-against-bungie-dismissed">dismissed</a> that complaint last year.&nbsp;</p>

## Microsoft makes its 10-year Call of Duty pact with Nintendo official

<p>Late last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-call-of-duty-nintendo-consoles-053027619.html">announced</a> that it was &quot;committed&quot; to bringing <em>Call of Duty (CoD)</em> to Nintendo for 10 years if its Activision Blizzard acquisition was approved. Now, president Brad Smith has <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1627926790172811264">tweeted</a> that the &quot;binding&quot; 10-year contract has been signed, and confirmed that Nintendo would get the same access to <em>CoD</em> as Xbox.</p><p>&quot;Microsoft and Nintendo have now negotiated and signed a binding 10-year legal agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Nintendo players — the same days as Xbox, with full feature and content parity,&quot; Microsoft wrote in a statement. &quot;We are committed to providing long term equal access to <em>Call of Duty</em> to other gaming platforms.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft previously said that it offered Sony a similar deal for PlayStation consoles, and committed to offer the game on Steam at the same time as Xbox — provided the merger goes through, of course.</p><p>The deals are all part of Microsoft's efforts to convince regulators allow its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard to proceed. The deal is strongly in limbo right now, as the US Federal Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html?uuid=tgHPUlN7dMD649Bd3830">sued to block the takeover</a>, and the UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uks-competition-watchdog-says-microsofts-activision-merge-could-harm-uk-gamers-132410352.html">may require</a> Activision to divest parts of its business for the merger to proceed.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the European Union is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-faces-eu-antitrust-warning-over-activision-deal-sources-2023-01-16/">reportedly</a> set to join the UK in declaring that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition. To that end, Microsoft reportedly requested a hearing with EU regulators to defend the deal — and that meeting is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/microsoft-defend-activision-deal-eu-hearing-feb-21-2023-02-14/">set for today</a>, according to <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The acquisition ran afoul of regulators from the start over concerns that it would cut off Sony's PS5 and other consoles from key games, particularly<em> CoD</em>. Sony vehemently opposes the deal, having called it a &quot;game-changer that poses a threat to our industry.&quot; Microsoft has said that Sony's comments were &quot;self-serving&quot; and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-promises-support-call-of-duty-playstation-forever-060216077.html?uuid=ds6EqSRQ1XpKT8j15830">promised</a> to support <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation &quot;forever.&quot;</p>

## Ubisoft's Mousetrap system lengthens the lag to punish 'Rainbow Six Siege' cheaters

<p>Cheaters are why we can't have nice things. All the time, money and effort that could be going towards expanded DLCs and improved gameplay mechanics is instead spent staving off the legions of mediocre players who mistake aimbots for actual gaming prowess. The entire exercise is exhausting and Ubisoft isn't going to take it anymore, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2SY2EgP1gLzVdXkz6uZSYu/rainbow-six-siege-operation-commanding-force-operator-and-gadget-guide">the company announced Monday</a>. Come the game's next update release, any 'Rainbow Six Siege' player found cheating through the use of input spoofing — that is, using a third-party device to run a keyboard and mouse on their console instead of a controller — will see their lag times drastically extended. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.</p><div id="1d0231b3e4114871ba11acc6419111d5"></div><p>These devices — which include the<a href="https://store.xim.tech/XIM-APEX_p_18.html"> XIM APEX</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cronus-Controller-Emulator-Playstation-Nintendo-PC/dp/B088QTFM46/ref=asc_df_B088QTFM46/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=459453549984&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=5372952495420623109&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1014353&amp;hvtargid=pla-911639987511&amp;psc=1">Cronus Zen</a>, or the <a href="http://www.reasnow.com/home/reasnow-s1.html">ReaSnow S1</a> — allow players to leverage the heightened sensitivity and increased reactions that a keyboard and mouse offer over console controllers. They also incorporate aim assist, autoreload, and autoscope features which have long (and rightfully!) been scorned by the larger gaming community and banned from anything even loosely resembling official competition. But that hasn't stopped folks from increasingly relying on such devices to artificially boost their scores in online shooters from 'Destiny 2' to 'Overwatch.'</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That will no longer be the case with 'Rainbow Six Siege.' The company revealed its Mousetrap system on Monday, a detection suite built specifically to sniff out accounts running these illicit hardware devices. Mousetrap is already live, has been for a few seasons now as the company honed the system's detection capabilities and built out a database of known cheats. Also, yes, they're very much onto you and your pedestrian FPS machinations.&nbsp;</p><p>“We know exactly which players are spoofing and when they were spoofing,” Jan Stahlhacke, gameplay programming team lead for 'Rainbow Six Siege,' announced in the Y8S1 reveal above. “We also know that at the highest ranks spoofers become much more common.”</p><p>Should the system spot one, that account will see a notable increase in its response times, more than enough to cancel out any ill-gained advantages. The user will have to unplug the device, then play a few more rounds with the &quot;al-ping-tross&quot; chained to their neck before the lag penalty will (eventually) dissipate. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-cheaters-weapons-ricochet-200044185.html">Activision took similar — and equally inventive — measures in 2022</a> against <em>Call of Duty</em> cheats with its Disarm measure.&nbsp;</p><p>The company does acknowledge that such devices are used legitimately by gamers with disabilities and Ubisoft urges those players to reach out with feedback about how these changes might impact them. Huh, seems like the sort of thing you'd want to get squared away before enacting a sweeping policy such as this but, then again, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-sexual-misocnduct-allegations-092903220.html">Ubisoft isn't exactly famous for its culture of inclusivity</a>.</p>

<p>Ram pulled the wraps off its 1500 REV electric truck concept <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-first-look-ram-1500-revolution-bev-concept-ces-2023-223035895.html">at CES</a>, following that up with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-reveals-production-ready-ram-1500-ev-truck-202957196.html">a proper unveiling</a> earlier this month. Eager early adopters could reserve a 2024 model with a $100 deposit for the so-called Ram REV Insider+ membership. However, late last week, Stellantis shut down pre-orders as <a href="https://ramrev.com/reserve/maximum-capacity">&quot;membership max capacity&quot;</a> had been reached. Initial news of the closure was posted on <a href="https://www.ram1500revolutionforum.com/forum/threads/reservations-now-closed-for-ram-1500-rev-ram-rev-insider-membership-has-reached-max-capacity.6515/">a Ram 1500 REV forum</a> early Friday and <a href="https://jalopnik.com/ram-1500-rev-100-reservations-sell-out-in-just-one-wee-1850127870"><em>Jalopnik confirmed</em></a> with the automaker that reservations were indeed sold out. No additional information on the number of memberships purchased or when they might re-open was made available to the outlet.</p><p>During the official debut on Super Bowl Sunday, Ram revealed an electric truck that looks more like its gas-powered siblings than the futuristic design we saw at CES. That's not uncommon as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-price-increase-193124847.html">Ford's F-150 Lightning</a> also closely resembles it's massively popular existing lineup. We still don't know much about the 1500 REV's specs yet, though <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ram/1500-rev"><em>Car and Driver reports</em></a> it will have a battery pack that can quick charge at 350 kilowatts that's based on 800-volt architecture. Ram is targeting a driving range of up to 500 miles and towing capacity over 10,000 pounds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Ram concept featured an interior that can be reconfigured for three rows of seating thanks to a powered midgate. And with the midgate down, the 1500 REV can carry items up to 18 feet in length. It's unknown at this point if those storage and seating options will make it on the final production model. We also don't know exactly how much the truck will cost, but it will likely be comparable to the F-150 Lightning, which <a href="https://shop.ford.com/configure/f150-lightning/model/customize/pro?gnav=shopnav-bp">currently starts at just under $56,000</a>.&nbsp;</p>
