<p>Report finds four new offshore depots would emit around three times what the entire US emits each year, pushing world closer to climate catastrophe</p><p>Joe Biden’s administration has been urged not to sink its own climate goals by approving an unprecedented ramp-up of oil export infrastructure off the Texas coast that could result in planet-heating emissions equivalent to three years of the US’s entire emissions output.</p><p>The federal government has already quietly approved the Sea Port oil terminal project, a proposed offshore oil platform located 35 miles off the Texas coast, south of Houston, and will decide whether to allow three other nearby oil terminal proposals. Combined, the four terminals would expand US oil exports by nearly 7m barrels every day, handling the capacity of half of all current national oil exports.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/21/joe-biden-oil-terminals-texas-carbon-bombs-fossil-fuels">Continue reading...</a>
