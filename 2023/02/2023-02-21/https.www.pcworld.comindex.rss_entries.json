Ask yourself these 5 questions", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech journalists (including me) often recommend buying a modem for internet service rather than renting one from your provider. It&rsquo;s quick advice that readers will remember and, in most cases, it works out. Take PCWorld&rsquo;s own local pricing as an example&mdash;for the most basic plan, renting a combo modem-router gateway from Comcast is $15 per month or $180 per year. If you buy a compatible modem and basic router for $100 total, you&rsquo;ll save money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes renting can still work out in your favor. Case in point: Right now in San Francisco, Comcast is offering free gateway rentals on select plans for the first two years. If you plan to move, hop to another service provider for a better price, or otherwise need flexibility, choosing to rent can save you cash and headache.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you pick your best path forward? Here&rsquo;s the ultra quick guide:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Buy</em></strong> if you:<ul><li>Can&rsquo;t change providers and will remain on plans compatible with the modem&rsquo;s speed limitations</li><li>Will only change providers that have overlap in compatible equipment; also, you will remain on plans compatible with the modem&rsquo;s speed limitations&nbsp;</li><li>Will stay on a plan long enough to at least break even relative to renting a modem and don&rsquo;t mind if you don&rsquo;t extract additional value beyond that</li><li>Hate giving your internet service provider any extra reason to make a mistake on your monthly bill</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Rent</em></strong> if you:<ul><li>Will change internet providers before breaking even on a modem purchase</li><li>Will get the rental fee waived and will change providers (or buy your own modem) before the promotional period ends</li><li>Hate dealing with technical issues all on your own</li><li>Need access to perks (like no data caps) tied to use of the internet provider&rsquo;s gear</li><li>Don&rsquo;t have many connected devices (some providers cap the number of active devices on lower-priced plans <em>&lt;cough&gt;Comcast&lt;/cough&gt;</em>)</li><li>Learn that your internet service provider requires it (sorry, that sucks)</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, these scenarios don&rsquo;t address the nuances of your specific preferences and situation. For maximum optimization, you&rsquo;ll have to ask yourself the five following questions and crunch some numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-price-of-the-rental\">What&rsquo;s the price of the rental?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, renting a modem for no cost has a different impact than if it&rsquo;s $6, $10, or $15 per month. The monthly price affects how long it takes to break even on a modem purchase and if that time period makes sense for your situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who already own modems can generally ignore this question, except when the rental price is free. Say you have an older DOCSIS 3.0 modem (or gateway), but Comcast is offering free use of a DOCSIS 3.1 gateway. Comcast&rsquo;s gear will be compatible with gigabit plans, but your device won&rsquo;t. For such high-speed plans, the easy path is to use that gateway for the year or two (or however long that its rental price is free.) Also, the ISP&rsquo;s device may offer faster Wi-Fi speeds than your existing router or gateway, depending on its age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re signing up for a plan under 400 Mbps for download speeds and it were to cost even a penny-per-month to rent Comcast&rsquo;s gateway? Your purchased DOCSIS 3.0 modem is going to be cheaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-features-are-offered-by-your-rental-options\">What features are offered by your rental option(s)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, renting a modem means you get a device that meets the most current specs. Often your provider will periodically upgrade the modem with a newer version, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the latest bells and whistles don&rsquo;t matter much if you&rsquo;re stuck with nothing but 50 Mbps download speeds at your location. Unless the rental comes out cheaper than buying, you can buy the cheapest compatible modem and call it a day, <em>especially</em> if you already own a router. You&rsquo;ll have to be your own tech support, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-gear-do-you-already-own\">What gear do you already own?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of your getting your own equipment&mdash;more&rsquo;s at play than just the modem itself. As a recap, you need a modem to translate the signal coming into your home so that your local equipment (PC, phone, etc) can use it. Meanwhile, a router makes it possible to share that connection among many devices simultaneously. And a gateway combines both the functions of a modem and a router into one piece of equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could end up needing to buy just a modem, just a router, or nothing at all. It depends on the plan you pick, the number of devices you want to put on your network, and what your situation could be like later on.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Router Wi-Fi 6 Vergleichstest Aufmacher\" class=\"wp-image-1437914\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/VT_alle-Router_Aufmacher.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Even if you end up renting a modem or gateway, you could still need your own router.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Rau</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you have no networking gear of your own. Your contract length will determine the value of buying vs. renting. However, if you do rent, a gateway&rsquo;s limitations could still require a router purchase. Some Internet providers (ahem, Comcast) restrict lower-speed plans to a handful of active devices. You&rsquo;ll need your own equipment to bypass that policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, if you do have an existing modem or router (or both), a rental could make sense if your stuff isn&rsquo;t compatible with the network or won&rsquo;t make the most of the speeds you&rsquo;re paying for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-in-your-future\">What&rsquo;s in your future?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing your lifestyle can help you cut down on wasted expenses and aggravation. For example: Do you move frequently between locations with several available internet providers? Buying a modem (or gateway) could be too much of a commitment&mdash;you won&rsquo;t know for sure which ISP you&rsquo;ll end up with next. Or the new location could support much faster download speeds, making a previously smart, frugal purchase semi-obsolete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, you could be a person who lives permanently at one residence with just a single available internet provider. Renting a modem could end up far more expensive when sticking with the same provider for the long haul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re somewhere in between&mdash;you don&rsquo;t move often, but you can switch providers easily&mdash;then you&rsquo;ll have to weigh other factors, like existing equipment that you already own, how likely you are to hop to a new ISP or haggle over renewal pricing, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-your-internet-providers-reputation\">What&rsquo;s your internet provider&rsquo;s reputation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With some internet providers, it could be safer to forgo a rental. Billing errors are an extremely real phenomenon with ISPs and wasting minutes of your life arguing with customer service can be taxing. Even if you don&rsquo;t mind arguing with customer service, there could be other irritations like Comcast&rsquo;s above-mentioned limits on active devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, even if the math works out a little more in favor of a rental, buying could be the less costly choice. Time is its own form of currency. Your mental and emotional health are important, too.</p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1515484/should-you-buy-or-rent-your-internet-modem-ask-yourself-these-5-questions-to-decide.html", "date_published": "2023-02-21 15:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Score this colorful Logitech wireless gaming headset for just $30", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade your gaming gear, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.

Developers have already infused AI into products you use every day, with further improvements to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a scary concept to some. AI can make &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; devices smarter, but at the cost of knowing more about you and your daily lives. AI isn&rsquo;t perfect, either&mdash;and our tolerance for its mistakes is evolving, just as the technology is. However, manufacturers across the board will continue to use AI in a bid to keep improving their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s throw some light on just where AI is already touching your daily life, and new services that can help you improve it further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"your-smartphone-cameras-portrait-mode\">Your smartphone camera&rsquo;s portrait mode</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with one you already know. Traditional &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; SLR cameras can create a photographic effect called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/601917/getting-the-best-bokeh-in-your-background.html\">bokeh</a>,&rdquo; where the background becomes blurred under certain conditions. This serves to highlight the subject of the photo, and distinguish it from the insignificance of the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&rsquo;s smartphones&mdash;pretty much all of them, from Apple&rsquo;s iPhone to Android smartphones&mdash;replicate that effect using AI. &ldquo;Portrait mode&rdquo; uses what the camera &ldquo;knows&rdquo; of the scene to judge what it thinks is the subject, and then intelligently blurs the background. Where &ldquo;good&rdquo; smart bokeh differs from &ldquo;bad&rdquo; bokeh is often how intelligently the camera judges the dividing line between foreground and background. A thick, blurry line around your selfie, or a shot where part of your face or hair ends up blurred and out of focus, is often the difference between a &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; selfie. And who wants that?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S20+ portrait mode landscape\" class=\"wp-image-545548\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Samsung-Galaxy-S20-portrait-landscape-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Portrait mode works best on clearly defined lines, like this statue, as shot by the Samsung Galaxy S20+.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, be aware that the Qualcomm Snapdragon chips powering many of the world&rsquo;s top Android smartphones are <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379806/qualcomm-prioritizes-ai-in-snapdragon-8-gen-2-smartphone-chip.html\">already trying to detect what you&rsquo;re shooting</a> and enhance it before you take the photo, using AI to improve cellular connections, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"nvidia-dlss\">Nvidia DLSS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) sounds impenetrable, but the technology is quite simple: By knowing what part of the scene you&rsquo;re looking at, DLSS can focus your GPU&rsquo;s rendering power there. In real life, that means that GPUs focus their horsepower on just what you&rsquo;re looking at. That maximizes your game&rsquo;s frame-rate performance, delivering a better, smoother experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS is several years old. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398924/nvidias-faster-better-dlss-20-could-be-a-game-changer.html\">Nvidia debuted DLSS 2.0 in 2020</a>, and we&rsquo;d expect further development as time goes on. However, as GPUs stubbornly refuse to come down in price, DLSS at least stands as a technology that can extend the longevity of your GPU and enable solid gameplay for years. And it&rsquo;s all premised on AI, and what your GPU knows about humans playing games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"chatgpt\">ChatGPT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s move on to the AI of the future. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html\">ChatGPT looks amazing</a>, as it&rsquo;s a conversational chatbot that can be used for search, as a conversation, coding&mdash;the potential applications are numerous and diverse. It&rsquo;s free (though with a $20/mo paid version that guarantees access), and we&rsquo;d encourage you to try it out on what you don&rsquo;t know <em>as well as</em> what you know. You&rsquo;ll see that it can be shallower than what you&rsquo;d might like, sometimes &ldquo;hallucinates&rdquo; false data, but that it can stimulate ideas for you to develop. It&rsquo;s also a bit more &ldquo;loose&rdquo; in how it approaches various topics, so that you have the freedom to customize its responses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t treat ChatGPT as an infallible oracle, nor as a replacement for your current job. Twenty-five years ago, however, 3Dfx and Rendition were debuting 3D graphics that looked like a jumble of triangles. We would assume that the technology will continue to improve.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ChatGPT versus Bing\" class=\"wp-image-1506043\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-vs-ChatGPT.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>ChatGPT (left) versus Bing, showing off how differently the two can respond to an identical prompt.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bing-chat-ai\">Bing Chat AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing&rsquo;s AI chatbot (typically referred to as just Bing) is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1510936/bing-ai-with-chatgpt-now-available-to-some-users.html\">currently in trials</a>. It&rsquo;s both stuffier and determinedly more friendly than ChatGPT, with a sprinkling of emoji at the end of its responses. I was <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507512/microsofts-new-ai-bing-taught-my-son-ethnic-slurs-and-im-horrified.html\">shocked when its content guardrails failed</a> (after Microsoft spent six years putting them in place), but Microsoft also quickly moved to fix them. (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html\">Here&rsquo;s our hands-on with Bing Chat</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, Bing delivers lengthier responses, and footnotes its answers so you can check them yourself or follow up for more content. Is it better? That&rsquo;s hard to say. For now, it&rsquo;s entirely free, though it requires a Microsoft subscription. Google&rsquo;s Bard also promises the same basic features as Bing or ChatGPT, but until it shows up, it&rsquo;s largely a two-horse race. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"face-and-scene-recognition-in-photos\">Face and scene recognition in photos</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the consequences of always having a camera in our pocket is the risk that we&rsquo;ll never be able to find our photos again. &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; albums, including Google Photos, allow you to organize your photos both by subject as well as the scene. It&rsquo;s really nice to be able to search a photo as easily as you search Gmail, either for the scene or location (&ldquo;Bahamas&rdquo;) or simply clicking on the face of your kids, grandmother, or best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A photos app like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html\">Windows Photos Legacy app</a> can search the metadata attached to the photo to determine the location, but that&rsquo;s not much help if you want to search for &ldquo;ski trip&rdquo; or the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; of Washington or Colorado. There, you&rsquo;ll find that AI is scanning the photo to determine <em>what&rsquo;s</em> in the scene.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Photos Legacy 1\" class=\"wp-image-1477301\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Photos-Legacy-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Photos Legacy app (not the default Photos app) does a nice job surfacing scenes that you can identify through search terms.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to go into the Settings menus of apps to enable these recognition features. However, AI search might already be there on your phone: Try clicking the search icon within the Gallery app on a Samsung Galaxy camera, and you&rsquo;ll likely see facial recognition already there and ready to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"windows-hello\">Windows Hello</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Visual identification dates all the way back to the original Microsoft Kinect: Remember how the Kinect technology for the Xbox could automatically recognize you? Talk about a technology that was way ahead of its time. Now, Windows Hello uses a depth camera on your laptop to do the same thing. You can argue that it&rsquo;s not truly AI, as the technology essentially is matching your real-life visage against a stored record. But it&rsquo;s likely that Microsoft is thinking about how AI could be used to accommodate changes in your face, with new glasses, wrinkles, or a beard complicating matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"making-you-beautiful-on-cam\">Making you beautiful on cam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and other services already blur your backgrounds, hiding the mess you forgot to pick up last night or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398920/how-to-make-a-funny-zoom-background-to-entertain-your-friends-and-coworkers.html\">entertaining your coworkers with a fun background</a>.

All of these are AI features you&rsquo;d rather not give up, we&rsquo;d bet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ai-art\">AI art</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, set aside concerns about <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475597/getty-sues-stability-ai-and-the-future-of-ai-art-could-be-at-stake.html\">training generative AI art on copyrighted images</a>, or potential threats to small artists and their commissions. For small projects&mdash;say, a bake sale, Back to School night, or a  church breakfast&mdash;generative AI art may prove to be a handy bit of casual clip art that can be brought in on a custom basis. There are a number of AI art services that are just emerging: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html\">Microsoft Designer</a> looks like it could be quite handy, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html\">some of the art we&rsquo;ve seen from Midjourney</a> is simply breathtaking, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html\">Stable Diffusion works right on your PC</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Midjourney sea of stars\" class=\"wp-image-1511503\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mhachman_walking_in_a_literal_sea_of_stars_0154dd24-597f-477a-9e00-b39b8cbdf253-CMS-primary.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>There are a number of AI art services out there, but Midjourney continues to be near or at the top of the heap.

Still, we can&rsquo;t help but think of it as a travel agent: An agent can craft a magnificent custom travel package, but sometimes you&rsquo;d rather save the commission and book through Google Flights, Tripadvisor, or another service yourself instead. Decide what works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"you-com\">You.com</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You.com isn&rsquo;t a big name in AI yet, but that&rsquo;s not to say that it won&rsquo;t be. Implementing search, an AI chatbot, <em>and</em> generative AI art in the same interface <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448609/is-you-com-a-better-google.html\">makes it worth checking out</a>. It&rsquo;s also totally free (it takes a small commission from Walmart in search results) and otherwise ad-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"speech-voice-recognition\">Speech / voice recognition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&rsquo;t think much of Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa and Google&rsquo;s Home devices using AI, but they obviously do in simply parsing your words (and distinguishing them from background noise), comprehending them, and then responding. You can even ask a smart assistant to recognize your voice and tailor actions, such as a reminder or appointment&mdash;to <em>you</em>, rather than other members of the family. Natural-language processing is part and parcel of AI, in how it intuits meaning from your words and phrases. In fact, society seems to prefer that AI technology <em>not</em> listen on our conversations, which is why the idea of a trigger phrase came into being. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"alexa\" class=\"wp-image-1492201\" src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3815132/how-to-listen-to-music-on-alexa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /><figcaption>AI is simply something digital assistants require to function.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Journalists <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393964/otters-transcription-service-now-integrates-with-google-meet.html\">love Otter.ai and similar tools</a>, because they can automatically transcribe spoken interview audio into text that&rsquo;s easily transcribed into text.

Yes, autocorrect trips up, often humorously. But it can absolutely save you time when typing out a long email on your phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This same technology is moving onto the PC, either in apps like Google Workspace or Microsoft Editor. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549224/microsoft-editor-now-knows-who-to-talk-to-and-what-to-share.html\">Editor and Microsoft Word have quietly improved upon mere spelling and grammar suggestions</a> to analyzing your copy for inclusiveness and tone, to what we&rsquo;d assume will be more powerful content creation as Microsoft infuses the Office apps with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"recommendation-algorithms\">Recommendation algorithms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, not all of us like the recommendations that Google, or Netflix, or ad servers deliver to us. There&rsquo;s a theoretical trade-off: Give an algorithm more data, and its advice will improve. Anecdotally, that&rsquo;s true to some extent. Where the system breaks down is where a service has to balance what it thinks we&rsquo;ll like versus what it&rsquo;s paid to recommend&mdash;and we often can&rsquo;t tell the difference.  We still think that Netflix and Spotify, for example, do a fairly good job matching our preferences to the content they suggest.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Netflix discovery\" class=\"wp-image-1511504\" height=\"696\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/netflix-discovery_genre_1-100800394-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>What should I watch on Netflix?

But it is lacking in one area: brightness. Enter the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K. It bursts onto the scene with a VA display panel and Mini-LED backlight that achieves the coveted VESA DisplayHDR 1400 certification. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous display that can deliver on the promise of eye-searing HDR, though a few odd decisions knock it down a peg.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html\">best ultrawide monitors</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in an ultrawide display, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-the-specs\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K: The specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic specifications of the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K are similar to most 34-inch ultrawide monitors. It has a maximum resolution of 3440&times;1440, a 21:9 aspect ratio, and supports a maximum refresh rate of 200Hz when overclocked (and 165Hz otherwise). It has a VA panel which, although less common than an IPS panel, is still rather standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Display size: 34-inch ultrawide</li><li>Native resolution: 3,440 x 1,440</li><li>Panel type: IPS Mini-LED</li><li>Refresh rate: 165Hz (200Hz overclocked)</li><li>Adaptive-sync: FreeSync Premium Pro</li><li>HDR: VESA DisplayHDR 1400 certified</li><li>Ports: 2x HDMI 2.1, 1x DisplayPort, 1x USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts Power Delivery, 3x USB-A downstream, 1x USB-B upstream, 1x 3.5mm audio out</li><li>Stand adjustment: Height, swivel, pivot</li><li>VESA mount: 100x100mm</li><li>Speakers: 2x 5-watt speakers</li><li>Price: $1,499 MSRP</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mini-LED is what makes this monitor stand out. It delivers an impressive 1,152 dimming zones, the highest you&rsquo;ll find on the current generation of Mini-LED displays. Viewsonic also throws in a USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, a feature that&rsquo;s still rare among gaming displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-design\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K: Design</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512964\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>A sleek matte-black design and RGB lighting help the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K stand out.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K is a looker. The monitor&rsquo;s matte-black plastics seem simple at first glance, but varying textures and angles add interest and allure to the monitor&rsquo;s profile. Viewsonic leans into the theme set by the monitor&rsquo;s curved display panel by adding slight curves to other surfaces including the stand neck and base.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels solid, too, with serious heft in the stand and stiff plastics along most of the panel. I do think Alienware has Viewsonic beat in this area, as the<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html\"> Alienware AW3423DW</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\">AW3423DWF </a>both look and feel as premium as high-end televisions. They also benefit from the thinner profile an OLED panel can provide. Still, the Elite XG341C-2K feels more luxurious than less expensive brands, such as Acer&rsquo;s Nitro series and AOC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"alienware-aw3423dw\">Alienware AW3423DW</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alienware AW3423DW\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alienware-aw3423dw-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-13502820?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Falienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dwf%2Fapd%2F210-bfrp%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories?sid=2-1-1511598-5-624338-10150\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$999.99 at  Dell Home</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8200811-13513947?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Falienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dwf%2Fapd%2F210-bfrp%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories?sid=2-1-1511598-5-624338-10150\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1099.99 at  Dell Small Business</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The monitor throws in some RGB lighting elements in a cross pattern on the monitor&rsquo;s rear. They&rsquo;re controlled by the on-screen menu and add a nice bit of flair when the monitor is used in a dark room. There&rsquo;s also a flip-out headphone hanger on the left side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K runs afoul of a personal pet peeve: The stand is much larger than it needs to be. Its hefty neck and massive legs take up gobs of desk space and push the monitor too close to the user on narrower desks (such as those often sold at IKEA). You&rsquo;ll need a big, deep desk to make this monitor feel at home. The monitor has a 100x100mm VESA mount, so third-party monitor stands and arms are an option you may want to exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-features-and-menus\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K: Features and menus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic scores points with its video input options. These include two <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407649/hdmi-21-spec-10k-resolution-dynamic-hdr.html\">HDMI 2.1 inputs</a>, DisplayPort, and USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode. The USB-C input also supports up to 90 watts of power delivery for charging a connected device. This remains a rare feature among monitors not sold for office or professional use, so its inclusion in the Elite XG341C-2K is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s a merely <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">decent USB hub monitor</a>. Its downstream connections are limited to three USB-A ports and one 3.5mm audio port. There&rsquo;s no DisplayPort out or additional USB-C out. The monitor can function as a KVM switch when the USB-C and USB-B upstream ports are used to connect two PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single joystick controls the monitor&rsquo;s menus. This is common, but the way Viewsonic implements it is uniquely frustrating. Giving a joystick a tap will open a quick menu, or the main menu, on most monitors. On the Elite XG341C-2K, this turns the monitor off. The main menu is opened by moving the joystick up. This is counter-intuitive, as tapping the joystick is otherwise used to confirm settings and enter menus once a menu is open. I accidentally turned off the monitor more than a dozen times.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512965\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>There is a lot of work that needs to be done on the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s menus.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic&rsquo;s menu options are extensive, but navigating the menus remains a chore due to how the menu trees are laid out. Once I got acquainted, I found the monitor has numerous color temperature, saturation, and gamma features, as well as a total of five backlight modes and five response times modes. The monitor includes an sRGB mode, though it didn&rsquo;t seem to accurately restrain colors, and it doesn&rsquo;t include modes for other color gamuts such as DCI-P3 or AdobeRGB. This will disappoint some content creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor also has gaming-centric features such as a black equalizer (which boosts brightness to see detail in dark areas of a game) and a crosshair.&nbsp;A pair of 5-watt speakers are included. They&rsquo;re reasonably loud and sound clear when handling simple content, such as podcasts. However, the lack of bass is a big problem with music, games, and movies. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/832609/benq-ew3880r-monitor-review.html\">BenQ&rsquo;s premium monitors, which pair speakers with a built-in subwoofer</a>, remain the king of monitor audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-sdr-image-quality\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K: SDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s Mini-LED backlight has the potential for excellent HDR, but SDR performance remains more important, as most content viewed on a PC will be viewed in SDR.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512967\" height=\"824\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-brightness.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic leaps to an early lead, as the Elite XG341C-2K delivers a gob-smacking maximum SDR brightness of 706 nits. This obviously outpaces competitive monitors and leaves OLED alternatives in the dust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it&rsquo;s reasonable to ask if this level of brightness is meaningful. The Elite XG341C-2K can be uncomfortable to use at its maximum brightness. Still, brightness has its perks, and I prefer that a monitor capable of this level of brightness gives users the option to use it. If you need a bright monitor because your desk sits next to eastward-facing floor-to-ceiling windows, the Elite XG341C-2K might be for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512969\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-contrast.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor also delivers in contrast, with a maximum contrast ratio of 14290:1. This is an excellent result for any monitor and defeated only by OLED monitors which, due to their ability to completely turn off individual pixels, have a nearly perfect contrast ratio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some quirks to contrast. Mini-LED monitors have a downside called blooming, which causes bright halos or spots to appear around small, bright objects. This happens because the Mini-LED dimming zones are around a half-inch wide, so they&rsquo;re unable to perfectly align with what&rsquo;s shown on-screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not all bad news. Mini-LED monitors don&rsquo;t often suffer the dynamic brightness limitations of most OLED monitors, which reduce brightness when displaying bright images full-screen. Because of this, the Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s brightness is extremely stable, without noticeable dips or changes in brightness as varying content is displayed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely, the Elite XG341C-2K I received didn&rsquo;t have local dimming turned on by default, which means the Mini-LED backlight was not working to its full potential. A factory reset confirmed this was the default. I&rsquo;m technically bending my own rules in this graph, as I normally report only the out-of-box contrast ratio: The out-of-box contrast ratio was only 4430:1. Be sure to switch local dimming on in the monitor&rsquo;s settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512970\" height=\"828\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-color-gamut.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K can comfortably be called a wide gamut monitor, as it spans 100 percent of sRGB, 96 percent of DCI-P3, and 93 percent of AdobeRGB. These figures fall a bit short of OLED monitors like the Alienware AW3423DWF and top-notch IPS displays like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html\">Asus ProArt PA348CGV</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s color gamut is more than adequate for everyday use and most content creation. It also provides the vivid, super-saturated look that is common today, and which many people seem to prefer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512971\" height=\"884\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-color-accuracy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Color accuracy remains quite good. In truth, all of the monitors listed in this graph have a level of color accuracy sufficient for any use outside of a professional studio environment, and some are probably adequate even for that. And, as mentioned, the Viewsoinc Elite XG341C-2K offers a healthy range of image-quality adjustments for further calibration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s default color temperature was 6600K, which is very close to the target of 6500K. I found that the image&rsquo;s color temperature fit my preferences well, with a realistic look that wasn&rsquo;t too warm or too cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamma was a different story. I immediately noticed that the monitor seemed too dark, and my results confirmed that with a default gamma curve of 2.7, which is way off the target of 2.2. This made some content so dark that it could be difficult to see details. I was able to fix this by changing the gamma setting to Gamma 2.0, which resulted in a measured gamma curve of 2.2. Content looked right at this setting, but it&rsquo;s disappointing to see a monitor require user intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharpness was good thanks to the monitor&rsquo;s resolution of 3440&times;1440. This is roughly the same as a 27-inch widescreen monitor with 2560&times;1440 resolution. Games and movies look impressive and detailed, and small fonts are displayed with no noticeable pixelation at a typical viewing distance of two and a half feet. You will notice a reduction in sharpness compared side-by-side to a 4K monitor, though.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s overall performance is a bit tough to summarize. It can perform extremely well, but also falls short on a few issues. Local dimming is off by default, the gamma curve is wonky at default settings, and the color gamut falls slightly short of some competitors. Tweaks quickly resolve the first two issues and, once that&rsquo;s done, the monitor looks absolutely superb. The monitor is a fantastic choice for gaming, as its excellent contrast ratio, high brightness, and good color gamut combine for a vivid, dazzling image.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-hdr-image-quality\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K: HDR Image Quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K proudly carries <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://displayhdr.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-1511598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">DisplayHDR 1400 certification</a>, which means it can exceed a peak brightness of 1400 nits when displaying small, bright objects on an otherwise dark screen. It can also achieve 710 nits sustained across the entire display, which is the highest sustained HDR brightness I&rsquo;ve recorded from any monitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned previously, the monitor has excellent brightness stability. You won&rsquo;t notice wild swings in brightness as the monitor switches between displaying small, bright objects and large, bright scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this adds up to excellent real-world HDR performance that at least meets the bar set by previous top-notch HDR displays like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/810180/asus-rog-swift-pg32uqx-monitor-review.html\">Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX</a> and Samsung Odyssey Neo G9. Indeed, the Elite XG341C-2K achieves a better sustained brightness than either, so it objectively performs a tad better when it comes to brightness. Bright details, like the headlights of a car driving down a dark alley, and broad landscapes, like a snowy mountain, have eye-searing brilliance and ultra-punchy presentation. It&rsquo;s a real visual treat, and one that approaches the best HDR televisions I&rsquo;ve seen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"asus-rog-swift-pg32uqx\">Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/asus-rog-swift-PG32UQX-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/810180/asus-rog-swift-pg32uqx-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=AS90LM05R0B0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fas90lm05r0b0.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102&amp;subid1=2-1-1511598-5-810190-11291\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$2999.99 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>However, the monitor&rsquo;s HDR excellence is limited to HDR content, and it&rsquo;s important to be selective when enabling HDR. The monitor doesn&rsquo;t handle SDR content well when HDR is turned on, causing a very washed-out appearance. It&rsquo;s important to turn the HDR mode off when it&rsquo;s not needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-motion-performance\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K: Motion Performance</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"wp-image-1512974\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Despite fantastic image quality, the motion clarity in games on the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K is underwhelming to say the least.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s specifications suggest excellent motion performance. It has a maximum overclocked refresh rate of 200Hz, or up to 165Hz without, and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. That sounds great, but falls apart on closer inspection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic&rsquo;s overclocking mode is effectively useless. Turning it on disables both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and local dimming, removing two of the monitor&rsquo;s critical features. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to spend $1,499 for a fancy Mini-LED monitor and then disable the perks of the Mini-LED backlight. The 200Hz Overclock is a gimmick I&rsquo;d actively encourage owners to avoid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard refresh rate of 165Hz isn&rsquo;t much better. This monitor uses VA panel technology which, in general, can&rsquo;t match the pixel response times of IPS panels. VA panels are also known for &ldquo;black smear,&rdquo; a problem caused by low response when transitioning through darker colors. This problem is not a deal-breaker for me, personally, but it does hold back the monitor&rsquo;s overall motion clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps to compensate, Viewsonic offers five increasingly aggressive response time modes. The default mode, &ldquo;Fast,&rdquo; introduces some moderate overshoot visible in the form of trails around high-contrast objects and a shimmer in detailed textures. This problem becomes comically obvious in the more aggressive modes. &ldquo;Fastest,&rdquo; the most aggressive, introduces huge color shifts around moving objects and bright borders and halos in high-contrast areas. It looks as if the moving image is passed through a bad Photoshop filter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; response-time mode, which is the least aggressive, was my preference. Motion clarity is okay in this mode but noticeably soft compared to an IPS or OLED monitor at a similar 144Hz or 165Hz refresh rate. Test images from <em>League of Legends</em> showed that character outlines and health bars were distinct, but names and character details were obscured. Motion was smooth, at least, when AMD FreeSync Premium Pro was enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor has a black frame insertion feature called PureXP. This strobes the backlight which, thanks to our eyes&rsquo; inability to keep up, improves motion clarity. It&rsquo;s effective, and the bright Mini-LED backlight helps. Because backlight strobing quickly turns the backlight on and off, it has the side effect of decreasing brightness. But, with a maximum brightness of over 700 nits, you&rsquo;re still getting over 300 nits with PureXP turned on. Despite these advantages, PureXP once again disables AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and the local dimming feature. So, that&rsquo;s another no from me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, in one final pinch of salt into this monitor&rsquo;s wounds, turning on AMD FreeSync Premium Pro disables the monitor&rsquo;s brightness setting, which is odd. Turning on the Local Dimming feature does the same. Adjusting contrast sorta works around this, but the minimum level of brightness that can be achieved might still be too bright for SDR gaming in a dark room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, these issues seriously limit the Elite XG341C-2K&rsquo;s potential. In theory, it should be a fantastic gaming monitor. In practice, I found myself banging my head against the monitor&rsquo;s many restrictions and underwhelmed by its clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k\">Should you buy the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K is an excellent monitor held back by numerous minor issues. It benefits from the incredible contrast and brightness a Mini-LED backlight can provide and really struts its stuff in HDR content, which looks stunning. Unfortunately, Viewsonic makes a few bad calls in the monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menu controls and default settings, and the monitor&rsquo;s motion performance falls short of expectations. Even so, the Elite XG341C-2K can still make sense if great HDR is your number-one priority, as it puts the brightness of OLED competitors to shame.</p>\n\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511598/viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-review.html", "date_published": "2023-02-21 11:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Get 10TB of secure cloud storage for less than $100", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Our digital lives are more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406047/with-quantum-computers-here-developers-seek-uses.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complex</a>&nbsp;and bigger than ever, and we accumulate more and more files every single day.
