<p>What had struck Jürgen Klopp the most on Sunday when he finally watched a re-run of last season’s Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid was the streetwise conviction that the Spanish team showed; how they did not panic during the low moments, how they knew they would find a way.</p><p>Madrid dug a hole for themselves here, shipping two early goals – the second after a terrible goalkeeping blunder by Thibaut Courtois. And yet they barely blinked. Instead, it was Liverpool who fell apart at the first sign of turbulence, which was a first goal of the evening from their nemesis, Vinícius Júnior.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/21/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-last-16-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country has showed astonishing courage and resolve in the face of the brutal Russian invasion, but the costs mount by the day</p><p>When Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke in Warsaw and Moscow on Tuesday, the gulf between Russia and the west and its allies stretched a little further. Yet at the heart of two starkly different speeches lay a shared assumption: that this war will not end soon.</p><p>The Russian president assumed it would be over in days when he launched his brutal full-scale invasion of Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/a-year-of-war-in-ukraine" title="">a year ago</a> on Friday. He was hardly alone. The courage and resolve of Ukrainians, and the rush of support from the west and its allies, was remarkable. Each day that Ukraine fended off defeat counted as a victory. Yet the parameters have shifted. In a war of attrition, time is usually on the aggressor’s side. Millions have been forced to flee their country. More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-363-of-the-invasion" title="">7,000 civilians have died</a>, hundreds of them children, and the US estimates that there have been well over 100,000 Ukrainian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/02/us/politics/ukraine-russia-casualties.htm" title="">military casualties</a>. The economy and critical infrastructure are devastated and key resources lie under Russian control. Each Russian war crime has reinforced the Ukrainian understanding that this is an existential struggle, and the fear that a negotiated settlement at this stage would simply be an opportunity for Mr Putin to restock and prepare for a renewed assault.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/21/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-one-year-on-no-end-yet-in-sight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sadiq Khan’s free school meal plan ought to be the start of something big</p><p>At a time when food and energy prices are soaring, Sadiq Khan’s announcement that every London primary school pupil will get free school meals from September is a welcome shift in both tone and substance. The current incoherent tax and benefit system is one that leaves millions of children in poverty and hunger. The London mayor’s £130m <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/19/london-to-offer-free-school-meals-to-all-primary-pupils-for-a-year" title="">plan</a> is distinguished by the fact that it rejects the bookkeeping approach of the government in favour of a more universal scheme.</p><p>Mr Khan’s move is smart politics. It creates a distinctly Labour offer that will be welcomed by many voters ahead of next year’s mayoral elections. Providing a nutritious hot lunch at school is also a good policy that studies show will <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/calls-expansion-free-school-meals-are-timely-and-warranted" title="">result</a> in reduced child obesity rates as well as improved pupil attainment. The Impact on Urban Health thinktank <a href="https://urbanhealth.org.uk/insights/reports/expanding-free-school-meals-a-cost-benefit-analysis" title="">estimates</a> that making free schools meals universal will generate £1.71 in economic and social benefits for every £1 invested. Crucially, the move reveals an appetite for experimentation, necessary – as the Resolution Foundation chair, Gavin Kelly, and the University of Bath’s Nick Pearce <a href="https://politicalquarterly.org.uk/blog/beveridge-at-80-learning-the-right-lessons/" title="">point</a> out – to “flesh out the future of the post-Covid welfare state”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/21/the-guardian-view-on-post-covid-welfare-needs-more-progressive-experiments">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dominatrix in heels and feathers, a Warhol alumni who whip-danced for the Velvet Underground, a feminist trailblazer … ahead of major Barbican show, three giant personalities relive sitting for the great American artist</p><p>An unusual guest captivated viewers of Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show on 21 February 1984. Alice Neel was not the conventional celebrity but a painter and activist who’d been documenting poverty, resistance and radical lives in New York since the 1920s. She was also very funny. The 84-year-old communist started by teasing Carson about his latest divorce before suggesting he should make a show about the backstage life of a chat show host – instantly inventing postmodern comedy with a pop imagination to rival her friend Andy Warhol.</p><p>Neel was a hit – but she would be dead from colon cancer later that year. However, this final blaze of media glory was a fittingly American triumph, for Neel is as much an artist of American individualism as F Scott Fitzgerald. Her portraits capture larger-than-life people, big personalities who fill the canvas with colourful clothes or naked flesh. She paints her subjects entire, seeing selves in bodies, not just faces. For her, those bodies are never meat, but vulnerable revelations. She got Warhol to let her paint his scarred, frail torso after he was shot, and portrayed herself nude with the same honesty. Dressed or not, posing for Neel was an intimate experience. She had a way of seeing secrets. Here, three of Neel’s Americans remember seeing themselves anew through her eyes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/21/labia-piercing-alice-neel-annie-sprinkle-mary-garrard-gerard-malanga-barbican-velvet-underground">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Confirmation that Russia will be backing out of the New Start treaty underlines his disdain for the international order</p><p>There was perhaps only one truth spoken during Vladimir Putin’s two-hour <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/feb/21/putin-blames-ukraine-war-on-west-in-near-two-hour-moscow-speech-video-highlights">state of the nation address</a>: that Russia would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty">suspend</a> its participation in the New Start treaty with the US. The rest was yet another a trip down the rabbit hole into the Russian president’s parallel universe.</p><p>Those who were anticipating a major revelation in a speech that had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ab36f0d-d0f9-4700-b9d9-45387873ecea">been postponed from December</a> were disappointed. In the absence of any groundbreaking advances on the military front, many expected Putin to finally admit that Russia was at war in Ukraine. But no, the “special military operation” is ploughing on “step by step”. Not only did he fail to offer any reassurance to those who dared hope he was considering making some concessions to the truth that the operation is not going well, but he also left the radical pro-war faction hungry for a more aggressive approach.</p><p>Samantha de Bendern is an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House and a political commentator on LCI television in France</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## Football Daily | Liverpool get another chance to unfreeze against their Klopptonite

Sign up now!</a></p><p>You can sum up Jürgen Klopp’s Big Cup story at Liverpool in one word. It’s not “heavy”, or “metal”; it’s not even “heavy-metal” when it’s used as an adjective. It’s “Madrid”. Liverpool beat Spurs at the Estadio Metropolitano, aka the House of Simeone, in 2019 to win their sixth title. In the other four seasons, from 2018-22, they were eliminated by Madrid’s finest: Real three times, including two finals, and Atlético in a just-before-Covid night that gets weirder with every recall. So it was no great surprise when Liverpool, who had a one-in-four chance of drawing Real Madrid in the last 16, drew Real Madrid in the last 16.</p><p>Does anyone else’s memory drift back to 1978 and a short BBC2 series called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421428/">The Pickersgill People</a>? Episode one (if I remember correctly) featured ‘the Sheik of Pickersgill’, who would hold his red and white shemagh while chanting ‘United, United’. Of course, this would never happen in reality” – Peter Storch.</p><p>Postings regarding sightings of famous players off the pitch (Football Daily letters passim) reminded me of many not really seen at all. In the 1990s, when hope was still part of the repertoire of Evertonians, on a once-important news discussion group, there were regular claims of sightings. Many of these were along the lines of ‘my auntie’s window-cleaner knows a bloke who lives next door to a woman whose cousin is on the ground staff of [insert any team]’, followed by a ‘revelation’ about a player from said team who was said to be desperate to join Everton’s ‘Dogs of War’. My most cherished memory of those days goes back to the outpouring of euphoric debate that ensued when one of our number claimed to have witnessed Fabrizio Ravanelli coming out of the Goodison Road Supper Bar with a very big portion of chips wrapped in the (now defunct) Football Echo” – Paul Preston.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily.

<p>A bill would offer protection to so many British women whose lives are made a misery. But there is a glaring loophole that must be closed</p><p>If a stranger slaps your bottom, is it bad behaviour or bad manners to complain because they meant it as a compliment? In the battle to end the harassment women face in their everyday lives, the discussion has often centred on how women can do more to protect themselves, rather than stopping those who feel they are entitled to touch, pester and target others.</p><p>As parliament <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3196/stages/17234">debates new laws</a> on public harassment on Wednesday, we can change this – but only if we stop excusing criminal behaviour as clumsy seduction.

<p>Which language immigrant parents should speak at home has been endlessly debated. For now, we have not passed Urdu onto our children</p><p>As a second-generation British Pakistani growing up in Bradford, I was surrounded by Urdu and smatterings of Punjabi. English came later, and I can remember not being able to understand my teacher on the first day of nursery. This was all part of my parents’ plan: to speak in Urdu to my siblings and I because they knew we would learn English at school. They were right.</p><p>There have been countless debates over the years about which language immigrant parents should speak to their children, and the impact of that on their studies. I’ve never been convinced of the benefit of dropping one language in favour of the other. Because of my parents’ decision, I’m able to speak both languages fluently. I write for a living and worked as a journalist for the BBC, and my multilingualism has only enhanced my life. It gives me access to other worlds, stories, film and poetry. Whether it’s ordering cuts of meat in the butcher, placing an order in a restaurant or discussing designs in a clothing shop, it adds joy to my life, allows me to weave in and out of communities, and frees me from the constraints of any one group.</p><p>Saima Mir is a freelance journalist and author of the 2021 novel The Khan</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/21/children-mother-tongue-second-generation-migrant-guilt-language-parents-urdu">Continue reading...</a>

He was an important element in this movie.’ This is what I hope they thought. Instead of saying, ‘Well, he is old enough now, let’s give him an Academy Award nomination. It’s been 42 years since the last one’.”</p><p>Last nominated in 1981, in fact, for Robert Redford’s Ordinary People, Hirsch will be 88 by the time the Oscars roll around next month. If he wins, he will be the oldest actor to win, beating Anthony Hopkins, 83, who won for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/10/the-father-review-anthony-hopkins-olivia-colman-florian-zeller">The Father</a> two years ago.

Washington was jolted this weekend when its most famous resident <strong>Joe Biden</strong> snuck out of town and made a secret visit to Ukraine’s capital to reassure President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> that America had its back. Kyiv’s cause remains widely popular in Congress among the leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties, but figures on the GOP’s fringes attacked the president for leaving while the United States faced its own crises.

## Irish punks New Pagans on darning, domesticity and Derek Jarman: ‘Home is an extension of your art’

<p>Having hunkered down in rural Ireland during the pandemic, the band return with a witty second album tracing the creativity that can be found in a domestic setting</p><p>Lyndsey McDougall, the singer of Belfast alt-punk band New Pagans, has spent years studying embroidery crafted by Irish women through the 19th and 20th centuries as part of research for her PhD. Through hours spent in the archives at museums and libraries examining centuries-old pieces, McDougall came to understand that the needlework told stories: of mothers raising funds for their families to emigrate and wives creating the material culture for their community’s organisations – and of women flexing their skills for their fellow craftspeople.</p><p>McDougall’s study came out of her own practice of making needlework with the same techniques and materials that women would have used 200 years ago. She says it bears a lineage of agency and expression for Irish women, who have long used the craft to articulate themselves and their values. “I don’t have to overthink it, I just <em>make</em>,” she says over the phone from Belfast. “It’s a similar experience that you get when you’re on stage playing music. You go into this zone of just enjoying it and your body takes over.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/21/irish-punks-new-pagans-on-darning-domesticity-and-derek-jarman-home-is-an-extension-of-your-art">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The game series formerly known as Yakuza has been an inroad to modern Japan for its legions of overseas fans. Now, it hopes to do the same for Japanese history</p><p>Like a Dragon – the game series formerly known as Yakuza – has been going for almost 20 years. These are melodramatic games about the feuds and inner humanity of Japanese gangsters, one part soap-opera, one part kerb-stomping, chair-throwing over-the-top brawler and one part surprisingly true-to-life recreation of Japanese city nightlife. In their cities, from Osaka to Yokohama, in between knocking thugs’ heads together and navigating Yakuza clan drama, you can eat and drink at real-world bars and restaurants, duck into an arcade and play the games there, visit hostess clubs and sing karaoke. For a lot of its overseas players, its vibrant, sleazy recreations of Tokyo’s nightlife have been their first introduction to modern Japan.</p><p>But that was never the intention. “When we made this game, we never planned on releasing it overseas. We didn’t think people would like it,” says Hiroyuki Sakamoto, now series director, who’s been working on the series since its first planning meetings in 2003. “So we were able to focus on our Japanese audience, on making a game for and of Japan … we thought we were making a game that was probably only ever gonna be enjoyed by older guys with an interest in [Tokyo nightlife district] Kabukicho and its criminal underworld.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/feb/21/like-a-dragon-ishin-japan-yakuza-sega">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young couple drive around in circles in the desert while being pursued by a demonic driver in this tedious wannabe shocker</p><p>This lumpy, tedious horror thriller teases a big mystery as to what’s really going on for a couple who keep finding themselves back on the same stretch of highway no matter which direction they drive off in. Unfortunately, the reveal at the end is the second most hackneyed plot twist in film history. (Hint: it’s the one that isn’t “it was all a dream”.) The best way not to break your brain trying to guess is just not watch this nonsense at all.</p><p>Those who persist in ignoring this warning will be subjected to an attenuated campfire-style spooky story that starts with young lovers Sarah (Shannon Dalonzo, the marginally more competent actor of the two) and Michael (Justin Gordon) driving along the stretch of Route 66 that, judging by the cactus-like vegetation, is just near Joshua Tree national park. In the real world, this is a relatively active stretch of highway near Palm Springs, but the film-makers must have shooed everyone off for long enough chunks of time to make it look eerily empty. Sarah and Michael natter boringly away about their upcoming nuptials, seemingly in a fruitless effort to make us like and root for them before it all kicks off.</p><p>The Fearway is released on 23 February on digital platforms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/21/the-fearway-review-groundhog-day-of-a-road-horror-is-a-real-highway-to-hell">Continue reading...</a>

It’s when you rent out a room in your house – or a unit in your multi-unit building – so that your mortgage is covered by your tenants. Hang on, you might say, isn’t there already a perfectly good way to describe this? Isn’t that called being a live-in landlord?</p><p>Yes, precisely, but don’t tell the house hackers that.

<p>Computer programmer Cassius John-Adams explains how he mashed up Crazy Taxi and The Fifth Element during an obsessive three-year period, single-handedly creating the game he’d always dreamed of</p><p>Over lunch one day at work, Cassius John-Adams, a computer programmer for a Canadian TV network, was moaning to his co-workers that things aren’t as good as they used to be. “We got on to how everything, from video games to science-fiction films, was better in the late 90s and early 00s when we were all much younger,” explains the 45-year-old from his house in Toronto. Someone mentioned The Fifth Element, Luc Besson’s wildly inventive 1997 sci-fi film. John-Adams brought up Crazy Taxi, Sega’s cartoonishly energetic driving game. And then, “I was like: ‘Man, I wish there was a mix between the two.’ Everyone around the table went, ‘Yeah, that would be the perfect mix.’”</p><p>It was the spark for one of the great passion projects in recent video-gaming history. Doing nearly all of the work himself, fitting it around his day job, John-Adams has made that very hybrid, a new game called Mile High Taxi that splices the vibe of Besson’s movie and the hurtling mayhem of Crazy Taxi into a heady compound of millennial nostalgia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/feb/21/it-took-over-my-life-how-one-man-made-his-dream-90s-video-game-on-his-own">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Bath Abbey and St Mary’s, Bathwick</strong><br />Francesco Corti, directing from the harpsichord, brought virtuosity to an all-Bach programme with English Concert that closed this year’s festival; while in a morning recital, Ruby Hughes and Fretwork illuminated Purcell’s songs</p><p>Just as Bach unfailingly lifts the spirits, Bath’s <a href="https://bathbachfest.co.uk/">BachFest</a> – a complement to the longer-established MozartFest – is guaranteed to brighten the gloom of February. In the final concert of this year’s festival the <a href="https://englishconcert.co.uk/">English Concert </a>was directed from the harpsichord by <a href="https://francescocorti.com/">Francesco Corti</a>, winner of the 2022 Diapason d’Or for his solo recordings. As soloist in the opening Harpsichord Concerto in D minor, BWV 1052, Corti’s virtuosity was perceptible, but only just: in the context of Bath Abbey the sound of this particular instrument was not quite robust enough to hold its own against the string forces, albeit scaled down in number.</p><p>That concerto was adapted from a showpiece for violin and, since Bach was an inveterate recycler, players and editors have more recently felt able to follow his example. The Concerto for two oboes and bassoons was assembled from movements of the Easter Cantata BWV42 and the Easter Oratorio BWV249a, chosen for their long, eloquent woodwind lines. Bach would surely have approved of both the motivation and the playing here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/21/bath-bachfest-review-bath-abbey-st-marys-bathwick-corti-english-concert-hughes-fretwork">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Using local creatives and actors, director Katie Mitchell’s A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction is a narrative response to the climate crisis and an experiment in sustainability</p><p>Katie Mitchell’s new theatre production will arrive at the Barbican in London in April having already toured internationally without anyone involved getting on a plane or even crossing a border. The show, entitled A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, is an experiment in how theatre can be more sustainable. It is staged by a local creative team and features a different performer in each venue it plays.</p><p>The idea took shape at Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland, where the British theatre director was due to stage a show. The French choreographer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/05/jerome-bel-dance-is-going-through-drastic-change-we-must-stay-in-sync">Jérôme Bel</a> had recently announced that he would no longer fly, a decision Mitchell had herself made after working with scientist Stephen Emmott on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/19/ten-billion-review-royal-court">Ten Billion</a>, staged at the Royal Court in 2012. Mitchell and Bel began discussions with producers at Vidy-Lausanne about sustainable theatre in which, says Mitchell, “the artistic conversations were intersecting with budgeting and systems and structures as well”. The zero-travel rule is just one part of the initiative which is not a set-in-stone model but rather a way to prompt new ways of working on individual productions and within organisations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/21/zero-travel-touring-play-eco-theatre-katie-mitchell-a-play-for-the-living-in-a-time-of-extinction-lydia-west">Continue reading...</a>

It’s as generic as they come, though British actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/14/jodie-turner-smith-this-much-i-know-jodie-turner-smith-ive-watched-top-gun-hundreds-of-times-dont-judge-me-">Jodie Turner-Smith</a> is brilliant as a rookie reporter for the fictional Washington Chronicle who uncovers a scandal with the potential to blow open the presidential race.</p><p>Turner-Smith’s character, Eli James, is increasingly frustrated at having to write clickbait lifestyle articles such as “college dorm must-haves”. But when she uncovers a lottery scandal, she teams up with the paper’s Pulitzer-winning columnist Nicholas Booker (Brian Cox, giving a lefty-intelligentsia version of his alpha-ego male in Succession). Their relationship is nicely played, especially by Turner-Smith, who makes Eli a satisfyingly complicated woman: super smart and competitive, a bit reckless and most of all determined – as she’s had to be as a woman of colour in a largely male, mostly white world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/21/the-independent-review-political-thriller-jodie-turner-smith-brian-cox">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While the West End production of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop musical continues in London, a new cast will simultaneously tour the UK beginning in Manchester in November</p><p>For more than five years, the Victoria Palace theatre in London has been the only “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQjGGrKRL8o">room where it happens</a>” in the UK. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/lin-manuel-miranda">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>’s smash-hit musical Hamilton, about US founding father Alexander Hamilton, will embark on a tour beginning in Manchester in November and continuing in Edinburgh next year, with further locations to be announced.</p><p>Cameron Mackintosh, producer of the tour, said he would be assembling a new company of actors “to bring this great show to our leading cities”, while the London production runs simultaneously. Visiting Scotland will be fitting, added Mackintosh, because “the real story of Alexander Hamilton began in Ayrshire, where his father was born in the 1700s, before he moved to Nevis in the West Indies”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/21/hamilton-musical-first-uk-tour-lin-manuel-miranda-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Tigers’ win over Saracens on Sunday was a timely reminder that elite sport is not just a matter of youthful exuberance</p><p>Professional rugby is increasingly a numbers game. Pounds, euros, metres carried, kick percentages, set-piece efficiency. Some of it is useful information, some of it clutters the imagination. It is also worth keeping in mind that one of the greatest strengths of a top player cannot be fully measured. To borrow the old saying, it’s not the size of the dog that matters, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.</p><p>You can, in other words, be the best athlete in the world, with the most chiselled physique and the best gym scores. And you can still be swept aside by the boundless competitiveness and inner drive of the insanely committed. Rarely will you see a better example than Mike Brown’s man-of-the-match performance for Leicester against Premiership leaders Saracens on Sunday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/21/breakdown-rugby-union-mike-brown-and-leicester-veterans-show-heart-and-soul-has-no-age-limit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: Pro-Brexit MP criticises PM’s handling of negotiations and says ‘it’s important to get support before finalising details’</p><p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the former business secretary and a former chair of the European Research Group, which represents hardline pro-Brexit Tory MPs, has used his “Moggcast” podcast to criticise Rishi Sunak’s handline of the Northern Ireland protocol negotiations.</p><p><strong>Rees-Mogg accused Sunak of being like Theresa May (not a compliment in Tory Brexit circles).</strong> Referring to the way No 10 has handled the talks with the EU on rewriting the protocol, with Tory MPs being kept in the dark, he said:</p><p>It’s quite surprising, because this is very similar to what happened with Theresa May.</p><p>So a story would appear in The Times and Downing Street would say ‘no, this isn’t quite right, it isn’t at all right’.</p><p><strong>He said there would be no point having a deal that was unacceptable to the DUP – implying that No 10 was at fault for not accepting this.</strong> He said:</p><p>There seems to me to be no point in agreeing a deal that does not restore power-sharing.</p><p>That must be the objective. If it doesn’t achieve that objective, I don’t understand why the government is spending political capital on something that won’t ultimately succeed.</p><p><strong>Rees-Mogg defended the Northern Ireland protocol bill, which No 10 seems happy to shelve, saying it has the support of “the person who had a mandate from the British voters” – ie, Boris Johnson. </strong>The bill would allow the UK government to unilaterally abandon parts of the current protocol (even though some lawyers say this would be against international law).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/feb/21/rishi-sunak-brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-ministers-resign-threat-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

A sucker for those sorts of things, not to mention a bit of a gamer in my youth, I tuned in with great interest. And there they were: Super Mario Bros, Mario Kart, Sonic the Hedgehog, Street Fighter II, GoldenEye, Call of Duty … on it went until it was time for Brooker to reveal the No 1. “What could it be?” I wondered. I was not ready for the answer, because the answer was Twitter.</p><p>A baffling choice, and I can’t remember Brooker’s logic for why Twitter was best of the lot. But I do remember his argument for why it was definitely a game, which was that, ultimately, the aim of people who use it is to collect as many followers as possible. Nobody wins Twitter but everyone plays it, trying their hardest to be among the most popular, influential, important people on there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/21/football-twitter-abuse-attention-seeking-walked-away">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I love my partner deeply but I miss sexual intimacy. Should I explore my bisexuality, or accept that my sex life is over?</p><p><strong>I am </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>52-year-old man in a loving relationship with my female partner, who is 49. While we have great intimacy and companionship</strong><strong>, we don’t have</strong><strong> sexual intimacy </strong><strong>as my partner has gone through perimenopause and </strong><strong>has no sex drive</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>This has been the case for </strong><strong>two to three years</strong><strong>, and though I have maintained my faithfulness</strong><strong> (and masturbate for sexual relief),</strong><strong> I miss sexual experiences with </strong><strong>her. </strong><strong>I haven’t put any pressure on </strong><strong>my partner to have sex </strong><strong>and I do not want to sleep with any other woman</strong><strong>. However, I am bisexual and was thinking of </strong><strong>having sex with another </strong><strong>man as a </strong><strong>friend with benefits. </strong><strong>When I raised this with my partner, who knows about my bisexuality, she became extremely upset. I feel lost. I love </strong><strong>her deeply but do not know </strong><strong>what to do</strong><strong>. Should I just give up on sex and celebrate the deep intimacy we have in our relationship?</strong></p><p>Become a supporter and advocate for your partner in helping her to recover her sexual interest – assuming that is what she wants. You can start by encouraging her to seek a consultation with a sex therapist, or with a sexual medicine specialist who could assess the role that dwindling sex hormones might be playing in her loss of libido and offer treatment.

## Uncharted territory: how the Fall’s fractious New Zealand tour nearly sank Flying Nun records

<p>When the Kiwi indie label got a chance to record a live album by the Manchester band, the tensions fraying the group almost destroyed the record company – as documented in a new book</p><p>When Flying Nun announced in 1983 that it was going to issue a new live album by the renowned Mancunian outfit the Fall, the news came as a bit of a surprise. The label had positioned themselves as advocates for New Zealand underground music and here it was doing a live record from a prominent UK act. Yet Flying Nun’s Roger Shepherd and Chris Knox sensed an opportunity. Knox and Doug Hood, also working for Flying Nun at the time, had recorded the Fall’s appearances in Auckland the year before and had managed to secure a tacit agreement from the band to release it on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/28/flying-nun-records-10-of-the-best-songs-of-the-dunedin-sound">Flying Nun</a>.</p><p>Unlike back home in the UK, where the band had the backing of taste-makers such as John Peel but meagre record sales, the Fall were minor stars in New Zealand. In fact, if there was a barometer of New Zealanders’ distinctive musical tastes in the early 80s, it was their unparalleled support of the Fall. When Gap Records from Australia licensed the Fall for the territory, their single<em> </em>Totally Wired landed in the New Zealand singles chart for six weeks in the middle of 1981 (it peaked at No 25). The following year Lie Dream of a Casino Soul made the Top 20 and Hex Enduction Hour reached No 11 in the album chart after the band’s short New Zealand tour. Thanks to Knox and Hood’s tapes from two of those shows, Shepherd found himself with an unexpected opportunity. Putting out a Fall record on Flying Nun could make the label some real money and help offset the cashflow problems that threatened its stability.</p><p>Three months ago (or so) Helene, who runs Sydney’s Stranded venue, and Ken West … managed to convince the Fall’s manager, Kay Carroll, that they were eminently suited to bringing her bunch of Northern Soul Boys (joke) over to Australasia … A tour was born. Being a Wellingtonian by birth (nine years in Levin, hardy soul), Helene thought NZ would benefit from the Fall, and maybe even vice versa. So, completely bypassing the normal promotional avenues, Mainstreet in Auckland, Victoria in Wellington and Christchurch Town Hall were booked through people in those three cities who had never had any experience with overseas acts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/21/the-fall-band-new-zealand-flying-nun-record-company">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The host was on to me and my friends as fast as a security guard trying to get a chaotic drunk out of McDonald’s</p><p>So the scene was a set of railway arches, and there was a different party in each one. In retrospect, it was really easy to tell them apart: it went Weird People, Old People (40+), Young People (-30). But when you first arrive at a venue, it’s a bit discombobulating: too much sensory stimulation, very little signposting. It’s a reasonable human imperative, I think, to move towards the visible bar, rather than stop to notice that every arch has a bar.</p><p>This is how I and a group of friends and family ended up fleetingly in the Young People party on our way to the Old People one.

## The Mushroom Speaks review – an eccentric, awe-struck ode to fungi

<p>Director Marion Neumann not only pays tribute to the magic of mushrooms but claims they could save humanity from the coming climate apocalypse </p><p>At once earthy and magical, fungi not only link us to the origins of life itself but also open doors to alternate realms of consciousness. In Marion Neumann’s loose-limbed documentary, just the latest in a string of films that opine on its enigma, the mushroom can even save the world.</p><p>Compared with the surreal time-lapse photography of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/06/fantastic-fungi-review-mushrooms-documentary">Louie Schwartzberg’s Fantastic Fungi (2019)</a> or the rustic charm of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/16/the-truffle-hunters-review-dogs">Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw’s The Truffle Hunters (2020)</a>, Neumann’s approach is more free-wheeling and eccentric. Interviews with a wide host of fungi lovers – who include scientists, culinary specialists and devoted enthusiasts – delve into the generative power of mushrooms with vigour and optimism. Considering that the cultivation of fungal cultures has allowed us to ease our physical ailments as well as repair damaged ecosystems, the film posits that, beyond a transactional relationship, humans can also model our behaviours after the virtues of the mushroom. Mycelium, the word that describes the thread-like structure of fungal colonies, is often brought up, suggesting that humanity should aspire to such interconnectedness in the face of increasing ecological disasters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/21/the-mushroom-speaks-review-eccentric-doc-on-the-mystery-of-funghi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this moving and funny meditation on loss, the host of the award-winning podcast Griefcast argues that shared stories are an effective response to death</p><p>The Victorians, as the comedian <a href="https://cariadlloyd.com/">Cariad Lloyd</a> points out in her touching new book, were deadly serious about death. Bereaved families tied black bows to their doors. People wore armbands and veils after losing a loved one – a public show of internal pain. And memento mori – including photographs of corpses – were hung in homes as gruesome reminders that we all die. There’s a theory that the first world war shattered these customs – the loss was too monumental and so the culture around dying became much more private, cloistered, lonely.</p><p>Perhaps, writes Lloyd, that’s why we’re often so ill-prepared when loved ones die: we’ve lost touch with time-honoured ways of working through grief, both collectively and individually. To her credit, she is doing her bit to try to change that. Having lost her father to cancer when she was 15, she’s spent years grappling with her sorrow (“a huge, swirling, tangled ball of wires – like the worst headphone knot you have ever seen”).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/21/you-are-not-alone-by-cariad-lloyd-review-the-mourning-after">Continue reading...</a>

Words by Lorenzo Tondo and Ruth Michaelson</p><p>Fourteen days after two powerful earthquakes shook southern Turkey and northern Syria, in what has been described as one of the deadliest of the 21st century, the death toll has surpassed 46,000. Dozens of towns have been reduced to rubble with six-story buildings crumbling in a matter of seconds. After five days, there was already no place for the dead in the cemeteries of the affected regions while hundreds of thousands of people were sleeping in the open air, in often subzero conditions. Many have slept in their cars or in makeshift tents under market stalls, with nowhere else to go. For more than a week, rescuers worked day and night, hampered by a large winter storm, in an attempt to find the survivors.</p><p>Above: a pedestrian passes a collapsed building in <br />Kahramanmaraş, southern Turkey.

The interior of the shack feels like the show’s epicentre, a final redoubt. Later we find ourselves looking into a recreation of Nelson’s studio in the 1990s, and wander the perimeter of a skeletal cuboid cage, fashioned from rebar, in which concrete human heads, clownish masks, and grim and gurning gargoyles are strewn about and hang from metal grilles. Are they human trophies, misformed effigies from an unknown belief system or secret cult? Whatever I write feels like a spoiler.</p><p>We enter through a kind of storage facility, piled high with stuff on shelving racks and leant against walls, embalmed in plastic sheeting and spilling out of boxes. All cast in a grim and dirty red glow, like a photographic dark room or a goth club. Already we are in a time-lagged alternative dimension. We haven’t even met Nelson’s spectral biker gang yet, or the ranting con-artist conspiracy theorist. We’ve not disappeared into the go-downs, with their dodgy companies and free-zone offices. As soon as you are out, an old wooden door beckons, and we’re plunged into a further warren of interconnecting rooms. Take a left, do a right. Door after door, room after room. Lights flicker, an old table fan sweeps dead air in an empty office, a phone doesn’t ring and there’s no one there. This is familiar Nelson territory. Have I been here before? Most likely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/21/mike-nelson-review-hayward-gallery-spooky-rooms-and-indoor-deserts-create-a-pleasurably-disturbing-show">Continue reading...</a>
