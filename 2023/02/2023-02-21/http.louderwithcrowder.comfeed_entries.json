MSNBC said Psaki \"will break down and make sense of the most complex public policy discussions happening in the Nation\u2019s Capital from the debt ceiling to the political campaign trail to the war in Ukraine and more.\u201d She will also contribute a regular column to MSNBC's morning newsletter.</p><p>I can barely contain my excitement.

Though no one can <em>fully</em> fill that void. Y'know, due to its girth. </p><p>This week, Psaki gave an interview with the New York Times about the launch of the show. She acknowledged that people will probably question her honesty, given that her previous job was to lie.

To say the least.  For starters, it's a little odd that Nancy Pelosi had a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alexandra-pelosi-january-6th\" target=\"_blank\">film crew </a>ready to go the day of. And even <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-rips-capitol-police\" target=\"_blank\">AOC</a> admitted the police were opening the doors for the rioters. Which is actually the <em>opposite</em> of what police should do when trying to fend off a mob of angry citizens. Little-known fact. </p><p>Now, new court filings reveal police officers actually pushed rioters toward the Capitol. The filings come from January 6th defendant William Pope of Topeka, Kansas. Included in the filings is video of three undercover Metropolitan Police Department officers who actively participated in the crowd. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c3 undercover DC Metro police officers joined the march #Jan6 protesters\\u2014one climbing over a barricade and pushing others toward the Capitol, and another walking behind #AshliBabbitt and predicting \\u201csomeone will get shot\\u201d\\u2014newly disclosed court docs show. https://t.co/4hzmhByPKe\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Epoch Times (@The Epoch Times)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EpochTimes/status/1627406417194889222\">1676838900</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The three undercover officers chanted, \"Drain the swamp!\" and \"Whose house? Our House!\" while one of them donned a Trump beanie. In another filing, Pope, the defendant, described how one of the officers climbed over a barricade, and yelled, \"Go, go, go!\" at the mob of people descending on the Capitol. This officer then pushed people in front of him towards the Capitol while shouting, \"C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, let\u2019s go!\"</p><p>Now, I'm no lawyer. I just write silly little blog posts for a living. But that sure sounds like some instigation to me. </p><p>At another point in the video, the other two undercover officers were almost directly behind Ashli Babbitt on the exterior stairs when one of them predicted someone would get shot.</p><p>The video shot by these undercover officers is under court seal. However, a February 17th motion included bodycam footage that wasn't previously available to the public. One of the videos, taken from Officer Terry Thorne, shows Officer Thorne telling protestors heading towards the Capitol to \"keep the march going.\" Bodycam footage from Officer Lawrence Lazewksi shows him and another officer discussing how the police were essentially \"set up\" on January 6th.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c\"Keep the march going\" . . . as the officer waves them to the Capitol\\u201d</div> \u2014 \\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf8 (@\\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf8)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeStateWill/status/1627061678193127426\">1676740319</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sooo, yeah.

Because whenever you <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/zachary-levi-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">criticize our involvement with Ukraine</a>, the first criticism is \"yeah, well what about Reaganism, the Cold War, and every other war you supported?\" </p><p>I was watching <em>Family Ties</em> with Deace in the 80s. Discovered girls and beer in the 90s. And like many looking back in hindsight, should have paid closer attention in the 2000s. Opinions are allowed to change. I've grown to view the world differently as I've gotten older. Okay? Okay.</p><blockquote>You're taking my high school son to fight and die in Ukraine, literally, over my dead body. I am never allowing that. I'm never letting you take him to die over your elites pissing contest. Not happening. I don't care what the threat is, I don't care what the penalty is. And if you're thinking of drafting my daughters get the camps ready, cause you're gonna need them.</blockquote><p>One of two things when Biden, the Democrat Party, and way too many \"Republicans\" act like they are elected officials of Ukraine serving at the pleasure of Zelenskyy. The first is that no one realizes the people with the Ukraine flag in their bio are childless progressives who have grown up expecting others to fight or who live in liberal states where enrolling in the military is something rubes and rednecks do. The other is that these elitist twats realize all those things and don't give a sh*t.<br /></p><p>Set aside my acknowledgment that there are levels to foreign policy I don't understand, and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ukrainian-woman-sunflower\" target=\"_blank\">that we enjoyed</a> easy <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ukrainians-looters-pants\" target=\"_blank\">February 2022 content</a> as every other website did.

Now, another famed athlete has joined the chorus of voices pushing for sex-separated sports: former NFL star Marcellus Wiley. </p><p>Wiley is a former defensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers. He took to Twitter and TikTok on Saturday to share his extremely controversial opinion that biological men are stronger, and therefore better at sports than women. He must not be up to date on the ever-evolving \"science.\" Otherwise, he would know that actually, everything we have ever known about the genders is wrong and men and women are exactly the same. Rookie mistake. </p><p>Wiley began with a disclaimer that he has no issues with transgender people in general, before explaining, \"You all can try to Dave Chappelle me all you want. I am very clear on this. You can be a transgender. You can be the homie, but I\u2019ll be damned if a male at birth turns into a female and tries to compete against my daughters.

Whether it's enough to actually change the policies, on the other hand, is a whole other can of worms. But breaking down the narrative is the first and most important step.

And I forget where I was going with this.</p><p>Set aside my acknowledgment that there are levels to foreign policy I don't understand, and that we enjoyed easy February 2022 content as every other website did. I find it astounding that, a year later, our president, the Democrat party, and even way too many \"Republican\" leaders view signaling their virtue on Ukraine as the one true measure of \"patriotism.\" And how any criticism of how much money we send to them -- money that Zelenskkyy tells us right away it's not enough -- makes YOU the \"extremist.\"</p><p>Think about all the help our own country has needed over the past year. The people in East Palestine are only the latest -- and most extreme -- example.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

There are two universal truths. The first is that if you are in the news, <em>South Park</em> <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-park-tackles-transgenders-competing-in-womens-sports-video\" target=\"_blank\">is going to take the piss out of you</a>. The second is if you want to make it worse on yourself, complain about it. Harry's wife is so distraught at being turned into an animated Canadian, instead of being treated as the super serious pubic figure she expects to be, she won't calm down about it. And there may be lawyers involved.</p><p>To recap the story, the \"Queen of Canada\" died. The \"Prince of Cananda' and his wife are on the outs with the \"Royal Canadian Family,\" and demand their privacy. So much so, they keep <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/primce-harry-60-minutes\" target=\"_blank\">going on TV, making documentaries and writing books</a> about how they demand their privacy.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">South Park just destroyed Harry and Meghan <a href=\"https://t.co/R1zzyrx50x\">pic.twitter.com/R1zzyrx50x</a><br />\u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1626236958774292484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>They move to South Park across the street from Kyle, who is sick and tired of them. Kyle discovers that if you ignore them, they go away. Harry and Meghan get in a mood that they are being ignored from being told they demand their privacy.

Harry might, but...you know. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11773161/Meghan-Markle-upset-overwhelmed-depiction-South-Park-DAYS-says-source.html\" target=\"_blank\">Per the Daily Mail</a>:</p><blockquote>According to a source in California, Meghan spent the last few days \u2018upset and overwhelmed\u2019 over how she was portrayed. The source told The Spectator that the Duchess of Sussex 'is annoyed by South Park but refuses to watch it all.'</blockquote><p>Earlier on Monday, something called a \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/south-park-parody-prince-harry-meghan-markle-could-turn-legal-threat-royal-expert\" target=\"_blank\">royal commentator</a>\" said the Sussexes have their legal team looking into it.</p><blockquote>According to sources close to the ex-royals, it appears that, like so many things with Meghan and Harry, this may have legal ramifications attached. Their legal team are casting an eye over the episode to see what is wrong, and what could be turned into something more sinister.</blockquote><p>If true, Prince Harry's legal team is as confused as <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prince-harry-first-amendment-bonkers\" target=\"_blank\">Prince Harry on how the \"bonkers\" First Amendment works in this country</a>. They also seem unclear with how South Park works. All this does is guarantee that the Prince of Canada and his \"sorority girl, influencer\" wife remain South Park residents. Only as bit players. Aimless wandering in the background holding their \"we demand privacy\" signs as the townspeople forget they exist.</p><p>Except for Randy.
