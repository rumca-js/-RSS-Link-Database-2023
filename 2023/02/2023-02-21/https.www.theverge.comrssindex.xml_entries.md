  <p id="VNUy6N">Google is giving YouTube Music users the ability to create custom stations based on specific artists and to tune how the algorithm decides what songs it should play. The feature, which is called the “Radio Builder,” started rolling out on Tuesday and can be accessed by scrolling to the “Your music tuner” section of the YouTube Music homepage in the iOS or Android app.</p>
<p id="kYYvTq">When building your custom station, you can select up to 30 artists and choose whether you want to only hear music from them or if you want it to pull in songs from similar musicians. You can also tell it to play songs that you’re familiar with, new-to-you songs, or a mix of the two and add filters, letting you tune the mix. For example, you could make a station that plays...</p>

  <p id="7zZv5j">If you want to get classic <em>Angry Birds</em> from Google Play — the version that costs just a buck and isn’t laden with microtransactions — you’d better get it quick. <em>Rovio Classics: Angry Birds, </em>a rebuilt version of the original mobile hit, will be delisted from Google’s app store on Thursday due to “the game’s impact on our wider games portfolio,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Rovio/status/1627956351002443778">developer Rovio announced on Tuesday</a>. Oddly, the App Store version will still be available, though Rovio’s plan is to change the game’s name to <em>Red’s First Flight</em>.</p>
<p id="psMOpA">My guess is that Rovio is delisting this remake of <em>Angry Birds</em> to push people toward its free-to-play games in the series that make money off microtransactions. As a $1 one-time purchase, the <em>Rovio Classics</em> version of the game likely...</p>

With the new v50 update, you’ll be able to “touch” things like menu buttons or virtual keyboards with just your hands, meaning it will be easier than before to use your hands for certain functions instead of relying on the Quest controllers or a pinch gesture.</p>

  <p id="j0QseU">Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) threw his support behind striking YouTube Music workers in a letter addressed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai Tuesday, <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2023-02-21/bernie-casar-lend-support-to-austin-based-youtube-staff-on-strike/">as first reported by the <em>Austin Chronicle</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="uMUbUk">Sanders’ support comes amid growing tensions between workers on YouTube Music’s Content Operations team and its parent company, Google. The nearly 60 workers are formally employed by Cognizant, a third-party contractor to Google. Last October, they filed for a union election with the 1,300-member Alphabet Workers Union (AWU). But shortly after that request was filed with the National Labor and Relations Board, Cognizant issued a new return-to-office mandate that organizers — and Sanders — argue amounts to an illegal union-busting strategy.</p>

  <p id="P8MDja">Last year, Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter and promptly brought chaos to the company — laying off three-quarters of the staff and upending many long stable (if not always successful) parts of the business. So Twitter users began looking for a way out. Many migrated, even if only for a few days, to Mastodon, others moved to Instagram or Snap, and a lot of people declared Hive Social their new home.</p>
<p id="8LYoFu">Hive seemed like a cleaner, better version of Twitter, with an attractive app featuring a familiar interface — only it creaked under the sudden influx of new users. Then, the company announced it would need to shut down its servers for two weeks to fix security issues. The challenges Hive faced were enormous — as they would be...</p>

  <p id="4wB9qW">Microsoft and Sony’s gaming chiefs are both preparing to meet with EU regulators today in a showdown over Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The closed-door hearing in Brussels will see Xbox chief Phil Spencer and other senior Microsoft executives argue the case for the $68.7 billion deal to proceed, with PlayStation chief Jim Ryan attending to voice Sony’s concerns over the deal.</p>
