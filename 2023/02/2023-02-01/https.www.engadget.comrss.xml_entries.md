<p>Almost 20 years in, Facebook is still growing. The social network now has 2 billion daily active users, Meta reported alongside its fourth-quarter earnings. The report marks the first time Facebook, which added 16 million users last quarter, has reached 2 billion daily users.</p><p>While Facebook isn’t the first Meta-owned platform to reach 2 billion daily users — WhatsApp <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html">recently crossed</a> 2 billion DAUs — it does show that the company’s biggest source of ad revenue is still growing, even while Meta has made significant cuts to its business in recent months. CEO Mark Zuckerberg alluded to the company’s recent restructuring, which resulted in the elimination of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html">11,000 jobs</a>, saying in a statement that “our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency.'”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A graph of Facebook daily active user growth, showing that Facebook added 16 million new users in the 4th quarter of 2022, bringing the platform to 3 billion daily users." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/673f03d0-a280-11ed-bf4c-f9d8e972bbc1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>But while Meta’s revenue <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-q2-2022-earnings-203433373.html">has shrunk</a> over the last year, the company’s $32.2 billion in revenue for the last quarter of 2022 was still slightly better than expected even as it was down 4 percent from last year.</p><p>During a call with analysts, Zuckerberg suggested that Meta will continue to make cuts as it prioritizes efficiency. “We're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial,” he said. The CEO also said that generative AI would be a priority for Meta in the year ahead.</p><p>“Generative AI is an extremely exciting new area with so many different applications,” Zuckerberg said. “And one of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative AI.”</p><p>Meta also continues to lose vast amounts of money on its metaverse investments. Reality Labs, the division overseeing its VR, AR and metaverse projects, lost $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, and nearly $14 billion for the whole year, Meta reported. and the company, once again, confirmed that it expects to lose even more money on Reality Labs in the year ahead. &quot;We still expect our full year Reality Labs losses to increase in 2023,&quot; Meta CFO Susan Li said. &quot;And we're going to continue to invest meaningfully in this area given the significant long term opportunities that we see.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While the Reality Labs losses have contributed to Meta's revenue slowdown over the last year, Zuckerberg also said that he believes the company is in the midst of a &quot;pretty rapid phase change,&quot; compared to years past. &quot;We can't just treat everything like it's hyper growth,&quot; he said. &quot;There are gonna be some areas that are going to be very rapidly growing, or that are very, kind of, future investments that we want to make.&quot;</p>

## ‘Overwatch 2’ will punish players who regularly team up with cheaters

<p>With the third season of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>slated to start on February 7th, Blizzard is stepping up its efforts to combat cheating. In a blog post <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23910164/">published Wednesday</a>, the studio said it would begin identifying players who regularly play with known cheaters. Blizzard says the owners of those accounts will face repercussions, even if they’re not cheating themselves. It warns of “severe suspensions” and, in some cases, outright bans.</p><p>Next season, Blizzard will also introduce a system for moderating custom game modes. The company says the new technology will automatically remove games with inappropriate titles or content and sanction the accounts that create and post those modes. The system comes after the original <em>Overwatch’s</em> “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-once-again-bans-overwatch-2-sexual-harassment-simulator-but-not-before-it-reappeared-in-the-popular-list/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com">sexual harassment simulator</a>” custom mode made a brief reappearance last month. The mode tasked players with impregnating the game’s female heroes while playing as Cole Cassidy, the hero Blizzard <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-jesse-mccree-cole-cassidy-211428000.html">renamed</a> after allegations about its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">“frat boy” workplace culture</a> came to light in 2021. After the mode appeared in <em>Overwatch 2’s </em>most popular list, Blizzard took action but didn’t say how it would prevent a similar incident from happening again.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Lastly, Blizzard says it’s taking action against a practice known as stream sniping. If you’ve ever watched a popular streamer play a multiplayer game like <em>Overwatch 2</em> or <em>Valorant</em>, you know how frustrating it is for content creators when someone tries to queue into the same match and uses a stream to give themselves a competitive edge. Starting with season three, players will have the option to prevent their BattleTag, and the tags of anyone else in their match, from appearing in their game client. Blizzard will also allow players to hide or delay their queue time. The studio says those measures should prevent someone watching a stream from figuring out if they’re in the same lobby as a streamer. You’ll find the toggles to enable those features within <em>Overwatch 2’s </em>social settings.</p>

## EA reportedly canceled an unannounced single-player Titanfall game

<p>EA didn't just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-apex-legends-mobile-battlefield-mobile-shutting-down-172943226.html">kill <em>Apex Legends Mobile</em> and <em>Battlefield Mobile</em></a>, apparently. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/electronic-arts-cancels-secret-apex-legends-game-in-development?sref=10lNAhZ9">sources</a> claim the publisher canceled an unannounced single-player game set in the Titanfall and Apex Legends universe. While details of the project aren't available, veteran developer Mohammad Alavi (who also worked on the Call of Duty series) was reportedly helming the project until he left Respawn in early 2022. EA is said to be finding places for the affected 50 team members when possible.</p><p>EA declines to comment. Respawn says it's shutting down <em>Apex Legends Mobile</em> as its content roadmap is starting to &quot;fall short&quot; of expectations. The studio also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-delayed-to-april-28th-220058242.html">delayed <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a> by six weeks over quality concerns.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reported cancelation doesn't come as a shock. The global economy is slowing, and game publishers are among those scaling back to help endure financial turmoil. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-delay-games-canceled-202818759.html">canceled three games</a> amid a gloomy outlook, and Halo developer 343 Industries is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/phil-spencer-says-microsoft-will-continue-to-support-and-grow-halo-amid-343-layoffs-184954755.html">dealing with the consequences</a> of Microsoft's layoffs. Decisions like this theoretically help EA and Respawn concentrate on known money-makers like <em>Apex Legends</em>, which has earned over $2 billion so far.</p><p>The rumor is likely to be disappointing to fans if true. The <em>Titanfall</em> games are well-reviewed, but <em>Titanfall 2</em> arrived seven years ago. A third title in the series eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-05-apex-legends-respawn-battle-royale-impressions.html">transformed into <em>Apex Legends</em></a> as the battle royale trend took hold. Now, players may have to wait even longer for a new story-driven game in the franchise — if it happens at all.</p>

## Paramount+ is the latest streaming service to completely remove shows

<p>Paramount+ has reportedly <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/paramount-to-remove-titles-including-real-world-homecoming-1235246702/">joined</a> the trend of streaming platforms removing original shows to cut costs. <em>The Real World: Homecoming</em>, which reunites casts of the original 1990s MTV reality series, got the boot along with six other shows.</p><p>Jordan Peele’s <em>The Twilight Zone</em> reboot, which ran from 2019 to 2020, was also a casualty. In addition, the streamer axed true-crime drama <em>Interrogation</em>, the animated series <em>The Harper House</em>, the comedy <em>No Activity</em>, the crime drama <em>Coyote</em> and the dark comedy <em>Guilty Party</em>. Parent company Paramount Global hasn’t announced whether they will land somewhere else after their removal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The cuts follow similar removals from sister company Showtime, which Paramount will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-showtime-merger-premium-plan-cable-network-170551927.html">fold into Paramount+</a> later this year. (It will then take on the unfortunate rebranding, “Paramount+ With Showtime.”) Rival streamer HBO Max recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/westworld-the-nevers-to-leave-hbo-max-101455395.html">pulled</a><em>Westworld</em>, <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em> and <em>The Nevers</em>. They will begin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/westworld-roku-tubi-warner-bros-discovery-ad-supported-channels-183905525.html">appearing this month</a> with ads on a Roku and Tubi channel creatively titled “WB TV Series.”</p>

You have to use the vouchers within a year, so you can't save them for perpetuity. You also can't hold more than eight at a time. You do get My Nintendo Gold Points equivalent to five percent of what you pay, though. Nintendo doesn't say if or when the vouchers will</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's no secret behind the strategy for the vouchers. Nintendo clearly hopes you'll not only join Switch Online, but commit to buying multiple games where you might have otherwise bought just one. Still, it's difficult to ignore the value. Even one set of vouchers can recoup the cost of Switch Online if you were already planning to buy games. In theory, you could quickly build a collection of major titles while saving a significant amount of money.</p>

## AI-generated ‘Seinfeld’ is just as awful as it sounds

<p>A new Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/watchmeforever">livestream</a> tries to answer the question: What if AI made never-ending <em>Seinfeld</em>? “Nothing, Forever” is an experiment using OpenAI’s GPT-3 natural language model to produce (occasionally coherent) dialog between pixelated counterparts of Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer. Although it’s closer to surreal performance art than the beloved 90s sitcom, it conjures images of a strange, dystopian future where we entertain ourselves with endless content generated by robots.</p><p>“Nothing, Forever” immediately hits you with well-known aesthetics. Scene transitions show the exterior of a line of New York City brownstones over the sound of a quirky jazz bassline. It frequently cuts to “Larry” (the Jerry equivalent) performing what AI passes as standup comedy. Scenes inside Larry’s apartment show him chatting with George, Elaine and Kramer's counterparts about appropriately mundane topics. Their conversations, while mostly unintelligible and lacking structure or narrative, make their inspiration clear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the other hand, the stiff and rudimentary character models look like they walked out of a 1980s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-30-sierra-adventure-classics-reach-steam.html">Sierra adventure game</a>. Their voices are robotic too, and Jerry and George sound less like their real-world counterparts and more like Mr. Van Driessen, the hippie social studies teacher from <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead</em>. Finally, it’s a stretch to say the generated dialog is coherent — much less funny. (If not for its laugh track, you wouldn’t notice the laugh lines.) Generative AI’s current limits are as much on display as the show’s influence.</p><figure><img alt="Still of a pixelated Jerry Seinfeld character doing standup comedy onstage in an AI-generated parody." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/238332e0-a269-11ed-ae5f-a5b7e4e9b132" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitch</div></figure><p>“Aside from the artwork and the laugh track you’ll hear,” one of the show’s creators <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/zavrrv/comment/iynu5er/">posted</a> to Reddit, “everything else is generative, including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music.” The stream has little human involvement and changes based on viewer feedback from the Twitch stream. “The show can effectively change, and the narrative actually evolves based on the audience,” said Hartle in an <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjkyxp/whats-the-deal-with-nothing-forever-a-21st-century-seinfeld-that-is-ai-generated">interview with <em>Vice</em></a>. “One of the major factors that we’re thinking about is how do we get people involved in crafting the narrative so it becomes their own.”</p><p>That goal may be far away, as any narrative — much less a personalized one — seems beyond its current capabilities. Still, with a sizable budget and several years of technological advancement, it’s easy to imagine someone producing more watchable generative programming, an endless stream of personalized, assembly-line digital media. “Our grounding principle was, can we create a show that can generate entertaining content forever? Because that’s truly where we see the future emerging towards. Our goal with the next iterations or next shows that we release is to actually trade a show that is like Netflix-level quality.”</p>

<p>Electric vehicle maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/rivian/"><ins>Rivian</ins></a> is laying off another six percent of its workforce. The company reduced its headcount by the same proportion of workers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-lays-off-6-percent-of-its-workforce-as-it-struggles-with-production-082137076.html"><ins>back in July</ins></a>. The automaker has around 14,000 employees, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-rivian-cut-6-jobs-amid-price-war-internal-memo-2023-02-01/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, so it will be letting go around 840 people this time.</p><p>As with the previous round of layoffs, Rivian says it's focusing resources on increasing production and becoming a profitable company.&quot;While this doesn’t impact manufacturing jobs in Normal, teams across the company will be losing passionate collaborators — teammates who stretched themselves daily and have given their all to help us execute on our mission,&quot; CEO RJ Scaringe wrote in an email to employees. The company shared a copy of the memo with Engadget.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of its push toward profitability, Rivian is attempting to ramp up production of its R1T and R1S vehicles, as well as the delivery vans it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-van-nationwide-152713164.html"><ins>making for Amazon</ins></a>. It had to slash its production target for 2022 due to supply chain issues. <em>Reuters </em>notes that Rivian fell just short of its goal of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-on-track-to-produce-25000-vehicles-in-2022-233943952.html"><ins>making 25,000 vehicles</ins></a> last year.</p><p>The company is also working on more affordable R2 electric trucks, which it plans to produce at high-volume, but it doesn't expect to start shipping them <a href="https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/6v7zO1FRJBVJvAvTe57y0A/2a3644c5b07a914feb637d348fb002b6/Rivian_Q3-2022_Shareholder-Letter.pdf"><ins>until 2026</ins></a>. Rivian will build that truck at a $5 billion factory <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-georgia-incentives-221339799.html"><ins>it's constructing in Georgia</ins></a>.</p><p>&quot;Continuing to improve our operating efficiency on our path to profitability is a core objective and requires us to concentrate our investments and resources on the highest impact parts of our business,&quot; Scaringe wrote. &quot;The changes we are announcing today reflect this focused roadmap.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>We'll get a clearer picture of the state of Rivian's business when it reports quarterly earnings on February 28th. The company announced its latest layoffs soon after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-implements-huge-us-price-cuts-across-its-lineup-083211088.html"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-ev-price-cut-170151501.html"><ins>Ford</ins></a> cut prices of their EVs, making it more difficult for newer players like Rivian to compete. Earlier this week, EV startup Arrival said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cash-strapped-ev-startup-arrival-is-laying-off-half-its-staff-172255412.html"><ins>cut around half of its workforce</ins></a>.</p>

While there aren't many details, the hardware will run a new, Google-designed version of Android designed with wearable displays in mind — this isn't Meta's heavily customized take on Android from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest line</a>. Qualcomm will provide the chipset.</p><p>The &quot;XR&quot; hardware will also entail partnerships with Meta and Microsoft, although Samsung isn't elaborating further. In an interview with <em>The Post</em>, mobile president TM Roh says the ecosystem has to be &quot;somewhat ready&quot; before launch. The tech giant wants to avoid the missteps of rivals who debuted comparable hardware without robust support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung is no stranger to wearable screens.

They're all faster and take better photos. The competitive landscape is very different this year, however. The S23 line is competing against not just an expanded Apple lineup with two large-screen iPhones, but a Pixel family that finally lives up to some of Google's loftier promises. Check out the specs below to see how they compare, and be sure to look at our hands-on sessions with the S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra.</p><h2>What's Changed</h2><p></p><p>The centerpiece upgrade, as you may have guessed, is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgyZjc5MzE1LTNiODAtNGY1NS05YTJhLTQwNzI4ZjY4ZjYzMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVm0NVdclcPdPjvIHR7lC0j9wjWy-Fq-Df4uuEstTCMz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra%2F">Galaxy S23 Ultra's</a> 200-megapixel main camera. It makes the S22 Ultra's 108MP sensor seem modest, and Samsung claims strong low-light photography as well as 8K video at 30 frames per second. You can also expect an improved 12MP selfie camera on the S23 and S23+ models (up from 10MP) with 60FPS HDR, and those phones can shoot Expert RAW photos at their primary camera's full 50MP resolution.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After that, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgyZjc5MzE1LTNiODAtNGY1NS05YTJhLTQwNzI4ZjY4ZjYzMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAf8AnWvB1P0R5uaE-IPYcy5xDnB1lKNjREPwgIu4r3b7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23%2F">Galaxy S23 series</a> revolves around incremental (if welcome) updates.

Batteries are ever-so-slightly larger, and there's greater use of recycled components. Memory and storage are largely unchanged, although that still delivers up to 12GB of RAM and 1TB of storage on the S23 Ultra. You'll still want the highest-end device if you crave more than 8GB of RAM and a 1080p display.

## Samsung Galaxy S23 and S23+ hands-on: Flagship phones that play it safe

<p>While the Galaxy S23 Ultra might be the 200-megapixel camera-toting showstopper, Samsung is also unveiling two more premium smartphones. The Galaxy S23 and S23+ feature a minor redesign, some useful software tricks and, this time, almost spec parity across the two devices.</p><p>Even more so than last year’s Galaxy S22 series, the 6.1-inch S23 and 6.6-inch S23+ are very, very similar. The main differences are the screen size, battery capacity and price. Although, the S23+ also has ultrawideband support, which could help with precision location hunting of any compatible Bluetooth<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smart-tag-plus-bluetooth-tracker-pre-order-133106142.html"> trackers</a>. Besides that, these are the <em>same</em> phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="bc91e6fb13504a288bee39844c5f328c"></div><p>What’s new for 2023? Well, a mild redesign. The company has removed the camera cutout on the back of both devices, even though it’s another trio of cameras. The S23 series, regardless of which phone you choose, will launch in a range of colors: black, off-white, green and lavender. I like the muted green.</p><p>The Galaxy S23’s AMOLED FHD+ screen is capable of 120Hz refresh rates and now has a  peak brightness of 1,750 nits – one of the notable upgrades from last year’s S22, which topped out at 1,300 nits. Beyond the bigger size, the 6.6-inch Galaxy S23+ has an identical screen and both are bright, vivid and smooth. Screens are what Samsung, always, does well on the Galaxy S series.</p><figure><img alt="Galaxy S23 and S23+ stood upright on a wooden table, showing the homescreens. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/f549b070-a092-11ed-bd9f-47cd4152e2d0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>The entire S23 series doubles the number of components made from recycled materials, up to twelve. That includes “pre-consumer” recycled glass for the front screen and back cover. In addition, Samsung used recycled aluminum for the SIM tray and volume keys. It also sourced recycled plastic from water barrels, discarded fishing nets and PET bottles for the speaker modules and in the construction of the back glass.</p><p>The camera specifications are recycled too: a combination of 50-megapixel wide, 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP telephoto sensor. In Samsung’s defense, last year’s S22 series beefed up cameras substantially. This year’s update is more of the same. The cameras seemed responsive and capable enough during our brief hands-on, but we’ll have to wait and see if they perform better than their predecessors in real life.</p><p>At least there are some imaging software advances. You can now capture full 50MP images in Samsung’s Expert RAW format, which used to be limited to 12MP. Video capture also picks up upgraded video stabilization. The S23 analyzes movements and compensates for your shakiness at up to two times wider angles than its predecessor. Rounding out the camera hardware, both the S23 and S23+ have an upgraded 12-megapixel selfie camera, which features a Super HDR mode that captures 60 frames per second in higher dynamic range.</p><p>While the cameras may not be pushing the boundaries of smartphone photography (that’s the S23 Ultra’s job)  there are bigger batteries in both phones year. The Galaxy S23 has a 3,900mAh battery (up from the 3,700mAh cell in the S22), while the Galaxy S23+ has a 4,700mAh battery, 200mAh bigger than the S22+.</p><p>This year One UI update also throws in a few new useful features. Typically, Google’s Android updates dominate a “what’s changed” list between S-series phones. But this year there are some Samsung-made additions worth highlighting. Let's start with the improved comfort mode. The S23  will now adjust contrast levels and colors to reduce the screen’s harshness later in the day. The S23 series also has a new image clipper – no S-Pen needed – replicating the addictive sticker feature that Apple introduced on iPhones in iOS 16.</p><figure><img alt="Galaxy S23+ propped up in the middle of a conveyor belt with food." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/f573cdb1-a092-11ed-bddf-b3148adb907c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>Our first impressions: it’s not a particularly exciting year for Samsung’s smaller flagships.

This year's phone has a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x Infinity-O QHD+ touchscreen with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1,750 nits. Beneath it lies an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication, although you will still be able to access your info and apps with face recognition as well. The S Pen integration has carried over again, with the Ultra sporting an embedded stylus that you can use to doodle, take notes and more.</p><p>Aside from the small design change, the biggest difference between this year's Ultra and last year's is the upgraded rear camera array. The Galaxy S23 Ultra has a whopping 200MP Adaptive Pixel sensor, along with a 12MP ultra wide shooter and a 10MP telephoto lens. The system is capable of shooting 8K video at 30fps, 4K video at 60fps or FHD video at 120fps and 960fps, the latter of which is dubbed Super Slow-Mo. Plus, it can shoot 4K/60fps video from its 12MP selfie camera, too.</p><p>When it comes to specs, the Galaxy S23 Ultra runs on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and supports up to 12GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage and 5G connectivity.

The Pros support 13th-gen Core i7 CPUs and Intel Iris X GPUs, but they can be configured to have up to 32GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage (albeit that’s your cap there, as there’s no expansion slot on these). You do, however, get the same 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2x display on the Pro laptops, so you won’t have to sacrifice there — and the 360 model supports touch input as well. The other noteworthy difference to call out is that both the 16-inch standard and 2-in-1 models have a larger battery than the 14-inch Book 3 Pro laptop, which is to be expected.</p>

## Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra hands-on: A 200MP camera is the biggest update

<p>It’s February and the first major flagship phone launch of 2023 is here. <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxYjg3ZTYzZC1jMDY0LTRiNjYtOWIzNi01OWFkOGQwZTFmNDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT_rhwwHHbjMi7Sne84K9PgTShM8jjAM--YOvXPyvJvg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F">Samsung</a> is launching the new Galaxy S23 series at its Unpacked event in San Francisco today, and this year’s trio of phones are no surprise. While last year’s focus was on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-annoucement-150056033.html">addition of an S Pen slot to the Ultra variant</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s-22-ultra-hands-on-the-galaxy-note-reincarnated-150005282.html">saying hello to the Note replacement</a>, this time around things feel less monumental.</p><p>Most of the changes to the standard S23 and S23 Plus models feel incremental, while the biggest update to the S23 Ultra is a new 200-megapixel rear camera, enhanced selfie shooter and a few software updates. Some other improvements are less obvious, like a tweak in the curvature of the phone’s screen, different materials used in the case and the latest Qualcomm processors. There are also new colors and storage options available, but that’s pretty much it. If you want the details on the regular S23 and S23 Plus, check out what my colleague Mat Smith thought in his hands-on. I am focusing on the S23 Ultra here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides the camera bump, everything about the S23 Ultra feels like a negligible improvement. But that’s not a bad thing and it does mean those who bought last year’s model won’t feel like they’re missing out by not jumping on the new phone.</p><div id="d4e8fc104b2f431da34b8c88ba08c2cd"></div><h2>Design and display</h2><p>At first glance, unless you have one of the newer colors like green or lavender, the S23 Ultra looks nearly identical to its predecessor. It retains the same boxy shape, though Samsung says it’s reduced the screen edges’ curvature to make it easier to use with the S Pen. The display can also hit up to 1,750 nits of outdoor peak brightness now, though I couldn’t really tell the difference, especially without an S22 Ultra on hand to do a side by side comparison. And even though I continue to struggle using a 6.8-inch screen with just one hand, I was able to reach across the display to hit far-off elements. It just took some effort.</p><p>One of Samsung’s focal points for the S23 Ultra is sustainability. Materials like pre-consumer recycled aluminum and glass, as well as post-consumer plastics from discarded fishing nets went into the handset. The S23 Ultra is also the first phone to use Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which the company says offers “heightened durability for long-term use and [was] designed with an average of 22 percent pre-consumer recycled content.” Honestly, I couldn’t tell the difference simply by touch. All I can say is the S23 Ultra felt well-made and wasn’t noticeably heavier or lighter than before.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The most significant update to the S23 Ultra is its new 200-megapixel “Adaptive Pixel” rear sensor that Samsung says is a first for its Galaxy family of products. While you will have the option to shoot at 200MP, by default the system uses pixel-binning to deliver brighter, clearer pictures at 12MP. When I used the S23 Ultra to shoot a bowl of lemons at the available options of 200mp, 50MP and the default level, the latter resulted in the best picture. I zoomed in on the peel of the fruit on all three images, and was surprised to see individual pits and fine hairs on the 12MP photo. On the other two, there was barely enough detail to see the skin texture.</p><figure><img alt="An off-angle view of the Galaxy S23 Ultra's side, showing its slightly curved screen edge." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d3ac3ce0-a1e0-11ed-acb7-7d1ccc6cf6e5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung says it also improved its Nightography mode for better images in low light, thanks to a new “AI-powered image signal processing (ISP) algorithm.” Our demo area was very brightly lit and I wasn’t able to access any dark corners to put this claim to the test, so we’ll have to wait till we can run a real-world test to verify how well this works. And though I did capture a quick 8K video at 30 frames per second (up from 24fps before), it’s hard to judge the quality just by playing that footage back on the phone. You’ll likely want to shell out for the new 1TB storage model if you plan on filming a lot of 8K video.</p><p>There are some additional improvements to the S23 Ultra’s cameras that I couldn’t test during the hands-on event. The optical image stabilization (OIS)’s range has been doubled, meaning it can compensate for twice the amount of movement in all directions. The processing algorithms have also been updated to, as Samsung says, “carefully reflect a person’s dynamic characteristics” based on details “even down to minute facial features such as hair and eyes.” I don’t really get what that last one means practically and couldn’t see a difference in the few photos I snapped.</p><p>I also checked out the S23 Ultra’s new 12-mp selfie camera, which is the same across this year’s lineup. Though the bump in resolution seems like a step up for the two standard models, going to 12-mp might feel like a drop from the S22 Ultra’s 40-mp sensor. But a Samsung rep told me the new sensor is bigger and more advanced, featuring dual-pixel autofocus. They also support Super HDR and can now shoot clips at 60 fps, up from 30 fps before. The few selfies I snapped at the demo came out clear and autofocused quickly, but without a side by side comparison I can’t judge how much better the S23 Ultra is than its predecessor and competitors.</p><figure><img alt="The Galaxy S23 held in mid-air with a picture of a woman in the Gallery app on the screen." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/57e4f650-a1e1-11ed-afc9-9beecc0aeb4a" /><figcaption>The Galaxy S23, which has the same front camera as the S23 Ultra, showing a selfie snapped with it.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The rest of the Ultra’s rear camera array is the same as last year. In addition to the new 200MP sensor, you’ll find a pair of 10MP telephoto cameras and an ultrawide 12MP option. The Ultra also has a laser autofocus that the regular S23s don’t.</p><h2>Processor, battery and S Pen</h2><p>Just like last year, the Ultra is the only model that has an S Pen that tucks away inside the onboard slot. There are no changes to the stylus this year, and making the few sketches and notes I did during my preview felt as smooth as before.</p><p>As always, there are loads of things we will need to wait till we can run our full barrage of tests before we can say for sure. For example, all the new S23s are powered by a custom version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, featuring higher clock speeds than the standard version. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 <em>for Galaxy</em> will hit up to 3.3Ghz, which is a whole 100Mhz faster than the standard. But Qualcomm said the improvements include “accelerated performance… in both CPU and GPU frequencies,” and that the chipset is “the fastest Snapdragon ever.” You’ll still get the benefits of the standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, like hardware-accelerated ray-tracing for better lighting effects in games.</p><p>The S23 line also has a larger vapor cooling chamber to keep the phone from overheating during a gaming marathon, while Samsung says the S23 Ultra’s 5,000mAh battery can last more than 20 percent longer than last year’s model.</p><p>Short of installing benchmarks on the demo units at the hands-on, which is kind of a no go, there wasn’t much I could do to test the S23 Ultra’s performance. I installed <em>Survivor.iO</em> and ran through the tutorial and first round, and the phone ran as quickly and smoothly as expected. I did encounter some lag when trying out new OneUI features like picking system-generated themes and switching modes and routines, though.</p><figure><img alt="The Galaxy S23 Ultra held in a hand in mid-air showing the Samsung Notes app. On the canvas is a cutout of a woman on the top left and the handwritten words " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/1a673b80-a1e1-11ed-9fff-64f7a4f19db1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><h2>New OneUI 5.1 features</h2><p>All three new S23s ship with OneUI 5.1, which brings intriguing new features that are at once Android 13-like and iOS 16-esque. In addition to new color palette options generated from your choice of wallpaper, Samsung’s software now offers lock screen customization options that are strongly reminiscent of Apple’s. You can choose your clock widget’s color, font and style, pick what system indicator symbols sit below it, as well as your wallpaper and more. But the S23 Ultra has a field for you to include a message on your lock screen in case you leave your phone somewhere and have enough faith in humanity to leave your contact information for someone to return it.</p><p>Samsung is also adding new Modes and Routines to OneUI 5.1, and the former is basically the company’s take on Apple’s Focus modes. Both give you the ability to create profiles for activities you might start like sleeping, gaming, exercising or driving, and dictate which apps to silence or whitelist. OneUI’s Routines feature, however, is a little more fun. It’s basically “if this then that” conditional programming, offering more granular triggers and action. At the demo, a Samsung rep set the Ultra to change its wallpaper when Airplane mode is activated.

Samsung’s offering is slightly different because its interface supports split screen, so you can more easily drag and drop your stickers between apps and then resize them in Notes, for example.

## Samsung's Galaxy Book 3 Ultra laptop includes AMOLED screen tech borrowed from phones

<p>True to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2023-event-preview-galaxy-s23-160039754.html">the rumors</a>, Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Book 3 line — including the company's first-ever Ultra laptop model. The Galaxy Book 3 Pro, Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360 convertible and Galaxy Book 3 Ultra all center around 120Hz, 2,880 x 1,800 "Dynamic AMOLED 2X" displays with technology lifted directly from Samsung's higher-end smartphones. You'll only find touch input on the Pro 360, but this still promises rich colors (120 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut), smooth responses and DisplayHDR True Black 500 support.</p><p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book 3 Ultra (pictured above) is, unsurprisingly, billed as a performance powerhouse. It comes with up to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-13th-gen-laptop-cpu-24-cores-140050825.html">13th-gen</a> Intel Core i9 and NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-laptop-gpu-price-release-date-165006688.html">GeForce RTX 4070</a> graphics — this is very much a gaming machine. You can also expect up to 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD (with an expansion slot), a 1080p webcam and an AKG-tuned quad speaker array with Dolby Atmos surround. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one USB-A port, a microSD slot, a headphone jack and HDMI round out connectivity. The Ultra is an easy-to-carry system despite the specs, weighing 3.9lbs and measuring 0.65in thick thanks to a "full" aluminum frame that you'll also find in other models.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c2926a30-a242-11ed-bffc-a2349fa7ba5d" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Galaxy Book 3 Pro and Pro 360 (middle) are more conventional thin-and-light portables. Both support up to a 13th-gen Core i7 and lean on integrated Iris Xe graphics. They support up to 32GB of RAM a 1TB SSD and the ports of the Ultra, but don't have the Ultra's expansion or HDMI 2.0 compatibility (only HDMI 1.4). The Pro is available in a very light (2.42lbs) 14-inch model as well as a 16-inch (3.4lbs) configuration, while the Pro 360 is only available in a 16-inch (3.7lbs) variant. The touchscreen laptop does have optional 5G, however.</p><p>Integration with Samsung's phones is tighter than before, too. Multi Control now lets you steer your handset (not just your tablet) using the Galaxy Book 3's keyboard and trackpad — you can drag-and-drop content between devices. You can automatically upload the phones' Expert RAW photos and edit them in Adobe Lightroom, too. The company is also eager to note support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-your-phone-175356621.html">Microsoft Phone Link</a>, including new productivity features. You can quickly continue web browsing on your computer, or quickly connect to your phone's hotspot.</p><p>We're still waiting on pricing as we write this, but <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvY29tcHV0aW5nL2dhbGF4eS1ib29rcy9hbGwtZ2FsYXh5LWJvb2tzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODM2MzZlZDAtZmVmMi00NmM3LWFkZGMtYmQzOWE5NWRlYTNiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbsUxQYCBYjoFKLzh7-TT4DAEcOwAyDNahSs-OmHoEYI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fall-galaxy-books%2F">pre-orders are available today</a> for the Galaxy Book 3 series. They'll ship on February 17th, starting with the Pro and Pro 360 notebooks. It's evident that the Ultra is the headliner, though, as it's one of the few truly portable laptops that can still deliver the performance needed for games and heavy-duty media editing.</p>

## Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra hands-on: NVIDIA RTX 4070 power in a super slim frame

<p>Samsung is ready to take its Ultra branding to the final frontier — at least, as far as its mobile products go. After introducing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-hands-on-price-specs-features-150056575.html">an Ultra variant of its tablets last year</a>, the company is launching a similarly high-specced model of its Galaxy Book laptops in 2023. Alongside the new S23 series of flagship phones, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNjE4YWU1NS0zNmNhLTQzMTktOGNmYi1mZTk3ZmE4Y2QzOWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZTHdRNDcPsntT24A0K17p6jiIJ4cenMChUdV3Y21Pin&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F">Samsung</a> launched the Galaxy Book 3 Pro, Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360 and Galaxy Book 3 Ultra at its Unpacked event in San Francisco today.</p><p>The Ultra and the Pro 360 are only available in 16 inches, while the clamshell Galaxy Book 3 Pro comes in 14- and 16-inch sizes. I was able to check out a few of them at a recent hands-on event, though Samsung didn’t have every single model available. Rather than detail every configuration, I’m going to focus on my impressions of the Book 3 Ultra here. For the complete breakdown of the six other laptops, check out our news post for the full specs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In general, the Galaxy Book 3 lineup is pretty straightforward. They’re powered by 13th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, with Iris X graphics and up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM. The Pro 360 is the only touch-enabled model, and Samsung has redesigned its display to remove a layer in the panel while still supporting touch. All models have 3K Dynamic AMOLED screens that run at 120Hz and can get as bright as 400 nits.</p><div id="fc846d4c156043a39203ceb5595f3641"></div><p>The star of the show, however, is the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, and it’s a beast of a machine. It uses Intel’s Core i7 and i9 processors, and those are paired with NVIDIA’s RTX 4050 and 4070 graphics cards respectively. The i7 model comes with 16GB of DDR5 RAM while the i9 configuration has 32GB.</p><p>Despite packing such powerful guts, the Book 3 Ultra is an impressively thin and light laptop, weighing 1.79kg (3.9 pounds) and measuring 16.5mm (0.64 inches) thin. It’s not as light as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-gram-style-16-hands-on-032237742.html">LG Gram Style I saw at CES</a>, which is just 1.2kg, but the latter doesn't offer RTX 30 series graphics. Samsung’s laptop also felt more premium and sturdy than the Gram, which might be thanks to its aluminum frame, though I have to say LG’s machines at least have a distinctive style. The Galaxy Books are starting to look boring, with the same MacBook-esque design they’ve come in for years. Like the Galaxy S23 phones, parts of the Book 3 series were built from recycled plastics from discarded fishing nets.</p><p>The Book Ultra is heftier than the other Book 3s, but it also offers a generous array of ports including HDMI, microSD, two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C sockets, a USB-A slot and a 3.5mm audio jack. Like most laptops with a 16-inch screen, the Ultra also sports a roomy keyboard and its trackpad is positively enormous. I wish the buttons had a bit more travel, but typing on the Book Ultra was comfortable enough. It’s no ThinkPad, but it’ll do the job.</p><figure><img alt="A close up of the side view of the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra. In view are the USB-A port and a headphone jack, as well as the keyboard's buttons that have minimal depth." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/965c1160-a246-11ed-b8b5-aec1d733d019" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I didn’t get to try out much else on the Galaxy Book 3, since we had a limited amount of time to check out a ton of devices. The few apps I opened, like Notepad and Control Panel, launched quickly, but I can’t say that’s a good measure of performance.</p><p>I also wish I had been able to check out the 1080p webcam or new features like the updated quad speaker system and PC-smartphone connectivity tools like Recent Websites and Instant Hotspot via Microsoft’s Phone Link. In theory, though, signing into your Samsung account on the Book Ultra and your Galaxy smartphone should allow you to seamlessly move a web page from your phone to your PC. Samsung’s Multi Control now supports Galaxy smartphones so you can use your laptop, tablet and phone with a keyboard and trackpad</p><p>Computer makers have been building software that makes connecting your phone and PC less of a hassle for years. While tools like this are getting better over time, it’ll be interesting to see just how useful Samsung’s offering will be in the real world. Frankly, the most intriguing thing about the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is what Samsung has been able to squeeze into such a svelte frame.

## FTC faces setback in bid to block Meta’s acquisition of VR developer Within

<p>The Federal Trade Commission has suffered a setback in its attempt to prevent Meta from buying Supernatural developer Within Unlimited. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/meta-wins-court-nod-to-buy-virtual-reality-startup-in-loss-for-lina-khan-s-ftc?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, a federal court this week denied the agency’s request for a preliminary injunction to block the purchase. The deal reportedly won’t close for at least another week yet, as the court also issued a temporary restraining order to give the FTC time to decide whether to appeal the ruling.</p><p>Engadget could not confirm <em>Bloomberg’s</em> reporting because the court documents announcing the decision are sealed. Meta did not immediately respond to a comment request. The FTC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-meta-supernatural-within-vr-metaverse-antitrust-193448429.html"><ins>sued the company last July</ins></a>, arguing Meta’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-acquiring-within-supernatural-123904948.html"><ins>acquisition of Within</ins></a> would reduce competition in the emerging virtual reality market. Within is the creator of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supernatural-vr-workout-app-beat-saber-chris-milk-130014895.html"><ins>Supernatural</ins></a>, one of the most popular VR exercise apps on the Oculus Quest Store. An eight-day trial in December saw Meta CEO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-will-testify-ftc-antitrust-case-meta-160453510.html"><ins>Mark Zuckerberg</ins></a> and Chief Technology Officer Andrew “Boz” Bosworth testify. During the hearing, Bosworth said Meta could abandon the acquisition if it did not “close in a timely manner.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With Wednesday’s decision, the FTC must decide whether to move forward with its antitrust case against Meta. The agency has a hearing scheduled for February 13th with its administrative judge.

President Biden appointed Khan to the FTC for her expertise in antitrust law.

## Commerce Department calls Google and Apple 'gatekeepers' of mobile apps

<p>Biden administration officials have taken aim at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> in a new report, describing the pair as “gatekeepers” of the mobile apps that consumers and businesses rely on. The Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) <a href="https://ntia.gov/press-release/2023/ntia-calls-changes-boost-competition-mobile-app-markets"><ins>states</ins></a> that users “should have more control over their devices” and argues that more legislation is probably needed to bolster competition in the app ecosystem. The agency also claims that &quot;the current ecosystem is not a level playing field.&quot;</p><p>In a report titled “Competition in the Mobile App Ecosystem” (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/mobileappecosystemreport.pdf"><ins>PDF</ins></a>), the NTIA says it pinpointed two major policy issues that are getting in the way of a more competitive app ecosystem. First, it says that users &quot;largely&quot; can't get apps outside of the Google and Apple-controlled app store model. The report notes that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html"><ins>sideloading</ins></a> is not an option broadly available to most iOS users and that alternative app stores such as Amazon Appstore and Samsung’s Galaxy Store &quot;are not currently sufficiently viable options to create robust competition.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The NTIA says the second issue it identified is that Apple and Google impose technical barriers that can make it more difficult for developers to compete. These can include factors such as limits on how apps function and funneling apps through &quot;slow and opaque review processes,&quot; the report says.</p><p>The agency determined that, while there are some benefits to the current mobile app ecosystem, particularly when it comes to security measures, the cons outweighed the pros. It added that it's still possible to shore up privacy and security in a more competitive marketplace. To get to that point, the NTIA suggests that several changes are required.</p><p>First, it says, users should have more control over what they do with their devices, including the option to set their own apps as defaults (something that's already possible <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6271667?hl=en">on Android</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-change-default-apps-email-browser-195555516.html">iOS</a> to some degree), a way to hide or remove pre-installed apps and the ability to use third-party app stores. The NTIA argues that operators of app stores shouldn't give their own apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-app-store-search-rank-changes.html">preferential treatment</a> in search results as well.</p><p>In addition, there should be measures in place to prevent limits on sideloading, web apps and other app stores &quot;while still preserving appropriate latitude for privacy and security safeguards,&quot; the agency said. Moreover, it claimed that &quot;limits on in-app purchasing options should be addressed&quot; by preventing app store operators from forcing developers to use their own payment systems. Google has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-netflix-spotify-reader-apps-link-sites-payment-044147213.html"><ins>testing third-party billing options</ins></a> for certain Android apps, while Apple last year started allowing certain app makers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-netflix-spotify-reader-apps-link-sites-payment-044147213.html"><ins>direct users to their websites</ins></a> to manage payments and accounts.</p><p>&quot;We appreciate the report acknowledges the importance of user privacy, data security and user convenience,&quot; an Apple spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. &quot;Nevertheless, we respectfully disagree with a number of conclusions reached in the report, which ignore the investments we make in innovation, privacy and security — all of which contribute to why users love iPhone and create a level playing field for small developers to compete on a safe and trusted platform.”</p><p>In a filing with the NTIA, Apple said it &quot;competes with other products that do not offer the same level of protection and instead choose to let customers load unvetted code onto their devices — which independent studies show leads to more malware and less privacy.&quot; The company also claimed that if its &quot;security and privacy protections were regulated out of existence, the result would thus be less competition and less consumer choice.&quot;</p><p>Engadget has contacted Google for comment.</p><p>The NTIA report comes amid a drive from the White House to bolster competition in the tech industry. &quot;My vision for our economy is one in which everyone — small and midsized businesses, mom-and-pop shops, entrepreneurs — can compete on a level playing field with the biggest companies,&quot; President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-calls-for-bipartisan-legislation-to-keep-big-tech-in-check-193830970.html"><ins>wrote last month</ins></a> in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> op-ed.</p><p>There have been attempts in Congress to increase competition in the mobile app ecosystem. Proposed legislation called the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-ios-android-app-store-competition-open-app-markets-act-143026966.html"><ins>Open App Markets Act</ins></a> failed to pass in the last session despite gaining bipartisan support.

<p>Jony Ive once designed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jony-ive-leica-prototype-auction-131002791.html">limited edition Leica camera</a> for charity, but he worked on a far lower-tech product for the UK charity Comic Relief's <a href="https://www.comicrelief.com/press-releases/biggest-red-nose-makeover-in-history-revealed-with-help-from-aj-odudu-amanda-holden-frankie-bridge-miranda-hart-and-sir-lenny-henry">Red Nose Day</a>. In fact, the famed ex-Apple designer <a href="https://shop.comicrelief.com/products/rnd23-red-nose/">came up with</a> a new version of the Red Nose itself, designing a model that transforms from a flat &quot;C&quot; shape into a honeycomb paper sphere. It's a key part of Comic Relief's annual charity broadcast March 17th on several BBC channels.&nbsp;</p><p>In a short video (below), comedian Diane Morgan jokingly describes it as &quot;the most perfect nose in history.&quot; It has a few typical Ive touches, like plant-based materials and a small case for storage when it's folded flat. In a press release, Comic Relief called it &quot;the most dramatic makeover since [the Red Nose] debut in 1988.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="87c0e0a10c5c43a99e1bba6da856de61"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>&quot;We've grown up with Comic Relief and are proud to support their remarkable work,&quot; said Ive. &quot;This new and seemingly simple Red Nose has been a fabulously complex little object to design and make and has involved our entire team. We hope it brings a little moment of joy to everyone who wears one.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The £2.50 ($3) product is being sold directly by <a href="https://shop.comicrelief.com/products/rnd23-red-nose/">Comic Relief</a> and also on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0BPJT1FWL/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]23344978[t]w[r]https://www.google.com/[d]D">Amazon</a> for the first time with a limit of eight per customer. Money raised from the March 17th telethon and Red Nose sales goes toward people battling issues like homelessness, mental health issues and food insecurity.

<p>The <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/super-bowl/">Super Bowl</a> is set, and that means it's a good time of year to be in the market for a new TV.

Yes, those willing to wait and pay extra for the latest and greatest are likely to get a better image, but buying a well-reviewed older TV is usually the better value. While we don't review many TVs here at Engadget, we've scoured reviews and price histories to find the best Super Bowl 2023 TV deals happening right now that may be worth your time. Prices may fall further over the coming months as TV manufacturers look to clear out their inventory, but if you want a new set in time for the Chiefs-Eagles clash, here are a few discounts of note.</p><h2>55-inch Samsung S95B OLED TV</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVZIQlhZNjM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tajMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVhZGNiM2NiLTU0ZmEtNDQwMi1iOTk0LTIwMWZkY2M1M2MyZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR3mMZ3UKc7-Xe-cenwyMwrEg-0imm9EArQWxbp5dYHG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09VHBXY63">Samsung's S95B</a> is broadly <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vd2lyZWN1dHRlci9yZXZpZXdzL2Jlc3Qtb2xlZC10di8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVhZGNiM2NiLTU0ZmEtNDQwMi1iOTk0LTIwMWZkY2M1M2MyZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQfyUGTO8l5UP5deUuxC4igw59d9pfAdjjbDiLJpudjy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fwirecutter%2Freviews%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F">regarded</a> as a <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/best/tvs-on-the-market">top choice</a> among last year's premium-level TVs, and right now its 55-inch variant is available for $1,448, tying the all-time low we saw back around the holiday season.

At the same time, its added layer of quantum dots allows it to achieve higher-than-usual brightness levels for an OLED, as well as more saturated colors. This means it should perform better than most current OLED TVs in a brightly-lit room. Beyond the display tech, it has four full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 ports, all of which are capable outputting 4K video at a 120Hz refresh rate. The main downsides are its lack of Dolby Vision HDR support and the fact that it's <em>only</em> available in 55 or 65 inches.</p><h2>48-inch LG C2 OLED TV</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVJNSEJYWVgvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZ0aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWozLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYWRjYjNjYi01NGZhLTQ0MDItYjk5NC0yMDFmZGNjNTNjMmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVzaLc4TlXBGDk2dU8Wcn6KO58-gFgDsy07z7q26uDr4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09RMHBXYX%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1">LG's C2 OLED TV</a> can't match the S95B in terms of color saturation or peak brightness (something the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html">wants to address</a> in 2023), but the consensus is that it still lives up to the standard of LG's past OLED TVs, with similarly excellent contrast, black levels, and viewing angles. Like the S95B, it's well-suited for gaming, with four full HDMI 2.1 ports and 4K/120Hz support, and here you don't miss out on Dolby Vision. It just won't look quite as nice outside of a darker or moderately-lit room, particularly with HDR content.&nbsp;</p><p>The C2 comes in a wider array of sizes, though, including the 48-inch variant on sale here.

It still gets significantly brighter than most OLED sets as well, and like the models above it has four full HDMI 2.1 ports and a 120Hz refresh rate.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/alienware/">Alienware</a> has announced when you'll be able to get your hands on its first laptops with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40-series graphics cards. Last month at CES, the brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-x16-m16-m18-gaming-laptops-170032351.html">unveiled</a> a new 18-inch model, as well as more 16-inch laptops, and now the company has revealed some pricing and availability details.</p><p>The chunkiest system is called the Alienware m18. It will initially be available in the US on February 9th with a GeForce RTX 4080. That powerhouse system will start at $2,899. More configurations will be available at a later date, including an entry-level model that starts at $2,099 ($2,999 CAD in Canada).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with one of NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-laptop-gpu-price-release-date-165006688.html">most powerful laptop GPUs</a>, the Alienware m18 boasts Intel's fastest 13th-gen HX mobile CPUs, up to 9TB of storage and either a 165Hz quad-HD or 480Hz 1080p display. It's as thick as the existing m17 but there's a promise of improved cooling, thanks to a vapor chamber covering the processor and graphics card, seven heat pipes and a quartet of fans. These are said to provide a 25 percent airflow improvement.</p><div id="159c2ce99790478aae6231d537d833ec"></div><p>The m16 has a similar design and the same cooling boosts. Likewise, it will debut in the US with an RTX 4080 configuration on February 9th. That version of the m16 will start at $2,599. More variants are on the way, with the entry model slated to start at $1,899 ($2,699 CAD).&nbsp;</p><p>As for the x16, that also has a 16-inch display, albeit in a slimmer, more portable and all-metal form factor. Alienware managed to cram six speakers into this laptop, including two upward-firing tweeters and dual woofers. You'll be able to snap one up with Intel's fastest non-HX 13th-gen CPUs. The x16 will debut in the US with an RTX 4080 on February 14th for $3,099. Other Intel and NVIDIA-powered variants, available later, will start at $2,199 ($2,999 CAD).&nbsp;</p><p>Alienware plans to release AMD-powered versions of all of these laptops in Q2. It will reveal pricing closer to launch.</p><p>Meanwhile, Alienware has revealed that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-500-hz-gaming-monitor-ips-g-sync-170047975.html">its first 500Hz monitor</a> will arrive in the near future. The 24.5-inch display will debut in China on February 9th and it will make its way to North America &quot;soon.&quot; Pricing for the US and Canada will be announced later.</p><p>You'll also need to wait a little longer to find out initial pricing and availability for the next Alienware x14, as well as Dell's G15 and G16. Alienware will announce those details on March 2nd. On the same day, the brand will host an event on Twitch, during which it will reveal more peripherals and other hardware.</p>

## Netflix brings spatial audio to hundreds more titles, but only for Premium subscribers

<p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-netflix-spatial-audio-ambeo-two-channel-154220638.html">using a spatial audio system</a> that doesn't require dedicated equipment. After debuting the tech with season four of <em>Stranger Things </em>and a few other other titles, Netflix is now rolling it out more broadly. However, you'll need to be subscribed to the top-end Premium tier to check it out. The company says spatial audio is now available on more than 700 of its most-watched titles, including <em>The Watcher, Wednesday</em> and <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em>.</p><p>A spatial audio badge on shows and movies will make it clearer if a title supports that format. You can also search for &quot;spatial audio&quot; to see the full list of supported titles. In the coming months, you'll be able to check out more series and films with spatial audio enabled, including <em>You, Your Place or Mine, Luther: The Fallen Sun </em>and <em>Tour de France.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix teamed up with Sennheiser to use Ambeo 2-Channel Spatial Audio tech. It's designed for built-in stereo speakers, particularly laptops and tablets. Netflix says spatial audio should be effective on TVs that aren't too far away from the viewer and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html">phones with stereo speakers</a>. The company claims that its spatial audio will offer a more immersive experience to those wearing headphones too.</p><p>Premium subscribers are getting another boost starting today, which could come in especially handy for those who watch Netflix shows and movies on the go and across several devices. You'll now be able to download titles to six different devices, up from four. That's six more devices than users on the ad-supported plan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-basic-with-ads-explainer-190555318.html">can download</a> TV series and films to.</p>

## The Morning After: The verdict on Apple’s second-generation HomePod

<p>Apple’s first HomePod in 2018 was late to the smart speaker game. Sure, it sounded good, but it lacked a lot of the basic functionality of its rivals. Yet again, with its second-generation $299 HomePod, the company delivers stellar sound quality, but this time, expanded smart home tools show Apple has learned from that first attempt.</p><p>The new HomePod can easily pair with HomeKit and Matter accessories and has temperature and humidity sensors. You can use that data to create automated triggers for other smart home devices. Even without a compatible smart thermostat, you can successfully trigger a smart plug,  once the HomePod detects a certain temperature.</p><p>The most notable new feature on the HomePod isn't even ready yet. Sound Recognition can listen for smoke or carbon monoxide alarms and notify your other Apple devices. Unfortunately, it won’t arrive in an update until later this spring.

It's not entirely clear if all the clips used ElevenLab's technology, but a post with a wide collection of the voice files on 4chan included a link to the startup's platform. The company is now gathering feedback on how to prevent users from abusing its technology. It may even drop its Voice Lab tool altogether and have users submit voice cloning requests that it can verify manually.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-voice-tool-deepfake-celebrity-audio-clips-094648743.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-delayed-to-april-28th-220058242.html">'Star Wars Jedi: Survivor' is delayed to April 28th</a></h2><h3>Respawn says it will use the extra six weeks to polish the game.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-delayed-to-april-28th-220058242.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/3ca78830-a227-11ed-bfcf-37bbd4bd0b1a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure></a><p>Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment announced the delay of<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> to April 28th.

## How to stream every game with Apple's MLS Season Pass

<p>Apple dabbled in live sports with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball-181930932.html">weekly Major League Baseball games</a> last year, but now the company is launching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mls-season-pass-price-release-date-173226971.html">its most ambitious offering yet</a>. Today, the company debuts MLS Season Pass, a subscription that gives soccer fans access to every game of the 2023 season, the Leagues Cup and both MLS Next Pro and MLS Next matches — all with no blackouts. While you can sign up today and start watching a library of archived content, the first games begin February 25th.&nbsp;</p><p>MLS Season Pass will be available to stream through the Apple TV app on the company's range of devices, game consoles, streaming gadgets, set-top boxes, smart TVs and on the web. Anywhere you find that piece of software you'll be able to access the subscription. The streaming plan costs $15 per month or $99 for the season. If you're an Apple TV+ customer, you'll get the discounted rates of $13/month or $79 a season. What's more, avid fans who are season ticket holders for an MLS club will get the all-inclusive streaming subscription for free. Apple's tie-in with MLS is part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-mls-soccer-streaming-subscription-service-171000757.html">a 10-year deal</a>, so the US league's games aren't going to another network or streaming service any time soon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you're not sure if you want to commit just yet, &quot;the majority&quot; of the on-demand content already streaming is available for free. More importantly, Apple will offer every game on opening weekend free of charge and will follow that up with weekly free games. That library of on-demand items includes archived matches going back to 2019, documentary-style stories, the best moments from last season and curated highlights.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Apple MLS Season Pass" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/66df1fe0-a1d8-11ed-bbff-e5a645edd017" style="height: 1428; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Each team has a club page with highlights, schedule info and archived games. Once you select the team(s) you want to follow, match reminders will display in the Up Next section of the Apple TV app. As the season approaches, you'll be privy to game previews and other team-specific content. During matches, updates will show on your iPhone lockscreen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwdc-2022-new-features-coming-to-i-os-16-new-lockscreen-171715107.html">via Live Activities</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple has committed to English and Spanish commentary teams for every match. Additionally, MLS Season Pass will offer French for matches that include the leagues Canadian clubs. Apple has already announced a team of nearly 50 announcers, including a wide range of experienced broadcasters and former players. Maurice Edu, Cobi Jones, Taylor Twellman, Lori Lindsey and Danielle Slaton are just a few of the many. In addition to games, MLS Season Pass will offer live pre-game, halftime and post-game analysis in addition to a &quot;whip-around show&quot; with live look-ins at in-progress matches and detailed discussions of key moments from every game.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Apple will also provide radio broadcasts as part of the streaming plan. If you don't care for the broadcast team, or just prefer to listen to your favorite club's radio crew, you can opt for that alternate audio. The company promises that the sound will sync up with the live action so it will be a true replacement if you choose it. One of the key things that Apple hasn't announced yet is streaming quality. The company says that the &quot;full production plan&quot; will be announced ahead of the season's start, which will hopefully include that info. Apple's weekly MLB games were streamed in 1080p at 60fps, but since MLS Season Pass is a much more elaborate effort that includes literally every match, maybe the company will surprise us and upgrade to 4K.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Apple MLS Season Pass" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/8707b2f0-a1d8-11ed-97bf-bb8c62a45a2e" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p></p>

## UK government reveals 'robust' plans to regulate crypto

<p>The UK government has detailed &quot;ambitious&quot; plans to regulate the crypto industry, with proposals on stronger rules for trading platforms, crypto lending, new token issues and more. The goal, it says, is to protect consumers and businesses, while enabling &quot;a new and exciting sector to safely flourish and grow,&quot; it wrote in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-and-protect-consumers">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year saw the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-sec-regulator-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-defrauding-investors-113127838.html">fall of FTX</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-lending-giant-celsius-files-for-bankruptcy-065843977.html">Celsius</a> and other crypto exchanges, along with wildly fluctuating prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. As a result, critics in the UK have been calling for new rules that protect consumers from the &quot;crypto wild-west,&quot; as the opposition Labour party's Tulip Siddiq <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/af79c6f8-1696-4c3f-b0f7-4d85a39adebc">put it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UK government plans to strengthen rules around the operation of crypto trading firms like FTX, along with other financial intermediaries. The primary aim, it wrote, is to enhance consumer protection and the ability of exchanges to weather storms. As part of that, it's proposing what it calls a &quot;crypto market abuse regime&quot; that would create rules around money laundering and other illegal schemes. It also plans to strengthen laws around cryptocurrency lending.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the treasury department is introducing a time-limited exemption that would allow designated crypto firms to issue new tokens. Companies registered with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for anti-money laundering purposes would be allowed to issue coins while the new regulations are written.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2022, the UK government <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-announces-plan-to-set-stricter-rules-for-crypto-ads-132529935.html">promised a crackdown</a> on misleading crypto ads, but that now seems quaint given the tumultuous year that followed. At the time, the government figured that around 2.3 million people in the country owned a cryptoasset.</p><p>Today's proposal &quot;delivers on the original policy intention of the measure to promote innovation, enhance consumer protection and ensure that cryptoasset promotions can be held to equivalent standards as promotions of financial services products with similar risk profiles,&quot; the government said.

<p>The last Boeing 747 to ever be built has changed hands in front of thousands of people who wanted to say goodbye to the iconic widebody plane. Customers, suppliers, celebrities, as well as current and former employees — including the original staff known ass the &quot;Incredibles&quot; who built the first 747 — gathered at the company's Everett factory to witness Boeing delivering the plane to Atlas Air Worldwide. The event marks the plane's end of production since it was first built in 1967.&nbsp;</p><p>Boeing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-to-end-747-production-012324738.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/boeing-to-end-747-production-012324738.html">revealed back in 2020</a> that it was going to retire the model in a couple of years after it was done building the last orders for it. The 747 was one of the most famous four-engine widebody jets in the world and revolutionized air travel by doubling passenger capacity and thereby lowering the price of each seat. During the peak of its popularity in 1990, Boeing delivered 70 units in a single year. But like most older technologies, it eventually took a backseat to some of the company's newer jets, particularly its two-engine planes that can fly the same routes but can use fuel more efficiently.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deliver-last-747-saying-goodbye-queen-skies-2023-01-31/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, the company only delivered five 747s in 2022, though the whole program itself produced 1,574 jets. The last planes Boeing delivered, including this one, will be used to transport cargo in the years to come. Yes, we won't be seeing any new 747 anymore, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-31/boeing-747-jumbo-jet-production-comes-to-an-end-after-54-years?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> says the orders delivered for freighter use could be around until the 2050s.&nbsp;</p><p>Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said in a statement:</p><p>&quot;This monumental day is a testament to the generations of Boeing employees who brought to life the airplane that 'shrank the world,' and revolutionized travel and air cargo as the first widebody. It is fitting to deliver this final 747-8 Freighter to the largest operator of the 747, Atlas Air, where the 'Queen' will continue to inspire and empower innovation in air cargo.&quot;</p><p>Kim Smith, Boeing's VP and general manager for the 747 and 767 programs, revealed that the model's production line shut down as workers finished building different parts for the last plane. Employees who worked on in the factory have now been transferred to other programs or have voluntarily retired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>YouTube TV has dropped the MLB Network from its service after failing to renew its agreement, according to a statement from YouTube given to <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/youtube-tv-drops-mlb-network-in-carriage-dispute"><em>The Streamable</em></a>. &quot;You will also lose access to any previous Library recordings from this channel,&quot; the streamer wrote. &quot;Members will be able to continue watching select national MLB games via coverage on FOX, ESPN, and TBS through our Base Plan.&quot;</p><p>The dispute appears to be over compensation, according to a statement from MLB Network. &quot;YouTube TV has been unwilling to negotiate a fair carriage agreement... consistent with what close to 300 other US providers have agreed to for distribution.&quot; MLB Network was part of YouTube's $65 Base Plan and one of the few that carried 4K content as part of YouTube TV's 4K Plus add-on.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The news isn't too tragic yet, as baseball season is still a couple of months away. YouTube TV has previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-loses-access-to-disney-channels-083536190.html">lost access</a> to other channels including Disney's ESPN and ABC, but in the case of the latter, they were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-disney-channels-back-espn-abc-213518747.html">restored</a> just a day later. That lends some hope that the streaming company can reach an agreement with MLB Network ahead of any disruption to games next season.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, &quot;MLB Network remains widely available throughout the US, including on Altice USA (Optimum), AT&amp;T U-verse, Charter Communications (Spectrum), Comcast, Cox Communications, DIRECTV, DIRECTV Stream, DISH, fuboTV, Sling TV, Verizon Fios and many others,&quot; MLB Network wrote.&nbsp;</p>

## Amazon once again broke labor laws during New York unionization drive, judge rules

<p>Last month, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fails-to-overturn-staten-island-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-064010341.html">failed to overturn</a> a Staten Island warehouse's vote to unionize and now it has taken another loss. A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has ruled that the the company broke federal labor laws in an effort to push back a unionization drive at that facility and another that voted against the union, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8zMS9idXNpbmVzcy9lY29ub215L2FtYXpvbi11bmlvbi1zdGF0ZW4taXNsYW5kLW5scmIuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzI3MWI0ZDAtYmNlMy00ZmQ4LTg4NzktZWUyN2I2NWM5NjkzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaEOFrZ_UCY9BtbrHfU__HcWxymf4x8BriLxIu8Vc5ry&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F01%2F31%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Famazon-union-staten-island-nlrb.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has reported. Amazon can still appeal the ruling to the NLRB's Washington board.</p><p>Federal administrative judge Benjamin Green ruled that Amazon supervisors unlawfully threatened wage increases and benefits if workers formed a union. The company also violated the law by removing a worker's post on a digital message board inviting co-workers to sign an Amazon Labor Union petition to make Juneteenth a paid holiday, the judge said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Several other complaints by the union were dismissed, however. Those include accusations that Amazon said take-home pay would fall in the case of unionization, and that it promised improvements in an educational subsidy program if workers voted against the union. The union also protested Amazon saying workers would be fired if they formed a union but failed to pay union dues. The latter was not illegal, the judge ruled, and the other complaints were overstated.</p><p>Amazon took all that as a positive. "We’re glad that the judge dismissed 19 — nearly all — of the allegations in this case," said spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis in a statement to the <em>NYT</em>. "The facts continue to show that the teams in our buildings work hard to do the right thing."</p><p>The judge set aside one decision brought by the labor board as to whether employers can force workers to attend anti-union meetings. That puts the ball in the court of the NLRB, which can overturn a 75-year old ruling. "I believe that the NLRB case precedent, which has tolerated such meetings, is at odds with fundamental labor-law principles," the labor board's lawyer Jennifer Abruzzo <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/nlrb-top-attorney-takes-aim-at-anti-union-persuasion-meetings">wrote in a memo last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## Google Fi warns customers that their data has been compromised

<p>Google has notified customers of its Fi mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service that hackers were able to access some of their information, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/google-fi-customer-data-breach/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The tech giant said the bad actors infiltrated a third-party system used for customer support at Fi's primary network provider. While Google didn't name the provider outright, Fi relies on US Cellular and T-Mobile for connectivity. If you'll recall, the latter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-37-million-customers-data-062232994.html">admitted</a> in mid-January that hackers had been taking data from its systems since November last year.</p><p>T-Mobile said the attackers got away with the information of around 37 million postpaid and prepaid customers before it discovered and contained the issue. Back then, the carrier insisted that no passwords, payment information and social security numbers were stolen. Google Fi is saying the same thing, adding that no PINs or text message/call contents were taken, as well. The hackers only apparently had access to users' phone numbers, account status, SMS card serial numbers and some service plan information, like international roaming.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google reportedly told most users that they didn't have to do anything and that it's still working with Fi's network provider to &quot;identify and implement measures to secure the data on that third-party system and notify everyone potentially impacted.&quot; That said, at least one customer claimed having more serious issues than most because of the breach. They shared a part of Google's supposed email to them <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/10pjtie/google_fi_data_breach/j6kysv8/">on Reddit</a>, telling them that that their &quot;mobile phone service was transferred from [their] SIM card to another SIM card&quot; for almost two hours on January 1st.&nbsp;</p><p>The customer said they received password reset notifications from Outlook, their crypto wallet account and two-factor authenticator Authy that day. They sent logs to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/31/google-fi-customer-hack-story/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> to prove that the attackers had used their number to receive text messages that allowed them to access those accounts. Based on their Fi text history, the bad actors started resetting passwords and requesting two-factor authentication codes via SMS within one minute of transferring their SIM card. The customer was reportedly only able regain control of their accounts after turning network access on their iPhone off and back on, though it's unclear if that's what solved the issue. We've reached out to Google for a statement regarding the customers' SIM swapping claim and will update this post when we hear  back.&nbsp;</p>

## Google's experimental ChatGPT rivals include a search bot and a tool called 'Apprentice Bard'

<p>Google employees have been testing several potential ChatGPT competitors as part of the tech giant's bid to launch a response to OpenAI's technology, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/google-testing-chatgpt-like-chatbot-apprentice-bard-with-employees.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chatgpt-ai-chatbot-search-170007802.html">previous New York Times report</a> said that Google CEO Sundar Pichai declared &quot;code red&quot; and accelerated AI development to be able to unveil at least 20 AI-powered products this year. Now, <em>CNBC</em> has detailed several of the products the company is working on, including a chatbot called &quot;Apprentice Bard&quot; that uses Google's LaMDA conversation technology.</p><p>Apparently, Google management asked the LaMDA team to prioritize working on a ChatGPT competitor, telling them that it takes precedence over any other project and even warning them not to attend unrelated meetings. Apprentice Bard reportedly looks and functions like ChatGPT in that a user can type a question or a prompt in a text box and then get a written response.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>CNBC</em> says it saw samples proving the bot's answers include information from recent events — something ChatGPT isn't capable of, because it only has limited knowledge about anything that happened after 2021. In one example, Apprentice Bard was able to answer whether there will be another round of layoffs at Google. (Unlikely for this year, it said, seeing as the company is doing well financially.) If you'll recall, Google's LaMDA tech had gotten a former company engineer fired after he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blake-lemoide-fired-google-lamda-sentient-001746197.html">claimed that it had gained sentience</a>.</p><p>Google is also reportedly testing a new search page that uses a question and answer format. The experimental home page features five potential question prompts replacing &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; under the search bar. After a user types in their query, the page generates human-like responses in gray bubbles. Underneath those responses are suggested follow-up questions, followed by the typical search results with links and headlines. In addition, Alphabet is working on a project called &quot;Atlas&quot; under its cloud unit. While <em>CNBC</em> didn't have details on what it is, it's still reportedly part of Google's &quot;code red&quot; efforts.</p><p>It's unclear at this point which of Google's projects are going to be released to the public. Google AI chief Jeff Dean told employees during an all-hands meeting to discuss the company's response to ChatGPT that it's moving &quot;more conservatively than a small startup.&quot; Providing people wrong information will have a much bigger impact for a known company like Google, after all. Indeed, <em>The Times</em> previously said that the tech giant is prioritizing safety, accuracy and blocking out misinformation when it comes to the development of its search chatbot. If reports that Microsoft is incorporating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reportedly-integrating-chatgpt-technology-into-bing-131502579.html">ChatGPT's technology into Bing</a> as soon as this March are true, however, we'll also likely see Google's search chatbot in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
