The uncertainty is killing me. </p><p>At least this isn't as bad as that time Martha decided to show off the Nativity set she made at \"Camp Cupcake,\" the prison she spent five months at for insider trading.

We already covered the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/google-employee-vlog-let-go\" target=\"_blank\">chick who vlogged her day </a>at Google's adult daycare just before they showed her the door. Today, we've found another Google refugee. This one was laid off while on a three-month mental health break. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cGoogle engineer who was laid off while on mental health leave says she 'silently mourned' after receiving her severance email at 2 a.m. https://t.co/hXJK0ZWji7\\u201d</div> \u2014 Insider Tech (@Insider Tech)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TechInsider/status/1620401093267054594\">1675168700</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly. The free food and art displays of Google HQ became too much for her, and as a result, she had to take off a quarter of the year. As a general rule, if you can take three months off from your job with little to no impact on your company, you probably aren't an <em>essential</em> worker. Just a wild guess. </p><p>Twenty-nine-year-old Ali Neal told Business Insider she checked her email at 2 AM and saw the notice of unemployment from Google. She immediately called a friend to tell them about her layoff, which she saw as a \"personal attack.\" She then drank whiskey and \"silently mourned\" her layoff until the morning. </p><p>She was quickly removed from her work laptop, emails, and corporate documents. Google won't even let her come to the office to drop off her laptop and other devices. They told her to meet with security somewhere near the office or ship them in a box. </p><p>Neal described the layoffs as \"Un-Googley,\" explaining that she had thought of the company as a \"safe and stable environment\" where the risk of layoffs was low. She also claimed to have \"bled for Google\" and met and exceeded performance expectations. She also assumed she would be safe from any layoffs due to the fact she was already on leave. </p><p>Which makes perfect sense. When a company is faced with mandatory <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-managers\" target=\"_blank\">layoffs</a>, they would <em>never</em> choose an employee who has been on leave for several months and whose absence has gone largely unnoticed with little-to-no impact on day-to-day operations. Not in a million years. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

She's currently being held at Cook County jail on $150,000 bond. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cVera Liddell allegedly stole $1.5M in chicken wings from Illinois schools https://t.co/EQ4P6I2NXU\\u201d</div> \u2014 New York Post (@New York Post)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1620603110266634241\">1675216865</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's even more impressive than the sheer quantity of chicken wings stolen is the short timeframe in which Liddell was able to steal and consume such a vast quantity of chicken wings. Her poultry poaching ramped up during the Covid pandemic when students were no longer attending school in person, but lunches were packaged for families to pick up.  The fraud allegedly only lasted 19 months, from July 2020 to February 2022. </p><p>The fowl felon was found out after a routine mid-year audit in January 2022 showed the food district exceeded its budget by a whopping $300k, even though it was only halfway through the year. Seems like Vera got a little too cocky in her aptitude for chicken stealing.</p><p>At one point, Vera reportedly placed the order for more than 11,000 cases of chicken wings and picked them up in a district cargo van. The order was billed to the school district. Employees of the food supplier, Gordon Food Services, said they knew the chicken thief \u201cdue to the massive amount of chicken wings she would purchase.\"</p><p>It is not known what happened to the extreme quantity of chicken wings after Vera hauled them home. Prosecutors noted, \u201cthe food was never brought to the school or provided to the students\u201d and that chicken wings are not ordinarily served to students, since they have bones. </p><p>The sad part of this story is Harvey School District comprises about 1,600 students, and over 80 percent qualify as low-income. But on the bright side, I bet Vera threw one hell of a Super Bowl party. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Or, it's not Kennedy freaking out about it. <a href=\"https://ca.style.yahoo.com/jordan-petersons-ottawa-event-directly-opposes-nh-ls-diversity-and-inclusion-efforts-experts-say-191156733.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWRzdGF0ZS5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFWs9wRlpr4xiNDmDr-h82PP0VeP08pnTqFI5Jd1f2MY6_m0-ab5x4ZESWqpIGa77O9dmkiuKHMYxCWf0eN7W72vnb25tyQmg6QstGYX4cnt5UJ7ju5tM5XKLQzmSLphRd2sow6VsDQxK1CvysOS9oesZwzTfaIlvoBPbw9otDMh\" target=\"_blank\">As it says in the title of his content</a>, \"experts say.\" He is only reporting what the \"experts\" say.</p><blockquote>Peterson\u2019s appearance at an arena not only housing an NHL franchise, but operated by a group with representation at the NHL\u2019s board of governors table, has raised concerns among those working to build diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in hockey.</blockquote><p>It hasn't raised concerns. Kennedy just wants those Jordan Peterson clicks. Plus <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-network-analyst-lashes-out\" target=\"_blank\">whining about one guy not wanting to wear a specific hockey jersey is so last week</a>. Woke twats have hated Jordan Peterson ever since his controversial opinion that while he is happy to call you whatever you want to be called, it is wrong for government to compel speech. </p><p>The author summarizes all the usual Peterson complaints they claim are some version of -phobic, none of which have anything to do with hockey. Then comes the \"expert\" who \"says.\" Surprise! It's a professor who has the same political opinion as the journalismer.</p><blockquote>If NHL teams are truly committed to sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion work, it seems to me that to give a platform to someone with such polarizing views of human rights and responsibilities as Jordan Peterson could be understood by many marginalized hockey fans as being in direct opposition to those DEI goals.</blockquote><p>The goal here is to get the Ottawa Senators, if not the National Hockey League itself, to be forced into denouncing Peterson. Then, if all goes to plan, the venue with cancel Peterson's show. Whether or not the Senators win their next few games or not? Meh.</p><p><p><em>The Louder with Crowder Dot Com Website is <strong>on Instagram now!</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lwcnewswire/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow us at @lwcnewswire</a> and tell a friend!</em></p></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">I EXPOSED Olivia Wilde's EGREGIOUS LIES About Jordan Peterson! | Louder With Crowder</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/U2RwDAHpYGI\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n</small>\n</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-cnn", "title": "Bill Maher's new liberal media peers are lashing out at him being allowed a show on CNN", "date_published": "2023-02-01 12:38:45+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32934429&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C22%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Hearing rumors that CNN wanted to hire a comedian to liven up the ratings was the funniest CNN thing we've heard since Brian Stelter said he likes girls. Then Bill Maher was given a show on CNN, and it stopped being funny. </p><p>Honestly? In Maher's defense, it's a pretty sweet hustle. After his show <em>Real Time</em>, he records an \"overtime\" show for YouTube. CNN is going to take it and air it on their failing news-content network. Maher does no extra work but gets an extra bag of money. Sweet deal.</p><p>The rub is that while <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-founders-slavery-christianity\" target=\"_blank\">Maher is reliably liberal</a>, he's not leftist. Maher has an occasional opinion that goes against accepted leftist thought. And since those occasional anti-leftist thoughts may now be on cable news, hardo leftists are freaking out. Like former MSNBC host Cenk Uygur, who got fired over a decade ago and still can't deal. Please note that while Cenk has a blue checkmark, it's a legacy verified account and Cenk may or may not be notable.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Bill Maher is actually perfect for CNN to be honest.

CNN is so desperate for ratings, the network will no doubt try to keep Maher on the air for the Neislen rating version of outrage clicks. But at the end of the day, Bill Maher still has an occasional opinion that is contrary to the far left and they won't let that be allowed on network TV for long.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
