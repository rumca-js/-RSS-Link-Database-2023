In order to defeat this mechanical titan, you need to wail on it with a guitar that's cobbled together from scrap metal, timing each of your attacks to the up-tempo beat of Nine Inch Nails' \"1,000,000.\" Developer Tango Gameworks is obviously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3T8Xo1E2VI&amp;ab_channel=LeTourneauTech,Newsandwhatever\">known for its whimsy</a>, but it was previously confined to a horror genre that Hi-Fi Rush most definitely does not belong to. Instead, Tango's latest is a surprisingly vibrant Saturday morning cartoon of a game, capturing the spirit and electric energy of a Dreamcast or GameCube title in the best way possible. It's tremendous in almost every respect, meshing its toe-tapping combat with genuine humor and a massive helping of both confidence and style.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At its core, Hi-Fi Rush is an interesting mix between a character-action game like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta and a rhythm game. Its melee action will feel immediately familiar to anyone who's well versed in the former, as you use your Flying V guitar to pummel enemies with combos consisting of both light and heavy attacks, juggle foes in the air, and dodge out of the way of incoming danger. The best character-action games are able to lure you into a trance-like state as you gradually become more proficient at dispatching large groups of enemies, yet Hi-Fi Rush takes it a step further by baking this rhythmic flow into its very design. You can still succeed by button-mashing your way to victory, but timing your attacks to the beat of the game's soundtrack lets you dish out increased damage and clear areas in a much more efficient manner. Enemies also attack and move on the beat, making each fight feel like an improvised dance where you're the main attraction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In order to help you find your rhythm, the whole world of Hi-Fi Rush pulsates with the beat of whatever music is currently playing, providing you with both visual and audio cues for nailing its timing. Elevators jerk up and down on the beat, computer lights blink with each snare hit, and the barriers that lock you inside combat arenas are made from equalizers that undulate along with the music. The sound of mechanical gears, steam pipes, and the thud of your own footsteps even coalesce with the soundtrack to create a harmonious noise. There are other optional visual cues you can add for extra assistance--like a metronome--but the basic timing concept remains the same throughout, even outside of its slick and satisfying combat.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review-good-vibes-only/1900-6418023/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-trading-post-introduces-a-new-way-for-players-to-buy-items/1100-6511091/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "WoW Trading Post Introduces A New Way For Players To Buy Items", "date_published": "2023-02-01 21:49:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Blizzard has introduced a new shop called the Trading Post into its MMORPG <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/\">World of Warcraft</a>.

After a short wait and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-confirms-some-reports-about-dc-studios-good-luck-figuring-out-which-ones/1100-6509855/\">lots of rumors</a>, we now know more about what to expect from the pair, who announced the studio's upcoming plans at the end of January. The team has an 8-10 year plan in place that will start with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/\">Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters</a>. The initial announcements are part of that first chapter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1620468379672002565\">various announcements</a> are in different states of pre-production, with the animated series Creature Commandos already in production and the live-action film Superman: Legacy in the process of being written by Gunn himself. In his announcement, Gunn said that he considers storytelling to be king and wants these movies and series to reflect their creators' visions.</p><p>Along with these newly announced projects, a bunch of existing ones are still on the way, including the Flash and Aquaman films. The team wants to, where possible, have the same actors play characters across live-action, games, and animation, though it sounds like he expects that this won't always be possible. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-continues-to-shoot-down-unfounded-dc-studios-rumors/1100-6510575/\">Gunn</a> also addressed Matt Reeves' second Batman movie directly; when a project doesn't fit directly into the bonds of the interconnected DC Universe, it will be labeled as a DC Elseworlds project.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Superman: Legacy</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093943-superman.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film (New)</strong></p><p>Of all the new projects announced, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-legacy-movie-announced-in-new-dc-slate/1100-6511015/\">Superman: Legacy</a> is the only one with a firm release date, which is July 11, 2025. Superman Legacy is currently being written by Gunn himself, but did not announce a director or star--while Henry Cavill previously played the character, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-was-not-fired-from-new-superman-movie-because-he-was-never-cast/1100-6511027/\">Gunn said</a> that Cavill is not the right fit for the story. This won't be an origin story, but will instead deal with Superman's legacy as both a Kryptonian and a citizen of Earth.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Authority</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093948-theauthority.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film (New)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-the-authority-movie-based-on-wildstorm-comics/1100-6511017/\">The Authority</a> is a superhero team from the Wildstorm label. While heroes like Superman and Batman let their code dictate their actions, The Authority sees the world as a broken place that must be fixed by any means necessary, leading them to do things that look more villainous than heroic--think Ra's Al Ghul's plots in various Batman stories.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Brave and The Bold</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093945-batman-brave-bold.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film (New)</strong></p><p>The Brave and The Bold is, in comics and animation, a place for Batman to cross over with other superheroes in the DC comics universe. In the DC Universe, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-announces-new-batman-movie-the-brave-and-the-bold/1100-6511018/\">The Brave and The Bold</a> will tell the story of Batman and Damien Wayne and act as an introduction to the DCU's Batman and the DCU's version of the Bat Family. This will be separate from Matt Reeves' Batman, and will feature a different actor in the role.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093946-supergirl-woman-tomorrow.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film (New)</strong></p><p>Supergirl's film will come after Superman: Legacy. Gunn describes it as more of a science-fiction film. It's based on Tom King's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-announces-supergirl-movie-based-on-critically-acclaimed-comic/1100-6511030/\">Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</a> storyline. While Superman was raised on Earth with steady influence from his parents, Supergirl grew up on a hunk of Krypton surrounded by destruction. She'll be more jaded than Superman, showing how their different backgrounds changed their outlooks. Supergirl does not yet have a director, writer, or star attached. With Gunn mentioning that the upcoming Flash film will serve as a DCU reset, it's possible that that movie's Supergirl, played by Sasha Calle, could appear here, but it seems like the reset will most likely involve a recasting as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Swamp Thing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093947-swamp-thang.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Film (New)</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/swamp-thing-movie-announced-will-be-horror-focused/1100-6511016/\">Swamp Thing</a> will be a dark horror story that investigates the origins of the Swamp Thing. Gunn describes it as being totally outside the DC Universe but says that it will still feed into the stories of the DCU. Swamp Thing was previously in two live-action movies in 1982 and 1989, with the first having been directed by horror legend Wes Craven. The character was also in two television series--a 1990 show on USA Network on cable that lasted for 72 episodes, and a live-action show from the defunct DC Universe streaming service that also spawned Doom Patrol, Titans, and Stargirl. The more recent series was produced by James Wan (Aquaman, Malignant, The Conjuring), but <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-universe-canceled-swamp-thing-remainder-of-seas/1100-6467432/\">production on the show was halted</a> before it could finish its first season.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Creature Commandos</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093954-creature-commandos-social-feature.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Animated Series (New)</strong></p><p>This animated show is already written by Gunn himself and is in production. Gunn specifically mentioned in his announcement of this title that we can look for characters to move freely between live-action and animation, with the character \"usually having the same actor play their voice as who plays them in live-action.\" <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-creature-commandos-series-with-james-gunn-writing/1100-6511023/\">Creature Commandos</a> has historically been a sort of supernatural military team, with characters that resemble <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/happy-fourth-anniversary-to-the-start-of-the-cursed-dark-universe/1100-6491792/\">classic horror characters</a> filling out the ranks. Various incarnations of the team have included vampires, werewolves, Creature From The Black Lagoon-style amphibians, a gorgon, Frankenstein's monster, and a mummy who is a communications specialist. Weasel and the father of Rick Flag, Joel Kinnaman's character in the Suicide Squad films, will be part of the team, and the image Gunn shared also featured Frankenstein, the Bride of Frankenstein, and others.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Waller</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093953-waller.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>TV series (New)</strong></p><p>Since Gunn is busy with Superman: Legacy, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peacemaker-renewed-for-season-2-as-hbo-max-wants-second-taste-of-dc-series/1100-6500768/\">Peacemaker Season 2</a> is reportedly on hold for now. Instead, Gunn says, we can look for members of Team Peacemaker in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squads-handler-amanda-waller-is-getting-her-own-tv-series/1100-6511021/\">Waller</a>, which will star Viola Davis as DC's least-good good guy, Amanda Waller. The show will pick up where Peacemaker left off, with Waller's daughter <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peacemaker-pushed-danielle-brooks-out-of-her-comfort-zone/1100-6500303/\">Leota Adebayo</a> revealing Waller and her work to the world. Behind the show are Christal Henry, who wrote on <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hbos-watchmen-review-an-incredibly-promising-start/1900-6417339/\">HBO's 2019 Watchmen show</a>, and Doom Patrol TV series creator Jeremy Carver, who will be fresh off the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-doom-patrol-and-titans-canceled-wasnt-james-gunns-decision-report/1100-6510891/\">recently-canceled series</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Booster Gold</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093950-booster-gold.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>TV series (New)</strong></p><p>Gunn describes <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-announces-booster-gold-dc-comedy-series/1100-6511025/\">Booster Gold</a> as \"imposter syndrome as a superhero.\" Booster is a \"loser from the future\" who uses tech to go back and time and become a superhero so that people will like him. Booster Gold debuted in live-action on the CW series <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-a-eulogy-for-the-best-arrowverse-show/1100-6502974/\">Legends of Tomorrow</a> for a hot second, played by Scrubs alum Donald Faison, before that show was unceremoniously canceled. Look for this show to appear on HBO Max.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lanterns</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093951-john-stewart.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>TV Series (New)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lanterns-announced-in-new-dc-slate-focused-on-hal-jordan-and-john-stewart/1100-6511019/\">Lanterns</a> will take the place of the previously planned Green Lantern show. Instead of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-casts-gay-green-lantern-alan-scott-for-hbo-max-series/1100-6492125/\">focusing on Alan Scott</a>, it will tell the story of John Stewart and Hal Jordan, the two best-known Lanterns. Gunn called this a \"terrestrial-based\" story and compared it to shows like True Detective. The Lanterns act as space cops and will investigate a mystery that ties into the larger DC Universe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093970-themyscira.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>TV Series (New)</strong></p><p>Gunn compared <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-dc-show-paradise-lost-is-game-of-thrones-with-amazons/1100-6511032/\">Paradise Lost</a> to Game of Thrones in his introduction. The series is set on Themyscira, home of Wonder Woman, and the story will be \"about the political intrigue behind a society of all women\" according to DC Studios co-president Peter Safran. The series will not involve Wonder Woman, despite it taking place on her home turf, as it is set before her birth.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shazam: Fury of the Gods</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093968-shazam2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Set to release on March 17, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-gets-first-hilarious-trailer-at-comic-con-2022/1100-6505804/\">Shazam: Fury of the Gods</a> is a direct sequel to 2019's Shazam. Billy Batson and his fellow foster kids struggle with their superhero identities when a trio of ancient gods led by Hespera (Helen Mirren) appear to reclaim the magic they say was stolen from them.</p><p>Following statements about pharmaceutical company Pfizer made by Shazam star Zachary Levi, Gunn--himself once fired over tweets--confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-reacts-to-zachary-levis-anti-pfizer-comments/1100-6511020/\">Levi's status as Shazam</a> hasn't changed as a result of the comments. \"Actors and filmmakers that I work with are going to say things that I agree with and things that I don't agree with,\" he said. \"And that's going to happen. I don't have a list of things that somebody should say because of what I think. I can't be changing my plans all the time because an actor says something that I don't agree with.\"</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Flash</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093966-3920720-flash-movie.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film</strong></p><p>While the future of The Flash in the DCU is still in the air, the upcoming Flash movie is still on the way and set to release on June 16, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcu-studios-bosses-fully-support-ezra-millers-recovery-open-to-dcu-return/1100-6511026/\">Gunn and Safran said</a> that conversations about Ezra's continued portrayal of the character haven't happened yet as actor Ezra Miller \"is completely committed to their recovery,\" following <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flashs-ezra-miller-avoids-jail-time-on-trespassing-charge/1100-6510522/\">their actions in 2022</a> and that the discussion will happen \"when the time is right.\" With that said, Gunn reportedly called the upcoming film \"probably one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.\" The Flash kicks the door open to DC's multiverse. Not only will we see Miller's Barry Allen, but both Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton will appear as their respective iterations of Batman. The movie takes inspiration from Flashpoint, in which Barry Allen travels back in time to prevent his mother's murder. In comics and animation, Reverse-Flash plays a significant role in this story, but there are no indications that that character will be present in this film. Sasha Calle will appear as Supergirl, and Michael Shannon will reportedly return as General Zod from Man of Steel.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Batman 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093969-thebatman.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film</strong></p><p>Set to debut on October 3, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-batman-2-gets-release-date-will-exist-as-dc-elseworlds-with-joker-2/1100-6511028/\">The Batman 2</a> is still happening with Matt Reeves directing and Robert Pattinson starring. This will be a separate project from the above The Brave and the Bold, which will star a different actor as the Caped Crusader. The movie, along with the sequel to Joker, will be labeled as DC Elseworlds projects, outside the series' main continuity.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093967-joker2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film</strong></p><p>Hot off the success of 2019's Joker, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joker-2-gets-first-image-shooting-has-started/1100-6509946/\">Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux</a> is in production as of December 2022.

The first film is the highest-grossing picture in the previous slate of DC films, and had already finished shooting before Gunn and Safran took over. Director James Wan has said that this film is a little more serious than the first one, and a little more relevant to the world right now.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blue Beetle</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4093972-bluebeetle.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Film</strong></p><p>Of all the DC films that preceded the changing of the guard at Warner Bros.

Set to debut alongside Superman &amp; Lois Season 4, this series focuses on an adopted son of Bruce Wayne, as well as the children of Batman villains like Harvey Dent and the Cluemaster, as they investigate Bruce's murder and try to clear the names of the falsely accused offspring.

They are more lightly armored than typical Stormtroopers, which allows for quick movements and easy maneuvering. The helmet is presented in its iconic shape from the films and, according to Hasbro, it features \"premium deco, realistic detail, movie-inspired design and electronic voice distortion so fans and collectors can have their voice sound just like a Scout Trooper.\" It also features a visor facepiece that lifts up when you need some fresh air after wearing a helmet around all day.</p><figure

Brady holds major NFL passing records in many statistical categories, including overall passing yards, total passing TDs, games started, overall record, and number of completions. He also has seven Super Bowl wins--the closest QBs are Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw with four each.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">For all the rings.<br />For all the touchdowns.<br />For all the memories.<br />Thank you for everything, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomBrady?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">@TomBrady</a>. \u2764\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/Ixy3VeymIP\">pic.twitter.com/Ixy3VeymIP</a></p>  \u2014 NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1620793865598017536?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">February 1, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Brady's return to the sport in 2022 made waves far beyond the world of football, especially after he and his wife of 13 years--world-famous model Gisele B\u00fcndchen--announced their divorce in October 2022.
