  <p id="V57uT9">Samsung announced a new batch of Galaxy S flagship phones at its Unpacked event this week, all of which are set to arrive soon. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23574119/samsung-galaxy-s23-unpacked-event-galaxy-book-3">As expected</a>, the new class to choose from this year includes the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23343147">Galaxy S23</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23343147">Galaxy S23 Plus</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23342402">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. Samsung’s trio of flagships for 2023 offer some refined designs — which look a little iPhone-like, if I’m being candid — with some camera, battery, and processor improvements over last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22955139/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-review">S22</a> generation. But which one is the right one for you?</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="Gm1UpT"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="2mKU8L">It may be a no-brainer if you don’t want a phone that’s too big (the S23 is the smallest of the three) or if you want a stylus (the S23 Ultra is your only option for S Pen use). But if you’re in the margins and need to contemplate which phone is the...</p>

  <p id="5zFdH9">Another year, another round of flagship Samsung phones. This time around, Samsung used its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23577653/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2023-news-products">Unpacked event</a> to announce a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23578596/samsung-galaxy-book-3-pro-360-ultra-14-16-inch-price">new line of Galaxy Books</a>, in addition to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23343147">Galaxy S23</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23343147">S23 Plus</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23342402">S23 Ultra</a>. The latter probably feels familiar to last year’s S22 generation, as there are once again three models to choose from: a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321978/iphone-14-pixel-6a-phone-screen-size-6-1-inches">big-ish</a> one, a bigger one, and the biggest one. That last one, the S23 Ultra, features souped-up specs, a stylus, and some big megapixel gains. However, each member of the S23 family is promising faster performance than last year’s model thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23458241/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chipset-processor-x70-5g-dynamic-spatial-audio">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processors</a>.</p>

This aggressive price cut means the A750 Limited Edition (made by Intel) is much more affordable than the average price for an RTX 3060, which Intel estimates at $391. “That’s what we see if you just take a snapshot of what’s on Newegg or Amazon, it’s around $391 on average,” says Intel fellow Tom Petersen in a press briefing with <em>T...</em></p>

  <p id="mfl3lE">An early slogan from Bumble encouraged users to “be the CEO your parents always wanted you to marry.” Since its founding in 2014, the company has billed its app as the more empowering dating service for women — one where women message matches first, and women are in control. It’s earned Bumble the moniker of “feminist Tinder.” And Bumble has been more than happy to play into that marketing.</p>
<p id="X6CdaZ">But almost a decade on, Bumble can still feel as tired and broken as other dating apps. And it often seems like that feminist twist is more marketing fodder than meaningful change to how our apps run our love lives.</p>

I’ve really been enjoying the new Rian Johnson / Natasha Lyonne show <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23558961/poker-face-peacock-review"><em>Poker Face</em></a>, with its oddball characters and unusually extended murder-of-the-week introductions. The first four episodes are already out, and two of them have a fun audio tie-in. (See, I made this relevant to the newsletter!) There’s a big plot point around a radio broadcast in one episode, and another features a true crime show called <em>Murder Girl</em>, whose host is <a href="https://twitter.com/rianjohnson/status/1619847614761172993">played by a former podcaster</a> (and <em>Verge </em>alum).

  <p id="7UlVob">Gmail’s iOS and Android apps have been updated with a new interface that makes it easier to see where your packages are in transit, and when they might arrive. The feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23437282/google-gmail-package-tracking-features">was announced last November</a>, when Google said it would be arriving “in the coming weeks,” but it’s only been spotted in the wild by the likes of <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/29/gmail-package-tracking/"><em>9to5Google</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gmail-package-tracking-live-enable/"><em>XDA-Developers</em></a><em> </em>over the past couple of days.

<p id="etATCE">The feature is currently opt-in, making it easy to miss it if you don’t know where to look.

(Google has used LaMDA in the past to power similar chatbot demos at I/O, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto">its conversation with Pluto</a>.)</p>
