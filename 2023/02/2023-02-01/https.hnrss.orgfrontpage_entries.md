## Ask HN: Does the HN commentariat have a reductive view of what a human being is?

<p>I've been very struck during most of the AI discussions recently how little weight comments seem give to the subtlety and rich contextual knowledge that humans bring to even quite simple activities.<p>I know we often over-estimate the value of our contributions. I know we often find that our functions can ultimately be automated in some respect. But I find in aggregate that the leading comments reflect a very arid conception of being a human connected to other humans.<p>For example in the discussion about AI Lawyers very little sense of the moral aspect of another human acting on behalf of a human client. In the discussions about the replacement of programming jobs by this kind of technology, not a great deal of confidence in the importance of human judgement in building human-focused systems.<p>Is this just reflective of our context as people that streamline and automate, or do HN readers just think a human isn't such a complex entity?<p>For me this is somewhat like the T-Shirt that says "I went outside once, but the graphics were crap"...except nobody's joking.</p>

## YC is hiring a product engineer to work on co-founder matching (SF/remote, US)
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34613508](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34613508)

<p>About two years ago, YC launched a site to help people find co-founders.  We heard from a lot of people that the biggest thing holding them back from starting a company was that they didn't want to do it alone and didn't have any friends who wanted to do it with them.<p>So we built a site that's similar to a dating site but for co-founders, and launched it on HN: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298</a>.<p>Like any new product, we weren't sure how well this would work.  Other people had tried this idea before, and none of them had really taken off.  But we thought YC had some unique advantages in doing it.<p>Fast forward to now, and frankly it's worked better than we dared hope.  In the first two years, YC has invested in dozens of companies that came from people meeting each other on the site.  We wrote about three of the early successes here: <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/does-co-founder-matching-work" rel="nofollow">https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/does-co-founder-matching-wo...</a>.  We believe that in the long term, this could be how hundreds or even thousands of successful startups get started.<p>Right now, only two engineers are working on this which is a bit crazy, so we'd like to hire someone else to help us move faster.  We use Rails and React, but you don't have to have worked with Rails before as long as you have full stack web experience.<p>The majority of the team is in the SF Bay Area where the YC program runs.  You don't have to be in SF but unfortunately we can only hire people in the US at the moment.<p>YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC's portfolio.<p>The most unique benefit though, is that as part of the YC software team, you basically get full access to the YC program, founders, and partners - from our bi-annual batch retreats in Sonoma to our weekly meetups in SF.  You'll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you'll get to know hundreds of startup founders.  If you think you might want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping-off point.<p>If you’d like to work with us, there’s a formal job description here where you can apply (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=3d64f000-8d84-434c-87a0-62f4ccff9aae" rel="nofollow">https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=3d64f000-8d84-...</a>) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com. We’d love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Hello HN,<p>I've created a new Sudoku app for iOS and Android that prioritizes simplicity and privacy. It's free to download and use, and I'd be grateful for any feedback or suggestions.<p>Features:<p>> 4 difficulty levels, accessible at any time<p>> No personal data collection of any kind<p>> Clean, minimalistic design that focuses on the game<p>> Takes up significantly less space than other popular apps (by a factor of about 10x)<p>> Minimal use of advertisements<p>I was frustrated by how many of the popular Sudoku apps feel excessively over-engineered, consume a lot of storage space and some that even collect unnecessary personal information, like location and contacts. So I put this app together without any of those things (using flutter).<p>Links:<p>iOS: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sudoku-puzzle-palace/id1668683822" rel="nofollow">https://apps.apple.com/app/sudoku-puzzle-palace/id1668683822</a><p>android: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kingfishertech.sudoku">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kingfisher...</a><p>Here's a screenshot of the main app page: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FbCf2IJ" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/FbCf2IJ</a><p>Thanks for taking a look and happy solving!</p>

## Show HN: We built a developer-first open-source Zapier alternative

<p>For the past few months we’ve been building Trigger.dev and can now share our beta with you: <a href="https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev">https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev</a>. Trigger.dev is an open source platform that makes it easy for developers to create event-driven background tasks directly in their code. You write workflows using our SDK, and can view all the runs in our web app.<p>Why we built this:<p>- We found current workflow / automation tools like Zapier and n8n are good for simple tasks, but not for more advanced use cases.<p>- Dropping down into code in these tools is just not a great experience. We prefer using our own IDEs, version control, and having access to GitHub Copilot etc.<p>- Sometimes, a workflow requires us to query a database or handle some sensitive information. It would be great if this data wasn’t sent to a third party.<p>Our beta version lets you:<p>- Trigger workflows from webhooks, custom events or schedules (CRON)<p>- Use API integrations with Slack, GitHub, Shopify and Resend. We’re adding more of these each week.<p>- Add delays of up to 1 year. Workflows will resume where they left off, even if your server has gone down.<p>- Support for Fetch and subscribing to generic webhooks.<p>- Observe every workflow run in the app (great for debugging).<p>- Open source MIT license so anyone can self-host the platform.<p>We’re still early so would love your feedback and opinions. Feel free to try us out for free – and if you want a specific API integrated, just let us know.<p>Main website: <a href="https://trigger.dev">https://trigger.dev</a>

## Ask HN: Reject/ghost on all job applications with 8 YoE, what am I doing wrong?

<p>Hi HN,<p>I know this isn't the forum for this kinda question but I've been an avid reader and commenter here for 10+ years and I feel I align pretty well with the demographic. Which is why I'm asking for help.<p>Recently I've been applying to remote jobs, but literally all of my applications have been rejected or ghosted. It's so much different than when I was looking a couple years ago. I'm in my mid-20s, with 7-8 years of professional experience and have been programming since I was a kid. I have FAANG names on my resume, jobs and internships (when I was a student). I consider myself a reasonably good engineer - I don't think I'm hot shit, but I would've expected to get to the first screening at least somewhere.<p>Has the landscape changed so much in the past few years? Or, if I'm doing something wrong and raising a huge red flag to everyone, how the hell do I figure out what it is? Getting kinda jumpy about my prospects, it's been disheartening.</p>

## Show HN: GPTMinus1 – Fool OpenAIs AI Detector by Randomly Replacing Words

<p>This is a joke before anyone gets too worked up. The algo is a simple one which goes and replaces random words with their synonyms.<p>It will obviously beat these AI detectors but the output isn't probably what you would want.<p>The point stands though that more sophisticated approaches that rephrase or mix up the word distribution will be able to throw off the detector and it should not be relied on exclusively for, say, checking if a student assignment is AI generated.</p>

## Ask HN: Are ChatGPT answers getting worse for anyone else?

<p>In the past few weeks, I've noted a decline in my desire to use ChatGPT, because it feels like the answers are slowly getting lazier and lazier. I used to be able to ask pointed questions about "how do I use X tool to perform Y job". It's crossed a threshold where if I turn around and google the same thing I'm getting the right answer. Maybe my questions are degrading in quality in some subtle way I can't detect, or maybe I'm asking the wrong questions. I can't help but wonder why it went from great to meh.</p>

## Show HN: KnifeGeek – Online Database of Pocket Knives

<p>Hey HN! About a year ago i stumbled upon the world of swords, knives, and EDC gear. A weirdly addicting (and expensive) hobby to have.<p>Back then i noticed something, it was quite tedious to easily sift and search through knives based on length, steel, brand, and what not to find the knife for me. There were some great youtube channels that helped me pick out what i wanted however i had to sit through multiple 30 minute videos just to review 10-15 knives or so each.<p>Recently i've been having a little trouble sleeping so i decided to pickup a new passion project to work on late at night, here's KnifeGeek!<p>it's a completely free website where you can search, filter, and sift through an extensive knife database (over 60K+ knives) and add them to your collection or wishlist. You do need to sign in to add stuff to your wishlist or collection and after a bunch of advanced searches.<p>Please check it out and let me know if you think anything is missing! I'll try to flesh it out more on a daily basis if people find it cool or useful.<p>Planning to add in price comparison functionality and more data per knife in the next week.<p>PS: Images are a little shoddy, working on that.</p>
