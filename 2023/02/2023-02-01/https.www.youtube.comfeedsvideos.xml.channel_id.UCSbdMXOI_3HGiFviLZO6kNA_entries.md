Well, Here's this video. A little different from my normal content but i found this to be something extremely important. Meta and Ready at Dawn announced that they will be completely shutting down one of the most popular VR games ever made; also one of the best VR games ever made.. Echo VR. WHAT!? It actually makes no sense.. but i think I know exactly why. Gamers, lets rise up. We CAN'T let Meta get away with this. This is ridiculous. 

Not that this will do anything.. but here's a change petition:
