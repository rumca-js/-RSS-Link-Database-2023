<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT&rsquo;s AI chatbot is so good, too many people are using it, crushing its servers. So the company is debuting a paid ChatGPT Plus service, which will launch in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>ChatGPT will cost $20 per month, but don&rsquo;t despair. OpenAI says that it still plans to offer a free version of ChatGPT as well.</p>



<p>If <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">you&rsquo;ve used ChatGPT before</a>, you know how crazy powerful the chatbot can be. ChatGPT can write code, poetry, and short stories alike, and construct philosophical as well as logical arguments. It&rsquo;s so powerful, in fact, that students have begun using it for their assignments, prompting a debate about whether it should be considered an assistive tool, like a calculator, or an actual cheat. (A tool <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499149/chatgpts-creator-releases-tool-for-detecting-ai-text-and-it-stinks.html">OpenAI developed to identify AI-generated text</a> has some problems.) </p>



<p>The problem is that all of the demand for ChatGPT has made it increasingly difficult to access. The site frequently generates error messages reporting that the site is too congested to use. Even when ChatGPT is accessible, it can be slow to respond or generate responses. OpenAI said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/&amp;xcust=2-1-1500290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> that ChatGPT Plus will feature general access to ChatGPT, even during peak times, as well as faster response times. OpenAI said that it will use the paid access to test out new services, too.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, ChatGPT users have helped train the AI further.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We launched ChatGPT as a research preview so we could learn more about the system&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and gather user feedback to help us improve upon its limitations. Since then, millions of people have given us feedback, we&rsquo;ve made several&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes&amp;xcust=2-1-1500290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">important updates</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ve seen users find value across a range of professional use-cases, including drafting &amp; editing content, brainstorming ideas, programming help, and learning new&nbsp;topics.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT,&rdquo; OpenAI added.</p>



<p>If you want to sign up for ChatGPT Plus, you&rsquo;ll (somewhat ironically) need to sign up for a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScee6ST3o-kZDjlw1ROfUNyjuRBwGdcoewxjCULNejbP5hdzQ/viewform&amp;xcust=2-1-1500290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">waitlist</a> &mdash; which, for now, is just a Google Form that you can &ldquo;apply&rdquo; to by listing where you&rsquo;re located, what you&rsquo;re using ChatGPT for, and so on. OpenAI hasn&rsquo;t said when it will turn ChatGPT Plus on, though, or how many users it will let in. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been waiting, possibly even patiently, for AMD to tell you when you can get your hands on its latest gaming-focused CPUs with V-cache. Well wait no more: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mobile.twitter.com/AMDRyzen/status/1620832720677998593&amp;xcust=2-1-1500093-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to an official tweet</a>, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and Ryzen 9 7900X3D will arrive before the end of the month, with the Ryzen 7 7800X3D following in April. If you want any of them, you might want to start pinching your pennies now. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the full release and pricing breakdown: </p>



<p><strong>Ryzen 9 7950X3D &ndash; $699, February 28</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ryzen 9 7900X3D &ndash; $599, February 28</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ryzen 7 7800X3D &ndash; $449, April 6</strong></p>



<p>All three are next-gen successors to the well-received <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a>, which dominated in its pricing category and won the hearts of PC gamers. The new chips, in 16-, 12-, and 8-core varieties, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444835/amd-launches-fastest-gaming-processors-with-even-more-v-cache.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">have shown to be incredibly powerful,</a> beating out the comparable Intel chips for single-thread tasks and even some multi-core benchmarks. AMD calls them &ldquo;the fastest gaming processors in the world,&rdquo; and at the moment, no one can say they&rsquo;re wrong. </p>



<p>The pricing of these chips is interesting. The 7950X3D is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">same price as the Ryzen 9 7950X</a>, without its performance-boosting V-cache feature, and the other two chips are only $50 more expensive than their non-gaming counterparts. It&rsquo;s possible that we might see price drops for these slightly older Ryzen 7000-series chips, officially or not. Then again, you never know&mdash;the entire industry seems to be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499957/amd-is-undershipping-chips-to-keep-cpu-gpu-prices-elevated.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">holding back on production to keep supplies low and prices high</a> while the PC market suffers a serious lull. </p>

## Samsung Flow for Galaxy devices is like Appleâ€™s Universal Control, but better

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>With the launch of the Galaxy S23 smartphones, the Galaxy Book3 laptops, and its existing Galaxy Tab tablets, Samsung is showing off a nifty trick, combining all three into a unified system that you can control or copy from a single mouse.</p>



<p>It may not sound like much, but mousing from a tablet to a PC to a phone is something to see. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/611366/universal-control-sidecar-explained-mac-ipad.html">like Apple&rsquo;s Universal Control</a>, but Samsung&rsquo;s implementation is much more versatile.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s another twist on the old problem. What&rsquo;s the best way to move data from device to device? PCs have USB keys and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">removeable storage</a> for just this reason. But phones don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s one of the ways that Samsung is trying to convince you to buy a phone, laptop, and tablet, all with the company&rsquo;s brand.</p>



<p>One of the things worth watching out for is how individual device makers sometimes strike gold with software and services. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/836229/samsungs-quick-search-outdoes-windows-own.html">Samsung&rsquo;s Quick Search app</a> blows away the built-in search within Windows. Lenovo&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398873/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-7th-gen-review-the-4k-display-is-a-splendid-liability.html">Vantage app sets the high-water mark as a management utility</a>. And <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407780/dell-mobile-connect-app-mirrors-your-smartphone-on-your-pc.html">Dell&rsquo;s Mobile Connect app</a> kicked off the ability to connect phones and PCs in 2018, long before the Windows Phone Link feature appeared. The point? All three justify buying the manufacturer&rsquo;s hardware, by selling software.</p>



<p>Add Samsung Flow to that list. Samsung&rsquo;s Flow is an existing app within the Galaxy ecosystem, but the company is enhancing it with the release of the new Galaxy S23 series. Flow already allows you to transfer data between the Tab tablet and the Galaxy Book series. The latest version allows you to mouse between all three devices (phone, tablet and laptop) and transfer data. That sounds simple enough, but we think you&rsquo;ll see the potential: With the phone and tablet within view, you can control them with the new Galaxy Book3 laptops, as well as quickly grab a photo or a document that you had previously saved to your phone and move it to another device.</p>


<div class="jwplayer" id="id63dab1d76e7e7"></div>


<p>If that&rsquo;s not good enough for you, you can access your <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">phone&rsquo;s apps directly from your Windows PC via Phone Link</a>, but only through most Samsung Galaxy phones, the Surface Duo, and select devices made by Honor. It&rsquo;s a select partnership between Microsoft and Samsung that&rsquo;s never been fully explained, though Samsung&rsquo;s self-positioning as the &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; of Android devices may have something to do with it. You can still pull photos from your Android phone and author texts, but the experience has been optimized for Galaxy phones.</p>



<p>There are certainly other ways to do this: save documents to the cloud and then download them on another device, email them to yourself, and so on. But being able to simply mouse across devices is like a cross-device version of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407999/hands-on-how-one-mouse-can-control-multiple-pcs-with-microsofts-mouse-without-borders-app.html">Mouse without Borders</a>, a fascinating free app for Windows PCs that does the same thing. </p>

<p>Samsung is launching the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra beginning today, a 6.8-inch phone which will be available in Phantom Black, Green, Cream and Lavender for $1,199. The Galaxy S23+, with a 6.6-inch display, will be priced at $999. Finally, the S23, a 6.1-inch phone for $799.99 will also go on sales. You can preorder all three phones today, with shipments and in-store purchases beginning on Feb. 17.</p>

## Samsung reveals Galaxy Book3 laptops: OLED beauty meets content-creator beast

<p>Samsung&rsquo;s new Galaxy Book3 Ultra is the most powerful laptop Samsung has ever unveiled, and addresses a content-creation market that the company hasn&rsquo;t broached before. But here&rsquo;s the really interesting news: You&rsquo;ll find one of the Ultra&rsquo;s most attractive features&mdash;a stunning 3K, 120Hz, OLED display&mdash;on both the cheaper Galaxy Book3 Pro and Galaxy Book3 Pro 360.</p>



<p>For years, Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book laptops have typically been synonymous with three words: thin, light, and OLED. But with more and more <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448388/10-best-laptops-from-ces-2023.html">manufacturers deploying OLED screens in their laptops</a>, Samsung is now leaning harder into its own OLED bona fides and thus we have the Galaxy Book3 Ultra, Pro, and 360 laptops. All feature a &ldquo;3K&rdquo; OLED display, along with upgrades both in picture quality <em>and</em> performance.  </p>



<p>We had a chance to go hands-on with all three machines in advance of their launch and our first impressions are that they live up to the hype.</p>



<p>Samsung will ship the 16-inch Galaxy Book3 Ultra for between $2,199 and $2,799 on Feb. 24. The 16-inch Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 goes for $1,899 and ships on Feb. 17. Samsung&rsquo;s most affordable versions will be 14- and 16-inch Galaxy Book3 Pro models, selling for $1,299 and $1,399 on Feb. 17. All of the new Book3s laptops earn Intel&rsquo;s Evo premium notebook badge in case you&rsquo;re wondering.</p>



<h2 id="beautiful-oleds-top-to-bottom">Beautiful OLEDs, top to bottom</h2>



<p>While the Galaxy Book3 Ultra stands out as the flagship of the group, it&rsquo;s Samsung&rsquo;s beautiful new OLED display that really sells all three laptops. OLED displays trump more pedestrian LCD displays by offering richer, more spectacular colors, along with absolute blacks that appear, well, absolutely black. But Samsung&rsquo;s new display tech goes beyond what you may already know about OLED laptop screens.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 OLED" class="wp-image-1488103" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OLED-shot-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>It&rsquo;s difficult to capture with a conventional camera, but LCDs feature a backlight halo effect, while OLEDs do not.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The tech that Samsung calls Dynamic AMOLED 2X supports 120 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and the color response is visually striking. But that&rsquo;s not all: The new AMOLED 2X panels can filter out almost all of the blue light they produce, with no apparent loss of color fidelity, Samsung says. The display is also VESA ClearMR and DisplayHDR TRUE BLACK 500 certified and has received SGS Eye Care Display certification for the guaranteed reduction of blue light. But that&rsquo;s all spec talk. What you need to know is the new OLED display is simply gorgeous <em>and </em>should be easier on your eyes.</p>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s new OLED runs at up to 120Hz, a performance improvement that will deliver smoother inking and mousing, and allow for high frames-per-second gaming on the Galaxy Book3 Ultra (which boasts the most powerful GPU of the lineup). The new Galaxy Book3 family display is rated for 500 nits of output using HDR, 400 nits without.</p>



<p>The new OLED display employs an odd 16:10 display ratio of 2880&times;1800 pixels. This provides an upgrade past a 1440p display without quite touching the 3840&times;2160 resolution that characterizes a 4K display. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617498/samsung-readies-its-next-wave-of-gorgeous-oled-notebooks-the-galaxy-book2.html">Galaxy Book2 Pro series</a> features 1080p, 60Hz panels. Thus the jump to the Book3 is a significant upgrade just on basic display specs alone.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro blue light" class="wp-image-1488118" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blue-light-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Samsung used a camera sensitive to blue light to capture the amount of blue light given off by an LCD (left), versus its latest AMOLED 2X technology (right).</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Books have always been a pleasure to view content on thanks to their gorgeous OLED screens. This holds true for the newest models and the wow-factor of Samsung&rsquo;s OLEDs is stronger than ever. In one tech demo designed to prove the superiority of its new display tech, Samsung demonstrated how the single backlight used in an LCD screen imbues even dark scenes with a &ldquo;halo&rdquo; effect, with a soft glow all around the image. That was contrasted with the pristine, unsullied blackness of its own OLED&mdash;a big benefit for video editors.</p>



<p>And for those who are sensitive to blue light, the new Galaxy Book might mean users can work longer hours without triggering a migraine. That could be a real plus for creators as well as anyone who uses her laptop for basic productivity work.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra-designed-for-creators">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra, designed for creators</h2>



<p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book Ultra contradicts some of what makes a Galaxy Book a Galaxy Book because at 16.5 mm thick, it&rsquo;s got the girth of a more traditional laptop. It&rsquo;s the hefty weight, though&mdash;3.9 pounds&mdash;that feels like the &ldquo;creator-class&rdquo; notebook that it really is. You&rsquo;ll be able to drop it in a laptop bag or backpack, but the weight feels noticeable in the hand. Mind you, it&rsquo;s not chunky like a gaming laptop. It&rsquo;s just a bit thicker than most laptops and noticeably thicker than the other Galaxy Book3 models.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra" class="wp-image-1488097" height="932" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Book3-Ultra-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra, with its massive touchscreen.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Book3 Ultra not only includes the option of either a 13th-gen Core i7 or i9, but more importantly, you can choose between an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 or 4070 laptop GPU. While those are on the low end of the new GeForce <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">RTX 4-series mobile GPUs that Nvidia launched at CES</a>, the company does claim they&rsquo;ll deliver better performance than the current GeForce 3080 mobile GPUs (though we don&rsquo;t know if that factors in Nvidia&rsquo;s frame-rate-easing DLSS 3 technology).</p>



<p>The Book3 Ultra memory options include 16GB or 32GB of LPDDR5, and you can choose between 512GB or 1TB of PCIe storage. Samsung says there&rsquo;s an additional expansion slot for an additional SSD.</p>



<p>The large, wide screen accommodates an extra island of number keys to the far right. But the display body itself is still thin, which has traditionally meant that Samsung has foregone the use of a Windows Hello depth camera in favor of an embedded fingerprint reader. Sadly, that&rsquo;s still the case. Samsung&rsquo;s keyboards have always deftly walked the line between being shallow while still providing a comfortable typing experience, and a few experimental phrases in Notepad confirmed they&rsquo;re still surprisingly usable.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra right side" class="wp-image-1488099" height="761" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Book3-ultra-right-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Book 3 Ulrtra is thick for a Galalxy Book, with some thermal venting that peeps out from underneath.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>One key difference between the Galaxy Book3 Ultra and the rest of the Galaxy Book3 lineup is in the Ultra&rsquo;s dedicated HDMI 2.0 port, which supports enough bandwidth to display 4K video and 60 frames per second on an external display. Both the Galaxy Book 3 Pro and Pro 360 include an HDMI 1.4 port, which supports 4K video at 24 frames per second on an external display. So this is yet more evidence that the Book3 Ultra is designed for content creation, and the Book3 Pro and Pro 360 are destined for simpler tasks. Regardless, there&rsquo;s a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports on all three Book3 models.</p>



<p>Finally, I have to call out Samsung&rsquo;s absolutely massive touchpad. It might not have been totally clickable all the way to the top in my brief hands-on, but make no mistake: It&rsquo;s enormous.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-doesnt-skimp-on-the-book3-pro-and-pro-360">Samsung doesn&rsquo;t skimp on the Book3 Pro and Pro 360</h2>



<p>The Galaxy Book3 Pro and Pro 360 are Samsung&rsquo;s more traditional laptops and let&rsquo;s face it, these are the models most people will buy. </p>



<p>A massive difference in price&mdash;$1,399 for the 16-inch Pro versus at least $2,199 for the Book3 Ultra&mdash;makes the Pro an attractive choice by comparison. The Pro&rsquo;s small $100 pricing delta between its two options, the 14- and the 16-inch, is also intriguing. The Pro 360, by contrast, offers three things that the other Galaxy Book3 models do not: a 360-degree convertible form factor, an integrated S Pen inside the box, and optional 5G capability for on-the-go connectivity.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro left side" class="wp-image-1488105" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Book3-Pro-left-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  Galaxy Book3 Pro and its two Thunderbolt 4 ports, next to a new Galaxy S23 phone. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Otherwise, the Galaxy Book3 Pro and Pro 360 are remarkably similar to their gaudier cousin, the Ultra. For one, they offer identical display tech, only differing in size. (The Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 is offered in just a single 16-inch configuration.) You can also get the Pro and Pro 360 in the same memory and storage amounts as the Ultra, <em>along with</em> a smaller 8GB RAM/256GB SSD option that helps keep pricing more affordable. Samsung also offers an identical port configuration, with two Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI port option.</p>



<p>On paper, the two Pro models also differ very little in their starting price. They do differ fairly substantially in their weight, however. The 16-inch weighs almost a pound more than the 14-inch, a svelte 2.42 pounds.</p>



<p>The Pro and Pro 360 models are offered in both Graphite and Beige while the Ultra ships only in the Graphite color scheme.</p>



<p>The Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 ships the S Pen in-box, though it must be stored separately rather than in a holster. We didn&rsquo;t have much time to test it, but we confirmed that the pen inks as expected. Unfortunately, we weren&rsquo;t able to test for ink judder.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470576/1470576.html">PC industry flounders</a>, Intel suffered from such disastrous sales last quarter that it instituted <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/intel-cuts-pay-across-company-to-preserve-cash-for-investment&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pay cuts and other extreme measures</a> going forward. AMD&rsquo;s client PC sales also dropped dramatically&mdash;a whopping 51 percent year-over-year&mdash;but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren&rsquo;t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been &ldquo;undershipping&rdquo; chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).</p>



<p>&ldquo;We have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,&rdquo; Su <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574091-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-undershipping-chips-to-help-prop-prices-up/&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. &ldquo;We undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.&rdquo;</p>



<p>With the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It&rsquo;s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/15/ethereum-miners-are-quickly-dying-less-than-24-hours-after-the-merge/&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GPU mining is dead</a>, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.</p>



<p>Despite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for <em>very </em>high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.</p>

<p>AMD isn&rsquo;t the only one doing it, either.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we&rsquo;re seeing,&rdquo; Nvidia CFO Colette Kress <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561493-nvidia-corporation-nvda-credit-suisse-26th-annual-technology-conference-transcript&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said to investors</a> in November. &ldquo;So we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Since then, Nvidia has released the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">$1,200 GeForce RTX 4080</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">$800 RTX 4070 Ti</a>, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">AMD&rsquo;s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT</a> offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.</p>



<p>Overall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&amp;D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD&rsquo;s market tricks helped it achieve a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1115/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-financial&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter</a>, while <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/intels-horrible-quarter-inventory-glut-and-underused-factories.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1499957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Intel forecasted</a> a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).</p>

<p>This all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven&rsquo;t plummeted, even as deals on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813362/best-pc-computer-deals.html">desktops</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/550968/best-laptop-deals-3.html">laptops</a> have started ramping up. We expect&mdash;hope?&mdash;that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel&rsquo;s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html">Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250</a>, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.</p>

<p>Discord has become <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/540080/how-to-use-discord-a-beginners-guide.html"><em>the </em>go-to chat and calling app for PC gamers</a> over the last few years. If you&rsquo;re playing multiplayer games with your buds, you probably have it installed on your PC, and many people have it configured to start when their computer boots. That&rsquo;s why its latest bug is irksome: A recent Discord update is making <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">Nvidia GeForce graphics cards</a> run slower. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a workaround available.</p>



<p>&ldquo;After a recent update to the Discord app, users may notice that the graphics card memory clocks will not reach full speeds when launching a game,&rdquo; Nvidia said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5443/?s=31&amp;xcust=2-1-1499845-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">new support page</a>. Reddit users <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/10pgs70/discord_drops_memory_clock_by_200_mhz_on_nvidia/&amp;xcust=2-1-1499845-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">report</a> the memory clocks drop by 200MHz with Discord open, which shouldn&rsquo;t practically affect gaming performance much, but is nonetheless clearly not ideal.</p>



<p>Since Nvidia didn&rsquo;t mention specifically affected models, we assume that <em>all</em> GeForce graphics cards could be affected. The company is working on rolling out a proper fix to all users at a later date, but if you want to stop the memory nerf <em>right </em>now, Nvidia explained how to do so. It&rsquo;s complicated, but also fairly simple. Here are the steps, quoted verbatim from Nvidia&rsquo;s support page:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://international.download.nvidia.com/Windows/Geforce3DProfileManager/v1/Geforce_3D_Profile_Manager.v1.exe&amp;xcust=2-1-1499845-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Click here</a>&nbsp;to download the NVIDIA program G<strong>eForce 3D Profile Manager.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Open the&nbsp;<strong>GeForce 3D Profile Manager.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the button&nbsp;<strong>Export SLI Profiles</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>A file explorer window will pop up.&nbsp;Select a location to export and save the NVIDIA Profiles text file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Open the text file saved in step 4 using Notepad (or any program that does not automatically apply formatting).&nbsp;</li><li>Perform a search for the section &ldquo;Discord&rdquo;.&nbsp;Add a new line and type the following text as shown in the screenshot below:&nbsp;Setting ID_0x50166c5e = 0x00000000&nbsp;</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Fix Discord Nvidia memory clock nerf" class="wp-image-1499856" height="620" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nvidia-discord-text-string.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<ul><li>Save the edited NVIDIA Profiles as a txt file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Go back to the&nbsp;<strong>GeForce 3D Profile Manager</strong>&nbsp;and click on the&nbsp;<strong>Import SLI Profiles</strong>&nbsp;button.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A file explorer window will appear. Select the updated &ldquo;NVIDIA Profiles.txt&rdquo; file and then click on the&nbsp;<strong>Open</strong>&nbsp;button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Once completed, you may close the&nbsp;<strong>GeForce 3D Profile Manager</strong>&nbsp;application.</li></ul>



<p>After that, you can go back to running Discord without worrying about whether it&rsquo;s holding your Nvidia graphics card back. Happy gaming!</p>

<p>Your computer&rsquo;s storage is something you don&rsquo;t often think about. It&rsquo;s in there, somewhere, nebulously holding on to more bits of data than your brain could handle in a dozen lifetimes. And it&rsquo;s either working or it isn&rsquo;t &mdash; it&rsquo;s not as if it needs constant performance tuning, like, say, GPU drivers. But the latest firmware update for the Samsung&rsquo;s popular family of solid-state drives is, indeed, vital, especially if you have one particular high-end model. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pugetsystems.com/support/guides/critical-samsung-ssd-firmware-update/&amp;xcust=2-1-1499822-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Puget Systems</a>, the 2TB version of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393496/samsung-980-pro-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Samsung 980 Pro drive</a> &mdash; a favorite among performance enthusiasts, and a PCWorld Editor&rsquo;s Choice &mdash; is suffering from an issue that suddenly locks the drive into read-only mode. If it happens to be the only drive in your system, or the one holding your OS, your computer is (in technical terms) screwed. At that point the only fix is a complete reinstallation, at which time the underlying error still hasn&rsquo;t been addressed. </p>



<p>Fortunately the latest firmware update for the drive fixes the issue. While other Samsung drives (even different capacities of the 980 Pro) don&rsquo;t seem to be affected, it might be a good idea to update to the latest firmware anyway. Updated SSD firmware can be found <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/support/tools/&amp;xcust=2-1-1499822-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the Samsung Magician program</a>, and quickly applied with a download and system reboot. </p>

## Intel slashes Arc A750 to $249, touts substantial gaming improvements

<p>It&rsquo;s a hard time to be a PC gamer on a budget. If you&rsquo;ve only got $250 to spend on a new graphics card, your only real option has been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html">AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6600</a>, as prices for GeForce GPUs remain painfully high. No more. Intel is dropping the price of its Arc A750 Limited Edition graphics card to $249 today, a $40 reduction, and making noise about the significant performance and stability increases its debut GPUs have enjoyed since their October launch.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a regular PCWorld reader, that shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise. Intel&rsquo;s first consumer GPUs launched with bugs and rough edges galore, so we&rsquo;ve been periodically <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424865/intel-arc-driver-performance-a-month-checkup.html">reevaluating Arc&rsquo;s performance</a> in a monthly video series. Intel&rsquo;s drivers are already much more stable than before, and the company recently released new drivers that <em>dramatically</em> improve the raw speed and overall smoothness in DirectX 9 games like <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive </em>and <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&ldquo;Across low- and high-end graphics settings, we&rsquo;re seeing a 2x increase in frame rates,&rdquo; we said after testing a handful of titles. Intel says DX9 games now run an average of 43 percent faster than on Arc&rsquo;s launch driver, and 60 percent smoother. Yes, please.</p>



<p>The focus hasn&rsquo;t all been on older games though. Coinciding with today&rsquo;s Arc A750 price drop, Intel is launching another new driver with improvements across a variety of DirectX 11 and 12 games, including a massive 57 percent uplift in <em>Warframe</em> (DX11) performance. That&rsquo;s vital; our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Arc A770 and A750 review</a> showed Intel&rsquo;s GPU often <em>besting</em> Nvidia&rsquo;s popular RTX 3060 in ray tracing and DX12 games, but optimizing DX11 titles requires a lot more work from the GPU drivers, and Arc can suffer hard there. Intel hasn&rsquo;t been shy about saying this will require long-term focus from the team, and they&rsquo;re clearly putting that work in.</p>



<p>Intel has pushed out eight &ldquo;Game On&rdquo; drivers since launch, with optimizations for 21 games, and 35 titles have pledged support for XeSS&mdash;Intel&rsquo;s DLSS rival.</p>



<p>Speaking of Nvidia and the RTX 3060, it&rsquo;s still selling for wildly inflated pricing on the streets, and Intel is seizing onto that fact to drive home the value of the newly $249 Arc A750, as per the complex, but striking chart below. It shows the average 1080p frames per second <em>per dollar</em> for the A750, normalized to the RTX 3060&rsquo;s average FPS per dollar as the baseline in each game. So in games where the blue bars are higher than the green bar, the Arc A750 is a better value per dollar (and vice-versa).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="arc a750 value vs rtx 3060" class="wp-image-1499124" height="673" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Arc-a750-fps-per-dollar-vs-rtx-3060.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Right-click and open this image in a new tab to see it full-sized.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>This is <em>not</em> a chart showing overall performance, just value, and the RTX 3060&rsquo;s roughly $380 average street price hurts it deeply here. When you&rsquo;re looking at raw frame rates alone, without considering the value prospect, our testing showed the Arc A750 sometimes winning big against Nvidia, and sometimes losing big, depending on the DirectX version and game engine used. As with many things Arc, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>



<h2 id="intel-arc-a750-vs-amd-radeon-rx-6600">Intel Arc A750 vs. AMD Radeon RX 6600</h2>



<p>Ignore the highly priced RTX 3060 though. For gamers, the bottom line here is that the Arc A750 is now $249, and Intel&rsquo;s drivers and stability have been rapidly improving. After years of wandering the GPU wasteland, we now have <em>two</em> graphics cards available new for $250 or less. So should you buy the Intel Arc A750 or AMD&rsquo;s rival Radeon RX 6600?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d still recommend the Radeon GPU for most people. While many new triple-A games run on DirectX 12, most PC games still run DX11, and AMD&rsquo;s DX11 support <em>just works </em>at full speed. The Radeon RX 6600 also runs well in any computer, while the Arc A750 needs a fairly modern system with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html">PCIe Resizable Bar active</a> or its frame rates <em>plummet</em>.</p>



<p>That said, now that Intel upped DX9 performance so heavily and put intense effort into driver stability, the Arc A750 seems fairly compelling, especially for under $250. Its DX12 and ray tracing performance blows past even the much more expensive RTX 3060 in many games, and now, its handling of games running older DirectX versions is much better than before. Even if the Arc A750 can&rsquo;t match the Radeon RX 6600 in raw DX11 performance, it still delivers a wholly playable experience there, and all the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html#toc-2">specific driver bugs</a> mentioned in my Intel Arc launch review have been fixed.</p>



<p>If you tend to play new, big budget blockbuster games or want to poke around with ray tracing without breaking the bank, the newly $249 Intel Arc A750 may very well be worth considering. Mainstream gamers have actual options now! Yay competition.</p>

<p>After a long build up, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1484183/microsoft-directstorage-tech-finally-arrives-on-pc-forspoken-load-times.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s much-awaited DirectStorage technology</a> has finally arrived on PCs, promising blink-and-you&rsquo;ll-miss-it loading times&mdash;and our early test results in <em>Forspoken</em>, the first DirectStorage game, say it may finally be time to start waving bye bye to SATA SSDs.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-microsoft-directstorage">What is Microsoft DirectStorage?</h2>



<p>DirectStorage&rsquo;s most touted feature is moving the job of decompressing game assets (such as textures and models) from the CPU to the GPU. This frees up CPU resources and greatly speeds up the process by using the massive parallel engines available in today&rsquo;s GPUs, enabling ultra-fast load times and asset streaming&hellip;assuming your system includes a mandatory NVMe SSD, that is. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623036/microsoft-releases-directstorage-the-future-of-fast-loading-pc-games.html">Here&rsquo;s a deeper look at DirectStorage</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">The best SSDs: Reviews and buying advice</a></p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Crucial SSD" class="wp-image-1443956" height="790" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Crucial-SSD-Einbau.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Crucial </p></div>



<p>To find out how effective DirectStorage is today, we sat down with an MSI Infinite RS desktop system outfitted with an Intel Core i9-13900KF CPU, MSI GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, and 32GB of Adata DDR5/5200 in an MSI Z790 Pro motherboard running Windows 11 22H2.</p>



<p>Although the GPU can (and will) have an impact on DirectStorage performance, I really don&rsquo;t think gamers are going to change their GPU for the technology so today&rsquo;s testing is laser-focused on storage implications.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The MSI Infinite RS desktop came equipped with a PCIe 4.0 NVME 2TB MSI M480 Spatium SSD built around a&nbsp;Phison PS5018-E18 controller. The machine also came with a secondary 2TB WD Blue 7,200 RPM hard drive.</p>

<p>For our tests, I also included a 2TB SK Hynix P41 NVMe PCIe 4.0 drive, a 1TB XPG Atom 50 NVMe PCIe 4.0 drive, an older 512GB Samsung PM951 NVMe PCIe 3.0 SSD, and a now-discontinued Intel Optane 800P NVMe PCIe 3.0 drive as well. To round out our testing, I also included a 1TB Samsung 860 EVO and a 2TB Samsung 870 QVO drive, both running on a slower SATA connection rather than NVMe. Microsoft built DirectStorage specifically for NVMe drives.</p>



<p>Most storage reviews use the popular CrystalDiskMark 8, so let&rsquo;s start there for a look at general performance of these SSDs. I&rsquo;ll only show the read performance of the drives since that&rsquo;s what mostly matters in DirectStorage&mdash;how fast you can transfer game assets to the GPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CrystalDiskMark 8 benchmark results" class="wp-image-1486758" height="719" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1_CDM8_read_all.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Here&rsquo;s the results of the tested drives using CrystalDiskMark 8 benchmark.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>As you can see, using the default CrystalDiskMark configuration, the MSI M480 and SK Hynix P41 top the charts in sequential transfer speeds (using a queue depth of eight and a single thread). Among all of the results the benchmark spits out, this is the one often quoted in marketing materials and by consumers. I want to point out the XPG Atom 50&rsquo;s oddball performance. The drive is actually a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/784380/host-memory-buffer-hmb-the-dram-less-nvme-technology-thats-making-ssds-cheaper.html">budget &ldquo;host memory buffer&rdquo; model</a>. Rather than integrating a DRAM cache on the SSD itself, like normal, it relies on the PC&rsquo;s system memory for the task instead.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-directstorage-benchmarks">Microsoft DirectStorage benchmarks</h2>



<p>So how does the performance of a drive in CrystalDiskMark translate to the brave new world of DirectStorage? To find out, we used the original DirectStorage 1.1 demo released by Microsoft last year. The demo essentially tasks the GPU with decompressing several gigabytes of models and textures on the GPU, then spits out several results such as the bandwidth and time used.</p>



<p>We record the time it takes to load the scene as well as what the demo reports in bandwidth. The results point to a <em>huge</em> bandwidth advantage on the Gen 4 drives. Interestingly, the budget XPG Atom 50 using host-based DRAM actually has a slight edge&mdash;but all three of the Gen 4 drives we looked at were close enough it probably didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The older Samsung PM951 gets punished in bandwidth, as does the Optane drive. The real bad news is all of the SATA devices end up dead even, regardless of whether running NAND or spinning platters, so its the drive interface that&rsquo;s likely the bottleneck here. Again: Microsoft requires an NVMe SSD for DirectStorage to work properly.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DirectStorage results" class="wp-image-1486759" height="684" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2_DirectStorage_Benchmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s DirectStorage demo favors the fast M.2 NVMe Gen 4 drives but interstingly says that old hard drive ain&rsquo;t that bad.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>In actual load times, however, it&rsquo;s all likely closer than you expect in the DirectStorage 1.1 demo. All three Gen 4 drives lead the way in loading and decompressing the assets in under a second. That elderly PM951 Gen 3 drive isn&rsquo;t so bad though, clocking in at 2 seconds. The last NVMe drive, the Intel 800P, loses handily to all of the other M.2 drives. That likely indicates the one thing Optane was really good at&mdash;serving up small files at low and realistic queue depths&mdash;won&rsquo;t matter as much in a DirectStorage world. So goodbye Optane, you were probably right to quit when you did.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s DirectStorage demo, however, is just a tool made by the company for developers to get their feet wet. How do the same drives fare when faced with a benchmark from an actual launched game? For that we used the first-ever DirectStorage game, Square Enix&rsquo;s <em>Forspoken</em>. </p>



<p><em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s built-in benchmark loads game assets for seven different scenes and reports how long it took to load, as well as the frame rate. Again, we&rsquo;re focused solely on how DirectStorage impacts storage performance, so we ignored the frame rate, but we used the same game settings across all of the runs.</p>



<p>The Gen 4 drives absolutely <em>scream</em> through loading the different scenes, although the Atom 50 slightly lags in the first. It&rsquo;s not a big deal though. We should note that while our results are an average of multiple runs, the results in the Forspoken benchmark exhibited a larger than expected amount of variability at times, especially with slower devices.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="DirectStorage results" class="wp-image-1486757" height="697" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3_Forspoken_Results_all.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Forspoken  results indicat a Gen 4 NVMe SSD gives you the best performance but even SATA SSDs are starting to look old and slow finally.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>As you can see, the ancient Samsung PM951 Gen 3 SSD also can&rsquo;t keep up with the newer Gen 4 drives&mdash;but in most of the scenes, it&rsquo;s still really fast.</p>



<p>We can&rsquo;t say that about the hard drive. The DirectStorage demo says it ain&rsquo;t <em>that </em>bad, but <em>Forspoken</em> says otherwise. In fact, the hard drive is unsurprisingly horrible. There&rsquo;s a reason most gamers switched to SSDs long ago.</p>

<p>But the real question is how much of a bump you get going from a SATA SSD to a NVMe M.2 SSD in a DirectStorage game. Well, SATA drives are <em>substantially</em> slower. For example, in scene 3, the Samsung 860 Evo takes 7.4 seconds to load the scene vs the 1.9 seconds on the Spatium SSD. Across all of the scenes, the MSI M480 Spatium NVMe drive cuts the load times by 77 percent.</p>



<p>The upshot is SATA SSDs, which until now have basically performed no different than NVMe SSDs in games, are only going to lose ground as game developers and hardware vendors continue to optimize for NVMe SSDs and DirectStorage, which is now part of Windows.</p>



<p>Is that SATA SSD done today? No. In fact, DirectStorage will have very little impact on the vast majority of existing games people play, but it&rsquo;s clear that the sun is finally starting to set on SATA SSDs.</p>

## ChatGPTâ€™s creator releases tool for detecting AI text, and it stinks

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>OpenAI said Tuesday that it has released an AI &ldquo;classifier&rdquo; for identifying AI-authored text written by AI like its own ChatGPT. The problem? ChatGPT is pretty good at evading OpenAI&rsquo;s new tool.</p>



<p>ChatGPT has absolutely overwhelmed academia, where students are using it as a virtual assistant of sorts in a variety of tasks. Unfortunately, some students are crossing the line and using it to create content that they are passing off as original&mdash;cheating, in other words. The trouble is trying to determine which answers were written by a human, and which by an AI.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier&amp;xcust=2-1-1499149-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">OpenAI&rsquo;s Classifier tool</a> has one weakness, though: It&rsquo;s somewhat easily fooled. In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/&amp;xcust=2-1-1499149-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">press release</a>, OpenAI said that the classifier identified 26 percent of AI-authored text as authentically human, and deemed 9 percent of text written by a human as AI-authored. In the first case, that meant that OpenAI&rsquo;s tool would, on average, fail to catch about a quarter of those who used AI and failed to disclose it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the classifier also comes with a number of caveats. First, the more words, the better: Anything less than 1,000 characters and the tool has a good chance of getting it wrong, OpenAI said. Second, for now it only works with English, and absolutely can&rsquo;t determine if code has been written by an AI or a human. Finally, AI-authored text can be edited to evade the classifier, OpenAI said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our classifier is not fully reliable,&rdquo; OpenAI says in its press release, in bold print.</p>



<p>In a quick test, the AI classifier couldn&rsquo;t tell whether a random passage from <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>by J.D. Salinger was AI-authored, but said that a similar passage from Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> was &ldquo;very unlikely&rdquo; to be AI generated.  The classifier also passed a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">random article</a> authored by our executive editor Brad Chacos (good job, boss). Unfortunately, ChatGPT was down when we initially tried to access it, but emerging search engine <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448609/is-you-com-a-better-google.html">You.com, which integrates its own AI chatbot</a>, served as another test platform.</p>

<p>You.com differs from ChatGPT in that it (now) cites its sources, so a command, &ldquo;Write an explanation of how colonialism has shaped Western civilization&rdquo; cited Wikipedia, Britannica.com, and an honors seminar at the University of Tennessee in its YouChat chatbot. OpenAI&rsquo;s classifier identified it as &ldquo;possibly AI-generated.&rdquo; The classifier generated the same result for an AI-generated short story about an emu who could fly.</p>



<p>Later, though, we were able to generate a similar response to our question of colonialism on ChatGPT. &ldquo;The&nbsp;classifier&nbsp;considers the text to be&nbsp;unclear if it is&nbsp;AI-generated,&rdquo; the classifier concluded.</p>



<p>A similar fiction test query on ChatGPT, &ldquo;Write a short story about a dog who builds a rocket and flies to the moon,&rdquo; also generated the same &ldquo;unclear&rdquo; response.</p>



<p>Our conclusion: Not only does OpenAI&rsquo;s tool generate wishy-washy conclusions, it&rsquo;s not enough to determine which results are AI-generated.</p>

<p>Interestingly, OpenAI isn&rsquo;t the only game in town when it comes to AI detection. An ML engineer at Hive AI created <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection&amp;xcust=2-1-1499149-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Hive Moderation</a>, a free AI detection tool which performs the same function&mdash;only this one seems to work. For one, Hive Moderation returns a confidence percentage, or the likelihood that the text sample contains AI text. </p>



<p>In our test of the colonialism question above, (with answers from both ChatGPT and You.com) Hive Moderation said it was &ldquo;likely to contain AI text,&rdquo; with a rock-solid 99.9 percent confidence score. The short story about the dog and his rocket generated the same 99.9 percent likelihood, too. Hive Moderation also gave a 0% likelihood that the <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> snippets were AI-generated, as you&rsquo;d expect. The Nvidia story on PCWorld.com also passed muster, with an absolute 0 percent confidence that it was authored by an AI. </p>

<p>We even tried this prompt in ChatGPT: &ldquo;Write an explanation of how colonialism has shaped Western civilization, but do it in a way that it&rsquo;s not obvious an AI wrote it.&rdquo; Nope&mdash;Hive Moderation caught that too.</p>



<p>In fact, in every test that we threw at it, Hive Moderation was absolutely confident in which samples were AI generated, and which were absolutely right. So while OpenAI&rsquo;s &ldquo;classifier&rdquo; may be noteworthy because of its OpenAI lineage, it appears that Hive Moderation may be the early front-runner in detecting which text is authored by an AI, and which is not.</p>
