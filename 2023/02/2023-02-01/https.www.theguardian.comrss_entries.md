<p>Like the City of London, the top flight is now an unregulated plaything with little relevance to the real world beyond it</p><p>So, how was your January? Perhaps like many people you engaged in a little belt-tightening, foreswore alcohol, began a new fitness regime, creatively restructured a few festive debts. Or perhaps you simply grimaced and shivered your way through a month of rising prices and falling temperatures, waited patiently in the bus queue or on the picket line, simply trying to make it to the next place.</p><p>At which point enter the Premier League, with its £815m of January spending, its doctrine of schlock and awe, its unshakeable fixation on persuading men in shirts to wear other shirts before a clock runs out. And on one level the dissonance here is hard to ignore, the temptation to juxtapose Chelsea’s bottomless balance sheet with the efficiencies and strictures being demanded of those who watch them every week. Just imagine how many nurses’ salaries Todd Boehly could have funded with the purchase of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/01/chelsea-to-sign-enzo-fernandez-benfica-british-record-transfer-fee">one Enzo Fernández</a>.

However, the result Forest are searching for is not unprecedented. In December 1977, Brian Clough took his newly promoted team to Old Trafford as shock mid-season leaders of the First Division. Dave Sexton’s hosts were hopeful of inserting themselves into the title race. What happened that afternoon sent shockwaves up and down the division, and Forest on an inexorable run to the title (with the small matter of a couple of European Cups to follow). “Never can Manchester United have been so humiliated in front of their own crowd,” wrote Ronald Atkin in the Observer of Forest’s jaw-dropping 4-0 win. “Forest, building neatly from midfield in front of an obdurate back line which gave Peter Shilton an industry-free match, took measure of United’s defence then contemptuously tore it to pieces.” A performance for the ages. And what a team! How they could do with John Robertson, Tony Woodcock and Archie Gemmill tonight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/feb/01/manchester-united-v-nottingham-forest-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The landmark decision, that luxury glass-walled flats opposite the museum’s new viewing gallery are being disturbed, could lead to a shift in how public life in cities operates</p><p>The verdict is in: people who live in glass houses may thrown stones with impunity. After six years of legal battles, the highest court in the land <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/01/tate-modern-viewing-platform-invades-privacy-of-flats-supreme-court-rules">has ruled</a> that the residents of the luxury glass-walled flats opposite Tate Modern’s viewing gallery face an unacceptable level of “constant visual intrusion”. They bought into the dream of living in an overpriced goldfish bowl next to one of the most visited museums in the world, and now they have decided they’ve had quite enough of being looked at, thank you very much.</p><p>The unprecedented ruling marks a hugely damaging step for the future of public life in our cities. It suggests that the mere ability of others to look through your windows is enough to have those people banished, that space shut down, and the surrounding urban environment regulated so that nothing may impinge on your own personal bubble.

With this ruling, the view of just five wealthy flat owners trumps the enjoyment of that very same view by millions of other people a year. The insistence of a few to live without curtains quashes the use of one of the capital’s most thrilling public spaces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/01/london-tate-modern-privacy-ruling-cities-privacy-precedent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England’s new defence coach Kevin Sinfield is merely the latest former rugby  league man to have a coaching influence in union</p><p>Kevin Sinfield’s journey from rugby league to England defence coach is, by now, a route well travelled. Admittedly Brett Hodgson’s tenure was remarkably brief but the records now show Sinfield is the third in a row to make it. With Andy Farrell guiding Ireland to No 1 in the world, Shaun Edwards making such an impact with France and Mike Forshaw recruited by Wales, this is shaping up to be a Six Nations defined by coaches whose careers began in the other code.</p><p>At first glance it is a trend traced to the north-west of England but it is one that might never have happened without a chance encounter in Hawaii between the San Francisco 49ers and an Australian known as “Supercoach”. The coach in question was Jack Gibson, renowned for his success with the Parramatta Eels in Australian rugby league in the early 1980s – around the time the “Invincible” Kangaroos swept all before them under Frank Stanton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/01/rugby-league-exiles-plot-six-nations-glory-kevin-sinfield">Continue reading...</a>

From its US headquarters, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/britain-only-g7-economy-expected-shrink-2023-imf">the International Monetary Fund predicted</a> the UK would be the worst-performing major economy of the year, and the only one to plunge into recession.

Why the IMF’s forecast, when it is usually wrong and there are already plenty of other projections that are, in fact, even more pessimistic?

The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/01/ministers-and-unions-dig-in-amid-widespread-strike-action-across-uk">biggest day of strikes in decades</a>. The country close to a standstill. You might have thought this would have been uppermost in people’s minds at prime minister’s questions. But not so much. Keir Starmer thought better of it. He wasn’t entirely sure what he wanted to say. Labour’s current position has barely progressed from “I wouldn’t have started from there”. Rishi Sunak is even worse. He hasn’t yet worked out that he’s prime minister and could therefore end the strikes. Someone should have a word.</p><p>Instead, the Labour leader chose to focus on sleaze. Not a bad substitute. And a relatively easy win. First he started with Nadhim Zahawi. Rish! must have hoped he’d heard the last of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/30/nadhim-zahawi-pushback-helen-whately">the former Tory party chair whom he finally got round to sacking</a> last Sunday.

Only problem is, the freshest tick on the ledger is 28 years old, entered when the Toffees won their last FA Cup in 1995. Newcastle’s most recent contribution came 54 years ago, in a competition that doesn’t exist any more and isn’t retrospectively recognised by Uefa.

<p><strong>Compton Verney, Warwickshire<br /></strong>A new exhibition brings together portraits of weird children and nobility by an artist with an eye for human uniqueness. It also reveals their true identity …</p><p>Four weird kids in black clothes turn their big eyes in unison as they sing what you imagine is a melancholy song about death. The great, great (and a few more greats) grandmother of Wednesday Addams is on keyboards, playing the virginals, the leader of the group. Her clothes are grave but more decorated than her brothers’ dark jerkins. She looks at you in a charged, even angry, way.</p><p>This psychologically acute study of Renaissance adolescence was painted in about 1565. Elizabeth I had been Queen of England for less than a decade. William Shakespeare had just been born. Yet in front of this painting by an artist known as the Master of the Countess of Warwick all that time collapses and you seem to be confronted by real young people, a bunch of severe teens whose turbulent emotions are squeezed into their stiff silken costumes and released in music. Their songbooks reveal they are performing the introspective Sixth Psalm of King David, set to music by Josquin des Prez: “I am weary with my groaning: all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/01/tudor-mystery-review-who-could-have-painted-such-medieval-strangeness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Life is seen through the eyes of a put-upon beast of burden in this beautifully photographed homage to Au Hasard Balthazar by the veteran Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski</p><p>Jerzy Skolimowski is the celebrated veteran director who first came to Cannes in 1972 with King, Queen, Knave starring Gina Lollobrigida and David Niven; now he has returned with a winter’s tale of a film, inspired by Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar from 1966. I’m not sure this is my favourite Skolimowski film, but it is engaging in many ways: beautifully photographed, sentimental and surreal in equal measure; and also stubborn – as stubborn as its hero – in its symbolism and stark pessimism.</p><p>Like Bresson, Skolimowski makes his lead a donkey, the beast that carried the Virgin Mary to Bethlehem and Jesus into Jerusalem. Skolimowski calls his animal “EO” – after its braying “eee-ohhh” sound. The place is present-day Poland, but the setting could almost be Europe at any time in the last few centuries. EO is being worked in a circus act but has to be let go because of legislation about using animals in this way. He winds up in a donkey sanctuary from which he is freed, then captured in the streets by a council worker for whose football team EO becomes a mascot. But then he is beaten by hooligans supporting the opposing team, captured by a gang trading in illicit horse- and donkey-meat, and finally rescued by a troubled young aristocrat whose haughty and devout mama (a tasty cameo for Isabelle Huppert) disapproves of her son’s louche gambling ways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/eo-review-an-innocent-donkey-leads-the-way-in-surreal-bresson-inspired-ride">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Black Sabbath legend’s announcement at 74 that he will never tour again marks an end to the rabble-rousing live career of a singular rock star</p><p>How did Ozzy Osbourne stick it out this long? And would you really bet on his retirement from live performance being permanent, given the vicissitudes he has already weathered? The irrepressible 74-year-old former Black Sabbath frontman has dealt with decades of drug and alcohol addiction; coped with Parkin syndrome, a form of Parkinson’s; and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/09/arts.artsnews">quad bike accident in 2003</a> that nearly killed him. Certainly, though, in both the 2011 documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne and The Osbournes, the TV series that turned him from moral threat to cuddly hero, you could always see the frailty only just below the surface.</p><p>Osbourne’s triumph as a rock star – as a founding father of metal, then as an MTV-friendly caricature of a wild man (though the wildness was very real), then finally as an elder statesman of heavy music – was startlingly unlikely. His voice had none of the rich, bluesy tone that dominated in British rock singing when Black Sabbath emerged at the end of the 1960s. Osbourne sang in a blank, desolate wail, with no vibrato. Where Rod Stewart sounded like he was singing from the bedroom doorway, Osbourne’s voice seemed to come from inside a padded cell.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/01/ozzy-osbourne-was-the-wild-man-of-metal-performance-and-vulnerability-was-his-secret-weapon">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I was swallowing the piano whole’: Stephen Hough on life as a prodigy – and playing for Jimmy Savile

<p>In an extract from his new childhood memoir, the great concert pianist recalls falling in love with the instrument, pestering his parents for lessons … and the deception on Jim’ll Fix It</p><p>Number 94 Chester Road, Grappenhall. Probably in 1966. Where and when I first touched a piano. It was at the home of Uncle Alf and Auntie Ethel. Alfred Smith had a Lancashire accent as flat in vowels as the cap on his head lacked a crown. His right forefinger was flat too, deformed into a spatula by an accident at work. He was kind and modest and back-slappingly cheerful, unlike his wife who always seemed to me rather sour. Or stewed perhaps, like tea steeped too long.</p><p>It was tea that brought us together, as we used to go to their house to drink it in their back sitting room. I was bored by these visits but on the right wall, in that back sitting room, stood a brown piano with yellow keys. A little boy aged four stood eye to eye with the teeth of those keys and gently, tentatively, pressed down some of the ivory tabs. My father said that I would play chords, not individual notes. Hammers hit strings, strings vibrated inside the box and the most amazing sounds entered my ears ... and my life. Nothing would satisfy me now but to have a piano of my own and to learn to play it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/01/i-was-swallowing-the-piano-whole-stephen-hough-on-life-as-a-prodigy-and-playing-for-jimmy-savile">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Modern technology is supposed to make our world better. But my flat’s ‘lighting system’ is broken, and I long for a single, simple light switch</p><p>I started shaving, tackling the wispiest of bumfluff, 40 years ago. I did so in an attempt to stimulate growth in order to make me look older, so I would have a better chance of getting served in pubs. Not one of these three things came to pass. The razor I used had two blades. I remember thinking how that felt excessive for my needs; one would have done. This was 1983 – 11 years after, according to its website, Gillette came up with the “Trac II®, the first twin-blade shaving system”. And it was a good 15 years before Gillette was “breaking the performance barrier with the MACH3®, the first three-blade technology, for an even smoother, closer shave”.</p><p>The blade arms race was on, providing a rich source of comic material for, among others, Billy Connolly, I recall, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f--Gq8Zrrvo">Mitchell and Webb</a>. But on the razor makers ploughed regardless, breaking new ground with ever more blades. Gillette, with a fine flourish, skipped four blades and went straight to five in 2006. And at five it has stuck, instead coming up with other stuff to keep our excitement high, most recently a heated razor that “delivers instant warmth in less than one second at the push of a button and provides a noticeably more comfortable shave”. Reassuringly, though, the blade race continues apace with the Dorco Pace 7, “World’s First and Only Seven Blade Razor”. Seven!</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/a-touch-screen-fridge-a-seven-blade-razor-why-is-everything-suddenly-so-complicated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A terrifying new report shows that these charities’ very existence is under threat. To let this happen is morally, and economically, wrong</p><p>At the beginning of the year, I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/27/critics-mocked-rishi-sunak-homeless-man-business">co-wrote a defence of Rishi Sunak</a> when Twitter unfairly pilloried him for seeing a homeless person as a three-dimensional human being, complete with a past, skills and ambitions. It was a nauseating experience. A bit like finding yourself humming along to a Take That tune. Still, I believed he deserved a fair shake. It didn’t take long for him to remind me of his incompetence and cruelty though.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/30/homeless-people-in-english-hostels-at-risk-of-return-to-streets-as-bills-soar">Homelessness charities warned </a>this week that rises in energy bills and underfunded council contracts threatened their very existence, which risked returning homeless people to a cycle of sofa-surfing and rough sleeping.

<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PC; EA Motive/EA<br /></strong>This remake of 2008’s urgent sci-fi horror from Visceral Games resists big changes in favour of some laser-focused improvements</p><p>Originally released in 2008, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/microsoft-dead-space">Dead Space</a> was EA’s sci-fi riff on 2005’s Resident Evil 4. It took the revolutionary design ideas of Shinji Mikami’s horror masterpiece – the over-the-shoulder perspective, tense crowd-control combat and zombies that weren’t really zombies – and launched them into a far-flung corner of the cosmos, switching virus-infected villagers for mutant alien necromorphs. The results were darkly thrilling, but couldn’t fully escape the light of Resi 4’s incandescent star.</p><p>Fifteen years down the line, with so much more distance from Mikami’s game, Dead Space is easier to appreciate on its own merits. This overhaul, from EA studio Motive, is a surprisingly restrained affair, resisting the temptation to supplement the game with modern adornments. Instead it streamlines the experience, altering the layout of doomed spaceship the USG Ishimura so that players may pass through it and its many horrors more smoothly. It’s a remake that embraces the original’s taut pacing and powerful forward-momentum, and is all the better for it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/feb/01/dead-space-review-an-intensely-horrible-sci-fi-classic-returns">Continue reading...</a>

I decided to adapt the brilliant novels by Jonathan Stroud – on which the series is based – not due to any personal paranormal experience, but because I was inspired by the terrifying TV shows and movies I saw growing up.

But we have to make fire – and how we go forward with our need is key to our place on Earth’</p><p>In May 2020, not long after we went into lockdown, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter commissioned me to take photographs responding to its wonderful seed collection.

I’m lucky enough to live on the edge of Dartmoor, where my husband has created a beautiful vegetable garden. The commission was an opportunity to meditate on that: every day, I would try to find something new. It encouraged me to think about my immediate environment in a wider context, in political terms, rather than just the idea of a garden being something you use to escape from the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/01/boy-fire-lockdown-leonie-hamptons-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

## Mary J Blige: the era-defining R&B original is back on imperial form – and primed for Grammys success

<p>Blige redrew the map in the 90s, combining hip-hop and soul, before her life and chart fortunes took a tumble. But after the Super Bowl and a creative return-to-form, she’s back on top</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/31/grammy-awards-2023-harry-styles-beyonce-lizzo-predictions">Grammy awards 2023: who will win – and who should?</a></p><p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mary-j-blige">Mary J Blige</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e84mxj/play/ahjgfx/p02vpwp9">performed at Glastonbury</a>. She appeared on the Friday afternoon during a rainstorm so relentless that the TV coverage was frequently blurred by water on the camera lens, innocuously sandwiched between Alabama Shakes and a wheezy-sounding Motörhead on their last legs. It was a relatively lowly billing for an artist with 100m sales to their name, but the sight of an R&amp;B artist on the Pyramid stage still carried the tang of novelty – it was the year someone got up a petition protesting Kanye West’s headlining appearance as “an insult to rock music” – and, moreover, Blige’s career was, by her standards at least, on its uppers.</p><p>The imperial phase that had begun with the release of her 1992 debut What’s the 411? had drawn to a close as the 00s turned into the 2010s. The previous year, she had released The London Sessions, a game attempt to pair her up with a series of UK artists: Disclosure, Sam Smith, Emeli Sandé, Naughty Boy. The results were OK, but the concept smacked of an artist casting around for a new direction – and the fact that the British artists got billing on the album cover seemed to say something about Blige’s diminished stature: it was being marketed as much on their presence as hers. It proved the lowest-selling album of her career.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/01/mary-j-blige-the-era-defining-rb-original-is-back-on-imperial-form-and-primed-for-grammys-success">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Disobeying the injunction to write only ‘what you know’, authors from Bram Stoker to Virginia Woolf have created rich fictional adventures into the unknown</p><p>Growing up in South Africa, it seemed that most of the damp, spotted books available to me were published in Britain. They tended to be set either in gothic country houses or on the streets of London, and they left me with a very clear (if partial and fictitious) impression of the city. When I moved to Britain, I spent several days wandering around London and felt a strong sense of deja vu: a simultaneous recognition and alienation that comes from the converging of real and invented places.</p><p>Of course, literature has always been about imagined places: Odysseus struggles to return to an Ithaca that no longer exists; Dante travels through an allegorical landscape towards paradise. Shakespeare’s plays are set in Bohemia, Syracuse, Venice, or Rome – places he knew through books. Imagined places are, I suspect, always elaborations or distortions of familiar landscapes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/01/top-10-imaginary-journeys-in-literature-christy-edwall-history-keeps-me-awake-at-night">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We have been mistaken for terrorists’: Italy’s most controversial rap group fight persecution

<p>P38-La Gang perform in balaclavas, namecheck the Red Brigades – and are under criminal investigation for inciting terrorism. Are they, as they believe, being scapegoated for their politics?</p><p>For P38-La Gang, everything changed on 1 May 2022, Labour Day. The Italian rap group were performing at the club Arci Tunnel in Reggio Emilia. The location appeared to be no coincidence. It is the city that birthed the Red Brigades, the far-left terrorist group that shocked Italy with kidnappings, kneecappings and more than 80 political assassinations in the 1970s and 1980s – a period of social turmoil known as the “Years of Lead”. On stage that day, the four-piece covered their faces with balaclavas and made a three-fingered gesture representing the P38 gun – the symbol of the 70s leftist movement Autonomia Operaia. As usual, the group flew the Red Brigades flag at the back of the stage – the title of their 2021 debut album, Nuove BR, translates as “new Red Brigades”.</p><p>Until then, the Bologna-based band had been considered one of the most bizarre and original newcomers in the Italian trap scene: angry, funny, outrageous, paradoxical, even a novelty act, depending on who you asked. Mixing bad taste with offending politicians and talkshow reporters, making fun of terrorism and dictatorships, P38-La Gang showed a face of Italy that few people want to see: the anger of workers paid €3 an hour and of a generation defeated by the class struggle who are surviving on memes and desperate irony.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/01/italy-most-controversial-rap-group-p38-la-gang">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Released 50 years ago, her tome of sexual fantasies didn’t simply give voice to female desire – it also exposed the lies upon which the patriarchy stands</p><p>When Nancy Friday’s My Secret Garden: Women’s Sexual Fantasies was published in 1973, the top-line controversy was its assertion that such fantasies even existed. It was such a simple inquiry, undertaken with neither the mechanical sexology of Shere Hite, whose Hite Report came out three years later, nor an attachment to methodological rigour, without which, people mansplained to Friday for the next four and a half decades, it was anthropologically meritless.</p><p>The critique was that her approach was journalistic, rather than academic; she wanted to know what women fantasised about, so she asked them.

<p>This tale of a multi-millionaire German shepherd and the super-rich excess lived in his name is full of people with unplaceable accents and dubious morals. It’s all a bit … empty</p><p>There’s a question hanging over the opening episode of the four-part documentary series Gunther’s Millions – but not a very compelling one. To paraphrase Mrs Merton: “What first attracted you to the millionaire dog Gunther?” This is Netflix’s latest attempt to generate a viral hit to match <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/17/making-a-murderer-documentary-review">Making a Murderer</a> in 2015 or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series">Tiger King</a> in 2020. It’s the story of how a German shepherd became “the richest animal in the world” after inheriting an $80m fortune from his doting owner, the late Countess Karlotta Liebenstein.<br /><br />These days Gunther’s millions afford him a Miami mansion once owned by Madonna, a villa in Tuscany, a yacht and a staff of 27, including the private chef who whips up his gold-leaf-adorned steak dinners. All this luxury is also appreciated – dare we say more appreciated – by the human handlers who take Gunther on his walkies, pat him on the head and call him a “good boy”. As one exceptionally guileless member of the Gunther entourage puts it: “I wanted to be a tick on that dog’s butt for the rest of my life.” No big mystery there, then. <br /><br />There’s also no mystery behind the commissioning of a documentary that combines so many flavours of tried-and-tested audience bait. There’s shameless super-rich excess, heart-tugging animal welfare scandals and – in the section when Gunther pivots to become a pop impresario – buxom bikini babes aplenty. There are even hints at a shadowy sex cult, operating out of Gunther’s many mansions. Gunther, you dirty dog!</p><p>If you’re reading all this, thinking, “Hmmm … Sounds like an elaborate tax scam to me,” then you’re way ahead of director Aurelien Leturgie. It takes him and his team hours of soft-ball questioning and circuitous storytelling to reach the same, fairly obvious, conclusion. The real perpetuator of this supercharged shaggy dog story is Maurizio Mian, pharmaceutical heir, CEO of the Gunther Corporation and one of several high-net-worth individuals named in the 2008 Liechtenstein Papers scandal. It’s not the dog who wants to drive a yellow Lamborghini, or own a nightclub, or employ female attendants with “jaunty buttocks” now, is it? <br /><br />What we have here – once again – is a slim story needlessly strung out over multiple episodes. At least there’s an opportunity to get acquainted with some characters along the way – the people with unplaceable accents and dubious morals who have been sadly missed from our screens since Eurotrash was last on air. <br /><br />There’s a pouty PR woman, affably willing to spin any old line for cash (is she from southern California, Schleswig-Holstein, or Huddersfield? It’s impossible to say!). There’s the strapping founder of a male escort agency, who claims his dreams of a modelling career in Italy faltered because he was simply too well built. And then there’s the indoor-shades-wearing, part-time paparazzo, a man so demonic he seems to arrive on a cloud of sulphur.<br /><br />Attempts are made to extract cheap laughs at these interviewees’ expense, by including supposedly off-mic asides, awkward seat shuffles and toupee adjustments in the final edit. Ultimately, though, they emerge with their dignity intact. Because, hey, it’s a living. Plus, any of them would have made a more interesting subject than Mian himself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/01/gunthers-millions-review-like-a-eurotrash-documentary-about-a-filthy-rich-dog-and-his-sex-cult">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A look at the surge in popularity of randomly selected councils that offer an alternative to politics as we know it</p><p>When Fauzia Bajwa, a retired software developer who lives in St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Quebec, received an invitation to participate in something called a citizens’ assembly, her first impulse was to write the letter off as junk mail. It’s a common reaction: most recipients of such a mailing never bother to respond. Then Bajwa looked at it again. The sender was listed as the Canadian Commission on Democratic Expression, a nonprofit organization that compiles opinion reports to submit to the Canadian government. Though<strong> </strong>the mailing’s language was vague – the assembly would be on the subject of so-called “online harms” – Bajwa’s curiosity was piqued. After all, she’d just read a book about online surveillance, and at the time was waking up to a news cycle that seemed to revolve around the tweets of a certain president of the United States. “I found it quite concerning that people were using what I initially considered to be a very good and useful tool” – the internet – “to put out lies and fake information, so I was already thinking about these issues,” she says. She went online and signed up.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/25/break-brexit-deadlock-ancient-athens-sortition">Citizens’ assemblies,</a> a phenomenon that is gaining in popularity around the globe, date back to ancient Athens, where legislative panels, courts and councils were chosen via random selection.

More recently, citizens’ assemblies have convened to hammer out solutions to such issues as homelessness in Los Angeles, <a href="https://participedia.net/case/4372">the allocation of a $5bn budget in Melbourne, Australia</a>, and the longstanding ban on abortion in Ireland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/01/citizens-assemblies-are-they-the-future-of-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

Perhaps he also stroked a cat, Vito Corleone-style, as he considered yet another request for a favour. This time it was the sculptor Donatello who needed help from his patron, Cosimo de’ Medici, the boss of mid-15th-century Florence. It was a case of boyfriend trouble.</p><p>Donatello had fallen out with his apprentice, who was also his lover. The young man had run off to Ferrara so Donatello, consumed with possessive rage, wanted Cosimo to give him a letter addressed to the ruler of Ferrara to explain that Donatello was there to murder his boyfriend. Cosimo provided the letter and sent a separate message asking Ferrara’s ruler to be gentle with Donatello for he was an artist and could get a bit emotional. When Donatello found his beloved, the youth “fell about laughing and Donatello, melting instantly, started laughing too”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/01/donatello-queer-identity-london-exhibition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chelsea had an eye-catching window, Arsenal settled for Plan B and Leeds were among the clubs who strengthened intelligently</p><p>Arsenal settled for plan B after being unable to land Mykhailo Mudryk or Moisés Caicedo but the alternatives were hardly bad. Leandro Trossard and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/arsenal-jorginho-deal-chelsea-caicedo-brighton">Jorginho</a> are proven top-flight performers who will need scant integration time in adding depth and quality to their title push. Longer-term additions, particularly in midfield, will be sought in the summer. The Polish defender Jakub Kiwior, signed from Spezia, has arrived with the future in mind but will hope to compete for a place quickly. Albert Sambi Lokonga, loaned to Crystal Palace, is playing for his Arsenal future in the next four months. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/01/transfer-window-verdict-how-every-premier-league-club-fared-in-january">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Islamic extremists may not like it, nor the bigoted Islamophobes, but today’s Muslim women have revolutionised the narrative of the hijab</p><p>At first, he began with, “What the fuck are you staring at?” The man was shouting at my friend and me as we travelled through east London on the underground. Then he stood up and stepped towards me screaming, “F***ing Muslim whore”, beginning a tirade of disgusting Islamophobic abuse. Though it lasted about five minutes, it felt like hours. Finally, another male passenger confronted him and managed to make him sit down. But as he left at the next stop, he came up close to my face and said, “If you get off here, I’ll be waiting for you.”</p><p>With depressing regularity, hijab-wearing women like myself are being subjected to appalling abuse and discrimination. Last year, a <a href="https://twitter.com/5Pillarsuk/status/1540002099253100545">shocking video</a> shared on social media showed a group of white men and youths in Sheffield launching a vicious attack on a veiled Muslim woman and her daughter. A 2019 paper from Nottingham Trent University reported that attacks against hijab-wearing women in the UK were on the increase, suggesting that this was because veiled Muslim women were “represented as <a href="https://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/37457/1/14361_Zempi.pdf">‘agents’ of terrorism</a>”. And <a href="https://tellmamauk.org/">Tell Mama UK</a>, the watchdog that monitors Muslim hate crime, reported in 2018 that 58% of recorded Islamophobic incidents were related to Muslim women because of their “overt religious identity”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/i-proudly-wear-a-hijab-forget-the-stereotypes-its-a-sign-of-style-and-strength">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Court finds owners of apartments opposite London gallery face unacceptable level of intrusion</p><p>The owners of luxury flats opposite the Tate Modern’s viewing gallery face an unacceptable level of intrusion that prevents them enjoying their homes, the supreme court has ruled.<br /><br />In a majority judgment, the court determined that the flat owners faced a “constant visual intrusion” that interfered with the “ordinary use and enjoyment” of their properties, extending the law of privacy to include overlooking – albeit only in extreme cases.</p><p>Noting that visitors to the Tate’s viewing gallery, which is currently closed, photograph the interiors and post this on social media, Lord Leggatt said: “It is not difficult to imagine how oppressive living in such circumstances would feel for any ordinary person – much like being on display in a zoo.”<br /><br />The case involves five owners of four apartments in the Neo Bankside development on the South Bank of the Thames taking action against the Tate over the estimated 500,000 visitors looking into their homes from the viewing platform 34 metres away. The platform, which opened in 2016, provides a panorama of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> as well as a direct view into their glass-fronted flats.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/01/tate-modern-viewing-platform-invades-privacy-of-flats-supreme-court-rules">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Harold Pinter theatre, London<br /></strong>Josie Rourke’s West End revival of Sam Steiner’s fringe hit really lifts when the show’s starry duo drop their romcom routine</p><p>Does a revival of Sam Steiner’s 2015 fringe sensation about a state-imposed “hush law” which limits our spoken word count resonate differently today, and on a West End stage? For some in our age of 24/7 online over-sharing, more quietude might sound like a utopia rather than the dystopia it is here, although the play is as much about resistance as it is about language.</p><p>This brave new world of 140 daily spoken words, at most, is refracted through a couple navigating love and intimacy and Josie Rourke’s production is driven by a starry duo in Jenna Coleman and Aidan Turner. She is Bernadette, a divorce lawyer with a working-class chip; he is Oliver, a musician with family privilege and a fragile ego. With a play that rose from the fringe circuit, Rourke’s great accomplishment here is that it looks fit for a West End stage, despite being a prop-free two-hander, while retaining its breezy minimalism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/01/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-review-aidan-turner-and-jenna-coleman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With a streak of humility utterly foreign to most music documentaries, Dunstan Bruce recounts the band’s successes – and failures – as pop stars and political activists</p><p>As a Dr Martens-wearing teenager in the 90s, I loathed the anarchist indie band Chumbawamba and their chart-topping anthem Tubthumping. (What a bunch of jokers, I thought.) Well, I take it all back after watching this funny and surprisingly sweet documentary co-directed by frontman Dunstan Bruce and Sophie Robinson. It begins with Bruce, now in his late 50s, overwhelmed by feelings of powerlessness as he thinks about the future of the planet, wondering what he can do (“I’m a washed up, rinsed out retired radical”). As a film-maker he indulges in a bit of wallowing here: taking the negative voice in his head and bringing it to life, played by an actor wearing a papier-mache head, who sarkily takes the piss out of him.</p><p>But from here the film settles nicely into an enjoyable blast of pop history. Chumbawamba started out as an anarchist collective in Leeds in 1982: living together in a squat, they went vegan (“I’m from Burnley! I didn’t like vegetables”), shared money equally and took it in turns to do the cooking. They’d been going for years when Tubthumping topped the charts. With a worldwide smash hit on their hands, the band decided that here was an opportunity to do something positive – to be a political band inside the belly of popular culture. They gave a lot of the money they made away, and in 1998 at the Brit awards, singer Danbert Nobacon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2014/sep/24/john-prescott-brit-awards-chumbawamba-1988">poured a bucket of cold water</a> over deputy prime minister John Prescott, furious at the Labour government’s treatment of Liverpool dockers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/01/i-get-knocked-down-review-enjoyable-blast-of-pop-history-from-chumbawamba-frontman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian’s former China correspondent assembles a cast of eye-witnesses to tell a story now being suppressed once more</p><p>The Communist party of China has an intrinsically fraught relationship with history, which it variously comprehends as a mirror (reflecting back uncomfortable truths) or war (a determined battle for ideological supremacy). But mostly, says Guardian journalist and former China correspondent Tania Branigan, the party views history as a tool. “It can be adjusted as necessary yet appears solid and immutable: today’s imperatives seem graven in stone, today’s facts the outcome of a logical, inexorable process. Life as it is meant to be.”</p><p>When the facts don’t fit the script, as Branigan illustrates over and again in this glorious, patchworked study of the legacy of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution, China’s leaders are brazen in enforcing forgetfulness. There is a long precedent for such edicts, she notes, citing the Qin dynasty eunuch described as “presenting a deer and calling it a horse, to find out which officials would obey without question. Some were quick to agree with him; he had the others executed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/01/red-memory-by-tania-branigan-review-the-toxic-afterlife-of-maos-cultural-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nancy Friday’s bestseller, My Secret Garden, divulged women’s deepest desires in the 70s. Now the star of Sex Education is exploring where our imaginations are taking us today</p><p>I was barely five years old in 1973 when Nancy Friday’s cult hit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/06/my-secret-garden-author-nancy-friday-dies">My Secret Garden: Women’s Sexual Fantasies</a> made its way on to the bookshelves and into the handbags of women in the US; just seven when it reached those in middle England. My Secret Garden was testament to the fact that women enjoyed as rich and diverse an erotic inner life as men did. Finally, here was a book in which ordinary women and girls – “you, me and our nextdoor neighbour” – were talking honestly about arousal, masturbation, sexual dreams and desires. In their minds, nothing was off limits, even a neighbour’s alsatian.</p><p>What Friday’s book revealed was that, for some of us, the sex we have in our head may be more stimulating than the physical nuts and bolts of any coupling, no matter how hot. Untrammelled by internalised social constraints, self-consciousness, or perhaps the fear of freaking our partner out, in our imagination we can indulge in our deepest, dirtiest desires. It was revolutionary, even provocative, at the start, and then it became required reading for everyone, a multimillion-copy global bestseller, a classic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/01/gillian-anderson-on-why-she-is-collecting-sexual-fantasies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>UK annual house price growth slows to 1.1%; US Federal Reserve expected to raise rates by 25bps to 4.75% but markets wonder whether it will then pause</p><p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets.</strong></p><p>The year has begun with further slowing in UK house price growth.</p><p>However, there are some encouraging signs that mortgage rates are normalising, but it is too early to tell whether activity in the housing market has started to recover.

## Victory City by Salman Rushdie review – a lavish fairytale

<p>Completed before he was attacked last year, Rushdie’s magic realist epic about a 15th-century Indian empire has an infectious sense of fun</p><p>The Vijayanagara empire covered most of south India in the 15th and 16th centuries. Viewed from one angle, it was a seedbed for the globalised modern world, in that it became a haven for art and new ideas and an economic power-house that traded with China and Venice. Viewed from another, it was a thicket of intrigue, rocked by rival factions, foreign wars and palace coups. Which is to say it was everything: the noble and the vile, the progressive and regressive, the Hindu heaven of Svarga twinned with treacherous Game of Thrones’ King’s Landing. Only the most brilliant or foolhardy scholar would dream of tackling its history in a single volume.</p><p>According to Victory City, one such scholar was the demigod Pampa Kampana, the empire’s mother, midwife and general overseer, who documented the era in a narrative poem she then sealed in a pot and buried in the ground. Victory City, we are assured, is the abridged translation of Pampa’s epic Jayaparajaya (a compound word meaning victory and defeat), retold in “simpler language” and stripped back from its original 24,000 verses. And if the result, while involving and enjoyable, rarely troubles the realms of the divine, that’s probably what happens when a mortal rewrites a deity’s prose.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/01/victory-city-by-salman-rushdie-review-a-lavish-fairytale">Continue reading...</a>

Suddenly I was free to focus on my own future</p><p>When I was a child, and friends asked me what I would do if I ever met my dad, I always replied that if I had a gun I would shoot him. I was a young teen in a small east Yorkshire market town with, at best, minor connections to a burgeoning petty criminal underworld. Even if I had been able to get a gun, I would have been more likely to shoot off a finger in error than aim correctly at my absent father. It was an empty threat that clearly revealed a deep, simmering anger.</p><p>My mum was a teenage tearaway who met an older guy, left school at 16, ran off to get married, and had me weeks after her 17th birthday. He turned out to be a violent alcoholic who was abusive. Thankfully, bravely, she left him before I was two, worried about the repercussions of me reaching an age when I could talk back. My dad did a runner to avoid paying child support and that was the last we heard of him. Until 14 years later, when the letterbox clattered open one morning: he had been found and summoned to court, in relation to the thousands owed, and Mum had to go. I insisted I go too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/01/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-saw-my-father-in-court-and-knew-i-had-to-turn-my-life-around">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Let them eat lentils' won't save us from animal farming - we must embrace meat substitutes | George Monbiot

<p>Our insatiable appetite for meat is laying waste to the planet. But the alternative is looking (and tasting) better by the day</p><p>Do you hate the idea of animal-free meat? Many people do. Unsurprisingly, livestock farmers are often furiously opposed. More surprisingly, so are some vegans: “Why can’t people eat tofu and lentils, like me?” Well, the new products – plant-based, microbial and cell-cultured meat and dairy – are not aimed at vegans, but at the far greater number who like the taste and texture of animals. Many others instinctively recoil from the idea of food that seems familiar, but isn’t.</p><p>So here’s a question for all the sceptics. What do you intend to do about the soaring global demand for animal products, and its devastating impacts?</p><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/environmentalists-animal-free-meat-livestock-farming">Continue reading...</a>

## The secret life of André Leon Talley: what an auction reveals about the late fashion legend

<p>From monogrammed luggage to unerring faith, a sale of Talley’s belongings shows the caring, complicated man behind the unforgettable image</p><p>If you’re in the market for a size 13 pair of Manolo Blahnik snakeskin evening slippers edged with crimson satin ribbon, then 15 February could be your lucky day. At <a href="https://www.christies.com/auction/the-collection-of-andre-leon-talley-20995-nyr">an auction at Christie’s in New York</a> of the personal estate of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/20/andre-leon-talley-obituary">André Leon Talley, the former American Vogue creative director</a> who died last year, they might be yours for a guide price of £400. A Chanel navy silk faille opera coat could be snapped up for about £3,000 (scattered “sun damage” is noted), while two extra-large Birkin bags look a steal at £4,000. There are no fewer than 29 Louis Vuitton trunks up for grabs (including one that made a cameo appearance in 2008’s Sex and the City film), along with a Prada coat in white crocodile and an orange liveried Hermès bike that Talley never rode but kept in storage at the Ritz in Paris.</p><p>When Talley died, the gaudy inventory of his possessions and tales of unpaid rent and a painful exile at the hand of Anna Wintour seemed to paint an operatic, bittersweet portrait of an overdressed and overwrought figure. But Talley was a more creative, more interesting, smarter and kinder person than any of that. Having grown up poor and black in the still-segregated US south, he won a full college scholarship and graduated with a master’s degree in French from Brown University. He forged a pioneering path to become the first person of colour to reach the highest ranks of Vogue, and his death at the age of 73 left a king-size void on the front row. And, in an elegant twist that Talley would have adored, it is the luxury wardrobe on which he splashed his fortune that will serve to portray him in a more flattering light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/01/the-secret-life-of-andre-leon-talley-what-an-auction-reveals-about-the-late-fashion-legend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>European research finds that increasing urban tree coverage to 30% can lower temperatures by 0.4C</p><p>Planting more trees could mean fewer people die from increasingly high summer temperatures in cities, a study suggests. <br /><br />Increasing the level of tree cover from the European average of 14.9% to 30% can lower the temperature in cities by 0.4C, which could reduce heat-related deaths by 39.5%, according to first-of-its-kind modelling of 93 European cities by an international team of researchers.<br /><br />The lead author, Tamara Iungman, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, said: “This is becoming increasingly urgent as Europe experiences more extreme temperature fluctuations caused by climate change.</p><p>“We already know that high temperatures in urban environments are associated with negative health outcomes, such as cardiorespiratory failure, hospital admission, and premature death.” <br /><br />Her team wants to influence policymakers to make cities greener, “more sustainable, resilient and healthy” as well as mitigating climate breakdown, she added, since heat-related illness and death are expected to present an even bigger burden to health services over the next decade than cold temperatures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/01/planting-trees-cities-cut-deaths-summer-heat-study">Continue reading...</a>
