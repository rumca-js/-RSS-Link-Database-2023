I show you how to setup an encrypted USB drive with a LUKS partition and cryptsetup. I wrote a script to automatically decrypt and mount drives on the fly too which does this automatically. Get it here:

`mounter`. For mounting drives (encrypted, normal and Android phones):
https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/mounter
`unmounter`. For unmounting. Also closing decryption of drives for safety:
https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/unmounter

Might do more on drive encryption, including full disk encryption later.
