I\u2019m not sure this is my favourite Skolimowski film, but it is engaging in many ways: beautifully photographed, sentimental and surreal in equal measure; and also stubborn \u2013 as stubborn as its hero \u2013 in its symbolism and stark pessimism.</p><p>Like Bresson, Skolimowski makes his lead a donkey, the beast that carried the Virgin Mary to Bethlehem and Jesus into Jerusalem.

The place is present-day Poland, but the setting could almost be Europe at any time in the last few centuries. EO is being worked in a circus act but has to be let go because of legislation about using animals in this way. He winds up in a donkey sanctuary from which he is freed, then captured in the streets by a council worker for whose football team EO becomes a mascot. But then he is beaten by hooligans supporting the opposing team, captured by a gang trading in illicit horse- and donkey-meat, and finally rescued by a troubled young aristocrat whose haughty and devout mama (a tasty cameo for Isabelle Huppert) disapproves of her son\u2019s louche gambling ways.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/eo-review-an-innocent-donkey-leads-the-way-in-surreal-bresson-inspired-ride\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/01/ozzy-osbourne-was-the-wild-man-of-metal-performance-and-vulnerability-was-his-secret-weapon", "title": "Ozzy Osbourne was the wild man of metal on stage \u2013 but vulnerability was his secret weapon", "date_published": "2023-02-01 16:20:55+00:00", "description": "<p>The Black Sabbath legend\u2019s announcement at 74 that he will never tour again marks an end to the rabble-rousing live career of a singular rock star</p><p>How did Ozzy Osbourne stick it out this long?

The results were OK, but the concept smacked of an artist casting around for a new direction \u2013 and the fact that the British artists got billing on the album cover seemed to say something about Blige\u2019s diminished stature: it was being marketed as much on their presence as hers.

To paraphrase Mrs Merton: \u201cWhat first attracted you to the millionaire dog Gunther?\u201d This is Netflix\u2019s latest attempt to generate a viral hit to match <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/17/making-a-murderer-documentary-review\">Making a Murderer</a> in 2015 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Tiger King</a> in 2020. It\u2019s the story of how a German shepherd became \u201cthe richest animal in the world\u201d after inheriting an $80m fortune from his doting owner, the late Countess Karlotta Liebenstein.<br /><br />These days Gunther\u2019s millions afford him a Miami mansion once owned by Madonna, a villa in Tuscany, a yacht and a staff of 27, including the private chef who whips up his gold-leaf-adorned steak dinners. All this luxury is also appreciated \u2013 dare we say more appreciated \u2013 by the human handlers who take Gunther on his walkies, pat him on the head and call him a \u201cgood boy\u201d. As one exceptionally guileless member of the Gunther entourage puts it: \u201cI wanted to be a tick on that dog\u2019s butt for the rest of my life.\u201d No big mystery there, then. <br /><br />There\u2019s also no mystery behind the commissioning of a documentary that combines so many flavours of tried-and-tested audience bait.

It takes him and his team hours of soft-ball questioning and circuitous storytelling to reach the same, fairly obvious, conclusion. The real perpetuator of this supercharged shaggy dog story is Maurizio Mian, pharmaceutical heir, CEO of the Gunther Corporation and one of several high-net-worth individuals named in the 2008 Liechtenstein Papers scandal. It\u2019s not the dog who wants to drive a yellow Lamborghini, or own a nightclub, or employ female attendants with \u201cjaunty buttocks\u201d now, is it? <br /><br />What we have here \u2013 once again \u2013 is a slim story needlessly strung out over multiple episodes. At least there\u2019s an opportunity to get acquainted with some characters along the way \u2013 the people with unplaceable accents and dubious morals who have been sadly missed from our screens since Eurotrash was last on air. <br /><br />There\u2019s a pouty PR woman, affably willing to spin any old line for cash (is she from southern California, Schleswig-Holstein, or Huddersfield? It\u2019s impossible to say!). There\u2019s the strapping founder of a male escort agency, who claims his dreams of a modelling career in Italy faltered because he was simply too well built. And then there\u2019s the indoor-shades-wearing, part-time paparazzo, a man so demonic he seems to arrive on a cloud of sulphur.<br /><br />Attempts are made to extract cheap laughs at these interviewees\u2019 expense, by including supposedly off-mic asides, awkward seat shuffles and toupee adjustments in the final edit. Ultimately, though, they emerge with their dignity intact. Because, hey, it\u2019s a living.

Having grown up poor and black in the still-segregated US south, he won a full college scholarship and graduated with a master\u2019s degree in French from Brown University. He forged a pioneering path to become the first person of colour to reach the highest ranks of Vogue, and his death at the age of 73 left a king-size void on the front row.
