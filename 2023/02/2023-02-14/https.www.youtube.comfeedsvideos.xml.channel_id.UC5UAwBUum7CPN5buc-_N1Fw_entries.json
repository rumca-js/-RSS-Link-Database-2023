It explains the basics, like how to connect to the internet or how to change settings, but it also presents a bunch of great features Plasma has and never really talked about before.\n\nWhile Kwin won't replace a full tiling window manager, it now has the ability to create tiling layouts, and then to place windows in the various tiles you created. To set up a tiling layout, you press Super + T, and you'll get that overview, with a default layout, in 3 columns. And then, once your layout suits you, all you have to do is drag a window while holding Shift, and your window will automatically occupy the tiling zone it's sitting above. \n\nThe widgets and tools have received so many improvements that even in this lengthy section, I can't list them all. First, Krunner got a, update to surface more relevant search results. When hovering over widgets, they'll tell you what you can expect if you middle click them. The tooltips have also been greatly improved.\n\nThe calendar widget now also supports the Hebrew calendar. The battery monitor shows the status of connected devices, the media applet now has 2 layouts, one for horizontal panels, and one for vertical panels, with the album art only.\n\nThe color picker can now show up to 9 colors, and clicking a color will automatically copy it to the clipboard, with a notification. The weather widget can now display the temperature in the task bar.\n\nFolder view now lets you show hidden folders, pop up notes will make links clickable by default, and Kickoff now supports separators in the menu. The wallpaper list should be much faster, changing wallpapers now uses a transition animation.\n\nFloating panels will be automatically de floated when a window touches them, and they'll use less padding and less space in that defloated mode. The breeze theme now has an outline around windows in dark mode, which makes them more easy to parse at a glance, trying to use a VPN will prompt you to install the relevant plugin.\n\nPlasma now supports high resolution scrolling under wayland, and they now support content types, which lets the compositor adjust the display's refresh rate depending on what you're doing.\n\nFractional scaling is also now natively supported under Wayland. When sharing your screen on wayland, the window picker will now have thumbnails to let you decide what you want to share.\n\nAnd there's also a new setting to let Xwayland application access global shortcuts.\n\nPlasma revamped multi monitor support, so all panels, windows, wallpapers, and widgets are saved per monitor, and restored when a monitor is plugged back in.\n\nNext are flatpak permissions. They have their own new settings page, that lets you review what applications have access to, and give them more permissions, or remove some.\n\nDiscover will now show more flatpak permissions on application pages. The homepage has received a new look. The \"all applications\" button is also now back in the sidebar, and when you're searching for something, if nothing is available, you'll get a  message and a button to search the whole store.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onPUaAKoGIM", "date_published": "2023-02-14 16:12:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
