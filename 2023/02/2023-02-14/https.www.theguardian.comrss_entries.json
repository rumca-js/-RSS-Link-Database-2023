The essential contribution that the arts make to the health, wealth and wellbeing of the UK is clear, well documented and tangible, but this government continues to sabotage and harm our national interests with a myopic approach to education and cultural investment. Now, scientific and technical innovations are hailed as the key to economic growth with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/07/rishi-sunaks-whitehall-carve-up-merely-rearranges-the-deckchairs\">creation</a> of a new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology last week, while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/07/key-appointments-in-rishi-sunaks-cabinet-reshuffle?amp\">refocused</a>\u201d and reduced.

With a 40% fall in GCSE arts entries since 2010, how exactly does the government intend to secure the talent pipeline into our vital creative industries? Arts subjects are disappearing from the curriculum in England at a frightening rate, and we should all be alarmed. The damage goes far beyond the economic; it requires a long-term coherent plan and investment in creative arts education. We know that governments often struggle to value what they can\u2019t easily measure.

Email <a href=\"mailto:feast@theguardian.com\">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Can you make good pizza at home without a pizza oven?<br /></strong><em><strong>Joe, Preston, Lancashire<br /></strong></em>Yes, but it\u2019s more a question of which style of pizza you\u2019re going to have the most success with. \u201cThe biggest thing is the temperature of the oven,\u201d says Rich Baker, co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.flatearthpizzas.com/\">Flat Earth Pizzas</a> in east London, \u201cbecause domestic ovens simply aren\u2019t hot enough to achieve what a pizzeria does.\u201d Joe might, he suggests, fare better with a grandma pizza, which is cooked in an oiled baking tray for about 15 minutes \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s ideal for the oven,\u201d he says. But if you\u2019re hankering for a floppy Neapolitan or crisper, New York-style slice, construct it in a hot cast-iron frying pan, then, once it has some colour on the base, pop it under a high grill until bubbling. \u201cThat\u2019s the method I use if I don\u2019t have access to a pizza oven,\u201d says Nick Buckland, co-owner of <a href=\"https://yardsalepizza.com/\">Yard Sale Pizza</a> in London, which opens its tenth site in Tottenham next month.</p><p>You\u2019ll also need a good basic dough recipe, which happily requires only a handful of ingredients \u2013 flour, water, yeast, salt \u2013 although, Baker adds, you could also include sugar, honey or olive oil \u201cto help it brown better\u201d. Flour-wise, Joshua Ward, co-founder of <a href=\"https://palmspizzeria.com/\">Palm\u2019s Pizzeria</a> in Margate, uses 00 for his New York-style slices: \u201cYou want a fairly high protein content, because it helps build the dough\u2019s structure, meaning it won\u2019t tear when you handle it\u201d; you could also use strong white flour, a mix of the two, or even add a little rye. Buckland also goes for 00 with \u201cat least 13g protein\u201d and, for three 12-inch pizzas, mixes 500g with 270ml water, and 1g fresh yeast (or \u00bdg dry, active yeast in a little tepid water). He then adds 30ml more water, followed by 15g salt and 15g extra-virgin olive oil, and mixes for about 10 minutes, until it forms a smooth, elastic dough. \u201cFold into a ball, put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and leave overnight\u201d at about 18C : \u201cThat\u2019s the perfect spot between letting the yeast do its thing, but without it happening too quickly.\u201d</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

New consoles, new technologies and, of course, new games are what drive headlines. So it\u2019s easy to overlook one of gaming\u2019s oldest companies and underestimate the sheer scale of its success. This month, Nintendo announced its quarterly financial results and said the Nintendo Switch is now the third bestselling games console of all time with 122.5m units sold, behind Sony\u2019s PlayStation 2 (somewhere north of 155m) and Nintendo\u2019s own DS (154m). As gamesindustry.biz journalist Christopher Dring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1622891592569786368\">pointed out</a>, it has beaten the DS on software sales, selling almost a billion games (994m) compared to the DS\u2019s 949m. A <em>billion</em> games!</p><p>Nintendo is an entertainment company, of course, but it is also a tech company \u2013 and surely one of the most successful tech companies around, both in its longevity and cultural impact, if not its absolute market value. Yet it has never behaved much like a tech company. The tech industry likes continuous disruption and unstoppable growth, whereas Nintendo likes experimenting with relatively modest hardware to get the most possible fun out of it. The company remains years behind on online gaming, where Microsoft\u2019s Xbox took the lead. It stopped competing with the PlayStation on the technical specifications of its games consoles back in the 00s. Instead of joining the mobile gaming gold rush of the early 2010s, it waited until 2016 to release its first smartphone games in partnership with mobile developers \u2013 and was rewarded later that year with Pok\u00e9mon Go.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/14/techscape-nintendo-innovation-tech-company\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/14/techscape-nintendo-innovation-tech-company", "date_published": "2023-02-14 11:45:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Jesse Marsch agrees to succeed Nathan Jones as Southampton manager", "description": "<ul><li>Marsch was sacked by fellow strugglers Leeds last week</li><li>Southampton are currently bottom of the Premier League</li></ul><p>Jesse Marsch is primed to succeed Nathan Jones after agreeing to take charge of Southampton after another round of positive talks on Monday.

But it\u2019s also fully conventional in that like the vast majority of romcoms it sets out to assemble a heterosexual couple and eventually succeeds. The core romance is sutured when Malloy\u2019s Jack and Briana Evigan\u2019s Jill, two ordinary normcore singletons who both love proper ballroom dancing and swing, finally get to dance together at the climax. Honestly, it\u2019s so brazenly obvious in following every rule of genre that it\u2019s barely a spoiler to reveal it: the fun is in how they get there.</p><p>Naturally, the course of true love sputters and stalls along the way. In the opening scene, they don\u2019t actually meet at the local dance club where Jill likes to go with her friend Patrick (Mario Cantone from Sex and the City), a gay man who\u2019s happy to pretend to be her husband to swat away unwanted dance partners. But Jill is impressed when she sees Jack, a former ballroom dance instructor recovering from a divorce, busting a move with his friend Samantha (Julianne Arrieta). Jack and Jill miss getting introduced by minutes, a pattern satisfyingly reprised throughout \u2013 although their respective hopes are raised when both of them encounter (separately of course) a crazy cat lady on a bridge who predicts they will each find true love by the end of the year \u2013 which happens to be in a week\u2019s time. Encouraged by different friends who all end up being guests at a wedding by the end, Jack and Jill go on a series of comically awful dates with people to whom they are quite unsuited.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/ask-me-to-dance-review-tom-malloy-briana-evigan-dancing-romcom\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/ask-me-to-dance-review-tom-malloy-briana-evigan-dancing-romcom", "date_published": "2023-02-14 11:00:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Parents, talk to your sons about Andrew Tate \u2013 we teachers can\u2019t take him on alone | Lola Okolosie", "description": "<p>The messages of toxic, misogynist influencers can reach children more easily than ever \u2013 schools and families need to work together to prepare them</p><p>At the beginning of the year, it felt like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/feb/11/the-truth-about-andrew-tate-his-home-is-less-hollywood-hideaway-more-rundown-meat-factory\">social media influencer Andrew Tate</a> was dominating all my conversations.
