The mounting demographic pressures have highlighted the fact that the CCP hasn't done enough to avert what would happen in the coming decades.
In September 2022, China's National Health Commission held a press conference to brief its work on seniors since November 2012. Data show that China's senior population over 65 years old reached 191 million in 2020, accounting for 13.5% of the total population. We doubt that the ratio of 13.5%, not 14%, was carefully crafted by the staff because reaching 14% would mean that officially, China was declared to be an aged society. At the same time, the National Health Commission predicted that around 2035, China's senior population aged 60 and above would exceed 400 million, accounting for more than 30% of the population, i.e. entering the super-aged stage.
