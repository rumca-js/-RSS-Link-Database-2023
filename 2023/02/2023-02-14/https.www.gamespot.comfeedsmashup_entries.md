<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> Season 16: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">Revelry</a> launched today, bringing a massive amount of new content to the game. But between the excitement over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">team deathmatch</a>'s long-awaited arrival and the new Remastered Legend Classes system, it's easy to miss one of the best new additions to the game: <a href="http://ea.com/games/apex-legends/lore-hub">an official lore hub</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Respawn's vision for Season 16 was partially focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-is-an-ideal-on-ramp-for-new-players/1100-6511254/">improving new players' gameplay experience</a>, with plans to update the Firing Range, add a better tutorial, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-patch-notes-buff-peacekeeper-and-mastiff-add-shiny-gold-shotgun-bolt/1100-6511419/">implement Orientation Matches</a> to help new players get familiar with the world of Apex Legends. But gameplay isn't the only experience Apex offers--the game also has an ongoing narrative that intertwines the stories of all 23 legends, and has been told in various formats, from YouTube's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-stories-from-the-outlands-explains-why-lifeline-traded-family-for-a-punk-band/1100-6504588/">Stories From The Outlands</a> series to various comics (both digital and <a href="https://www.darkhorse.com/Books/3006-933/Apex-Legends-Overtime-TPB">physical</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">Apex's <a href="https://culturedvultures.com/apex-legends-story-messy-complicated/">expansive storyline is now so complicated</a> that trying to even explain the context of the game's current events can be difficult. For newcomers, taking inventory of Apex's many, <em>many</em> plot threads can be overwhelming. The 23-character roster alone makes keeping track of things difficult, but another part of the problem was the fact after each season's storyline ended, there was no way to access that season's storyline. Over the last four years, Apex fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/">/r/ApexUncovered</a> and wikis hosted by <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Season">Fandom</a> (Gamespot's sister site) have meticulously archived and cataloged each season's in-game comic or story, along with links to Twitter comics and other lore sources. Ultimately, new players who wanted to know "the whole story" had to devote a significant amount of time to researching the events of past seasons. But with today's unveiling of Respawn's official Apex Legends Lore Hub, all of that changed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-apex-legends-lore-hub-will-help-new-players-catch-up/1100-6511522/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A fourth Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland is in the works and the story is being written now, according to Marvel boss Kevin Feige. Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/movies/kevin-feige-marvel-phase-5-exclusive-interview/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Feige didn't have a whole lot to say, but he did comment on the film and clarified how it's coming along.</p><p>"All I will say is that we have the story. We have big ideas for that, and our writers are just putting pen to paper now," Feige said.</p><p>Holland has starred in three standalone Spider-Man movies thus far, including Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). A fourth movie with Holland was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-spider-man-movie-trilogy-with-tom-holland-rumored-but-not-confirmed-yet/1100-6498384/">always expected</a>, but given the actor's comments about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-holland-is-taking-a-break-from-acting-says-maybe-its-time-for-a-spider-woman/1100-6499134/">taking a break from acting</a>, fans have been wondering what his status is.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-4-with-tom-holland-is-being-written-now-marvel-boss-says/1100-6511519/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Just Capped Off Its Final Season Before Lightfall In Fantastic Fashion

<p dir="ltr">The next expansion for Destiny 2, Lightfall, is only two weeks away, and Bungie just concluded its latest seasonal story with an incredible one-two punch. It tees things up for Lightfall in a truly exciting way. <em><strong>Spoilers for Destiny 2: Season of the Seraph's finale mission ahead.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Season of the Seraph has focused on the Warmind Rasputin, a powerful figure in Destiny's lore who has taken a more prominent role in the story than ever before. To end the season, Bungie launched a new mission that wraps up not just Season of the Seraph, but Rasputin's role in the story that stretches back to the first Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">In atypical fashion, this mission is set to Legendary difficulty, the optional setting you could use when playing through The Witch Queen campaign. Your Power level is capped at 1350 (well below where anyone who has reached this point in the seasonal story would be) and matchmaking is disabled. Combined with the urgency around the story--Eramis is prepared to use the Warsats to destroy the Traveler as revenge for it having abandoned the Eliksni, and Rasputin deems his own destruction to be the only course of action to stop her--this provides a real weight to the proceedings. Even as a mission meant to wrap up the ongoing season, things feel much more important.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-just-capped-off-its-final-season-before-lightfall-in-fantastic-fashion/1100-6511520/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The most important part of any shooter is its guns, and that usually means the more the merrier. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-most-wanted-event-guide-all-challenges-cosmetics-and-more/1100-6511502/">Most Wanted event</a>, you can get your hands on some returning weaponry from days gone by--including some that are needed for the event challenges, like the Heavy Sniper Rifle and Boom Sniper Rifle. A few of these <strong>unvaulted guns</strong> can only be found by buying them at Ace's Exotic vending machines, though, so we'll tell you where to find one of those and where to get the rest of the guns below.</p><h2>Where to find Ace's Exotic Vending Machine</h2><p>There are two types of Ace's vending machines that spawn around the map: Ace's Armory vending machines and Ace's Exotic vending machines. The former is common and sells standard weaponry, while the latter is much rarer and sells exotic weapons for a hefty price. Since vending machine spawns can be a bit random, you'll just need to look in populated areas for them--but you should <strong>prioritize named locations each time you drop</strong> <strong>into the map</strong>, as they have dedicated vending machine spawn locations. They won't always be of the Exotic variety, but if you're lucky, it will be.</p><h2>All of the unvaulted guns and where to get them</h2><p>There are quite a few guns that have been unvaulted for the big event, including some fan favorites that many are certain to be gunning (pun intended) for in every match.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-get-heavy-sniper-boom-sniper-ace-exotics-vending-machine/1100-6511501/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Fortnite's surprise Most Wanted event is here, and it builds on the structure we saw Epic unveil with last year's Dragon Ball event. Similar to events seen in games like Halo and Overwatch, the Fortnite Most Wanted event includes its own mini battle pass, complete with 13 exclusive cosmetics, culminating in a free character skin, Gold Blooded Ace.</p><p>First up, you can pick up new exotic weapons by robbing them from Cold Blooded Vaults. The only way you can get in is by killing Cold Blooded Bosses and picking up Vault Keycards. Minions also guard the vaults themselves.</p><p>If you successfully take the vault, you can pick up exotics like the Heist Breacher Shotgun, Heisted Accelerant Shotgun, Heisted Run n' Gun SMG, and the Heisted Blink Mag SMG. In addition, the update is bringing back several weapons including the Hand Cannon, Dual Pistols, Heavy Sniper, Hop Rock Dualies, Suppressed Pistol, and the Boom Sniper Rifle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-fortnite-event-feels-like-a-mini-season-launch/1100-6511515/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>Apex Legends Season 16: Revelry Battle Pass Rewards</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1752/17528202/4098913-cryptog7.jpg" /><br /><em>Crypto sports his new Technocrat skin while toting the Frenzied Frequency G7 Scout.</em><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> Season 16: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">Revelry</a> is finally live, as is the game's new seasonal battle pass. Featuring bold colors and striking designs, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-battle-pass-trailer-reveals-a-colorful-celebratory-theme/1100-6511431/">Revelry battle pass</a> contains 110 levels of festive, eye-catching cosmetics that are sure to make you stand out from the crowd. (Just watch out for those snipers!)</p><p dir="ltr">The Revelry battle pass has a lot to offer--even for players who care little for fashion. Other useful items like stat trackers, Apex Packs, Apex Coins, and Crafting Metals are also scattered throughout the battle pass, and with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-revelry-launch-trailer-confirms-tdm-is-coming-but-no-new-legend/1100-6511197/">no new legend joining the Apex Games</a> this season, pre-existing legends are getting a little more love in the cosmetic loot department.</p><p dir="ltr">As with all of Apex's battle passes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/">Season 16</a>'s pass comes in three forms:The standard premium battle pass is available for 950 Apex Coins ($950 USD), and gives players access to the battle pass's premium cosmetics. It also instantly unlocks the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The Modder's Corner Transition Screen</li><li dir="ltr">+10% XP Boost</li><li dir="ltr">Night Raver Bloodhound legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Bamboogie Mirage legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Amped Up Armorer Rampart legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzied Frequency G7 Scout weapon skin (Legendary)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Option two--referred to as the "battle pass bundle"--is a little more costly at 2,800 Apex Coins ($28 USD), but has the added benefit of giving you an instant, 25-level battle pass boost in addition to the standard premium battle pass loot listed above. This makes it a great choice for players who don't have a lot of time to devote to level grinding (or those who simply can't wait to get their hands on this season's loot).</p><p dir="ltr">But players who don't purchase either premium battle pass option will still unlock loot from the battle pass's free reward track. Completing the free battle pass will earn you the Visualizer Wraith legend skin (Rare), 7 Apex Packs, 11 weapon skins, 4 Transition Screens, 2 Music Packs, 200 Apex Coins, a banner badge, and stat trackers for all legends.</p><p dir="ltr">As always, the new battle pass includes two Legendary-tier reactive weapons skins. This season's reactive skins are for the Mastiff shotgun--the Headliner Mastiff weapon skin unlocks at level 100, and the Afterparty Mastiff skin unlocks at level 110.</p><p dir="ltr">As for non-cosmetic items, players will find Apex Coins, Apex Packs, Crafting Metals, and XP Boosts at the following levels:Apex Coins can be found in sets of 100 at levels 3, 5, 21, 29, 37, 45, 61, 69, 77, 85, 93, 95, and 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Packs can be found at levels 5 (Legendary), 7 (x2), 24, 38, 58, 60, 63, 66, 78, 84, 86, 87, and 99 (Epic).</p><p dir="ltr">Crafting Metals come in sets of 120, and can be unlocked at levels 4, 13, 20, 28, 36, 44, 53, 60, 68, and 76.</p><p dir="ltr">XP Boosts give you a 10% XP bonus that stacks with each XP Boost you unlock. XP Boosts are found at levels 1, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, and 70.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the gallery below for a closer look at all of Season 16's flashy battle pass cosmetics, stay tuned for

## Wild Hearts Is Now Playable For Those With Game Pass Ultimate Or EA Play

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-hearts/">Wild Hearts</a> doesn't technically release until February 17, but those with EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate can take the game's opening hours for a spin right now thanks to an early access trial.</p><p dir="ltr">The trial lasts for 10 hours, or up until players reach the city gates of Minato. For those eager to dive in, EA Play is $5 for a one-month subscription or $30 for a year.

## Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania Review

<p dir="ltr">Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which includes everything that's happened since Endgame, was an incoherent and disconnected mess full of stories that barely ever even referenced each other. But Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania is the start of a new day. It's a movie that should help the franchise regain its focus by putting the next big bad, Kang the Conqueror, front and center and kick off a new unifying story thread.</p><p dir="ltr">That's what it was <em>supposed</em> to do, anyway. And maybe that version of the movie exists on some other version of Earth. But in our reality, Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania is the most generic Marvel movie imaginable, smoothing over every edge that might alienate viewers until anything of substance has been expunged. That's not to say it's an unpleasant experience. It's not. Rather, it's the kind of movie you'll completely forget within a couple of days because there's nothing really worth remembering.</p><p dir="ltr">The setup here is that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has spent the time since Avengers: Endgame doing nothing, and his newly grown-up daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been secretly working with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne/the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) on a project to remotely map the Quantum Realm.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-review/1900-6418027/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite Is Prettier Than Ever--But It Seems To Be Coming At A Cost

<p>Fortnite's newest installment, Chapter 4, brought a number of big changes to the battle royale. The chapter's inaugural season introduced a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-augments-and-how-they-work/1100-6509692/">Augment</a> system, a chaotic bouncy hammer, and plenty of additional weapons. The new elements make for plenty of wacky fun, but usually only when they are working properly--something that has been increasingly uncommon over the past three months.</p><p>"I’m enjoying the season but it seems like something new is broken every week," said Redditor ltllama in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/10slf2l/comment/j726apn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">thread</a> about the high number of cosmetic issues that have popped in in Chapter 4.</p><p>Those new cosmetic issues are one issue of many in a season that's been plagued by bugs. Players have found ways to exploit new mechanics like the Shockwave Hammer and the Aerialist Augment, letting them bounce around the map infinitely. Other recurring issues have made it impossible for players to sprint or sometimes launching them into the sky after a mantle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-prettier-than-ever-but-it-seems-to-be-coming-at-a-cost/1100-6511081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite: How To Hide In A Hay Stack, A Leaf Pile, And A Giant Snowball In A Single Match

<p>A few of this week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> quests request you to do some hiding and seeking, asking you to be a bit sneaky with your playing to unlock that sweet challenge XP. One of these quests asks you to <strong>hide in a hay stack, a leaf pile, and a giant snowball in a single match</strong>. This can seem tricky as it requires you to travel to three different biomes without dying. But don't worry--it's easier than it sounds, and we'll walk you through it below.</p><h2>How to hide in a hay stack, a leaf pile, and a giant snowball in a single match in Fortnite</h2><p>First up, set your sights on the southern tip of the snowy section of the map. When you land there, go ahead and pull out your harvesting tool and hit the ground with it until you've made a giant snowball, then jump inside of it to knock that one off your list.</p><figure style="width: 2048px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4098907-route.jpg"><img alt="Start in the snowy area and work your way to Frenzy Fields." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4098907-route.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Start in the snowy area and work your way to Frenzy Fields.</figcaption></figure><p>Secondly, begin heading in the direction of Frenzy Fields to the southwest. As you make this long trek, keep an eye out for fallen leaves on the ground that you can jump in. There are plenty on this route, especially if you veer into the autumnal (yellow) section of the map. That will complete the second requirement of the quest.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-how-to-hide-in-a-hay-stack-a-leaf-pile-and-a-giant-snowball-in-a-single-match/1100-6511513/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

With so much going on, you'd be forgiven if you overlooked the fact that the Flare Gun has been brought back, too.

We'll tell you where to find the Flare Gun and how to use it below.</p><h2>Where to find the Flare Gun in Fortnite and how it works</h2><p>The Flare Gun should be pretty easy to find, as <strong>it can be rounded up on the ground, in chests, or from supply drops</strong>.

It allows you to mark where enemies are located within a fairly large radius, letting you to see them through walls and other structures for a limited time.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4098898-3926809-fortnite-flare-gun-1920x1080-74a3de2494d0.jpg"><img alt="The Flare Gun is an immensely useful recon tool." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4098898-3926809-fortnite-flare-gun-1920x1080-74a3de2494d0.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The Flare Gun is an immensely useful recon tool.</figcaption></figure><p>When you're ready to mark an enemy, equip the Flare Gun and aim it high into the sky in the direction of where you believe your opponent to be. When you fire it, you'll see the flare go up and over toward your foes, then they'll become marked soon after. This should wrap up the quest for you, but make sure you keep a Flare Gun around beyond this one request, as it can be a vital tool that could make all the difference for you and your squad--especially in the final few rings.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-how-to-find-flare-gun-how-it-works/1100-6511510/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/check-out-all-14-super-mario-bros-movie-posters/2900-4638/">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> hits theaters on April 7, but a new lineup of toys will be arriving much earlier. In fact, you’ll be able to get your hands on official action figures based on the animated film on February 26--with Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, and other familiar faces arriving later this month.</p><p>The Super Mario Bros Movie 5-inch Figure Series Wave One features Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Toad, with each figure offering between 8 and 16 points of articulation along with a unique accessory from the film (such as a plunger for Mario or flashlight for Luigi). Each figure will cost $20.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098888-mariofigures%281%29.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098888-mariofigures%281%29.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098890-toad.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4098890-toad.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098891-bowsertoy.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4098891-bowsertoy.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098892-mariokart.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4098892-mariokart.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098893-mariocastleopen.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4098893-mariocastleopen.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4098894-mariocastle.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4098894-mariocastle.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Bowser, meanwhile, is offered as an exclusive 7-inch action figure that features a "fire-breathing" effect and 15 points of articulation.

You’ll also need to drop a bit more cash, as the giant Bowser figure clocks in at $30.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/check-out-these-adorable-super-mario-bros-movie-toys/1100-6511508/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">In almost exactly one month, Ted Lasso will return with a new season. Apple TV+ has announced the comedy series starring Jason Sudeikis will come back March 15, with new episodes following each Wednesday. This will be the first time a show airs midweek for the streaming service.</p><p dir="ltr">The third season of Ted Lasso will consist of 12 episodes. And there's a lot to deal with, as AFC Richmond starts play in the Premier League. Let's just say media members don't see them doing well after the team's promotion. On top of that, Ted's former assistant, Nate (portrayed by Nick Mohammed), has taken over West Ham United for Rebecca's ex-husband, Rupert. But that hasn't stopped anyone from believing, as seen in the teaser trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Other plot lines for the upcoming season focus on Roy Kent (played by Brett Goldstein) taking over Nate's assistant coaching position for AFC Richmond and Rebecca (played by Hannah Waddingham) facing off against Rupert (played by Anthony Head). There's also Keeley (portrayed by Juno Temple) continuing to strike out on her own with her PR agency.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ted-lasso-season-3-gets-a-release-date-and-new-trailer/1100-6511507/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you're diving into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-most-wanted-event-guide-all-challenges-cosmetics-and-more/1100-6511502/">Most Wanted event</a>, you'll have quite a lot of cool stuff to figure out and find. From fresh cosmetics to unlock to brand-new exotic guns to find alongside some unvaulted favorites, you're probably already feeling like it's a lot to take in, but now you've noticed the new Heat Level in every match. If you're wondering how it all works, we've got you covered below.</p><h2>How Heat Level works in Fortnite</h2><p>During the Most Wanted event, you'll have a Heat Level in every match, which you'll be able to see as flame icons in your HUD. This level will increase each time you eliminate another player, open a vault, or answer one of the burner payphones in Cold Blooded-controlled areas of the map--and that can be both a good and bad thing. On the plus side, you'll gain some neat boons at each level, but they'll come at the cost of you becoming more visible to opponents and showing up on the minimap.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4098908-87d5fb67-79fe-418a-92b5-a35fd6b22a40.png"><img alt="Answer burner pay phones and pay gold bars to increase your heat level." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4098908-87d5fb67-79fe-418a-92b5-a35fd6b22a40.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Answer burner pay phones and pay gold bars to increase your heat level.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Heat Level 1 </strong>- Eliminated opponents drop additional bars.</li><li><strong>Heat Level 2 </strong>- Increases your movement speed by 15%, and you’ll regenerate up to 100 health out of combat.</li><li><strong>Heat Level 3</strong> - Increases your movement speed by 20%, and you’ll regenerate up to 100 health and 50 shields out of combat.</li><li><strong>Heat Level 4</strong> - Increases your movement speed by 25%, and you’ll regenerate up to 100 health and 100 shields out of combat.</li></ul><p>As you can see, you'll be playing a game of risk and reward when taking out your enemies or opening Cold Blooded Vaults, but it's our opinion that it's typically worth it. That extra movement speed and constant regeneration outside of combat significantly offset the fact that you'll have a target on your back (figuratively speaking). So get out there and mow down your enemies and become, well, the most wanted.</p>

## Xbox Clarifies Its Own Admission That Game Pass Cannibalizes Some Game Sales

<p>Microsoft has clarified its own admission that putting games into Xbox Game Pass can, in some cases, lead to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/">decrease in sales</a>. Responding to the many headlines recently about the cannibalization effect for Game Pass releases, Microsoft shed some further light on the matter.</p><p>In a statement to GameSpot, a Microsoft spokesperson said Microsoft tries to help game developers make the most money they possibly can through Game Pass. As such, Microsoft cuts deals with developers and publishers on a title-by-title basis, the terms of which are not made public and are presumably not consistent across the board. In its statement, Microsoft didn't comment specifically on any cannibalization effect, but it also didn't say this never happens.</p><p>Given the size and scale of Xbox Game Pass, the custom financial arrangements for each game, and all manner of other potential contributing factors, it certainly seems that some Xbox Game Pass titles would see their full-game sales affected by being included in Game Pass. In other cases, however, game sales may grow over time thanks to being included in Game Pass.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you’re lucky enough to live near a Costco, you have an easy way to save on not just groceries, but also video games, electronics, and other household products. The bulk retailer frequently holds members-only discounts--and back when PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles were scarce, Costco was one of the best places to look. You need to be a member to shop most of the sales, but a new promotion is giving away <b>$30 gift cards</b> when signing up for a <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card?utm_source=gamespot.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card_020923&amp;utm_term=scsf-565326&amp;utm_content=a0x1P0000058JsWQAU&amp;scsonar=1">Gold Membership,</a> </span> making this a great time to join.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card?utm_source=gamespot.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card_020923&amp;utm_term=scsf-565326&amp;utm_content=a0x1P0000058JsWQAU&amp;scsonar=1">Sign Up For Costco Gold</a> </div><p> </p><p>This Costco promotion comes with a few caveats. You’ll want to read the lengthy fine print, but the main takeaway is that <strong>only new members</strong> are eligible for the free gift card. But if you’ve never been part of the Costco family, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better time to join. An annual Gold Membership typically costs $60, but with a free $30 digital gift card, this essentially cuts that to just $30.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-free-30-gift-card-when-joining-costco/1100-6511477/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>AtGames already offers several home arcade products--including the Legends Ultimate arcade and the Legends Pinball--but the lineup is getting bigger this year with a few more products. If you've been wanting to play your favorite games in 4K or take them on the go, then these might be up your alley.</p><p>Arriving by the end of 2023 and available to preorder this summer, the AtGames Legends Pinball 4KP and Legends Ultimate 4KP are both in the works. Each machine comes with higher storage and processing power compared to the original versions, and also includes a new UI. In the case of the Legends Pinball 4KP, it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyl6ld2u8AI">also slightly bigger</a>, with a nearly 24-inch backglass display and solenoids in place of the haptic speakers on the original.</p><div>          </div><p>The Legends Ultimate 4KP closely resembles the standard Legends Ultimate, but it comes with a BitLCD marquee as the standard option, letting you show art for your game of choice while playing instead of the Legends Ultimate logo. Neither system has an MSRP yet, but given the $800 price for the existing Legends Pinball, expect it to be fairly expensive. Upgrade kits to replace your internal board will also be available, giving your older machines the processing power of the 4K models--these are planned at $350 for the Legends Ultimate and $400 for the Legends Pinball.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atgames-announces-4k-versions-of-legends-ultimate-arcade-and-pinball-machines/1100-6511500/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania introduces a new big bad to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the form of Kang the Conqueror, a major threat portrayed by Jonathan Majors. While the third Ant-Man movie will see the debut of Kang, he'll also return to menace Earth's mightiest mortals in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. And beyond that? Majors wants to share the screen with Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man.</p><p>"I'm just such a huge fan of him as an actor. I think what he did with Iron Man was such a gift to the culture at large," Majors said to <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2023/02/kang-avengers-5-jonathan-majors-interview/">Lifehacker Australia</a>. "I would love to be across from him on screen to see how our philosophies, acting-wise and character-wise, just personally, match up. You know, I find him to be such a fascinating artist, which is why Iron Man is so fascinating. His portrayal of Iron Man is so fascinating and he represents a very clear worldview and energy of the Avengers. And I think Kang represents a different era. It'd be really interesting to see those two kind of come together and have a bit of conversation."</p><p>Interestingly, Kang and Stark have a fascinating history in older Iron Man comics. The Crossing was a mid-'90s Iron Man storyline that involved Tony Stark betraying the Avengers after years of being manipulated by Kang, becoming a double agent for the villain.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jonathan-majors-wants-kang-to-meet-iron-man-in-the-mcu/1100-6511496/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Although Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has been chosen to kickstart <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-phase-5-and-phase-6-mcu-movies-and-tv-shows-coming-and-what-we-know/2900-4230/">Marvel's Phase 5</a>, it's also the third movie in Ant-Man's personal saga. In a new interview, director Peyton Reed has explained that he always thought of the films as a trilogy--though he didn't rule out more Ant-Man films in the MCU's future.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2023/02/ant-man-3-phase-5-peyton-reed/">Lifehacker Australia</a>, Reed explained that his vision for the Ant-Man movies was influenced by the films he grew up with. "I think in the back of your mind, for an optimistic person, you’re like oh, it would be great to do a trilogy of these movies," Reed explained. "I grew up with trilogies, Back to the Future, Star Wars, the Indiana Jones trilogy. So to me, it's like I treated this like a three act structure of this story."</p><p>"There were things in the first movie and the second movie we set up that I really wanted to pay off in this movie – character-wise, environment-wise – and to have it culminate with this encounter with this big villain," Reed added. The inclusion of notorious Marvel supervillain Kang the Conquerer is also the reason Quantumania was chosen to lead Phase 5, Reed said, describing him as a "sort of depth charge to the MCU."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ant-man-was-planned-as-a-trilogy-director-says/1100-6511495/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As of March 15, fans will no longer be able to stream any episodes of Arrested Development on Netflix, despite the streaming service producing the last two seasons of the hit comedy, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-removing-arrested-development-original-seasons-1235521721/">Variety reports</a>. </p><p>Arrested Development originally aired on Fox for three seasons before it was cancelled in 2006. Netflix was behind the series' revival when it licensed a new season in 2011, which aired on the service in 2013. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-arrested-development-season-5-trailer-ann/1100-6458763/">fifth and final season</a> aired exclusively on Netflix in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>Netflix also acquired non-exclusive streaming rights to Fox's first three seasons, meaning Netflix has thus far been the only place fans can binge the entire show at once. The first three seasons are also available to stream on Hulu, which is owned by Disney.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-pulling-all-of-arrested-development-including-seasons-it-produced/1100-6511494/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> is going all-in on Valentine's this year, with a new game mode, a Cupid Hanzo skin, new challenges, and a standalone dating sim called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-surprisingly-good-dating-sim-is-packed-with-in-jokes-teases-for-the-future-and-an-exciting-genji-reveal/1100-6511484/">Loverwatch</a>, where players will be able to romance Mercy or Genji.</p><p>The new V-Day game mode is called Love of Geometry, and will pit two teams of four against each other, with every player as Hanzo in his Cupid skin. As if that wasn't chaotic enough, the Love of Geometry event will temporarily replace Hanzo's Storm Arrow with Scatter Arrow, a special arrow that can split and bounce off walls to deal widespread damage. The controversial ability was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-out-now-makes-major-hanzo-changes/1100-6458714/"> patched out of Hanzo's kit back in 2018</a>, deemed too frustrating to players who found themselves in Scatter Arrow's erratic firing line. Blizzard has also teased a surprise for players who use Hanzo's Dragonstrike in Love of Geometry.</p><div>          </div><p><a href="https://loverwatch.gg/en-us">Loverwatch</a>, Blizzard's official-but-not-canon dating sim is also live for a limited time to celebrate Valentine's day.

Loverwatch even hints that Blizzard may have plans for a more in-depth Overwatch dating sim some time in the future.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-valentines-day-event-loverwatch-dating-sim-are-now-live/1100-6511493/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
