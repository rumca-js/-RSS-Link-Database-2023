## Marc-André ter Stegen: ‘Barcelona are on the way back. We found ourselves’

<p>A new generation is emerging at the Camp Nou, led by a goalkeeper who represents the past, present and future of the club</p><p>“We’re more attractive now,” Marc-André ter Stegen says. The last time Barcelona played in the Europa League, there were 79,468 people at the Camp Nou; the problem was that half of them were supporting the other team. That April night last year, Eintracht Frankfurt brought more than 35,000, <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/barcelona-espbarcelona/story/4643182/how-eintracht-frankfurt-fans-filled-barcelonas-camp-nouand-what-it-says-about-footballs-ticketing-model">stands swathed in white</a>. “It was tough, it didn’t feel like we were at home,” the goalkeeper admits, but he knows it won’t happen again, starting with Manchester United on Thursday night.</p><p>That experience against Eintracht prompted Barcelona to impose strict measures to deny visitors access, prevent tickets being bought by away fans <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/3063451/fc-barcelona-implements-the-safety-and-control-protocol-for-opposition-fans-for-the-game-against-manchester-united">and stop members selling seats on</a>, but it is not really about that. It is more about the teams, the moment: last season was the imperfect storm, unrepeatable. “Frankfurt wanted to really push it, they were really excited to travel,” Ter Stegen says. What has most changed though is <em>them</em> – seen in the stands and explained here as he settles into a seat at the club’s Joan Gamper training ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/14/marc-andre-ter-stegen-barcelona-are-on-the-way-back-we-found-ourselves">Continue reading...</a>

## This is not the first attempt to ban Black studies – but repression births resistance | Derecka Purnell

<p>Rightwing pundits target knowledge found in critical race theory because they know it leads to action </p><p>On the first day of Black History Month this year, the College Board announced significant changes to its Advanced Placement African American studies course. The billion-dollar company made this move after widespread rightwing pushback against the inclusion of liberal, progressive and radical books by Black authors in the curriculum (they have since <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/12/1156409108/college-board-african-american-studies-florida-desantis">apologized</a>). The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, currently leads the fascist charge on banning books and silencing ideas for students and schools. But he has fascist friends.</p><p>During the 2020-2021 school year, over 900 districts nationwide suffered “an intentional campaign to restrict or ‘ban’” anything deemed “critical race theory”, according to <a href="https://seis.ucla.edu/news/ideally-u.s.-public-schools-areplaces-where-students">The Conflict Campaign</a>. These districts represent 35% of all students in elementary, middle and high school. While we should organize to eliminate the elitist, profit-driven College Board from their schools, they ought to fight to introduce, protect and proliferate Black studies on campus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/african-american-studies-history-repression-resistance-republicans">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nato defence ministers meet to discuss further military aid; Bakhmut under intense artillery fire</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>A major new Russian offensive has begun, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. </strong>Speaking ahead of a two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, Stoltenberg said Russia was “sending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities”. Nato planned to increase its ammunition stockpile targets and he expected possible supply of aircraft to Ukraine to be discussed. Stoltenberg said Ukraine’s use of ammunition was “many times higher than our current rate of production”.</p><p>Ukrainian defenders who have held out for months are braced for new ground attacks, Ukrainian military officials have said. <strong>The eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is facing heavy artillery fire, according to local officials.</strong> “The city, the city’s suburbs, the entire perimeter, and essentially the entire Bakhmut direction and Kostyantynivka are under crazy, chaotic shelling,” said Volodymyr Nazarenko, deputy commander of Ukraine’s Svoboda battalion. The Ukrainian military reported 16 settlements had been bombarded near Bakhmut.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy <strong>thanked Ukrainian soldiers for “preventing the occupiers from encircling Bakhmut”</strong>. The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a new foothold in the Donetsk region and constitute a rare victory after months of setbacks.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s top general and the top US army commander in Europe have discussed further military aid for Kyiv</strong>. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi from Ukraine talked to the commander in chief of Europe’s combined Nato forces, US General Christopher Cavoli, ahead of the Nato defence ministers’ meeting. “We discussed the issue of supplying international military aid to Ukraine and training our units on the territory of partner countries,” Ukraine’s defence ministry quoted Zaluzhnyi as saying.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s allies have begun training Ukrainian troops on the Leopard 2 and other modern battle tanks. </strong>Germany started training Ukrainian soldiers on the Leopards on Monday at an army base in the northern town of Munster. Ukrainian troops are also being trained by Polish, Canadian and Norwegian instructors at a military base in Swietoszow, south-west Poland.</p><p><strong>Two Dutch F-35 fighters have intercepted a formation of three Russian military aircraft over Poland and escorted them out. </strong>The Netherlands’ defence ministry said: “The then unknown aircraft approached the Polish Nato area of responsibility from Kaliningrad,” according to a Reuters translation of the ministry’s statement. “After identification, it turned out to be three aircraft: a Russian IL-20M Coot-A that was escorted by two Su-27 Flankers. The Dutch F-35s escorted the formation from a distance and handed over the escort to Nato partners.”</p><p><strong>Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, has accused Russia of planning to use foreign saboteurs to overthrow her country’s government, prevent it from joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine. </strong>Sandu’s comments on Monday came after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country had intercepted plans by Russian secret services “for the destruction of Moldova” – this was later backed up by Moldovan intelligence officials.</p><p><strong>Russia is set to become “more authoritarian and militarised” in the coming years, Norway’s intelligence services</strong> <strong>believes</strong>. “There is no turning back,” said Lars Nordrum, second in command of the Norwegian intelligence service. “Russian interests will not be compatible with those of the west.”</p><p><strong>Russian arms supplies to India have been worth $13bn in the past five years, and India has placed orders for another £10bn, </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/13/russia-ukraine-war-fresh-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-region-ukraine-military-reports-live?page=with:block-63ea1f1b8f08b08d63d5510d#block-63ea1f1b8f08b08d63d5510d">according to Russian state media.</a> India is the world’s biggest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for about 20% of Moscow’s current order book. India has not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its prime minister, Narendra Modi, has called for dialogue and diplomacy to solve the conflict.</p><p><strong>An unverified video is being circulated on social media that appears to show the murder with a sledgehammer of a former Russian mercenary who fled the Wagner group</strong> while fighting in Ukraine. The clip is similar to one that showed the killing of another Wagner fighter, Yevgeny Nuzhin, in November last year. Wagner’s founder declined to say whether the apparent victim had been killed or not.</p><p><strong>The UN human rights office said it had recorded 7,199 civilian deaths and 11,756 wounded since Russia’s February invasion</strong>, mostly from shelling, missiles and airstrikes. However, it believed the actual figure was far higher.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-35-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
