The all new RAZER Edge handheld is here and in this video we finally get to test it out!
Powered by the Snapdragon G3X gaming cpu and backed by 6GB of LPDDR5 ram this is defiantly the most powerful dedicated android handheld on the market but is it better than the Steam deck or even the Nintendo switch? We do an unboxing of the Razer Edge Wifi, run some benchmarks test some android games like Genshin impact and finally wrap it up with some emulation like PSP using PPSSPP, Gamecube using the Dolphin emulator and even PS2 using AetherSX2!
