I don't get it. I've never got it. We're seeing a lot of it lately. Of course, there is a world of difference between it being one protester versus an angry mob of protesters (see <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/colorado-driver-hits-protesters-with-car" target="_self">RIOTERS ATTACK FEMALE DRIVER. SHE DRIVES THROUGH THEM, THEN TURNS BACK TO HIT THEM AGAIN</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/portland-rioters-try-blocking-a-truck-with-a-motorcycle-big-mistake" target="_self">PORTLAND RIOTERS TRY BLOCKING A TRUCK WITH A MOTORCYCLE. BIG MISTAKE!</a>). In the later case, the AG-FTB technique is most effective. It stands for "all gas, f*** the breaks."</p><p>However, sometimes it's a single person blocking you from making your way to work, home, or the pub. In that case, I feel this gentleman's technique is the most effective. Turn up the volume and as you watch, ponder the following ... what bad life decisions led to the other guy not wearing any pants. Make sure you're volume's up when you press play.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You want the volume all the way up for this one... <a href="https://t.co/iK2yFFzorA">pic.twitter.com/iK2yFFzorA</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1625625128729182210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Really, I can only think of six words to describe what it is we just saw.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

He actually walked all the way down the street, avoiding other cars and a bus, before deciding to stage his protest in front of this guy. His message was unclear. I don't see any signs of social justice, other than the nudity because at most protests there's usually a handful of naked people. Maybe there was a nearby "Defund the Police" rally and he got lost. Maybe the guy in the car owed him money. Or, maybe the naked guy is just a pervert.</p><p>Either way, that was a sweet punch.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Chelsea Handler Tries to Brag About Being a Childless Woman, But It's Actually Incredibly Depressing

Chandler began, "I wake up at 6AM, I remember that I have no kids to take to school, so I take an edible, masturbate, and go back to sleep." <em> </em>Such class.  </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Her day consists of "doing whatever the f*ck [she] wants," such as flying to Paris, meditating, a night out with "whatever hot guy" she met that morning, and climbing Mount Everest. She's desperately trying to make the point that, since she doesn't have kids, she has so much more time to be productive and useful to society. </p><p>This is one of the particularly depressing lies sold by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-lawrence-tirade" target="_blank">feminism</a> - that unless a woman is a slave to a cubicle 9 hours per day, 5 days a week in corporate America, she is not providing any value to society. In reality, procreating and raising up the next generation is one of the, if not <em>the</em> most important, tasks a woman can undertake. </p><p>Chelsea is 47 years old, single, and childless, and clearly not happy about it. A person who is happy with their decisions does not have to constantly justify them to the whole world. And this video is peppered with desperate attempts to justify her lack of children - "Hey look at all the places I can go since I DON'T have KIDS! Did you know I DON'T HAVE KIDS? Because I DON'T!!!" </p><p>To my knowledge, no one is telling her she should've had children or gotten married. It seems to be an internal pressure she's placed on herself and is now claiming to come from "society" so as to not have to deal with the regret over decisions she made during her younger years. Getting married and having children is desired by most women. So if, like Handler, a woman chooses not to, she will naturally be an outlier. It's not a "societal standard" that needs to be torn down. It's just natural. </p><p>Ladies, it's okay if you don't feel called to marriage and children. But please, don't follow the example of Chelsea Handler. For everyone's sake. </p>

## Activist "journalist" caught on hot mic saying what she wants to do to Ron DeSantis, Team DeSantis wrecks her face

<p>My mind is usually in the gutter, so mayhaps there is an innocent translation to this photo. Let me know what you see.

## New Study Blames Lack of Woodland Creatures on Racism Because We Live in a Clown World

No one is forcing anyone to live in an area lacking in woodland creatures. I personally would like more woodland creatures around where I live, but moving isn't in the cards for me right now. One day, however, I plan to live somewhere surrounded by woodland creatures. And, according to this study, white people, since those two apparently go hand-in-hand. </p>

## Watch: Byron Donalds answers young conservative on how to respond when leftists, media take away your "black card"

Byron Donalds spoke earnestly at a YAF conference this past weekend when asked how best, as a black conservative, to regain your "black card." Black Americans are expected to believe and act a certain way politically. And if they don't, their blackness gets called into question. Ironically enough, more often than not, from white progressives who claim <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wesley-hunt-border-crisis" target="_blank">everyone else is racist</a>. Something else <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-calls-out-democrats" target="_blank">Donalds has no patience for</a>.</p><p>Donalds got serious because a number of leftists attempted to take his black card away from him in 2023 alone.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Students ask <a href="https://twitter.com/ByronDonalds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@byrondonalds</a> on being a black Conservative: "You just gotta be authentic...it starts to push our politics which is why the left can't stand us. Because if Black people start voting [conservative, leftist ideologies] have to change b/c it will die on the vine." <a href="https://t.co/Lt3BhjJLHz">pic.twitter.com/Lt3BhjJLHz</a><br />— YAF (@yaf) <a href="https://twitter.com/yaf/status/1624439352360312833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Donalds says the key is authenticity because, contrary to what you hear in the media, Black America is very conservative. "And if you have more black people who say 'I'm conservative, but I'm still who I am' it gives a lot of people in the black community a place to say, 'I like that dude. I can mess with him. He's being honest. He's being direct.' The caricature of the 'black Republican?' That's not me."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9adb8" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33023874&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Donalds went on to say, "You can't try to put on a facade on for somebody. You can't play up to this base or that base." He adds that by staying raw and uncut, "it starts to shift our politics which is why the left can't stand us. Because if Black people start voting Republican in larger numbers, Democrat politics will have to change because it will die on the vine."</p><p>What the young conservative describes is something Donalds has experienced in the past two months. The congressman has been accused of having <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-reporter-cori" target="_blank">an Uncle named Thomas who is very cross</a> with him while others <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-wife-erika-twitter" target="_blank">attacked HIS WIFE for the color of her skin</a>. All for the crime of *checks notes* allowing his name to be nominated for Speaker of the House <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-mccarthy-cuts-deal" target="_blank">in order to continue a debate</a>.</p><p>As Donalds says in his speech, everyone is going to have an opinion so make sure they have an opinion about you. When the hate and the attacks come, all it means is you're over the target so keep going.</p><p><p>

## Jalen Hurts shares powerful message to junior reporter on "lessons learned" in soul-crushing Super Bowl loss

Jalen Hurts led the Eagles to a two-score lead going into the half as the Chiefs looked like they forgot how to play football. Then Patrick Mahomes remembered "I'm Patrick Mahomes, dammit" and the Eagles lost 38-35. Some say it was a questionable holding call that led the Chiefs to victory. Others like LwC Senior Foreign Policy Correspondent Lane Kendall say I'm just being <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/damar-hamlin-nfl-honors" target="_blank">bitter about the Bills</a>.</p><p>After the loss, Jalen Hurts proved what kind of a competitor and a man he is. Fifteen-year-old podcaster Giovanni, Hurts' #1 fan, asked Jalen what lesson he'll take from the loss. The QB's response was powerful.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Last question of the night to Jalen Hurts is from <a href="https://twitter.com/GioThePodcaster?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GioThePodcaster</a>. “What is one lesson that you learned from this game that you’ll take on to the next?” <br /><br />A smile and a heartfelt answer from the Eagles QB. <a href="https://t.co/AjhZvbwYSk">pic.twitter.com/AjhZvbwYSk</a><br />— Nick King (@NickKingSports) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickKingSports/status/1624992529077911552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Hurts told the young podcaster, "Obviously, we had a big-time goal we wanted to accomplish and we came up short. I think the beautiful part about it is everyone experiences different pains, experiences different agonies of life. But, you decide if you want to learn from it. You decide if you want it to be a teachable moment and I know what I want to do."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="100b1" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33023208&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Strong words that I pray all young competitors and athletes take to heart. "It doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you play the game" is bootycheeks. Of course, it matters if you win. Otherwise, there is no point in playing the game. If it doesn't matter if you win or lose, you're the loser.</p><p>However, there is something to say about how you are either winning or you are learning. There is no shame in losing, as long as you leave it all out on the field. Someone has to lose. This time, it was the Philadelphia Eagles. But what lessons do you take from that loss that you then apply to make sure the next time you're the one winning? That's how champions are made.</p><p>Cheers to Jalen Hurts, who I'm sure wanted to be anywhere else, taking the time to share that message with his young fans watching. The amazing thing is those fans get to spend the next fifteen years or so so watch Hurts applying those lessons and being the one holding the Lombardi trophy while some other QB is stuck in the press conference.</p><p><p>

</p><p>According to Mr. Green and his sources, there are three reasons "they" have us talking about UFOs now.</p><p>- The Jeffrey Epstein guest list is coming out, exposing all the elitists who hung out on what critics call "Pedophile Island." On a related note, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself. But you might want to do a welfare check on Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>- The chemical spill in Palestine, Ohio that some are saying could rival Chornobyl. It happened over a week ago, but corporate media has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pete-buttigieg-train-derailment" target="_self">only gotten around to covering it now after TikTokers forced their hand</a>.</p><p>- And, of course, World War 3...which will only be prevented as long as we continue to give Zelinskyy all the money.</p><p>As of this writing, it is unknown if Green has been disappeared. Or at the very least, sent to "rehab" by his personal trainer. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website will continue to monitor the situation as we pray for Tom Green's well-being.</p><p><p>
