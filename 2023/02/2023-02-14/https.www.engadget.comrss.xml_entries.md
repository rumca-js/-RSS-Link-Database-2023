<p>TuneIn is adding a new way for users to discover the more than 100,000 radio stations available to stream on its service. This week, the company – in honor of World Radio Day, which fell on February 13th – began rolling out <a href="https://tunein.com/explorer/"><ins>TuneIn Explorer</ins></a> (via <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/tunein-explore-google-earth-radio-station-discovery-map-ui/"><em><ins>Android Police</ins></em></a>).</p><p>The feature plots everything TuneIn offers on an interactive map allowing you to see where some of the world’s most famous radio stations are based out of. You can access the map by visiting TuneIn’s website on your computer or mobile device. The company has included handy filters along the top of the interface, allowing you to narrow down the stations you see based on genre and language. You can apply multiple filters if you want more specific results. The map also includes a search feature and even displays emergency broadcast stations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There’s no word yet on when the feature will arrive in the TuneIn app. In the meantime, we can imagine a few fun use cases for the map. You could turn to it if you want to rediscover a radio station from your hometown or as a way to immerse yourself in a language you want to learn.</p>

## Google Fiber launches 5Gbps service for $125 per month

<p>Google Fiber is <a href="https://fiber.googleblog.com/2023/02/fall-in-love-with-fast-5-gig-is-here.html">launching</a> the 5Gbps internet plan it began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fiber-5gbps-8gbps-plans-170026013.html">testing</a> in October. The service will initially cover four cities, but Google says the $125-per-month service will expand to other areas later this year.</p><p>The new plan is available today in <a href="http://fiber.google.com/cities/kansascity/">Kansas City,</a><a href="https://fiber.google.com/cities/westdesmoines/">West Des Moines</a> and Fiber’s <a href="https://fiber.google.com/cities/saltlakecity/">Utah cities</a>. It has symmetrical upload and download rates, an upgraded 10 Gig Fiber Jack (the small box housing the fiber cable’s entrance into your home), professional installation, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-03-the-next-generation-of-wireless-internet-will-be-called-wifi-6.html">WiFi 6</a> router and up to two mesh network extenders.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although 5Gbps speeds could be overkill for most households, they could come in handy for creative professionals, gamers or others who need minimal latency or transfer large files frequently. For example, a 150GB <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> download that takes 11 minutes at 2Gbps would only take about three minutes at 6Gbps (under ideal conditions, anyway).</p><p>The upgraded speeds are part of Google’s rejuvenated focus on Fiber. The company also recently <a href="https://fiber.google.com/blog/2022/08/whats-next-for-google-fiber.html">announced</a> its first network expansion in years. But, perhaps more crucially, it reestablishes Fiber as an industry disrupter pushing competitors to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-09-att-1gbps-fiber-internet-austin-texas-official.html">upgrade speeds</a> and lower prices (maybe) on existing plans. Comcast already offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/comcast-10g-internet-test-6-gbps-hit-download-speeds-143925568.html">6Gbps service</a> in some areas, but it costs a whopping $300 and doesn’t include symmetrical uploads.</p><p>Google also reiterated that Fiber’s 8Gbps option, also announced late last year, is still “coming soon.” That service will also include symmetrical uploads and downloads.</p>

## Instagram shuts down live shopping on March 16th

<p>Meta isn't done <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-live-shopping-ends-october-2022-202501693.html">pulling back some of its shopping features</a>. Instagram has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2hlbHAvaW5zdGFncmFtLzExODk2MDA2MTEzOTM2MDY_aGVscHJlZj1mYXFfY29udGVudCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmMwYmUyYzUtYjczMi00MWRlLWI3YzItYjA2MTI1OTJjYThiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeH9r1LXONoQsnIEWeQPShmbV4DKHv3mLmaaQzbm5SK3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F1189600611393606%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content">warned</a> users that live shopping will shut down on March 16th. From that day on, shops can't tag products during livestreams — you'll have to wait until afterward (or rely on less-than-elegant links) to buy must-have items. The social network explained the move as a way to "help [it] focus" on core features.</p><p>The move comes right as Instagram is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-home-screen-removes-shopping-tab-204954955.html">removing the shopping tab</a> from the home screen, and months after Facebook wound down Live Shopping and pointed stores toward Reels. Shopping is still part of these social media apps in posts, Reels and Stories, but Meta has increasingly taken a back-to-basics approach. Live shopping first reached Instagram in 2020, right as many people were forced to shop online during the pandemic.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The decision isn't surprising. Meta is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-billion-meta-q4-2022-earnings-223814979.html">looking for ways to cut costs</a> as a tough economy and an expensive metaverse pivot affect its bottom line, and it's particularly eager to slash initiatives that perform poorly. As <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/instagram-online-shopping-meta-influencers-ads-1850113601">explains</a>, that might include Instagram's live shopping. Social-based shopping was only expected to represent five percent of US e-commerce in 2022, according to Insider Intelligence. If that's true, Meta isn't earning much from purchases during live broadcasts.</p><p>Meta isn't alone in struggling with shopping features. TikTok was set to bring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-live-shopping-us-talkshoplive-200040748.html">live shopping to North America</a> late last year, but only using outsourced technology. <em>The Financial Times</em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/07b75caf-b2ab-4ace-9bb8-68d42f1da823">sources</a> claimed last summer that TikTok was scaling back its plans between a poor UK uptake and a mass exodus of employees. Simply speaking, there may not be as much of an audience for social shopping as tech giants expect.</p>

## James Webb telescope captures a Milky Way-like galaxy a billion light-years away

<p>Astronomers at the European Space Agency (ESA) used the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-first-targets-images-data-172517196.html">James Webb Space Telescope</a> to capture an image of a spiral galaxy that resembles our home, the Milky Way. The star system, LEDA 2046648, sits a billion light-years away from ours in the constellation Hercules; it contains thousands of galaxies, trillions of stars and countless planets.</p><p>The ESA <a href="https://esawebb.org/images/potm2301a/">released</a> the picture on January 31 (<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8xMy9zY2llbmNlL2FzdHJvbm9teS13ZWJiLWxlZGEyMDQ2NjQ4Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA5YWQwMTc4LTA2YjMtNDlhZS05NGQ2LWRhODA0NTUxOWQ4NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVO9of4jrzSvfoCcGIUiNqp_ZGA5o73XuucE96G6tYPo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F02%2F13%2Fscience%2Fastronomy-webb-leda2046648.html">highlighted</a> this week by <em>The NY Times</em>). The space agency described it as a mere calibration image to “verify the telescope’s capabilities as it was prepared for science operations.” ESA astronomers snapped it on May 22, 2022, with the Webb telescope’s Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That ultra-powerful camera can detect longer infrared wavelengths produced by light from this far away. Redshifting describes the stretching of light’s wavelength as it moves away from us, increasing until it appears redder than expected. It occurs because of the universe’s expansion: Distant systems like LEDA 2046648 keep moving farther from Earth.</p><figure><img alt="Image that was taken with the James Webb Space Telescope showing a spiral galaxy at the bottom center, surrounded by more distant galaxies (appearing as blobs) and individual stars." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ee5cc1e0-ac9e-11ed-97e6-598f3680efd4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">European Space Agency</div></figure><p>Most of the visible blobs surrounding LEDA 2046648 are also galaxies, although several stars can be discerned by their diffraction spike patterns. Some objects in the image could be as old as 300 million years after the Big Bang. Of course, an image of anything one billion light-years away means we’re viewing the galaxy’s light from a billion years ago. So astronomers are eager to study early galaxies like this one (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/most-distant-known-galaxy-hd1-192050141.html">even older ones</a>) to help clarify the types of stars that condensed out of the Big Bang — and how supermassive black holes ended up in most galaxies’ centers.</p>

## IKEA made a smart air quality sensor to track indoor pollution

<p>IKEA already has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-starkvind-smart-air-purifier-table-080021160.html">side table that doubles as an air purifier</a>, but now it has a way to gauge just how clean that air really is. The home store has <a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/newsroom/2023/02/14/ikea-launches-vindstyrka-a-smart-sensor-to-measure-indoor-air-quality">introduced</a> a smart indoor air quality sensor, the Vindstyrka, that gauges particulate matter levels (those smaller than 2.5 micrometers), humidity, temperature and the load of gaseous pollutants. Ideally, you'll know if your cleaning or cooking habits are making you sick.</p><p>Vindstyrka works by itself, but it unsurprisingly becomes more useful when connected to IKEA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html">Dirigera smart home hub</a>. You can check air quality through the company's app, and have the monitor control other devices. It can tell a Starkvind purifier to ramp up the fan speed based on particulate levels, for instance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IKEA plans to release Vindstyrka in all its markets starting in April. The company hasn't revealed pricing as we write this, but the feature set suggests it will be more affordable than high-end air quality monitors (such as Airthings' $299 View Plus) that also track CO2, radon and air pressure. It may be a viable option if the temperature and humidity sensors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html">built into your smart speaker</a> aren't enough.</p>

## Hyundai and Kia release software update to prevent TikTok thefts

<p>Kia and Hyundai released a software update on Monday after a viral TikTok challenge taught users how to hack the vehicles. But for now, it’s only available to a selected one million vehicles, out of the four million cars that will eventually need the patch.</p><p>It started as the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/tiktok-challenge-spurs-rise-in-thefts-of-kia-hyundai-cars.html"><ins>“Kia Challenge”</ins></a> dating back to at least May on TikTok, demonstrating how “Kia Boys” use USB cords to hot-wire cars. Owners soon caught on to the widespread theft and began suing the car manufacturers for a lack of response. The class action lawsuit said that certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars lacked engine immobilizers, a common device that prevents car theft, making it easy to gain access, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/21/kia-hyundai-sued-after-viral-tiktok-causes-rise-in-thefts/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em><ins> reported</ins></a> last September.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Car owners of affected models like the 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue can visit a local dealership to install the anti-theft update, <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3768"><ins>Hyundai said in a release</ins></a>. The updates include an anti-theft sticker to deter attack, a longer alarm, and the need for a physical key, rather than just a push start, to turn the vehicle on. Updates for other affected vehicles will be available by June, and you can find the <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3768"><ins>whole list on Hyundai’s website</ins></a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Kia and Hyundai have provided about 26,000 steering wheel locks to vehicle owners to prevent theft, according to <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/hyundai-kia-campaign-prevent-vehicle-theft"><ins>the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ins></a>. NHTSA got involved in the saga after thefts sparked by the Kia Challenge resulted in at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities, the agency said, turning it into a matter of public safety.</p>

## Meta clarifies its use of AI in ad-matching with a redesigned transparency tool

<p>Starting today, Meta is rolling out a new version of its “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool. The company says the redesigned interface is meant to provide users with more information about how their activities on Facebook and beyond inform the machine learning models that power its ad-matching software. If you’re unfamiliar with the tool, you can access it by clicking or tapping the three dots icon next to an ad on Facebook or Instagram.</p><p>Once you have access to the updated tool, you’ll see a summary of the actions on Meta’s platforms and other websites that may have informed the company’s machine-learning models. For instance, the page may note that you’re seeing an ad for a dress or suit because you interacted with style content on Facebook. Users will also see new examples and illustrations that attempt to explain how Meta’s machine learning algorithms work to deliver targeted ads. At the same time, the company says it has made it easier to access its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2hlbHAvMTA5Mzc4MjY5NDgyMDUzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5ZDRiMzUzZi1jODU0LTRmY2QtOTc0NS04ZDAzZTAyMGU4OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYOmhMYQmHlQB4VCV2Vz47f5bKzMculddzd1EmHPU1K5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F109378269482053">Ads Preferences</a>. You’ll see a link to those settings from more pages accessible through the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/b3fbe630-ac98-11ed-beaa-4ed2add532d9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>“We are committed to using machine learning models responsibly. Being transparent about how we use machine learning is essential because it ensures that people are aware that this technology is a part of our ads system and that they know the types of information it is using,” Meta said in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/increasing-our-ads-transparency/">blog post published Tuesday</a>. “By stepping up our transparency around how our machine learning models work to deliver ads, we aim to help people feel more secure and increase our accountability.”</p><p>The company notes it worked with “external privacy experts and policy stakeholders” to collect input on how it could be more transparent about its ads system. Meta doesn’t say as much, but the changes likely represent an effort to ensure the company is compliant with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-agreement-digital-services-act-172049636.html">Digital Services Act</a> when it becomes law in 2024. The legislation has several provisions that apply directly to Meta, including one that mandates more transparency around how recommendation systems work. The law will also ban ads that target individuals based on their religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or political affiliation.</p><p>More broadly, the changes come after Apple’s ad-tracking changes in iOS 14 significantly hurt Meta’s bottom line. One early report after iOS 14.5 went live estimated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-users-reject-app-tracking-165309407.html">only four percent</a> of iPhone users in the US opted into app tracking. Since then, Meta has seen revenue growth shrink significantly. More recently, in combination with its virtual and augmented reality spending, Meta saw its first-ever revenue decline in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-q2-2022-earnings-203433373.html">second quarter of 2022</a>.</p>

## Meta's Oversight Board will take on more cases and make decisions faster

<p>Meta's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oversight%20board/"><ins>Oversight Board</ins></a> says it will review more cases and fast-track some within as little as 48 hours. &quot;Increasing the number of decisions we produce, and the speed at which we do so, will let us tackle more of the big challenges of content moderation, and respond more quickly in situations with urgent real-world consequences,&quot; the board <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/943702317007222-oversight-board-announces-plans-to-review-more-cases-and-appoints-a-new-board-member/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>.</p><p>Although previous versions of the Oversight Board's bylaws mentioned expedited reviews of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook/"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram/"><ins>Instagram</ins></a> content moderation cases, it has not used this process so far. Under the board's revised charter and bylaws, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/meta/"><ins>Meta</ins></a> can now refer expedited cases to the board with relevant information and an explanation as to why it felt an urgent review was necessary. If the board's co-chairs decide to take on an expedited case, Meta &quot;agrees to be bound by the board’s ultimate determination,&quot; the bylaws state.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A panel (instead of the board's entire 23-strong membership) will review expedited cases and come to a decision that's posted on the Oversight Board's website within as little as 48 hours. The board notes, however, that this process can take up to 30 days. The target timeframe for standard decisions that demand more in-depth reviews is 90 days.</p><p>The board won't take public comments into account for expedited cases due to time constraints. It might also choose to carry out expedited reviews of user appeals.</p><div id="c7759fb739204ccc9f5b514e12421c8d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have designed new procedures that will allow us to act quickly and maximize our impact in urgent situations through expedited review.<br /><br />Our expedited decisions could be published as soon as 48 hours after accepting a case, but in some cases it might take longer – up to 30 days. <a href="https://t.co/VhvM8NJGjp">pic.twitter.com/VhvM8NJGjp</a></p>— Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) <a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1625481865803988992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Meanwhile, the Oversight Board plans to publish its first summary decisions. It said that after a committee chooses a list of cases that the board may consider, Meta sometimes reverses its original decision. The company has done so around 80 times so far, mostly to restore content it originally yanked. The board notes that while it has published full decisions on some of these cases, they've largely been summarized in transparency reports.</p><p>Moving forward, a committee will choose some of these cases in which Meta changed its mind. A panel (not the full board) will review them and publish summary decisions. These will include details about the original decision that Meta walked back and they won't take public comments into account. &quot;We believe that these cases hold important lessons and can help Meta avoid making the same mistakes in the future,&quot; the board said.</p><p>Since it formed just over two years ago, the board has published 35 case decisions relating to moves by Facebook and Instagram to remove content or allow it to remain on the platforms. Last quarter alone, Meta users submitted 193,137 cases for review.</p><p>While it's unlikely that the board's latest steps mean it will review anything close to the full number of cases it receives, the group should be able to address high-profile, urgent cases more quickly, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html?uuid=fA43GOSemluuWLRn6855"><ins>Meta's decision</ins></a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html?uuid=6Uj02ReD0Le7TtGv5855"><ins>indefinitely suspend former President Donald Trump</ins></a> from its platforms due to his influence over the January 6th, 2021 insurrection.

<p><em>BuzzFeed’s</em><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicaprobus/what-are-ai-infinity-quizzes"><ins>AI-powered quizzes have arrived</ins></a>. Starting today, there are six for readers to try. As you can probably imagine, the majority are themed around Valentine’s Day. Want help writing the perfect <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahaspler/breakup-text-generator"><ins>breakup text</ins></a>? How about a brief <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/ai-romcom-quiz"><ins>synopsis for a romcom</ins></a> starring your favorite actor as you? Those are just a few of the “Infinity Quizzes” <em>BuzzFeed</em> has on offer.</p><p>Each works in more or less the same way. You pick the quiz you want to complete and then answer a few questions to give Buzzy the Robot, an algorithm based on OpenAI’s public API, the material it needs to generate a personalized response to your prompts. “It’s like having a really smart coworker that you can bounce ideas off of and collaborate with who is always available and never eats at their desk,” <em>BuzzFeed</em> says of the software.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the breakup text BuzzFeed's AI created." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c0073f20-ac8d-11ed-baf7-ed565608192d" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BuzzFeed</div></figure><p>According to the outlet, each quiz was created by a human writer who wrote the framing, headline and questions. The personalized outcomes you see are the result of Buzzy combining the inputs from both the quiz writer and you the reader. “It’s a collaborative effort and we couldn’t do it without all three,” <em>BuzzFeed</em> said. “Human creativity is always at the center of our work, and our quizzes, but with the magic of AI we can now create things that were never possible before, like infinite results personalized just for you.”</p><p>The results Buzzy produces are predictably hit-and-miss. I enjoyed the breakup text it produced, but it took a few attempts and a few different quizzes before I got a result that made me chuckle. More than anything, <em>BuzzFeed’s</em> Infinity Quizzes highlight how hard it is to teach humor. However, I will say it’s a better use of the technology than we’ve seen from <em>CNET</em>, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html"><ins>tried and failed</ins></a> to use an AI to write financial explainers.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the romcom brief BuzzFeed's Buzzy AI created." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/d4837510-ac8b-11ed-beff-e7068b095e52" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BuzzFeed</div></figure><p><em>BuzzFeed’s</em> foray into generative AI comes after the company laid off <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/buzzfeed-layoffs-12-percent-employees-1235451552/"><ins>12 percent of its newsroom this past December</ins></a>. However, it’s far from the only business turning to generative AI to improve its fortunes. In the same week that it came out <em>BuzzFeed</em> had plans to embrace the technology for both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/buzzfeed-is-the-latest-publisher-to-embrace-ai-generated-content-183129050.html"><ins>editorial and business operations</ins></a>, Microsoft announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-investment-expansion-152302151.html"><ins>multi-billion dollar investment</ins></a> in OpenAI’s text generation systems. The tech giant has since announced it’s working on AI-enhanced versions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html"><ins>Bing and Edge</ins></a>.

## Uber and Lyft driver pay isn't keeping up with soaring fares, study says

<p>You've probably noticed a steep increase in the ridesharing fares you pay, but your drivers haven't necessarily received the benefits. UCLA Labor Center researchers have <a href="https://www.labor.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Taxi-Commission-policy-brief-2.9.23.pdf">published</a> a study indicating that median Uber and Lyft fares increased by 50 percent between February 2019 and April 2022, but media driver pay only climbed 31 percent. The companies' profits reportedly jumped from nine percent to 20.7 percent over the three-year span.</p><p>The authors recommended that authorities cap the amount companies can take from passenger fare, with proportionate increases in pay and enforced minimum rates. They also call for increased transparency around both the rideshare commission and drivers' trip data. The study team further called for more detailed data, such as different ride types and surge pricing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companies object to the study's conclusions.  In a statement to Engadget, Uber claims the researchers made errors and that its April 2022 take was 16.4 percent. Government fees are 18 percent, the company adds. Lyft, meanwhile, tells Engadget pay has been "consistently above" $1,100 per week since the start of 2021, and that commission caps would "dramatically" increase fares and hurt lower-income communities.</p><p>Study co-author Vivek Ramakrishnan <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk7n3/uber-lyft-fare-hike-revenue-study">tells</a><em>Motherboard</em> the group purposefully excluded government fees, however. The project is meant to show the growing profits, not the overall price increases.

A judge recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nyc-court-blocks-uber-and-lyft-driver-pay-raise-205406394.html">blocked a pay increase</a> for New York City ridesharing drivers in January after Uber sued the city's Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) over an allegedly flawed methodology for calculating raises. That raise may still kick in following a March 1st hearing, but it's evident the companies aren't eager to adjust pay on authorities' terms.</p>

## Discord adds video to Stage Channels, its Twitter Spaces-like broadcast feature

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/discord/"><ins>Discord</ins></a> is expanding Stage Channels, its Clubhouse- and Twitter Spaces-style feature that puts a spotlight on a small group of speakers broadcasting a conversation to a larger audience. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-stage-channels-203930584.html"><ins>Stage Channels debuted almost two years ago</ins></a> as an audio-only feature, but that's all about to change as Discord is adding video feeds, screen sharing and text chat to the mix.</p><p>Up to five participants can share their video feed. Someone else can can share their screen at the same time. As ever, no audience members' audio or video will be broadcast unless they're invited to join the speakers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Because video uses a lot more bandwidth than audio, Discord has imposed some limits. Any server with the free <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server"><ins>Community features</ins></a> switched on can enable video and screen sharing in Stages with up to 50 people, including the hosts. Still, Discord points out that's double the maximum viewer limit for video chat in regular voice channels. <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ-"><ins>Boosted servers</ins></a> can have up to 150 people in a video Stage at Tier 2 and 300 at Tier 3.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot of a Stage Channel in Discord showing video feeds, audience members, a text chat box and a list of rooms in the server." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/65ff63d0-ac84-11ed-aaf9-bdb08b707daa" style="height: 712; width: 1368;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Discord</div></figure><p>Text chat, meanwhile, is the same as in voice channels. You can select &quot;Show Chat&quot; on the top right of the panel and ask questions or comment on what speakers are discussing. Additionally, moderators have the ability to only allow users with certain assigned roles to share video or their screen on a server.</p><p>Meanwhile, as you're waiting for a Stage to begin, Discord will now play waiting room music. If you'd rather not hear it, you can switch off the music by hitting the eighth note (♫) button.</p><p>Although Discord users won't be able to broadcast their video Stage chats to as many users as they can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-guest-star-discussions-podcasts-170027538.html">on the likes of Twitch</a>, this will surely be a welcome update for users. Folks have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-stage-discovery-portal-170039853.html"><ins>used Stage Channels</ins></a> to run AMAs, fireside chats, live podcast recordings, beatboxing contests and other events. Now, creators can use the feature for premium gameplay streams if they want.</p><p>Adding video to the mix gives users more flexibility without moderators having to mute and unmute too many people. It's useful for audience members too, since it'll be harder to accidentally unmute yourself during a Discord video presentation. Make sure your mic muting hotkey isn't one you press often, folks!</p>

## Google’s privacy-focused ad tracking solution hits Android in beta

<p>Google is rolling out a beta of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-22-google-proposes-privacy-sandbox.html">Privacy Sandbox</a> for Android starting today. The program is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-14-google-chrome-third-party-cookies.html">the company’s attempt</a> to blend user privacy with targeted advertising, something the search giant has worked on for years in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-takes-first-steps-in-rolling-out-androids-privacy-sandbox-180531055.html">planned shift</a> away from cookie-based web tracking.</p><p>One of Privacy Sandbox’s pillars is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-topics-api-privacy-sandbox-third-party-cookie-replacement-130049935.html">Topics API</a>, which pulls a list of your top interests based on usage. It then compares them to a database from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Google’s data. Partner publishers can ping the API, which responds with a list of interests to help serve relevant ads without sharing overly intrusive information. Google says stored interests are “kept for only three weeks, and old topics are deleted.” In addition, the data and processing are done on-device “without involving any external servers, including Google servers.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The beta is the first time Privacy Sandbox has been available publicly on Android. Google is still working on Privacy Sandbox for Chrome (here’s the <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline">timeline</a>), which it has been letting developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-begins-trials-of-new-privacy-sandbox-settings-in-chrome-130018874.html">test</a> for about a year. It says it received feedback from hundreds of companies, which has helped shape its approach.</p><figure><img alt="Popup on an iPhone screen, saying, &#x00201c;Allow &#x002018;App&#x002019; to track your activity across other companies&#x002019; apps and websites?&#x00201d; The choices to respond are &#x00201c;Ask App Not to Track&#x00201d; and &#x00201c;Allow." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/8e2971e0-ac2d-11ed-bdff-806c25d33966" /><figcaption>Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) alert.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Privacy Sandbox is Google’s answer to Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-now-available-170536951.html">App Tracking Transparency</a> (ATT), which the iPhone maker introduced in iOS 14.5. The feature requires user consent to track them across other apps and websites.  Google dismisses ATT as a “blunt approach” since it doesn’t offer an alternate way for app developers and advertisers to replace the lost income from cookie-based targeting.</p><p>Privacy vs. advertising is an arms race. When platforms like iOS block the old ways of profiting from ads, advertisers can (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-lawsuit-over-apple-privacy-rules-211450574.html">do</a>) resort to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-22-canvas-fingerprint-web-tracking.html">fingerprinting</a>: collecting seemingly innocent device information that, when pieced together, may identify you nearly as well as cookies. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to detect and prevent. Google hopes Privacy Sandbox will strike the right balance between privacy and advertiser / developer revenue.</p><p>Google says the Privacy Sandbox beta will roll out gradually, starting with “a small percentage of Android 13 devices” and expanding from there. You’ll see a notification on your device inviting you to join the beta if selected. After accepting, you can visit the new Privacy Sandbox section in your device’s Settings menu to view tracked topics and opt out individually. Additionally, the menu lets you leave the program.</p>

<p>In 1992, Matt Moneymaker had an experience that would change his life. Some local farmers had told him about a number of mysterious sightings deep in the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj12MUpSeE5KbzZScyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzAzOTgyNWUtNDQ5Zi00NTI3LTg2NGUtYjFmY2VhOGNkYmYyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARCGVPLzxAgKD_avKSXUBjDDey4tVXxOapgJs9ZfK08H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv1JRxNJo6Rs">forests of Ohio</a>. Without the internet or social media, Moneymaker did what you did back then: He placed classified ads in the hope that these witnesses might come forward and share their story and, crucially, the location where it had happened.</p><p>“I went to the area where they had seen one, and I found tracks. And we heard their sounds, and I was at that point very, very, very committed to getting some video footage of these things” he told Engadget. Those <em>things</em>? Bigfoots. “From those classified ads, I got a bunch of calls and was able to plot them on a map. And then I actually talked to some of the witnesses who introduced me to other people in the area.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the thirty years since that lo-fi expedition, Bigfoot research has advanced significantly. Today your typical “squatcher” (as they informally call themselves) is more likely to carry a GPS and night vision goggles than a compass and binoculars. Because in a world of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-price-hike-in-ukraine-144623737.html">satellite broadband</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hasselblad-x2d-100c-incredible-resolution-beautiful-imperfections-150029773.html">100-megapixel</a> cameras and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-tapo-c420s2-night-vision-security-camera-133047088.html">full-color night vision</a>, blurry photos are starting to look a little quaint. Squatchers need to up their game, and they know this.</p><figure><img alt="Finding Bigfoot's Matt Moneymaker debuts new drone technology during Bigfoot Basecamp in September 2022" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/502846b0-ac63-11ed-bfff-22269163320e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"> Allison Babka for CityBeat</div></figure><p>Moneymaker is no stranger to the hunt. He is the President of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (<a href="https://www.bfro.net/">BFRO</a>), but is perhaps best known as one of the main investigators on Animal Planet’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1948830/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt"><em>Finding Bigfoot</em></a>. The show attracted millions of viewers and made its protagonists celebrities in the squatching world. But Moneymaker now hopes technology, not cable TV exposure, will be the tool that bags him the proof needed to silence the skeptics once and for all.</p><p>“Scientists will say that all these sightings of Bigfoot are just actually… they’re bear sightings, and people are mistaking them for bigfoots, and it's just, that <em>never </em>happens.”</p><p>This was one of the first things Moneymaker explained to me during our interview and it turned out to be eerily prescient. Just days later, a new study <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e9b353f-2483-466c-93ba-e142a13fe4a3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Telegraph+UK&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTliMzUzZi0yNDgzLTQ2NmMtOTNiYS1lMTQyYTEzZmU0YTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMS8yMi9iaWdmb290LWJlYXItbG9jaC1uZXNzLW5vdC1naWFudC1lZWwtc2F5cy1kYXRhLXNjaWVudGlzdC11c2luZy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwMzk4MjVlLTQ0OWYtNDUyNy04NjRlLWIxZmNlYThjZGJmMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARWhAojJsxXruTkE-W5I2-L-UIMM4oB6ywmXrHfb_-df&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2F2023%2F01%2F22%2Fbigfoot-bear-loch-ness-not-giant-eel-says-data-scientist-using%2F">did the rounds</a> claiming that most Bigfoot sightings were likely just bears. The <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.14.524058v1">related paper</a> was technically published just before we spoke, but most media didn’t pick up the story <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bigfoot-has-a-very-simple-explanation-scientist-says">until after</a>.</p><p>As Moneymaker tells it, the reverse is true. “The very first thing their mind wants to compute is ‘it's a bear’” he said, adding “rather than, ‘this just couldn’t be a bear, this is walking on two legs and has long arms like a man and doesn't have pointy ears and a snout.’” Needless to say, for squatchers, they didn’t need a scientific paper to tell them that skeptics will assume most sightings were actually something ursine.</p><p>So how does a serious squatcher like Moneymaker think we’ll eventually put the matter to rest? The answer isn’t on the forest floor, it’s in the skies.</p><p>Last September, Moneymaker was invited to take part in the <a href="https://www.citybeat.com/news/squatchin-ohio-bigfoot-investigators-are-more-determined-than-ever-to-prove-the-fabled-creature-is-real-14051034">Bigfoot Basecamp Weekend</a> in Ohio. It was here that he demonstrated his latest tech concept for finding these elusive creatures. At its core is a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DJI&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NzkzNzJhZC02MDEzLTQ0MzQtYmRiNy1lYmM1NDg2YWY0Y2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGppLmNvbS91ay9tYXZpYy0yLWVudGVycHJpc2UtYWR2YW5jZWQ_c2l0ZT1icmFuZHNpdGUmZnJvbT1uYXYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwMzk4MjVlLTQ0OWYtNDUyNy04NjRlLWIxZmNlYThjZGJmMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAc9Z55QpTK2ucBb6tqEGjkFkbavxOJyHJu68nWqTVrs5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fuk%2Fmavic-2-enterprise-advanced%3Fsite%3Dbrandsite%26from%3Dnav">Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced</a> drone by DJI combined with Dronesense’s <a href="https://dronesense.com/">search and rescue software</a> with a little dash of people power.

That's revolutionary. You know, that's a huge difference in terms of it being accessible and available to common non-governmental entities” Moneymaker said.</p><p>The live audience was originally there to be entertained. But according to Moneymaker, it turned out to be another part of the equation.</p><p>“We had an open speakerphone with the pilot, who was a few miles away. The audience was able to watch all this on a very big screen. [...] And on a very big screen, you can see more heat targets. So the audience was able to help direct him toward heat blips, and he was able to move his drone closer.”</p><p>As the event was a successful proof of concept, I asked Moneymaker why they don’t do them more often. “Using one at the Basecamp event was probably the first time that a thermal drone had been used systematically at a Bigfoot area. And so we're gonna go back and do it again in October” he said, before reminding me that squatchers rarely get funding and rely on sponsors. “I guess the point is, we'd love to go out and do that right now. We're trying to line up a benefactor to help us do that.”</p><p>Unfortunately, no Bigfoots were found on this occasion, but representatives from the local government seemed impressed enough that they pitched Moneymaker an idea. “[They] were really interested in tourism development around paranormal things. They had success developing things for Ghost Hunter tourism, that it brought people to little places, forgotten places that nobody ever had a reason to visit.”</p><p>The inspiration for using a drone with a thermal camera came from the Netflix show <em>Night on Earth</em>. Specifically the behind the scenes episode <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2a170a1e-7e5c-4edd-b5dd-ea6d3bd9416a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Netflix&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyYTE3MGExZS03ZTVjLTRlZGQtYjVkZC1lYTZkM2JkOTQxNmEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZXMtZW4vdGl0bGUvODExNjg1MDUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwMzk4MjVlLTQ0OWYtNDUyNy04NjRlLWIxZmNlYThjZGJmMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaDs1KnJJHCYj-XnxliwqumUvm1NGqZdD6F9wD3GUUEC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Fes-en%2Ftitle%2F81168505"><em>Shot in the dark</em></a>. Much of the footage in that series wasn’t thermal, instead likely shot with something like Canon’s ME20F-SH which runs well into double-digit thousands for the body alone. But it was enough to spark the idea.</p><div id="7b2eb4b350ab4eadabc0f85e70b981cd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Still spinning from the Netflix series “Night on Earth”.

The next thing he recommended was the best drone you can afford. At least with these two items you have aerial visibility during the day and the handheld for night. Make sure the thermal imager can record, as military style scopes don’t always offer that and visual evidence is obviously key here.</p><p>If you were thinking about night vision goggles, Moneymaker recommends getting an IR illuminator. “Even <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=dac7e4a0-2160-405e-ab51-9a983d362ef2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FLIR+Systems&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYWM3ZTRhMC0yMTYwLTQwNWUtYWI1MS05YTk4M2QzNjJlZjIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmxpci5jb20vZGlzY292ZXIvb3RzL3doYXRzLXRoZS1kaWZmZXJlbmNlLWJldHdlZW4tZ2VuLTItYW5kLWdlbi0zLW5pZ2h0LXZpc2lvbi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwMzk4MjVlLTQ0OWYtNDUyNy04NjRlLWIxZmNlYThjZGJmMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAagL2bSr7W7HCXSYXLnEvDaUcpq87yjqtLR66_VfYBPo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fdiscover%2Fots%2Fwhats-the-difference-between-gen-2-and-gen-3-night-vision%2F">third-generation</a> military night vision, if you have an in very dark conditions and you don't also have an infrared illuminator then you're not going to see very far.”</p><p>Between budget-stricken squatchers and other enthusiasts there isn’t a huge number of folk out there actively looking for Bigfoot, which is why most sightings are accidental. Logic would follow, then, that as phone cameras have proliferated the opportunity to catch a Bigfoot on camera has grown along with it. Not so, says Moneymaker.</p><p>“That's totally naive and ignorant. Because most sightings happen when these things are running across the road in the middle of the night in front of a car. That's your common Class A sighting. So unless you have a dashcam running, which most Americans do not, then you're not going to get it.”</p><p>Data for US dashcam use isn’t helpful, given the amount of population living in non-Bigfoot areas, but in Canada, it’s estimated that <a href="https://theseeker.ca/2022/06/dash-cam-statistics-trends-in-canada/">one in ten vehicles</a> have at least one camera.</p><p>Moneymaker’s more enthusiastic about potential sightings from an unlikely source: Law enforcement. “I think there’s more potential that footage is going to come in, in the course of a law enforcement call and investigation than from us, because there's just more of them.”</p><p>And he’d be right. According to the drone center at Bard University, <a href="https://dronecenter.bard.edu/files/2020/03/CSD-Public-Safety-Drones-3rd-Edition-Web.pdf">over 1,500 state and local agencies</a> across the country are regularly using drones. That said, of that number only around 500 are using a model that supports a thermal camera. Even then, there’s no guarantee that they have one installed. This is at the state level, but we can be fairly confident that federal agencies <a href="https://dronedj.com/2022/10/07/dji-dod-drone/">are not using any DJI products at all</a>, making sightings by the FBI, for example, extremely unlikely.</p><div id="f2df876a23af4b2d8e12cacc5fb1757f"></div><p>Perhaps a more accessible technological tool is social media. The BFRO has a strong <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2dyb3Vwcy9CRlJPLmdyb3VwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzMDM5ODI1ZS00NDlmLTQ1MjctODY0ZS1iMWZjZWE4Y2RiZjIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfVMKIX1epnAvRMpPeFH3DxVVgyaPTEkjksuuugCjIWT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2FBFRO.group">presence on Facebook</a> which allows it to receive potential sightings from anywhere. Before, cases were logged on the BFRO website, but the advent of Facebook started putting these posts in front of people that might otherwise not have been looking for Bigfoot news. Now, sightings can be shared around a local area swiftly and other witnesses come forward that might otherwise have kept it to themselves.</p><p>But there’s a negative aspect, too: Social media is famously an incubator for hoaxes, misinformation and outright lies and when your subject matter is already considered by many to be on the fringes, trust can be squandered just as quickly as it’s built. Or at the very least it makes it hard to know what’s sincere and what’s just for clout. Moneymaker says it’s not uncommon to see compilations of mostly fake videos with the occasional real sighting mixed in.</p><div id="80514c56ef8a45018dc3f331cccdccb9"></div><p>And there’s perhaps an even more formidable foe lurking in the shadows: AI image creation. All those Dall-E pictures you’ve seen recently may seem like fun, but in the right hands, the same tools can create some remarkably realistic pictures. For example, the one below, created by Instagram user Bitsquatch who is very upfront that these are not intended to be interpreted as real in any way, he only does it for fun.</p><p>“What I'm trying to do is just sort of visualize some of these classic Bigfoot type stories and some of the legends and the kind of the, the greatest hits so to speak” Bitsquatch said in an interview on an episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bigfoot-society/id1453429066?i=1000582870263"><em>Bigfoot Society</em></a> podcast.</p><p>“When I first started doing this, I was gonna send some messages to the various Bigfoot podcasts to say, ‘hey, be on it, be on the lookout, because it'd be pretty easy to fake an image’” he added. “Trail cam images, for instance, are very easy to create. I've never posted one. But the few I did, were like, wow, that that could definitely pass as the real thing.”</p><div id="415fab39f433474abbda87741f766df2"><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;"><div style="padding: 16px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cibr_zgspds/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div><div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"><div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"><div style="width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cibr_zgspds/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Bit Squatch (@bitsquatch)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>For the squatching community, that means they’ll have to work even harder to have any evidence taken seriously. That, compounded by the lack of funding is forcing people like Moneymaker to get more creative.</p><p>“One of the ways we're hoping to be able to support this is with a monetized live feed of the searches, like you would have a monetized feed to a concert. That's a lot of times now what the younger generation does, they'll have a Twitch feed. So we could potentially apply that to what we're doing.”</p><p>If all this seems like a lot of dedication for something that the mainstream has very little time for, that’s because it is. But then, tell that to the team of scientists that recently captured footage of a black-naped pheasant pigeon. First documented in 1882, the bird had <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/11/lost-pigeon-found-after-more-century">long since been assumed extinct</a>.</p><p>A team of researchers from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy spent weeks on a rugged, remote island off the coast of Papua New Guinea, enduring extreme conditions. The hunt was proving fruitless, despite private funding and a high level of local knowledge. But, two days before the end of the expedition, the elusive bird was caught on a camera trap. It was a chance encounter that would change all of their lives, putting to bed 140 years of belief that the creature was nothing more than a myth.</p><p></p><p><em>Image Credits: Pictures from the Basecamp weekend in Ohio provided by </em><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/photos-ohios-bigfoot-basecamp-weekend-with-finding-bigfoot-star-matt-moneymaker/Slideshow/14053078/14053083__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!Hdr5W4WhoCcPmVBTdVgdJ6pMyG6j2ey9ZYZzZZWheldWSSCRKxXhbgZpeJ23_JXyhRzuSouiv3XBcD8$"><em>Allison Babka for CityBeat</em></a><em>.</em></p>

## Amazon plans to eventually 'go big' on physical grocery stores

<p>Despite pumping the brakes on some growth plans and recently saying it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html"><ins>lay off more than 18,000 people</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/"><ins>Amazon</ins></a> is still looking to expand its empire. The company intends to “go big” on its brick-and-mortar grocery store business, CEO Andy Jassy told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f132299d-3b31-4248-8ddf-81182c5930fc"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>.</p><p>Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-16-amazon-buying-whole-foods.html"><ins>bought Whole Foods in 2017</ins></a> for $13.7 billion, but the company is far from dominating the grocery market like it has so many other sectors. The company's physical store division accounts for 3.4 percent of overall business and has grown only around 10 percent since the Whole Foods acquisition.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We’re just still in the early stages,” Jassy told the <em>Financial Times</em>. “We’re hopeful that in 2023, we have a format that we want to go big on, on the physical side. We have a history of doing a lot of experimentation and doing it quickly. And then, when we find something that we like, doubling down on it, which is what we intend to do.”</p><p>Many of the layoffs Amazon recently announced were in its grocery division. It has closed several of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20fresh/"><ins>Fresh supermarkets</ins></a> and put plans to open new ones on hold as it tries to find a format and formula that works. Jassy noted that many Fresh locations opened in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and as such Amazon hasn't &quot;had a lot of normalcy.&quot;</p><p>The physical retail business has struggled on other fronts. Almost a year ago, Amazon said it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-closing-bookstores-4-star-stores-210240474.html"><ins>closing</ins></a> all of its bookstores, 4-star shops and pop-up locations across the US and UK. The aim at the time was to focus more on the grocery side of things as well as physical clothing stores. However, Amazon took a $720 million hit last quarter due to slowing down its grocery expansion plans.</p>

## European Parliament votes to ban new gas car sales by 2035

<p>The European Union is one step closer to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-member-countries-agree-ban-sale-of-gas-powered-cars-2035-140035763.html">banning sales of new gas-powered cars</a>. The European Parliament has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230210IPR74715/fit-for-55-zero-co2-emissions-for-new-cars-and-vans-in-2035">voted in favor</a> of a Council agreement requiring that all new passenger cars and vans produce zero emissions by 2035. The move also revises some 2030 targets. Officials will now require that at least 25 percent of car sales (and 17 percent of vans) are zero-emissions models if a company wants to qualify for incentives between 2025 and 2029. The incentive will go away in 2030.</p><p>The new rules task the European Commission with keeping an eye on real-world achievements. It will have until 2025 to develop a way to report data on the emissions of the &quot;full life-cycle&quot; of cars sold in the EU, and will track the gap between emission limits and real consumption data starting in 2026.

<p>Amazon-owned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoox-amazon-autonomous-robotaxi-153756758.html">Zoox</a> has started offering driverless robotaxi rides in California after receiving a testing permit from the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles), the company <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/publicroads/">announced</a>. Unlike the autonomous vehicles from Cruise and Waymo, Zoox's vehicles are purpose built for driverless taxi rides, so they have no steering wheel or pedals.</p><p>On February 11th, shortly after <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/publicroads/">receiving the permit,</a> Zoox conducted the &quot;first run of its employee shuttle service in Foster City, California, marking the first time in history a purpose-built autonomous robotaxi without traditional driving controls carried passengers on open public roads,&quot; it wrote in a press release.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="64830e7ed4e741f996d02952ee9f4a86"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>To get to that point, the company completed what it called &quot;rigorous&quot; testing with the vehicles on private roads. It also ran its L3 test fleet (hybrid Toyota Highlanders with safety drivers) over a million autonomous miles on data-gathering missions in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Seattle.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoox has been developing its unique vehicles since it launched nine years ago, and was acquired by Amazon in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-self-driving-acquires-zoox-090509371.html">$1.2 billion merger</a> in the summer of 2020. Its robotaxis, introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoox-amazon-autonomous-robotaxi-153756758.html">later that year</a>, are relatively tiny at 3.63 meters (11.9 feet) long, have passenger bench seats that face each other, four-wheel steering and can drive in either direction. That makes them highly maneuverable, but they can also travel at speeds up to 75 MPH and run 16 hours on a charge thanks to the immense 133kWh battery packs.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoox will now offer full-time employees robotaxi rides between its Foster City offices during business hours. &quot;As the company continues to advance its progress and secure additional government clearances, it will expand its service to the general public,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p>

## Tesla Autopilot workers are seeking to unionize in New York

<p>A group of Tesla workers in New York has sent company chief Elon Musk a letter stating their intention to unionize, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-14/tesla-autopilot-workers-launch-union-campaign-in-buffalo-new-york-tsla"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. It could end up being the first Tesla union if successful, seeing as previous attempts fizzled out before organizers could petition for a vote. The employees involved in the campaign are in charge of labeling data for Tesla's Autopilot technology at the company's Buffalo, New York facility. <em>Bloomberg</em> says the group is asking for better pay, job security and a better work environment that eases the production pressures placed on them.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers told the news organization that they've been skipping bathroom breaks, since Tesla keeps a close eye on their every move. Apparently, the company monitors their keystrokes to see how long they spend on each particular task and how much time they spend working per day. They also said that the company shut down an internal chatroom where they can air their grievances, such as the how Tesla handles snow days. It was after that happened that the group started talking about unionizing. They're now planning to distribute Valentine-themed materials at the facility with links to a website where employees can sign union cards.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The employees are working with Service Employees International Union affiliate Workers United, which unionized Starbucks cafes across the US. While Workers United has a good track record, the group still faces a tough road ahead, considering Elon Musk is known to be a staunch critic of unions. In 2017, he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-24-elon-musk-thinks-unions-are-bad-for-tesla.html">fired back</a> against allegations of poor working conditions at Tesla's Fremont factory and criticized the United Auto Workers (UAW) for inciting the company's workers to unionize. He said UAW's allegiance is in &quot;giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.&quot;</p><p>Last year, he also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-challenges-uaw-union-vote-tesla-california-factory-095755736.html">challenged UAW</a> to hold a union vote, claiming that Tesla's (non-unionized) factory workers have the highest compensation in the auto industry. And let's not forget one of his perhaps most infamous tweets regarding unionization. In 2018, he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-28-tesla-musk-tweet-labor-law-violation.html">tweeted</a> that there's nothing stopping Tesla's workers from unionizing, but then he added: &quot;why pay union dues [and] give up stock options for nothing?&quot; The NLRB asked Musk to delete his post, deeming it as a threat that employees would be giving up company-paid stock options if they join a union. The tweet in question is still live, and Tesla is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-tesla-violated-the-law-telling-employees-not-to-talk-about-pay-085124724.html">appealing</a> the labor board's ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An artificial intelligence agent recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/an-ai-agent-flew-a-usaf-training-aircraft-for-over-17-hours-185930689.html">flew</a> a Lockheed Martin VISTA X-62A training aircraft for over 17 hours. VISTA (which stands for Variable In-flight Simulation Test Aircraft) normally uses software to simulate the performance characteristics of other aircraft. On this flight during a testing period in December, however, it mimicked a human pilot. US Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) Director of Research Dr. M. Christopher Cotting said in a statement, &quot;VISTA will allow us to parallelize the development and test of cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques with new uncrewed vehicle designs.&quot;</p><p>This is the first time AI has been engaged in such a way on a tactical aircraft, Lockheed says.

Despite that weight, it includes two 5K (5,120 x 2,560) 90Hz OLED displays and six-degrees-of-freedom tracking. But some difficult choices have been made, too: You have to scan your face using an iPhone app (sorry, Android fans) to produce a custom-fitted design and buy custom prescription lenses if you normally wear glasses.

## The Galaxy Watch 5 will soon offer temperature-based period tracking

<p>Samsung has announced that its Galaxy Watch 5 temperature sensor will finally be put to use. The company has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-natural-cycles-partner-advanced-temperature-based-cycle-tracking-galaxy-watch5-series/">teamed up</a> with the fertility app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/natural-cycles-fda-wearable-clearance-232422042.html">Natural Cycles</a> to bring its temperature-based period tracking algorithm to a smartwatch for the first time. The feature will be available in 32 countries across Europe, North America and Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Galaxy Watch 5 users will get access to &quot;advanced cycle tracking through the Cycle Tracking feature,&quot; recently approved by Korea's equivalent to the FDA, Samsung said. Much like Apple's Watch Series 8, it will provide retrospective ovulation estimates and help people better understand their cycles, the company told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/13/23598042/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-natural-cycles-period-tracking-wearables"><em>The Verge</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since 2018, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-10-fda-contraceptive-app-natural-cycles.html">Natural Cycles</a> has allowed women to track their temperature and menstrual cycle to check fertility, and the company has said it's 93 percent effective at preventing unwanted pregnancies. The app has already been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/natural-cycles-fda-wearable-clearance-232422042.html">approved by the FDA</a> and European regulators to be used on wearables. The company tested it with Oura rings, but the algorithm apparently hasn't been used on a smartwatch until now.&nbsp;</p><p>Temperature readings are key for those trying to achieve or avoid pregnancy, as basal body temperature tends to increase slightly two to three days after peak fertility. With Oura's temperature sensors, Natural Cycles was able to cut out the need to take readings from a thermometer, and it will presumably do the same with the Galaxy Watch 5.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature will be integrated into Samsung's Health app, so you won't require a separate app to use it. It'll arrive to Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro users &quot;within the second quarter&quot; in 32 markets, including most of Europe, Korea, the UK and the US.&nbsp;</p>

## Toyota will launch a 'next-generation' EV under the Lexus brand

<p>Toyota has <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/38774342.html">revealed</a> its plans for the future under a new CEO, and it looks like the company is finally prioritizing electrification. In his announcement, new President and CEO Koji Sato said the automaker is going to create new electric vehicles unique to Toyota and Lexus, its luxury division. He also said that the company is developing its &quot;next-generation&quot; battery electric vehicles, which will launch under the Lexus brand in 2026. It's not quite clear what &quot;next-generation&quot; means, but Sato said Toyota is working on &quot;everything from the battery and platform to how a car is built optimized for BEVs&quot; while also expanding its current EV lineup.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lexus-lead-toyotas-push-next-generation-evs-incoming-ceo-says-2023-02-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, Toyota is getting flak for dragging its feet when it comes to embracing electric vehicle technology and for its reluctance to move beyond its hybrid models, such as the Prius. Sato explained during the press conference that the automaker's slow EV adoption was mostly caused by communication issues. He also announced that the automaker will continue its &quot;multi-pathway&quot; and &quot;omni-directional&quot; approach, which means it's not going to drop its hybrid vehicles anytime soon. However, Toyota intends to accelerate its EV plans under its new management and to take on &quot;a BEV-first mindset&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So far, the automaker has only released one vehicle, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-suv-concept-202644349.html">the bZ4X</a>, based on its e-TNGA BEV platform. The company previously vowed that it was going to be the first among the seven &quot;Beyond Zero&quot; electric vehicles it plans to release by 2025. Meanwhile, Lexus has yet to start selling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lexus-rz-450e-ev-platform-toyota-110544774.html">the RZ</a>, the brand's first model that was built from the ground up as an EV.</p>

A number of users have <a href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1625311285725351936">remarked</a> that the algorithmic feed has been showing a <em>lot</em> of Elon Musk's tweets and replies, whether they follow him or not. Twitter's CEO effectively confirmed the matter, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1625407245218648065">tweeting</a> &quot;please stay tuned while we make adjustments to the uh... 'algorithm.'&quot;</p><p>I'd assume that by putting &quot;algorithm&quot; in quotes, Musk is joking that a person, possibly himself, may actually be responsible for the change. That's not too far-fetched, considering that the Elon-forward feed arrived shortly after Musk complained about a drop in his own engagement and even reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23593099/elon-musk-twitter-fires-engineer-declining-reach-ftc-concerns">fired an engineer</a> over the issue.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2e0d0d0e67ec4bae9990fcb7d41007fb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Please stay tuned while we make adjustments to the uh .… “algorithm”</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1625407245218648065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Following that episode, Musk tweeted that a fix was coming after a &quot;long day at Twitter HQ with eng team.&quot; He said that 95 percent of his tweets weren't getting delivered to the Following feed due to an issue with something called &quot;Fanout,&quot; so that's now been shunted to another service. He also noted that the Recommendation algorithm wasn't working correctly, &quot;causing accounts with many followers to be dumped.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word yet on why Twitter went from &quot;Musk lite&quot; to &quot;all Elon all the time,&quot; but it appears that issue is being addressed.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-37-million-customers-data-062232994.html">T-Mobile</a> suffered network outages on Monday night, leading to intermittent issues with its voice, text and data services, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/t-mobile-down-thousands-users-us-downdetector-2023-02-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. Based on reports submitted to <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/">Downdetector</a>, over 80,000 subscribers in several areas in the US were experiencing problems by around 10:14PM ET on February 14th. T-Mobile <a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1625379725563813888">responded</a> to users' complaints on Twitter, initially to tell people that the carrier was working on a fix for the disruption and then to update everyone about its progress. Shortly after midnight on February 14th, Neville Ray, the company's President of Technology, announced that T-Mobile has seen &quot;significant improvement and are operating at near normal levels.&quot;</p><div id="5f07c96bd74448278639fd6cb29d323c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have seen significant improvement and are operating at near normal levels.

The outages also seemed to have affected not just T-Mobile's own customers, but people who use MVNOs that rely on the carrier's network, as well. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/02/13/google-fi-t-mobile-outage/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> says Google Fi users have also been experiencing intermittent access to its services, though they'll likely be able use them as usual soon, if T-Mobile truly was able to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
