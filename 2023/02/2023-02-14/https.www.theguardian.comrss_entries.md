## Inside Our Autistic Minds review – this beautiful documentary will make you see the world differently

<p>Chris Packham gives autistic people the chance to make a film about their life, and the results are deeply moving. It’s a charming, powerful watch that’s hugely intimate</p><p>‘What I see is different,” says Chris Packham as he introduces Inside Our Autistic Minds (BBC Two). The naturalist is in his natural habitat, a woodland scene, which looks lush and peaceful but is, Packham explains, a lot for him to take, because he sees not just a vista of nice trees but all the connections between them, the names of all the species, their possible animal and insect inhabitants. Sherlock-style graphics on the screen help to convey the information overload within Packham’s brain. “It becomes utterly overwhelming,” he says.</p><p>Immediately, we have learned a little more of what it can be like to experience the world with autism. This new two-parter doesn’t give us too many insights into Packham’s own thoughts, in the way that his gently revolutionary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/18/chris-packham-aspergers-and-me-review-brave-ballsy-film">2017 documentary Asperger’s and Me</a> did, although his interactions during the programme with others on the spectrum are noticeably different to the more familiar sight of him working with neurotypical co-presenters. This time, he is handing the mic to others – meeting autistic people and then helping them to make a film that encapsulates their inner life. It’s a gesture with results as valuable as they are beautiful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/14/inside-our-autistic-minds-review-this-beautiful-documentary-will-make-you-see-the-world-differently">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Academics and criminologists say we need to stop seeing non-contact offending as a ‘nuisance offence’</p><p>Wayne Couzens is the “worst case example” of why indecent exposure offences need to be taken more seriously, experts have said.</p><p>The former Metropolitan police firearms officer is serving a whole-life term for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021. At the Old Bailey on Monday, the 50-year-old admitted a string of flashing offences, including exposing himself at a drive-through fast food restaurant just four days before Everard’s abduction.<br /><br />Jennifer Grant, a criminologist at the University of Portsmouth, said Couzens’s subsequent offending shows why indecent exposure needs to be viewed as a serious and sexual crime.<br /><br />“He’s that validation of why we should take it seriously because we need to stop worst-case examples like Couzens,” she said. “I think every report of indecent exposure should be taken seriously and the number of reports not being taken seriously in this case is an absolute shame, because you’ve got a clear opportunity to try to intervene with Couzens.”<br /><br />She added: “It’s certainly one of the things that the research points to. Which makes somewhat common sense, is that if someone is continuing to repeatedly indecently expose themselves, especially perhaps gaining in confidence – which it seems certainly like Couzens was, going round and round that drive-through, doing it repeatedly, actually – then that’s screaming to you that this person is potentially increasing in risk and might escalate. He is an awful case example of what escalation can look like at its very worse.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/14/wayne-couzens-previous-offences-indecent-exposure">Continue reading...</a>

Otherwise, the 3-5-2 system makes some sense, as it allows Hakimi and Mendes the freedom they need to bomb forward, disguises a relative weakness in midfield, and limits any defensive running Messi and Neymar have to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/feb/14/psg-v-bayern-munich-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Performative government rhetoric on migration has handed an opportunity to the far right</p><p>The spectacle of a torched police van outside a Merseyside hotel, and a mob <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/12/knowsley-hotel-asylum-seekers-merseyside-andrew-mitchell">chanting</a> “get them out” at asylum seekers cowering inside, should provoke profound soul-searching in the Home Office. Amid evidence that far-right groups are monitoring hotels accommodating migrants, and after the recent petrol bomb attack on a Dover immigration centre, Friday night’s disorder in Knowsley must be a wake-up call. Performative politics in Westminster can have real-life consequences.</p><p>As the government seeks to leverage the small-boats crisis into a vote-winning asset, its rhetoric has shamefully dehumanised vulnerable and often traumatised refugees. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has notoriously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/01/an-invasion-suella-braverman-refugee-crisis-governments-own-making">depicted</a> the arrival of migrants on English shores as an “invasion”.

Rishi Sunak has made it clear that he would like to swiftly deport small-boats asylum claimants to Rwanda; sources close to him have suggested that Britain may pull out of the European convention on human rights, if the move faces legal opposition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-knowsley-riot-a-wake-up-call-for-whitehall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Letting more patients bypass GPs and refer themselves to specialists risks heaping pressure on a system already in crisis</p><p>It’s a story that most people in England are familiar with: you ring the GP to book an appointment and are put on hold, only to be informed 20 minutes later that all the slots that day have been taken. Many people are struggling to book GP appointments and therefore waiting longer to be referred to specialist clinics. Satisfaction with GP services has <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1764">fallen sharply</a>, and the market for private appointments is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=market+for+private+gp+appoitnments&amp;oq=market+for+private+gp+appoitnments&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i10i160l3.3266j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">growing</a>.</p><p>Labour plans to allow more patients to bypass GPs and refer themselves to specialists. For those with “red flag” cancer symptoms, who could otherwise be waiting weeks to see a family doctor, this could be an improvement. Research suggests that <a href="https://bjgp.org/content/69/682/e294#ref-6">survival rates for cancer patients</a> are lower in health systems that adopt a “gatekeeping” system of GP referrals. A screening app or digital checklist could filter patients with a breast lump, for example, and allow them to skip this step. People can already refer themselves to a sexual health clinic, and NHS England is planning to expand this for services where GP involvement is not “<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PRN00021-23-24-priorities-and-operational-planning-guidance-v1.1.pdf">clinically necessary</a>”, such as hearing aids and podiatry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/the-guardian-view-on-labours-plans-for-self-referral-approach-with-caution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is a harmful disconnect between the Tories’ education policy and the country’s economic and social needs, says <strong>Michele Gregson. </strong>Plus letters from <strong>Mike Tucker </strong>and <strong>Dr Reg Orsler</strong></p><p>As your editorial (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-arts-education-a-creativity-crisis" title="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-arts-education-a-creativity-crisis">The Guardian view on arts education: a creativity crisis, 7 February</a>) made clear, the creative arts are a cultural, social and economic success story for the UK, and yet they have been under attack for more than a decade. The essential contribution that the arts make to the health, wealth and wellbeing of the UK is clear, well documented and tangible, but this government continues to sabotage and harm our national interests with a myopic approach to education and cultural investment. Now, scientific and technical innovations are hailed as the key to economic growth with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/07/rishi-sunaks-whitehall-carve-up-merely-rearranges-the-deckchairs">creation</a> of a new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology last week, while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/07/key-appointments-in-rishi-sunaks-cabinet-reshuffle?amp">refocused</a>” and reduced. The “arts premium” funding <a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/government-ditches-90m-school-arts-premium-manifesto-pledge/">promised in 2020</a> did not materialise, we have a national curriculum that is unfit for purpose and we are still waiting for a cultural education plan.</p><p>Why is there such a harmful disconnect between education policy and economic and civic needs? With a 40% fall in GCSE arts entries since 2010, how exactly does the government intend to secure the talent pipeline into our vital creative industries? Arts subjects are disappearing from the curriculum in England at a frightening rate, and we should all be alarmed. The damage goes far beyond the economic; it requires a long-term coherent plan and investment in creative arts education. We know that governments often struggle to value what they can’t easily measure. This government appears to be incapable of valuing even the things that it can. <br /><strong>Michele Gregson</strong><br /><em>CEO, National Society for Education in Art and Design</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/14/invest-in-arts-subjects-to-protect-our-childrens-futures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rudd returns in his incredible shrinking suit to meet Kang the Conqueror and a teen sucked into the subatomic Quantum Realm, but familiar joys are absent</p><p>Something big is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, albeit on an infinitesimal scale. Quantumania is the third film in the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced-dad ex-con with an incredible shrinking suit, but the first<em> </em>film in Phase Five of the MCU’s overarching, 31-movies-20-TV-shows-and-counting narrative. And that’s significant. Even if it would take an advanced degree in molecular physics to work through the implications.</p><p>Far easier to focus on this sunny day in San Francisco, where Scott (Rudd) and the rest of the beautifully blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family are living out their happy post-Blip lives. That is until some teen tinkering with a MacGuffin machine gets them sucked into the subatomic “Quantum Realm”. What does that mean? For one, it means more screen time with Michelle Pfeiffer who, as OG quantum-explorer Janet van Dyne, does an excellent job of grounding all the wacky sci-fi in emotional reality. She’s just a guilt-ridden working mom who hopes keeping her own past traumas hidden will protect her family (it won’t.

In the short time that he has been in the public eye, the 34-year-old Republican congressman from New York has been accused of fabricating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/02/george-santos-lies-new-york-congressman">almost every facet of his life</a>. During his election campaign, Santos claimed to be a “<a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/529798/george-santos-jewish-american-republican-congress/">proud American Jew</a>” whose grandparents “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/politics/george-santos-geneaology/index.html">survived the Holocaust</a>”. After being challenged on this, however, Santos clarified that he was raised Catholic and argued that he had always said he was “Jew-ish”. Emphasis on the ish.</p><p>What else has he lied about? Well, how long have you got? His education and work history appear to be fabrications. He has said his mother was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/records-show-george-santos-mom-wasnt-us-sept-11-rcna66411">working in the World Trade Center on 9/11</a>, yet records show she was in Brazil.

<p>He’s built a cannabis farm, invented a biker gang, and created an immersive warren of 15 sinister rooms. As he opens a landmark retrospective, the installation artist invites us into his curiosity-crammed studio</p><p></p><p></p><p>The first time I ever saw Mike Nelson, in 2005, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/10/art">he emerged</a> – bearded, scruffy, affable, resembling a jobbing builder rather than most people’s idea of an artist – from a warren of a building beside a former morgue in Margate, Kent. He was transforming a burnt-out cannabis farm into a vast and eerie re-creation of a functioning cannabis farm (except with non-narcotic plants), and he was stressed by how impossible the task was. Nearly 20 years on he is bearded, scruffy, affable and still stressed by the impossibility of the task ahead: this time, a grand survey of his work to date, for the Hayward Gallery in London. “I’m excited to be doing it but I’ve been dreading it as well,” he says.</p><p>It is hardly surprising, given the ambition of his works. One of his most famous, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/jun/14/mike-nelson-coral-reef-masterpiece">The Coral Reef</a>, which he made at the end of 1999 at Matt’s Gallery in London and again a decade later at Tate, consisted of a maze of 15 extraordinarily detailed and atmospheric rooms – among them a security surveillance office, a drug users’ den, and a mechanic’s workshop.

In 2018, in Parma, he filled a huge Mussolini-era building – the Palazzo dell’Agricoltore, or the House of the Farmer – with the detritus of an acre of scrubland cleared for farming – “piles of branches that were almost like twisted bowels and limbs, that were almost anthropomorphic, set in this rationalist architecture,” as he puts it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/14/i-made-an-exhibition-for-dogs-enter-the-strange-alternative-universes-of-artist-mike-nelson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Iraq war demonstration ignited a campaigning passion for some, but others were left disillusioned</p><p>Twenty years ago, Louise Barter took a coach up to London to attend her first demonstration. As she took her place in the ocean of protesters stretching from Embankment to Hyde Park on that cold Saturday, she was participating in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/15/politics.politicalnews">biggest political protest in UK history</a>. It changed her life.</p><p>Now a trade union organiser, Barter, 48, credits her politicisation to the historic 2003 Stop the War demo, when an estimated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/15/politics.politicalnews">1.5 million</a> people took to London’s streets. She remembers joining the rally with a woman she met on the coach from Hampshire who had not protested since the Vietnam war. “She said, I can’t believe we’re doing this again! I was really quite green to all of this,” Barter says. “There was a sea of people, and lots of different groups with slightly different reasons for being there. Though there were far-left groups, it felt like there were lots of normal people – not just really political people.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/14/stop-the-war-iraq-march-2003-protest">Continue reading...</a>

## The work from home revolution is here to stay – if you’re rich, white and live in London | André Spicer

<p>Hybrid work benefits both our professional and personal lives, but data suggests it has entrenched existing inequalities</p><p>A few days ago, I witnessed first-hand what working from home was doing to our society. It was a normal work day, and I rushed from my home to the local tube station. As I descended the stairs, I steeled myself for the usual crush of the Central line. But when the train whooshed into the station and I boarded, something seemed odd. It was 8.50am, I was heading into the City of London, and there was a seat available. In fact, there was not just one seat – I counted about 10 free seats on my carriage. Usually you would be lucky to find standing space, so I was trying to figure out what was wrong. I soon realised that it was Friday – the most popular day for employees to work from home.</p><p>During the past few years, we have witnessed a revolution in working life. When home working became more common during the Covid pandemic, many assumed this would be a temporary change. Yet according to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/characteristicsofhomeworkersgreatbritain/september2022tojanuary2023">data</a> released this week by the Office for National Statistics, between September 2022 and January 2023, 16% of the workforce still worked solely from home, while 28% were hybrid workers who split their time between home and the office. Even more than this – 40% – had worked from home at some point in the past seven days, compared with just 12% in 2019. This reflects global trends. A <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30446/w30446.pdf">survey</a> of employees in 27 countries found that working from home is becoming much more of a norm. Employees in this sample spent an average of 1.5 days working from home. The UK average was 2 days.</p><p>André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Bayes Business School at City, University of London.

## What women want: how the Magic Mike franchise caters to female desire

<p>In a sea of increasingly sexless multiplex options, the Steven Soderbergh-directed series prioritises lust and female pleasure</p><p>Magic Mike’s Last Dance, the third and final movie in the unlikely franchise about a male stripper from Florida, wastes no time getting to its point. The first lines of the movie reveal that Channing Tatum’s Mike Lane lost his custom furniture business – the raison d’être for his career as an exotic dancer – during the pandemic. He’s working as a bartender for rich parties where donors toss money at distant causes. Mike is a long way from the Xquisite, the seedy but beloved club of the first movie, nor the dimly lit sorority houses where he used to show up and undress as a cop. One former bachelorette party client recognizes him; she’s now a lawyer, and he’s a curious specimen from her past.</p><p>Within five minutes, Mike locks the door of an expensively glass-paneled room with Maxandra, Salma Hayek Pinault’s very rich, magenta-clad divorcee. Max has questions about his job; bartending, he explains, is “not really what I do”, an answer she parlays into a private dance complete with Tatum’s abs, several lifts and a sensual athletic feat involving a metal bookshelf. I was at a relatively staid, sober screening, and still the sequence drew titters from the crowd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/magic-mikes-last-dance-channing-tatum-steven-soderbergh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Super-high temperatures are the key to professional-quality pizzas, but there are ways to achieve good results with everyday equipment</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Can you make good pizza at home without a pizza oven?<br /></strong><em><strong>Joe, Preston, Lancashire<br /></strong></em>Yes, but it’s more a question of which style of pizza you’re going to have the most success with. “The biggest thing is the temperature of the oven,” says Rich Baker, co-owner of <a href="https://www.flatearthpizzas.com/">Flat Earth Pizzas</a> in east London, “because domestic ovens simply aren’t hot enough to achieve what a pizzeria does.” Joe might, he suggests, fare better with a grandma pizza, which is cooked in an oiled baking tray for about 15 minutes – “It’s ideal for the oven,” he says. But if you’re hankering for a floppy Neapolitan or crisper, New York-style slice, construct it in a hot cast-iron frying pan, then, once it has some colour on the base, pop it under a high grill until bubbling. “That’s the method I use if I don’t have access to a pizza oven,” says Nick Buckland, co-owner of <a href="https://yardsalepizza.com/">Yard Sale Pizza</a> in London, which opens its tenth site in Tottenham next month.</p><p>You’ll also need a good basic dough recipe, which happily requires only a handful of ingredients – flour, water, yeast, salt – although, Baker adds, you could also include sugar, honey or olive oil “to help it brown better”. Flour-wise, Joshua Ward, co-founder of <a href="https://palmspizzeria.com/">Palm’s Pizzeria</a> in Margate, uses 00 for his New York-style slices: “You want a fairly high protein content, because it helps build the dough’s structure, meaning it won’t tear when you handle it”; you could also use strong white flour, a mix of the two, or even add a little rye. Buckland also goes for 00 with “at least 13g protein” and, for three 12-inch pizzas, mixes 500g with 270ml water, and 1g fresh yeast (or ½g dry, active yeast in a little tepid water). He then adds 30ml more water, followed by 15g salt and 15g extra-virgin olive oil, and mixes for about 10 minutes, until it forms a smooth, elastic dough. “Fold into a ball, put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and leave overnight” at about 18C : “That’s the perfect spot between letting the yeast do its thing, but without it happening too quickly.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

New consoles, new technologies and, of course, new games are what drive headlines. So it’s easy to overlook one of gaming’s oldest companies and underestimate the sheer scale of its success. This month, Nintendo announced its quarterly financial results and said the Nintendo Switch is now the third bestselling games console of all time with 122.5m units sold, behind Sony’s PlayStation 2 (somewhere north of 155m) and Nintendo’s own DS (154m). As gamesindustry.biz journalist Christopher Dring <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1622891592569786368">pointed out</a>, it has beaten the DS on software sales, selling almost a billion games (994m) compared to the DS’s 949m. A <em>billion</em> games!</p><p>Nintendo is an entertainment company, of course, but it is also a tech company – and surely one of the most successful tech companies around, both in its longevity and cultural impact, if not its absolute market value. Yet it has never behaved much like a tech company. The tech industry likes continuous disruption and unstoppable growth, whereas Nintendo likes experimenting with relatively modest hardware to get the most possible fun out of it. The company remains years behind on online gaming, where Microsoft’s Xbox took the lead. It stopped competing with the PlayStation on the technical specifications of its games consoles back in the 00s. Instead of joining the mobile gaming gold rush of the early 2010s, it waited until 2016 to release its first smartphone games in partnership with mobile developers – and was rewarded later that year with Pokémon Go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/14/techscape-nintendo-innovation-tech-company">Continue reading...</a>

## Ask Me to Dance review – it’s love on the dancefloor in super conventional romcom

<p>Tom Malloy directs and stars as Jack, a divorced ballroom dance fan, who keeps missing Jill, also a dance fan, by minutes in this good-natured film</p><p>Written and directed by its star Tom Malloy, this low-budget comedy is likably offbeat, full of tiny kinks in every sense, with mildly surprising plot twists and supporting characters who are into threesomes, S&amp;M, and so on. But it’s also fully conventional in that like the vast majority of romcoms it sets out to assemble a heterosexual couple and eventually succeeds. The core romance is sutured when Malloy’s Jack and Briana Evigan’s Jill, two ordinary normcore singletons who both love proper ballroom dancing and swing, finally get to dance together at the climax. Honestly, it’s so brazenly obvious in following every rule of genre that it’s barely a spoiler to reveal it: the fun is in how they get there.</p><p>Naturally, the course of true love sputters and stalls along the way. In the opening scene, they don’t actually meet at the local dance club where Jill likes to go with her friend Patrick (Mario Cantone from Sex and the City), a gay man who’s happy to pretend to be her husband to swat away unwanted dance partners. But Jill is impressed when she sees Jack, a former ballroom dance instructor recovering from a divorce, busting a move with his friend Samantha (Julianne Arrieta). Jack and Jill miss getting introduced by minutes, a pattern satisfyingly reprised throughout – although their respective hopes are raised when both of them encounter (separately of course) a crazy cat lady on a bridge who predicts they will each find true love by the end of the year – which happens to be in a week’s time. Encouraged by different friends who all end up being guests at a wedding by the end, Jack and Jill go on a series of comically awful dates with people to whom they are quite unsuited.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/ask-me-to-dance-review-tom-malloy-briana-evigan-dancing-romcom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The messages of toxic, misogynist influencers can reach children more easily than ever – schools and families need to work together to prepare them</p><p>At the beginning of the year, it felt like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/feb/11/the-truth-about-andrew-tate-his-home-is-less-hollywood-hideaway-more-rundown-meat-factory">social media influencer Andrew Tate</a> was dominating all my conversations. My group chats pinged with alarm. At the school where I teach, colleagues expressed despair at just how <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/12/rapid-rise-in-andrew-tate-related-cases-referred-to-prevent-by-schools">far his misogynist messages have spread</a>. </strong>How had a man who many of us had never heard of until last summer garnered such a huge following, resulting in his content on TikTok being viewed more than 12.7bn times? Why were more people searching for him on Google than arguably the world’s best known influencer, Kim Kardashian? Why did his followers stand by him even when he claimed that rape survivors bear some “responsibility” for their assault? How, after #MeToo, could a version of masculinity so lacking in compassion, empathy and respect for women be so popular? The over-35s seemed blindsided – parents especially.</p><p>In the frenzy to regain some sense of control, many parents looked to schools. Courses for teachers on how to tackle Tate’s views were advertised, and sold out. In the WhatsApp group chat for year 6 parents at my son’s school, it was no different – “speak to the school” was the advice when I raised the issue.</p><p>Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writer focusing on race, politics, education and feminism</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p><strong>Park theatre, London<br /></strong>This interactive play by a former diplomat about working in negotiation feels like Debating for Dummies. Anderson’s off-script ad-libs are the sparkiest intervention<br /><br /></p><p>‘Thanks so much for coming,” announces Clive Anderson as Hugo Leitski at the start of Winner’s Curse. He’s accepting an award for his lifetime of work in negotiation. It might be an evening of celebration for Leitski, but for the audience, it is a party we’d rather have not got the invite to.</p><p>The premise is an interesting one. Leitski looks back at his career beginnings, where he is an assistant to one of the representatives from two fictional countries meeting to battle and negotiate over a strip of land. Written by the former diplomat Daniel Taub, who has negotiated peace treaties in the Middle East, in partnership with Dan Patterson, it should have the sense of something thunderous. But, crammed into a form that feels undeveloped and dry, the drama is unsalvageable.</p><p>Winner’s Curse is at <a href="https://parktheatre.co.uk/whats-on/winners-curse/cast">Park theatre, London</a>, until 11 March</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/14/winners-curse-review-clive-andersons-warmth-cant-revive-this-dodo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Almería was an off-grid paradise, but I like to think I’ve brought part of it back to the city with me</p><p>I take one last look at the lush valley below me. A tall palm tree sways in the soft warm breeze. A group of young people are working on one of the many vegetable and fruit terraces, their laughter mixing with the sound of water in the riverbed below. I tell myself that one day I will be back. But for now, it is goodbye. I’m leaving the eco-village in southern Spain, this cluster of old, whitewashed houses set in a green valley where I’ve spent the past six years.</p><p>My partner and I first arrived in Los Molinos – in Almería province, the driest part of Spain – in 2006, after a long spell in north London. Our experience of eco-living was limited to regular recycling and buying biodegradable laundry and bathroom products. In Spain, we had to learn how to live completely off-grid. All our electricity came from the array of solar panels in the garden, which meant we couldn’t have energy-hungry devices such as toasters and electric kettles. We even had to forgo the internet because there was no connection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/spanish-eco-village-paraside-leave">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Island settings, such as Enys Men and The Banshees of Inisherin, speak of the isolation and helplessness we feel in this era of pandemic and sociopolitical division</p><p>If cinema is anything to go by, it stands to reason that the further a place is from the regular thrum of civilisation, the more obscure everything becomes. The spiritual world feels closer, and supernatural phenomena more likely if nobody is around to interfere. And when there are fewer distractions to contend with, memories are replayed, minds wander, dreams contort into reality.</p><p>This, no doubt, is part of the reason why Mark Jenkin’s latest film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/enys-men-review-mark-jenkin-cornish-psychodrama-will-sweep-you-away">Enys Men</a> sees him venture offshore to a largely uninhabited island whose only resident is an unnamed volunteer (Mary Woodvine) tasked with monitoring the local plant life. Her routine becomes embellished with rituals of her own, like dropping a stone down a disused mine shaft, driven seemingly by metaphysical forces rather than any practical objective.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/cut-off-from-the-main-how-films-about-islands-reflect-our-anxious-divided-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this timely but unsubtle film, Jason Biggs plays a documentary maker who questions his ethics after his wannabe-gangster subject is murdered</p><p>This New York-set drama from 2020 was directed by Lanie Zipoy who died last year aged 49; it was on the ball in grappling with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement">Black Lives Matter</a> themes of systemic racism and white liberal guilt. The Subject poses thorny questions about the ethics of documenting marginalised black communities and what constitutes rightful representation – but proceeds at a dogged pace more suited to the stage (it’s written by playwright Chisa Hutchinson) and is perhaps a little too crude in setting up the character assassination of its hypocritical protagonist.</p><p>American Pie’s Jason Biggs plays Phil Waterhouse, an award-winning documentary director feted for his harrowing latest work, whose subject, wannabe gang member Malcolm (Nile Bullock), was beaten to death in front of the camera. Phil has reaped the benefits: a swanky apartment, where he cosies up with Latina girlfriend Jess (Anabelle Acosta), and a burgeoning career with a major TV series about ghetto life on the way. He seems smoothly post-racial, kicking it with the corner boys and extolling the superiority of “real” bodega coffee. But he has a self-flagellating secret: obsessively watching footage of Malcolm, stung by a blogger’s accusation that he failed in his film-maker’s duty of care.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/the-subject-review-white-liberal-guilt-is-big-villain-in-death-on-camera-drama">Continue reading...</a>

You wake, arms outstretched, pinioned by unforgiving hooves. The robin stiches the hem of the new day with his silver thread. Your heartbeat still races half a pace ahead of these unstabled steeds. Somebody died yesterday, you remember: they overslept the dawn. This is the first day with no bit or bridle to hold you in check, no reins to steer your journey.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/14/poem-of-the-week-second-sleep-by-hannah-stone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former Southampton head coach had a strange approach to building team spirit but he also inherited a weak squad</p><p>You’ve probably heard the story about Nathan Jones and the ping-pong table, but just in case you haven’t. It’s 2016 and Jones is in his first spell at Luton Town, desperately trying to instil a winning culture at an underachieving League Two club, and he decides that the squad table tennis league is becoming a problem. So he does what comes naturally to him. He burns the table down.</p><p>Perhaps my favourite part of this story – narrowly pipping Jones’s admission that he had to “smash the table up first to get it flammable” – is the way he rationalises it afterwards. “There was a big table tennis culture,” he says. “So I thought, ‘I can either cajole them and try to get them into the gym. Or I can burn the table’. It was far easier to burn the table.” In the mind of Nathan Jones, these are the only two options: persuasion or immolation. And after Jones exited Southampton after a chaotic 94 days, it struck me that this was roughly the same binary he applied to Premier League management.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/14/nathan-joness-exit-robs-us-of-the-funniest-manager-in-premier-league-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We haven’t had sex for three years, during which time an affair reignited my love of kink. Now my partner wants to reconnect but I find myself recoiling from her</p><p><strong>I have been with my partner for </strong><strong>seven years</strong><strong> and we have not had sex for </strong><strong>the last three</strong><strong>. For a long time this was due to her mental health and a period of intense stress and trauma. </strong><strong>During this time I flirted with other people and rediscovered my love of kink</strong><strong>, a love my partner does not share. This also led to an affair that </strong><strong>resulted in the best sex of my life. My partner now wants the relationship to work and to re-engage sexually</strong><strong> but, much as I love her, I find myself recoiling from her efforts. I also feel tremendous guilt that my </strong><strong>desire for a more kink-based sex life might destroy a </strong><strong>seven-year</strong><strong> relationship.</strong></p><p>It sounds as though you are on your way out of this relationship. You have difficult decisions to make. If you choose to stay, you will either have to give up your outside activities or continue them in secret. Whatever you choose, there will be a price to pay. First, you must try to find out if it would even be possible for you to re-engage with your partner, although your use of the word “recoiling” suggests that is unlikely. It sounds as though you have been hiding an important part of your sexual self for some time in this relationship. If we are not fully ourselves with a partner, the pressure of shutting off an “unacceptable” part can become too great and end the relationship. Provided your specific “kink” interest is a consensual one, try to be accepting of it yourself, and recognise that you deserve to be fully accepted by others.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>The story of Caril Ann Fugate and Charles Starkweather was painted as a teen couple on a murder spree but docuseries The 12th Victim shows that wasn’t all</p><p>The name Caril Ann Fugate might not ring a bell, but she probably lives somewhere in the recesses of your mind. Fugate was half of the teenage couple that set off on a murder spree in 1958, tearing across Nebraska and Wyoming and taking the lives of 11 victims, Fugate’s mother, stepfather, and younger half-sister included. The story captivated the American public, and became a meme before there were memes. Were it not for Fugate, who was 14, and Charles Starkweather, an 18-year-old high school dropout who cultivated a James Dean-ish mien, it’s likely there would be no Badlands or Natural Born Killers. The title track of Bruce Springsteen’s 1982 album Nebraska is sung from Starkweather’s point of view.</p><p>Bowlegged and barely 5ft 5in, Starkweather was every inch the ruthless rebel with his black motorcycle jacket and the cigarette that was a permanent fixture in his scowl. With her blank expression, Fugate was harder to read, even after Starkweather’s execution. Fugate was sentenced to life in prison, and images of her behind bars call to mind an Antonioni heroine: distant, subdued, unrepentant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/14/the-12th-victim-showtime-series">Continue reading...</a>

## A Small Town in Ukraine by Bernard Wasserstein review – on the border and at the centre of history

<p>In this touching account, the author traces his ancestors’ terrible ordeal while living in an ‘insignificant place’ that became a battleground for more than a century of conflicts</p><p>When historian Bernard Wasserstein was around nine years old, in 1957, his mother told him about Krakowiec, the “small town in Ukraine” his father’s family had come from and gone back to. At the time, he writes, it was located “smack on the border between Poland and the Soviet Union” – though, with the collapse of the USSR in 1991, it “emerged, as if from a cloud, just inside the newly independent republic of Ukraine”.</p><p>Wasserstein became fascinated by the place and, alongside his major study of 20th-century Europe, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/barbarism-and-civilization-9780198730736">Barbarism and Civilization</a></em><em>, </em>ambitious books on Israel/Palestine and many other aspects of Jewish history, has long tried to “assemble a biographical dictionary of every single person in recorded history who had ever lived” there. He has now distilled this somewhat madcap project into a compelling history, which pays tribute to his ancestors while raising issues that remain tragically relevant today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/14/a-small-town-in-ukraine-by-bernard-wasserstein-review-on-the-border-and-at-the-centre-of-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I lose time and burn up mental energy in pursuit of a dopamine rush that, as with all addictions, is a diminishing return. If only everyone else would join me</p><p>The problem with Wordle isn’t that some people use it to show off to strangers or that it’s especially time-consuming, or even that it’s a bit of a waste of brain, but the minuscule feeling of emptiness once you have done it. All that thrill of the chase collapsed into the meagre satisfaction of arriving at something you’re not even sure is a word, like “caulk”. That is how I got hooked on <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/">Quordle</a> – a four-word grid – just to delay the inevitable anticlimax. I cycled through <a href="https://www.spotify.com/heardle/">Heardle</a> (guessing a song, way too hard) and Worldle (guessing a country, in which I was mainly hamstrung by not being able to instinctively tell east from west). I had just enough discipline to avoid <a href="https://octordle.com/">Octordle</a>, in which you have 13 guesses to reach eight words. Then I discovered <a href="https://phrazle.io/">Phrazle</a>, in which you have to find a whole phrase. I’ll just have one quick go, I thought. I definitely won’t commit.</p><p>This enterprise is just daft. The world is absolutely rammed with phrases. I had one easy win – “Beware the Ides of March” on the first try – and then I was hooked. Now I can lose a sizeable proportion of my mental energy for the entire day, getting to “until the cows come home”. It doesn’t even mean anything! The whole experience is one of aching meaninglessness, chasing some combination of words that are either platitudes, demonstrably untrue, or long ways to say a thing that could be shorter. There’s no skill in it at all that I can make out. It’s not unusual for the phrase to contain so many weird combinations of letters that you have gone down a rabbit hole of whether there are any well-known axioms pertaining to the Balearic islands, before you finally land on “my birthday suit”. I can’t even bear to time how long it takes me, this daily three-act theatre of puzzling. “Word games” was not the addiction I expected so incredibly early<em> </em>in middle age. And the post-victory flatness, the diminishing dopamine returns, are still exactly the same – I’m just taking a more scenic route.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/how-am-i-spending-early-middle-age-playing-phrazle-and-other-mesmerising-word-games">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the biggest ever show of the artist’s work is unveiled in Amsterdam, we retrace the enigmatic painter’s footsteps in Delft and also The Hague</p><p>Dodging the oncoming bikes, I climb a low mound a few feet above water level and look across at the city. It is a clear evening: the horizon holds a delicate tang of orange that ascends, becoming royal blue, then indigo. In front of me is a quay where a few boats are moored; beyond that, an expanse of water, and then the city itself, a smudge of bare trees, steep gables and church spires. It’s pleasant, but scarcely dramatic, and yet I think that this view changed the way my brain is wired. In about 1660 an artist came down here and painted what he saw. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/vermeer">Johannes Vermeer</a> was not a famous man then, nor would he be for more than 200 years, but that picture, View of Delft, would prove pivotal in art history.</p><p>Delft is a small Dutch city of about 100,000 people, just 40 miles south-west of Amsterdam. It was carved out of low-lying land in the 13th century, then grew into a centre for printing, pottery and, by the early 17th century, fine art. Perhaps it was the light that inspired the painters: those big northern skies reflected in the canals and the contrasting shady interiors filled with men in black hats and women with pale, enigmatic faces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/14/discovering-vermeer-and-his-hometown-delft-the-hague">Continue reading...</a>

The huge postwar expansion in council-house building helped many families. But then those homes were almost given away to the lucky, devastating the next generation needing somewhere affordable to live.

<p>Director Gabriel Bier Gislason deftly combines dry Jewish humour with horror to create a surprisingly compelling and emotionally complex date-night thriller </p><p>For a horror film about the terror of demonic possession, Gabriel Bier Gislason’s feature-film debut is unexpectedly charming. Having fallen in love after an adorable meet-cute, Danish has-been performer Maja (Josephine Park) impulsively moves in with Jewish academic Leah (Ellie Kendrick), who suffers from a mysterious injury. Their romance is watched over by Leah’s ultra-Orthodox mother, Chana (The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl), who fusses over Leah’s every need with an insistence that borders on possessiveness.</p><p>The awkward interactions that spring out of this clash between an overbearing parent and a gentile outsider are portrayed with that entertaining dry humour of classic Jewish comedy, yet there are also darker forces at play. As Maja bumbles through a series of cultural faux-pas – imagine frying bacon for your Jewish hookup! – she also comes across strange clues, like small piles of salt strategically sprinkled around Leah’s flat. Is Chana actually nursing Leah back to health or is she manipulating her daughter through black magic?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/14/attachment-review-queer-horror-romcom-is-a-rare-valentines-day-treat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The cricket deals offered in India and recent financial developments in other sports are progress of a kind not seen before</p><p>It was only a few days ago that members of the Australian women’s cricket team were contemplating how best to navigate the impending “distraction” of the inaugural Women’s Premier League auction, scheduled during the first week of the T20 World Cup. “It’s a little bit awkward,” captain Meg Lanning said in South Africa last week. “But it’s just trying to embrace that and understanding it’s actually a really exciting time and you actually don’t have a lot of control over most of it, so you’ve just got to wait and see.”</p><p>What a pleasant distraction it turned out to be. Lanning herself will be $192,000 richer for three weeks’ work with the Delhi Capitals. Her teammate, Ash Gardner, will earn three times that playing for the Gujarat Giants. The allrounder’s figure of $558,000 is more than Sam Kerr pockets in a season with Chelsea and more than the WNBA’s top earner, Jackie Young.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/14/multi-million-dollar-wpl-auction-signals-huge-step-forward-for-womens-sport">Continue reading...</a>

## Banning ideas and authors is not a ‘culture war’ – it’s fascism

<p>The media’s framing of measures like Florida’s African American studies ban is a dangerous falsification of reality</p><p>A wave of Republican enthusiasm for banning concepts, authors and books is sweeping across the United States. Forty-four states have proposed bans on the teaching of “divisive concepts”, and 18 states have passed them.</p><p>Florida’s Stop Woke Act bans the teaching of eight categories of concepts, including concepts that suggest that “a person, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the person played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, national origin, or sex”. Many of the laws also target Nikole Hannah-Jones’s influential 1619 Project.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/13/african-american-studies-republican-ban-florida">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Complaint says switching off tracking devices should raise ‘red flags’ with insurers, as it could be covering illegal fishing activity and puts crew’s lives at risk</p><p>When it comes to illegal fishing, London’s ancient business of ship insurance may not get much attention. But according to a new complaint, the UK capital’s insurance industry is partly to blame when fishing vessels “go dark” at sea by turning off their mandatory satellite tracking equipment.</p><p>In a filing to City of London watchdogs, the ocean conservation charity Blue Marine Foundation has argued that EU-flagged vessels operating in the Indian Ocean that go dark are in likely breach of international, flag state and coastal state law, and that the UK insurance industry is “enabling” them by continuing to provide cover, thereby putting seafarers’ lives at risk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/14/london-ship-insurers-accused-of-enabling-fishing-vessels-to-go-dark">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He had a bad back, our holiday to Naples had been cancelled and we decided to stay in with a Chinese takeaway. While my hands were covered in grease, his were sweaty with nerves</p><p>I don’t go on many holidays. As a freelance journalist, I’m always paranoid about being forgotten by the time I’ve set up my out-of-office. But in late 2019, I figured I would run that risk. I booked a trip to Naples with my boyfriend, Ben. We found an Airbnb, planned a trip to one of the nearby islands and meticulously mapped out all the best pizza restaurants within a 20-mile radius.</p><p>A week or so before we were due to leave, however, Ben put his back out. A last-ditch attempt to snap it back into shape via a trained professional only made things much, much worse. At this rate, he wouldn’t be able to leave the house, let alone the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/14/my-most-romantic-moment-i-thought-my-boyfriend-had-indigestion-he-was-actually-about-to-propose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Years as a therapist have taught me that silence ruins relationships. So forget the cards and the roses and celebrate each other</p><p>I popped into my local newsagent last week to pick up a copy of the Guardian newspaper and, as I stood in the queue, I realised I was standing next to a rack of Valentine’s Day cards.</p><p>I began to browse and was struck by how many of the cards were humorous. Some were just silly – “dim sum-body say it’s Valentine’s Day?”, or there was one with a couple in the bathroom – “Roses are red, violets are blue, you shave your legs while I do a poo!” But to my surprise, there were also a lot of cards that were very explicit – “Roses are red, I’m shit at poems. Fancy a shag?” These cards had a laddish, rather adolescent quality.</p><p>Susanna Abse is a couple psychotherapist and author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/tell-me-the-truth-about-love-9781529107333">Tell Me the Truth About Love</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/partner-love-them-valentines-day-therapist-relationships-cards-roses">Continue reading...</a>

The Weinermobiles are driven across the nation by “hotdoggers” who claim the job for a one-year assignment. The morning after the converter was taken, the Weinermobile was towed to a nearby auto repair shop where mechanics installed a temporary converter that would allow the Weinermobile’s crew to drive it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/13/weinermobile-in-a-pickle-after-falling-victim-to-catalytic-converter-thieves">Continue reading...</a>
