## Microsoft confirms Game Pass can cannibalize regular game sales

<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605846/microsoft-hopes-to-buy-activision-blizzard-in-a-deal-that-would-make-gaming-history.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft began its Activision acquisition</a> (say that five times fast), and the final stages of the sale are causing both companies some headaches. As part of the deal&rsquo;s regulatory approval in the UK &mdash; or lack thereof, we&rsquo;ll see! &mdash; Microsoft had to submit to the Competition and Market Authority&rsquo;s investigation. In Microsoft&rsquo;s self-report, it admitted that putting a game on the Game Pass subscription service results in a measurable decline in that game&rsquo;s retail sales. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly rocket science. But it is a big admission from Microsoft, which has spent the last few years restructuring both its Xbox and PC gaming strategy to emphasize monthly subscriptions to Game Pass over pure software and hardware sales. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales&amp;xcust=2-1-1512473-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As GamesIndustryBiz notes</a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer claimed in 2018 that a game being on Game Pass would lead to <em>more </em>retail sales, not fewer. </p>



<p>The exact degree to which a Game Pass game might diminish regular sales was redacted from the public report. But whenever a new game debuts on the service <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1485054/hi-fi-rush-is-a-colorful-beat-em-up-that-lacks-variety-but-not-personality.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> a couple of weeks ago</a>, it definitely gets a boost of exposure thanks to the cheap point of entry for new and existing Game Pass subscribers. Whether that&rsquo;s worth losing revenue from initial sales is probably an extremely complicated bit of corporate math. For example, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is published by Bethesda, a Microsoft subsidiary&mdash;the company probably views signups for Game Pass itself as a win, no matter how much it might eat into the new game&rsquo;s sales on Steam and other platforms. </p>



<p>Microsoft is trying to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605962/microsofts-changing-the-game-now-the-ball-is-in-sonys-court.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">establish Game Pass as a new paradigm for gaming</a> and it&rsquo;s doing a pretty good job, creating a budget-friendly bulwark on PC and console to fight Sony&rsquo;s dominance with the PS4 and PS5. Microsoft has purchased a huge amount of publishers and developers in the last decade to secure exclusive titles including <em>Minecraft </em>developer Mojang, <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> developer Obsidian, and <em>Elder Scrolls </em>publisher Bethesda. </p>



<p>Buying Activision-Blizzard for $70 billion would be one of the biggest deals in gaming history, which is why it&rsquo;s a sticking point for antitrust regulators in Europe and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430050/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-activision-gaming-deal.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">even the usually lenient United States</a>. For example, one of the UK Competition and Market Authority&rsquo;s recommendations for the deal to pass muster is for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2023/02/microsoft-activision-deal-uk-regulator-divestment&amp;xcust=2-1-1512473-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft to sell Activision&rsquo;s mega-popular <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise</a> to a competitor. Some of Microsoft&rsquo;s rebuttals are getting weird, too. An executive <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/last-us-tv-xbox-activision-blizzard-acquisition-sony-1850051036&amp;xcust=2-1-1512473-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">claimed that HBO&rsquo;s TV adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em></a><em> </em>was a reason that Sony would still be able to compete after the prospective merger. </p>

## A legendary ‘lost’ graphics card just sold for $15,000

<p>If you think games like <em>Halo </em>and <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> are &ldquo;retro,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of 3DFX. It was a scrappy little company that competed with Nvidia in the early days of discrete graphics cards for home PCs. While the Voodoo series of GPUs can just about handle a modern version of <em>Tetris </em>(if you leave ray tracing off), they were beloved back in the 90s&hellip;so much so that someone just spent a huge chunk of cash just to own one of the last 3DFX prototype cards.</p>



<p>The Voodoo 5 6000 was 3DFX&rsquo;s final GPU design before the company was sold to Nvidia. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_5#Voodoo_5_6000&amp;xcust=2-1-1512418-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to Wikipedia</a>, there were a little over 100 of the experimental graphics cards created in 2000. The last few of these cards were intended to be the final retail version, but they never made it to store shelves. </p>



<p>A version of the card with the working number 3700, a near-final revision, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/325521605074?nma=true&amp;si=%252FCTAOWjfOfOhJqP6QPu%252FG6OUBo4%253D&amp;xcust=2-1-1512418-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">popped up on eBay</a> a couple of weeks ago. It was sold out of Washington state and spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/joao-silva/functioning-3dfx-voodoo-5-6000-prototype-graphics-card-auctioned-off-for-15000/&amp;xcust=2-1-1512418-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru</a>. The seller claims to be a collector who could &ldquo;personally verify&rdquo; that the card runs in compatible hardware and that it was personally revised by 3DFX engineer Hank Semenec. The winning bidder paid a nice, even $15,000 for a piece of personal computer history. Shipping was free. </p>



<p>The Voodoo 5 6000 connected to motherboards using the now-extinct Advanced Graphics Port, packing a whopping 128 megabytes of memory and a GPU clock of 166MHz. It would have been the first GPU to combine four processors and memory banks to hit those numbers. Its big selling point was to be the ability to run full-scene anti-aliasing at 8X to avoid &ldquo;jaggies.&rdquo; The auctioned-off unit included a custom adapter cable to power the card via a Molex plug. </p>

Samsung&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/32--odyssey-g50a-gaming-qhd-led-monitor-ls32ag500pnxza/&amp;xcust=2-1-1512324-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G50A gaming monitor for $349.99</a>, which is a savings of $100. This monitor is both fast and spacious. Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>



<p>The 32-inch Odyssey G50A has a resolution of 2560&times;1440, a refresh rate of 165Hz, and a response time of 1ms. Expect buttery smooth visuals. It features HDR10, which, according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/what-is-hdr10-plus-hdr-formats/#dt-heading-what-is-hdr10&amp;xcust=2-1-1512324-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Digital Trends</a>, allows for a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits and a color depth of 10 bits. It&rsquo;s also G-Sync Compatible, which resolves display stutter by syncing up the monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate with your computer&rsquo;s GPU.</p>



<p>This is an epic deal. If you&rsquo;re after the ultimate gaming experience, the Odyssey G50A is definitely worth considering. </p>

## Switching from Windows to Chromebook (and vice versa) is about to get easier

<p>Despite what some of my professional colleagues will tell you, ChromeOS is fine. While it basically started as a browser with a Start menu on top of it, Google has spent years diligently improving it and updating its capabilities. If it could only run my rusty old copy of Photoshop, I might just consider using it all the time. However, I have to admit that switching from Windows to ChromeOS has one big pain point and that&rsquo;s the different keyboard shortcuts for things like window management. But that&rsquo;s about to change.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromeos-111-shows-a-complete-look-at-custom-keyboard-shortcuts/&amp;xcust=2-1-1512356-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">About Chromebooks</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chromeos-beta-change-keyboard-shortcuts&amp;xcust=2-1-1512356-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>) reports that the upcoming ChromeOS version 111 has the ability to completely customize keyboard shortcuts, which can be made visible to the end user by enabling three of Chrome&rsquo;s custom settings flags. The primary settings menu then shows a full interface for all of the system-wide shortcuts, along with a pop-up menu allowing you to customize them with just a few short key presses. How wonderfully user-friendly! Now you can change the &ldquo;move this window to the left side of the screen&rdquo; from the default &ldquo;Meta + [&rdquo; shortcut to &ldquo;Meta + left arrow&rdquo;, as <s>nature</s> Microsoft intended. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Chromebook keyboard shortcut interface" class="wp-image-1512391" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chrome-shortcut-custom.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">About Chromebooks</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s where the other shoe drops. The user settings changes made in the menu aren&rsquo;t actually applied, as of this beta release of the OS. Yes, it&rsquo;s very strange to bake in a full user interface for this stuff without actually enabling it. But such is often the way with Google software &mdash; after all, the things hidden behind Chrome flags are sometimes not meant for the typical user to tinker with. </p>



<p>Since it&rsquo;s in beta right now, ChromeOS 111 should be hitting Chromebooks and other Chrome-powered hardware sometime within a month or two, assuming said hardware is still being supported by Google. </p>

<p>Should you have hand injuries or tendonitis, look into ratcheting screwdrivers, which help reduce fatigue. For more torque, get a screwdriver with a fatter handle.</p>

<p>Adding an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">M.2 SSD</a> to your build or laptop?

<p>Since M.2 SSD mounting screws are delicate, you won&rsquo;t need much torque to get them in or out and thus a slender or small screwdriver works fine. You should get a magnetized one though, as screws that take a Phillips #1 tend to be small and easy to lose track of.</p>



<p>Builds that don&rsquo;t use any M.2 SSDs can get away with just a Phillips #2, but we&rsquo;ve found that it never hurts to have a Phillips #1 on hand.</p>

<p>You should put screws in some kind of container as you work&mdash;a shallow dish or bowl, a tray, even a cup. (Using more than one is even better, as you can keep track of different screw types more easily.) Placing everything loose onto a table usually results in missing screws, while clothing pockets run the risk of screws becoming lost as you move around.</p>

<p>A hex nut driver bears out the adage &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&rdquo;</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>If not tightened down sufficiently, motherboard standoffs can come loose as you try to loosen the screws holding the mainboard in place. The screw remains tight within the standoff, however&mdash;leaving you in purgatory until you can keep the standoff still as you remove the screw. In fact, further down this list are tools to help fix that common problem.</p>

<p>But if you own a hex nut driver in the right size, you can avoid that time and irritation. Before you mount the motherboard, slip it over the standoffs and ensure each one is firmly attached to the case. No need to overtighten, either; just a bit past when the standoff first hits the metal of the case. Too much and you risk stripping the screw threads on the standoffs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Think a spinning standoff will never happen to you? Readjustments can come up during building. Also, later maintenance on your system may require it. Believe us, nothing stokes deep rage like when a standoff gets stuck as you try to remove a mobo for an RMA return.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Some cases come with an accessory&mdash;a small metal piece compatible with a Phillips #2 screwdriver&mdash;that fulfills this same role, but not all do. You may also have a bit like this in a screwdriver kit you already own or will be buying (look for the M5 size).</p>



<p>If neither apply to you, you can purchase a <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-26882-Nut-Driver/dp/B078HLCKK5/&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">standalone 5mm hex nut driver</a>. It will work with the two most common sizes of standoffs, though the smaller size will be a tad loose. (For a perfect fit, also purchase a <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-16-Inch-Nut-Driver-26862/dp/B078HM2X1C&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3/16-inch hex nut driver</a>.) You may want to grab these regardless of what you already own, as the larger grip on a standalone hex nut driver makes tightening or loosening the standoff easier.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Already have a small adjustable wrench in your toolbox? That works too, though it&rsquo;s more awkward to maneuver than a hex nut driver.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Normal lighting can create shadows that reduce what you can see while working in a case, especially if it&rsquo;s a dark chassis. A good flashlight makes clear where stray screws rolled, the labels on front panel pins, and where that one last screw hole on the mobo is. You can get an&nbsp;<a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/GearLight-High-Powered-LED-Flashlight-S1200/dp/B074BT4X5H/&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">affordable tactical flashlight</a> starting at about $20.</p>

<p>Every now and then, the screw holding your motherboard in place won&rsquo;t come loose. Instead, the standoff underneath the mobo does, resulting in the screw and standoff spinning around as an unremovable unit. This is a more common occurance during repairs or upgrades, but it can also happen during a build when undoing a screwup.</p>

<p>To fix this, you need to keep the standoff from moving while you loosen the screw&mdash;a job neatly filled by a <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=6%22+slim+adjustable+wrench&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">small adjustable wrench</a> (also known colloquially as a crescent wrench), which can be bought for around $20, sometimes less. Slide it between the motherboard and the case, then clamp it down on the standoff. Then hold that pesky standoff in place to take out the screw.</p>



<p>An adjustable wrench can also be used to tighten standoffs <em>before</em> you install a motherboard, if you don&rsquo;t have a hex nut driver on hand.</p>



<p>For dealing with loose standoffs, get an adjustable wrench with a slender head, like these <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Channellock-804S-Xtra-Adjustable-Wrench/dp/B01N94SQBI&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4-inch</a> and <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Channellock-806SW-Xtra-Adjustable-Wrench/dp/B01N52WJRT/&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6-inch Channellock models</a>.

Don&rsquo;t want to spend that much? You can get away with this <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.homedepot.com/p/Stanley-6-in-Adjustable-Wrench-87-367L/311368868&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-392844-18054&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cheap 6-inch Stanley wrench</a> as a preventative measure. Use it to ensure that the standoffs are tightened down properly before installing a motherboard.</p>



<p>An adjustable wrench is ideal since it leaves no marks on a standoff after extraction, but every situation with a spinning standoff leaves a different amount of room to work in. If you can&rsquo;t maneuver one into position, try the next item on this list: a hemostat.</p>



<h3 id="hemostat">Hemostat</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/img_2383-rz2-100882713-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="hemostat locking forceps pc building tools" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/img_2383-rz2-100882713-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>A hemostat clamped onto the back of a motherboard standoff. To replicate this, screw the loose standoff back into the case to have as many threads as possible to grip.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re faced with a hard-to-reach standoff trapped under a motherboard, <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/MABIS-Forceps-Medical-Locking-Silver/dp/B00EKQ7FY4&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a hemostat</a> can help you out of that jam. These locking forceps are slender and needle-nosed&mdash;ideal for getting under the motherboard when there&rsquo;s limited room. You can sometimes even clamp onto the standoff&rsquo;s screw threads poking out the back of the motherboard tray. Adding one to your lineup won&rsquo;t cost much, either, as it&rsquo;ll run about $5.</p>

<p>Using a hemostat is straightforward: Get the jaws around the standoff, then squeeze the handles to lock it. (Note: Most hemostats have teeth that can scratch up your standoff&rsquo;s finish. To avoid this outcome, wedge part of a rubber band between it and the standoff whenever possible.)</p>



<p>As a reminder, you&rsquo;ll barely ever need this tool if you make sure your case&rsquo;s standoff screws are firmly seated <em>before</em> installing a motherboard. Use a hex nut driver or an adjustable wrench to tighten them just a bit past when the standoff first bottoms out. (Don&rsquo;t go too crazy&mdash;overtightening can create its own problems, i.e., stripped screw threads.)</p>



<p>A hemostat also comes in handy if you opt for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubber+screw+case+fan&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">rubber &ldquo;screws&rdquo;</a> for mounting case fans.

</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>You can&rsquo;t always predict when a case sports a front panel held in place by stubborn plastic clips&mdash;much less ones located in hard-to-reach places. A flathead screwdriver can help you push them in to release. A <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Craftsman-9-41578-Slotted-Screwdriver/dp/B00065T00K&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">standard driver with a longer neck</a> is ideal, since it will fit into tight spots more easily. For size, a 1/4- or 3/8-inch head and an 8-inch neck should work.</p>



<p>Note that these can dent and scratch the plastic if you apply them directly. You can put a bit of protective material (a bit of rubber band or a cotton ball) between the screwdriver head and the plastic before levering away.</p>



<h3 id="rubber-bands">Rubber bands</h3>

In a pinch, a couple of these can make it easier to slide side panels off of cases too, if you have slippery hands. (Upgrade version for dealing with side panels: a <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubber+jar+opener&amp;xcust=2-1-394287-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rubber jar opener</a>, which is easier for big hands to hold in place.)</p>

<p>Stripped a screw head? You can extract the screw from your build by using a vise grip if a hemostat doesn&rsquo;t generate enough torque.
