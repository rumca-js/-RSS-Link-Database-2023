  <p id="nKECMG">Instagram will no longer let creators tag products in livestreams starting in March, the company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/1189600611393606?helpref=faq_content">announced on Tuesday</a>. “Beginning on March 16, 2023, you will no longer be able to tag products in live broadcasts on Instagram,” the company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/1189600611393606?helpref=faq_content">wrote on an Instagram support page</a>. “This change will help us focus on products and features that provide the most value to our users.”</p>
<p id="F2yVPI">The change marks Meta’s next big step away from live shopping. The company is kicking the shopping tab out of Instagram’s home feed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546755/instagram-removes-shopping-tab-home-feed-main-navigation-reels">in February</a>, and it shut down live shopping on Facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/3/23291088/facebook-shuttering-live-shopping-feature-focus-reels-instagram">in October</a>.

  <p id="3EHyl8">This year’s Super Bowl LVII was the most-streamed Super Bowl yet, hitting an average of 7 million streams across the services showing the game. According to <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/presspass/blog/2023/02/13/fox-sports-presentation-of-super-bowl-lvii-scores-six-year-high-with-113-million-viewers/">data Fox Sports obtained</a> from Adobe Analytics, Super Bowl streams increased 18 percent from last year’s 6 million streams — and 103 percent over 2020, which saw just 3.4 million streams.</p>
<p id="uBgcFy">The 7 million streams included viewers watching the big game on NFL’s TV and mobile apps, NFL’s website, the NFL Plus streaming service, as well as on Fox’s apps and website. This data doesn’t account for co-viewing, or when multiple people watch a stream on the same device, and still represents a small fraction of the 113 million average viewers the game raked in on traditional TV.</p>

  <p id="FmysSX">Hyundai and Kia are offering free software updates for millions of their cars in response to a rash of car thefts inspired by a viral social media challenge on TikTok. </p>
<p id="ykmbyo">The so-called “Kia Challenge” on the social media platform has led to hundreds of car thefts nationwide, including at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/hyundai-kia-campaign-prevent-vehicle-theft">according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>. Thieves known as “the Kia Boyz” would post instructional videos about how to bypass the vehicles’ security system using tools as simple as a USB cable. </p>
<p id="wqIVac">The thefts are reportedly easy to pull off because many 2015-2019 Hyundai and Kia vehicles lack electronic immobilizers that prevent thieves from simply breaking in and bypassing the ignition....</p>

  <p id="60qIHu">Thousands of T-Mobile customers in the United States <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/111sscz/megathread_tmobile_outage_21323/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">reported significant network problems</a> on Monday night, with many unable to place calls or carry out other basic functions. Issues were reported across the country, with users from California to New York saying that service was up and down or completely unavailable for extended periods.</p>
<p id="6Ub4Vw">DownDetector spiked and <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/">showed over 80,000 reports of problems</a>. Owners of Apple’s iPhone 14 phones said their signal status showed no cellular connection whatsoever — instead defaulting to the emergency SOS satellite indicator.</p>
<p id="NuT24z">By late evening, the carrier seemed to be getting a handle on things, but customers weren’t pleased with the disruption.</p>
<p id="0o2NhB">Responding to complaints on social media, T-Mobile said it...</p>

  <p id="fVWVGm">Toyota’s incoming CEO said the automaker <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/38774342.html">would release “next-generation” electric cars</a> under the Lexus brand by 2026. This is just one part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/24/23420947/toyota-ev-transition-electrification-strategy-reboot">a new strategy</a> in development to overcome problems linked to a slow and expensive EV manufacturing process.</p>

  <p id="uBRg8w">Google Photos appears to be broken for many users following Apple’s latest iOS 16.3.1 update. Several <em>Verge</em> staff members, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/justinkoehn/status/1625258936701014016?s=20">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertroRodrigu/status/1625309510150635522?s=20">on</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/shanechesley/status/1625307375253987330?s=20">Twitter</a>, report that the app crashes on launch, making it impossible to access or manage your Google photo library.</p>
<p id="ks9xss">While the problem isn’t universal — <a href="https://twitter.com/jtarrio75/status/1625272145042370565?s=20">a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/neo_nexus2/status/1625263587588554752?s=20">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/daAlexHernandez/status/1625305474101923846?s=20">people</a>, myself included, say they’re able to open Google Photos just fine — the crashing does still appear to be relatively widespread. Other Google apps, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Maps, all seem to be working fine.</p>
<p id="ohPNrN">It’s currently unclear what could be causing the problem and why it only affects certain people. The iOS update (which may or may not have triggered the issue) is supposedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/13/23598030/apple-iphone-watch-crash-detection-winter-sports-ios-16-3-1">relatively minor</a>; Apple’s release notes...</p>
