As they should. But there's more. Last week, the teachers' attorney John Bursch made a shocking statement: unvaccinated teachers allegedly had their fingerprints sent to the FBI. </p><p>The teachers were apparently <a href=\"https://teachersforchoice.org/2023/02/09/fingerprints-of-unvaccinated-nyc-teachers-flagged-to-fbi/\" target=\"_blank\">flagged</a> with \"problem codes\" in their personnel files. Their fingerprints with the problem flag were then sent to the FBI and the New York Criminal Justice Services. Meaning they will be eternally flagged as potential criminals. </p><p>No, this isn't Orwell's 1984. It's just New York City. Same difference, really. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cNYC schools sent fingerprints of teachers who refused COVID vaccines to the FBI. \\u201cTeachers who refused vaccination had their files flagged and passed along to law enforcement, including the FBI.\\u201d\\nhttps://t.co/kgBtrSW0OX\\u201d</div> \u2014 Michael P Senger (@Michael P Senger)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelPSenger/status/1624560198085144578\">1676160308</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This information comes from an affidavit written by Betsy Combier in the court case,<em> Kane vs. De Blasio</em>.  Combier is the President and lead paralegal of Advocatz, a paralegal consulting business for people going through the Courts, grievances, or life problems. She wrote,<em> \"When the DOE places a problem code in the employee's personnel file, it also places a flag on the employee's fingerprints, which is then sent to the national databases at both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.\" </em></p><p>She continued, <em>\"I know of many former DOE employees who have had problem codes in their personnel files because they declined to be vaccinated in violation of the DOE's mandate and were not granted a religious or medical exemption. The DOE places a problem code on the employee's personnel file immediately upon getting information that the employee did not submit proof of vaccination. As soon as the employee gets the vaccination and submits proof, the code is removed from his or her file.\" </em></p><p>So New York City, which currently is struggling with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/baseball-bat-man-street\" target=\"_blank\">rampant violent crime</a>, is categorizing teachers who made a personal medical decision as potential criminals. I don't think I have to explain to you how incredibly insane this is. And unfortunately not at all surprising. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-teachers-fbi", "date_published": "2023-02-12 15:29:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "WTF: A Galveston Boat Captain Allegedly Held Onto Human Remains He Was Supposed to Spread at Sea", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33015491&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>There are weird stories, and then there are stories that make you question everything you've ever believed about humanity as a whole. This one's definitely the latter. </p><p>Cody Kenney, a former <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cruise-nightclub-brawl\" target=\"_blank\">boat</a> captain in Galveston, Texas, has been <a href=\"https://www.fox26houston.com/news/galveston-boat-captain-accused-of-3-counts-of-abuse-of-corpse-failed-to-spread-ashes-at-sea\" target=\"_blank\">charged</a> with three counts of abusing a corpse after he failed to scatter ashes at sea. He was released on $15,000 bond. </p><p>Kenney was a contract captain for the vessels \"Island Girl\" and \"Hootie Who\" for Galveston Deep Sea Fishing Charters and Aqua Charters. He was the only primary captain until his abrupt resignation in September of last year. </p><p>The charters frequently work with families to disperse the remains of loved ones at sea. Court documents said about 95-98% of the ceremonies are done with the families and loved ones onboard.  The other ceremonies were done by Kenney alone, typically during a chartered fishing trip. </p><p>After Kenney's resignation, three containers of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-arrested-buckets-human-remains\" target=\"_blank\">remains</a> were discovered. </p><p>In October of last year, the owner of one of the boats got a call from Integrity Funeral Care about remains that were discovered in a Jamaica beach home. But court documents reveal the remains were actually originally found in the garage of a former deckhand of Kenney's. </p><p>Less than a week later, the boat owner discovered two more containers of remains. One of the containers had been given to Kenney in late 2021 or early 2022. So he held onto them for over a year. Oh. <span></span></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cA former boat captain for a Galveston fishing charter was arrested after he allegedly failed to scatter the ashes of at least three people at sea. https://t.co/9yzX6x9Ogo\\u201d</div> \u2014 KSAT 12 (@KSAT 12)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ksatnews/status/1624574028563288065\">1676163606</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hopefully, Kenney just got lazy and didn't want to take the solo trips to disperse the ashes, eventually forgetting he even had them.

AND they became friends. AND she held events for him, including one in Beverly Hills. AND -- this one is key -- she took him as a guest to an event at Mar-A-Lago. Donald Trump's house. This donor who James O'Keefe was allegedly so rude too it requires him to be removed from his company, was so unbothered by it she took O'Keefe to meet Donald Trump.</p><p>PROTIP: If you are going to stage a coup, get your facts straight. Otherwise, it makes people think your reasons for staging the coup aren't the actual reasons.
