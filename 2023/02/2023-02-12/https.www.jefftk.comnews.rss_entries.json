[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "How Cardioid Are Cardioids?", "description": "<p><span>\n\nDynamic cardioid microphones are one of the most common types of mic\nfor live sound.  The best known is probably the SM-57, but there are\nmany others.  They're called \"cardioid\" mics because their pickup\npattern is somewhat heart-shaped:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cardioid-mic-pattern-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cardioid-mic-pattern.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe idea is they pick up well in the direction you point them,\nreasonably well off to the sides, but very little in the direction\nthey're pointed away from.  This is valuable in a live sound context\nwhere you have 'monitor' speakers that point back at the performers:\nif you put the mic right between the monitor and instrument, pointing\naway from the monitor and towards the instrument, you should pick up\nmuch more \"instrument\" than \"monitor\".\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhy do we want that?  Because the more of the monitor you pick up both\nthe muddier it will sound and the quieter the instrument has to be in\nthe monitor before you get feedback.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Polar_pattern_cardioid.png\">Wikipedia\ndiagram</a> above, this effect would be ~20dB if you got the mic angle\nwithin 30deg of correct.  But how does real life compare, where\nrejection might not be as good and some sound could be bouncing around\nthe room?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI took two common dynamic mics, a <a href=\"https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm57?variant=SM57-LC\">Shure\nSM-57</a> and a <a href=\"https://en-us.sennheiser.com/live-performance-microphone-vocal-stage-e-835\">Sennheiser\ne835</a> and connected them to a <a href=\"https://www.qsc.com/solutions-products/loudspeakers/portable/powered/portable-pa/k2-series/k102/\">QSC\nK10.2</a> powered speaker through a <a href=\"https://www.soundcraft.com/en/products/epm8\">Soundcraft\nEPM-8</a> mixer.  Each time the mic was on a stand, pointed directly\ntowards or away from the tweeter, with the capsule 55\" from the\nspeaker's grille.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/off-axis-rejection-setup-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/off-axis-rejection-setup.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI set the mixer gain to 100% and slowly turned up the fader until I\ncould hear the beginning of feedback. I tracked the difference in\nfader settings, and while this isn't perfect&#8212;the faders are not\nprecisely calibrated tools&#8212;it lets us get a sense of how much of\nan effect we're talking about.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's an example with the e835. Pointed at the speaker:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/mixer-settings-pointing-at-speaker-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/mixer-settings-pointing-at-speaker.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd away from the speaker:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/mixer-settings-pointing-away-from-speaker-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/mixer-settings-pointing-away-from-speaker.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nComparing the positions across a few trials it was consistently around\n5dB better.  The SM-57 was also very similar, which makes sense since\nmy impression is the e835 was inspired by the SM-57/SM-58 family.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile 5dB isn't nothing, it's very different from the diagram\nabove. What's going on?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOur first problem is that we should be looking at the specs for these\nspecific mics instead of a random diagram from Wikipedia. If you look\nat the <a href=\"https://assets.sennheiser.com/global-downloads/file/10874/SP_1209_v1.0_e_835_e_835-S_Product_Specification_EN.pdf\">e835\nspecs</a> the rejection pattern is frequency-dependent:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cardioid-polar-pattern-e835-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cardioid-polar-pattern-e835.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSame for the SM-57:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sm57-typical-polar-patterns-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sm57-typical-polar-patterns.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's the frequency spread I was seeing for feedback with the SM-57\npointed directly away from the speaker:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/feedback-frequencies-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/feedback-frequencies.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis peak corresponds to around where the mics should have the worst\nrejection, ~125Hz.  Looking at the charts, I think the SM57 should be\nmanaging 10dB and the e835 3dB, which isn't exactly what I saw, so my\nguess is the rest of the difference comes from sound bouncing around\nthe room or manufacturing differences.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOverall, it's still worth pointing mics away from speakers: even 5dB\nis enough to make a worthwhile difference in how loud you can get a\nquiet instrument in the monitor before running into feedback issues.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(If you wanted to go farther you could notch out the feedback-prone\nfrequencies from the monitor mix, but this is rarely worth doing in\nthe contra dance live sound contexts I'm usually in.  Monitors that\nloud start to be a problem for getting good sound in the hall.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0EfXc8Jmo33PXct2NfheDNVYaS5W3hMZ9HmxvHWNL5KCNx3nXWtaTfhS6wqDRDfnDl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109852660191992722\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/how-cardioid-are-cardioids", "date_published": "2023-02-12 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
