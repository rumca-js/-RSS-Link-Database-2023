I plan on using Vmix after a successful two week trial. Please see the following FAQ on my component choices:\n\nWhy Intel?\nBecause that's what Vmix recommends. Vmix works with AMD processors but they are still recommending only Intel chips. Vmix also runs a little better on Intel as its more computational intensive - number of cores are not as important as the performance of the cores that are working the video processing. The unlocked processor was oddly less expensive vs. the regular i9-9900K\n\nWhy the Asus motherboard?\nI have built systems primarily with Asus motherboards for the last 20 years. I've had good luck with them and like the brand. I also need PCIe lanes for the GPU but also the 4 way capture board I'm using. Eventually I'll upgrade the system to 10 gig ethernet. \n\n\nSubscribe to my email list to get a weekly digest of upcoming videos! - http://lon.tv/email\n\nSee my second channel for supplementary content : http://lon.tv/extras\n\nJoin the Facebook group to connect with me and other viewers! \nhttp://lon.tv/facebookgroup\n\nVisit the Lon.TV store to purchase some of my previously reviewed items! http://lon.tv/store\n\nRead more about my transparency and disclaimers: http://lon.tv/disclosures\n\nWant to chat with other fans of the channel?
