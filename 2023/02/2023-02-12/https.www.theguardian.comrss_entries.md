<p>The 1983 Brink’s-Mat robbery was the largest score in British history – and now it’s been turned into a hugely entertaining BBC series. Prepare to enjoy some incredible retro sets</p><p>The British criminal underworld has a lore as rich as Arthurian legend, with its own errant knights (Jack the Hat, Ronnie and Reggie), daring adventures (the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2014/sep/28/the-great-train-robbery-in-pictures">Great Train Robbery</a>, the Hatton Garden heist) and storied quests (usually to the Costa del Crime and back again). It also has its own holy grail in the missing Brink’s-Mat millions. No fortune is more mythologised, more sought-after or more mysterious.</p><p>The Brink’s-Mat legend only grows in diverting retelling The Gold (BBC One), a six-part series from Neil Forsyth, creator and writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/12/guilt-review-mark-bonnar-neil-forsyth">of Scottish crime series Guilt</a>. It began in 1983 – as depicted in the opening scene – when six men in balaclavas burst into Brink’s-Mat secure storage facility near Heathrow airport. They intended to steal £1m in cash, but instead came away with about £26m of gold bullion (equivalent to £90m today). At the time, it was the largest score in British history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/12/the-gold-review-a-24-carat-drama-about-one-of-the-uks-most-shocking-robberies">Continue reading...</a>

But only if he grasps the nettle immediately, is bold and decisive, and discards his normal cautious, conservative and “sit on the fence” approach to controversial events.</p><p>Shell’s excess/windfall profits, if taxed in the interests of the majority, would fund pay increases for teachers, nurses, care workers and other deserving employees and show their paltry pay offers to be truly disgraceful by comparison. The company’s profits have been achieved not by increased productivity and efficiency but by the vagaries of an unregulated global energy sector, of which Shell and others have taken advantage. Starmer must take on the company, the energy sector and the government now, with the full force that his status as leader of the opposition allows.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/12/keir-starmer-v-the-energy-giants-would-light-up-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Big band crooner of the 1950s who also turned his hand to film and theatre before fading from view as tastes changed in the 60s</p><p>Dennis Lotis, who has died aged 97, built his career during a decade when popular culture turned upside down. In 1957 he was voted the UK’s top male singer in a Melody Maker poll for his interpretations of songs such as Nevertheless, Such a Night and Flamingo. Yet his crooning style, thanks to rock’n’roll, was fated to go the way of big band swing.</p><p>Lotis had arrived from his native South Africa in austerity London in late 1950, armed with a letter of introduction from the Anglo-American saxophonist Don Barrigo, which he presented to the bandleader Ted Heath. Palais de dance and decaying music halls were where young people – the term “teenagers” lay in the future – found live music, and in that world of dance bands Heath reigned almost supreme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/dennis-lotis-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Taking office at the height of the peaceful revolution in 1989, Modrow immediately set up a grand coalition government of all five parties, giving up his leading role in the Socialist Unity party (SED). He set out to reform the command economy, developed new ideas about education and within weeks dissolved the state security apparatus (the Stasi).</p><p>Modrow had long been a popular figure in the party hierarchy and was known for his tolerance, innovative approach and lack of dogmatism.

<p>(Human Re Sources)<br />Nine years on from her breakthrough EP, the British artist is finally back on track with a new label and an artistic rebirth</p><p>The journey to a debut album has been almost a decade long for British singer Rachel Keen, AKA <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/25/im-angry-im-raging-how-raye-took-on-her-record-label-and-won">Raye</a>. First coming to prominence with the EP <em>Welcome to the Winter </em>in 2014, she released pop-inflected collaborations with everyone from producer Jax Jones to Charli XCX, rapper Mr Eazi and house superstar David Guetta. A hit-making featured artist, Keen’s own solo material has been uneven, and in 2021 she provided a reason, alleging on social media that her record label, Polydor, had been <a href="https://twitter.com/raye/status/1409906686765240321">holding back her first album</a> for seven years.</p><p>The much-anticipated release of her debut LP , following her exit from Polydor, heralds Keen’s arrival as an independent artist. Her ear for a hook is apparent throughout its 15 tracks – on the thumping drums and bass-laden pulse of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dll6VJ2C7wo">Escapism</a>, the head-nodding house of Black Mascara and balladic crescendos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE144TIc1jY">Ice Cream Man</a> – while her vocals soar on the singalong chorus of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cLIG8JiOyg">Oscar Winning Tears</a>. There’s a touch of pastiche on the doo wop of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZfzdklFtf0">Thrill Is Gone</a>, but overall the record showcases a self-assured songwriter, capable of producing swaggering floor-fillers. <em><a href="https://raye.orcd.co/m21cb">My 21st Century Blues</a> </em>is Keen’s artistic rebirth.

## Peter Brötzmann review – free-jazz saxophonist on fiercely good form

<p><strong>Cafe Oto, London<br /></strong>The veteran avant gardist has lost none of his intensity with two sets showcasing the full light and shade of his fearsome improvisational playing</p><p>The German saxophonist Peter Brötzmann has worked in dozens of different contexts over the years, but his approach usually stays the same. Whether he’s collaborating with <a href="https://peterbroetzmann.bandcamp.com/album/an-eternal-reminder-of-not-today-live-at-moers">Californian noise rockers</a>, <a href="https://blackbombaim.bandcamp.com/album/black-bombaim-peter-br-tzmann">Portuguese psych bands</a>, <a href="https://wishimage.com/broleigh">Glaswegian pedal steel guitarists</a> or any number of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/05/peter-brotzmann-chicago-tentet-cd-review">free-jazz luminaries</a>, you’re likely to hear him play in a big, gruff, fruity honk, making splurges of sound in the mid-range of his tenor saxophone. Tonight’s gig, with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THIvOSU7B_U">Mental Shake</a> quartet, revealed some unlikely tenderness in the tone of this fearsome avant gardist.</p><p>Now aged 81, hunched to the right of the stage, looking like a particularly hirsute Mike Leigh, Brötzmann still plays with an extraordinary energy. He has long been a fan of the vibraphone – he’s cited Lionel Hampton as an unlikely influence on his most famous LP, 1968’s pan-European free-jazz odyssey <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/nov/22/peter-brotzmann-machine-gun">Machine Gun</a> – and featuring Chicago vibist Jason Adasiewicz in this band reveals hidden depths to Brötzmann’s playing. Adasiewicz sometimes tries to match Brötzmann’s intensity – he hits his instrument hard and percussively, plays dense, chromatic clusters of notes and sometimes plays the role that Bobby Hutcherson performed on Eric Dolphy’s Out To Lunch. But Adasiewicz can also play in a more relaxed four-mallet chordal style, as pioneered by Gary Burton, using lots of pedal and playing sustained, unresolved, modal chords that bring out Brötzmann’s more melodic instincts. In the second half, when Brötzmann switches from alto and soprano to the tenor sax, he responds to Adasiewicz with a series of simple, vibrato-heavy blues riffs, as if playing a collage of random three-note fragments from jazz standards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/peter-brotzmann-review-free-jazz-saxophonist-on-fiercely-good-form">Continue reading...</a>

It was a few seconds that speaks to the way Southampton have apparently regressed in the three months since boldly appointing Jones as Ralph Hasenhüttl’s successor.</p><p>In many ways, Bednarek’s inclusion in the starting line-up was also indicative of a muddled and miserable few months at St Mary’s. Bednarek was allowed to join Aston Villa on a season-long loan in September, with the Poland defender down the pecking order at Southampton. Bednarek, who irritated Southampton supporters by saying he had signed for a “bigger club”, wanted to play regularly before the World Cup but made just one league start before being recalled in January.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/12/nathan-jones-must-not-take-all-the-blame-for-southampton-calamity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There must be a better euphemism.

Not by her blandly rehearsed claims that the platform isn’t mainly porn, and is, in fact, enabling diverse and empowered creativity – sports, cookery, fashion! – but by her use of the word “spicy”, which cropped up four times as a synonym for sexually explicit. “A bunch of spicy content … something on the spicier side … some of it might be spicy … spicier content.”</p><p>That feels oddly coy, when you’re talking about a site hosting, for example, “super-specific niche fetish” and “vanilla hardcore”, as an OnlyFans content creator described it on a forum.

<p>The first world war’s impact on an Austrian clan is a charmingly told, chaotic story rooted in the author’s own history</p><p>At the centre of this novel, the first by the bestselling Austrian author to be translated into English, is a family and at the centre of the family is a young woman, Maria. The family live in a valley on the western edge of Austria – it is 1914 – and are known by the nearby villagers as “<em>die Bagage</em>” (the undesirables, the riff-raff) because they are poor and because “the kids are half wild”. And Maria is a woman whose exquisite beauty provokes both lust and resentment.</p><p>So when Maria’s husband, Josef, is conscripted to serve in the first world war, the postman is a bit too pleased to be delivering Josef’s call-up papers and imagines himself “the sort of man who could show a lot of tender affection if it came to it”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/12/last-house-before-the-mountain-by-monika-helfer-review-as-tumultuous-as-the-family-it-depicts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On the edge of an MOD firing range, a terrace house in poor repair provided the perfect canvas for a contemporary revamp</p><p>Four miles along the coast from Rye at Jury’s Gap sits a cluster of nine coastguard cottages. Built in two short, perpendicular terraces, the white brick facades and lichen-covered roofs are a familiar sight on Britain’s coastline. “The design of these cottages was very considered,” explains Marta Nowicka, who owns an end terrace. “These are one of the original live-work spaces, so it’s a very practical space.”</p><p>Nowicka’s cottage faces out to sea, but she is quick to add that the setting is far from idyllic. The cottages are on the edge of an MoD firing range – what Nowicka calls a “no-go area”. This creates a “tension” that appealed to her. She’s a London-based interior architect who purchased her cottage in 2010.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/12/shooting-star-a-seaside-cottage-near-rye">Continue reading...</a>

## Vermeer review – one of the most thrilling exhibitions ever conceived

<p><strong>Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam</strong><br />Moments of profound absorption, a glance, a letter… the mystery and stillness of the Dutch master’s work deepens the closer you get in this near-perfect show</p><p>The scene is unassuming – rinsed cobbles, whitewashed walls, a woman stitching in an open doorway as the Dutch gable facade ascends towards motionless clouds. Yet every visitor stands before it amazed. Perhaps the spell has something to do with the Advent calendar of open and yet to be opened windows, or the chain of absorbed and absorbing figures, or the abstract arrangement of frames and arches, or the brickwork that seems made of the very thing itself? The eyes and mind, beguiled, search the image for answers. How can Johannes Vermeer’s painting be so infinitely more beautiful than the scene it depicts?</p><p><em>The Little Street</em> (c.1657) hangs at the beginning of one of the most thrilling exhibitions ever conceived. <strong><a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/vermeer">Vermeer</a>,</strong> at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, brings together more of his paintings than ever before – and possibly ever again, given the cost and their fragility – 28 of the 37 known works. The show is superbly dramatic: a sequence of darkened chambers, where the paintings (like their subjects) appear sometimes alone, occasionally in twos or threes, each in its solo spotlight. The design reflects the revelatory aspect of Vermeer’s art at every turn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/12/vermeer-rijksmuseum-amsterdam-review-one-of-the-most-thrilling-exhibitions-ever-conceived">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stravinsky’s ballet sensation of 1913 shocked its first Paris audience. More than 150 versions later, the far-reaching pull of this modernist masterpiece remains irresistible…</p><p>For a work that changed the course of dance, introducing a blast of modernism into a conventional art form, Vaslav Nijinsky’s <em>The Rite of Spring</em> had a surprisingly short shelf life. Despite more than 130 fraught and complicated rehearsals as the dancers struggled to get to grips with the stylised steps and Stravinsky’s radical rhythms, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/12/sergei-diaghilev-and-the-ballets-russes">Sergei Diaghilev</a>’s Ballets Russes performed it only 10 times before consigning it to the history books.</p><p>Even the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Russian_Ballet_in_Paris_-_New_York_Times_1913-06-08.png">famous riot</a> that greeted its premiere in Paris on 29 May 1913 is a subject of some dispute.

She was the first MP to propose legislation to prohibit “sex pest” stalking, to ban drivers from talking on mobile telephones and to establish a national register of paedophiles, and, while she was unsuccessful from the backbenches of the House of Commons, it was her campaign skills that forced eventual government action on all of these issues.</p><p>Before she was elected as an MP in 1992, she also played a forceful role in the campaign to reform shop opening hours and, as the junior minister with responsibility for broadcasting at the then Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), she oversaw the introduction in 2000 of free TV licences for those aged over 75 and discounted charges for people who are visually impaired.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/12/janet-anderson-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Between them, they have nearly a million Instagram followers.

Mum was in her coffin. There were two pairs of hands holding on to each of the four grey straps.

I can’t remember if it was veneer or solid, but we began moving the wooden slats the casket had been sitting on. Mum was suspended now.</p><p>I was worried. I had recently hurt my shoulder, but had been doing exercises routinely, so when the time came my grip would be steady. She came to rest on a mixture of wet clay and pebbled stones. The sides of the chamber had been poured with concrete. There are two types of graves on offer in England. An earthen dug grave we describe as a <em>katchi kabar</em>, and the other, a solid lined grave described as <em>pakhi</em>.

<p><strong>Nottingham Playhouse, and touring<br /></strong>An at times arresting production of Christy Lefteri’s bestseller is let down by its didactic structure</p><p>Nuri is the beekeeper of Aleppo, or he was, until his hives were torched. Christy Lefteri’s bestselling 2019 novel traces the experiences of Nuri and his wife, Afra, as they struggle through Turkey and Greece to the UK, leaving behind lives shattered by the bombardments and brutalities of war. The storyline is a perfect fit for Nottingham Playhouse, which, as one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/14/theatre-refugees-west-yorkshire-playhouse-home-migration-matters">UK’s theatres of sanctuary</a>, is committed “to supporting refugees and people seeking asylum, by telling their stories on stage”. It also has particular resonance for Ruby Pugh, designer of this co-production (with Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse and UK Productions), since she, like Lefteri, worked as a volunteer with refugees in Athens.</p><p>Aspects of the staging are arresting. Pugh’s set, of wide skies and skeletal walls rising from mounds of furniture-engulfing sand, suggests both impermanence and fixity. The action shuttles through time and space, with Nuri (Alfred Clay) setting scenes through direct address to the audience. Shifting locations are evoked by light (Ben Ormerod) and sound (Tingying Dong; with music by Elaha Soroor); also by film projections from Ravi Deepres (including a breathtaking coup de theatre of a storm at sea).</p><p><a href="https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/events/the-beekeeper-of-aleppo/">At Nottingham Playhouse</a> until 25 February, and <a href="https://atgtickets.com/shows/the-beekeeper-of-aleppo/">touring until 6 May</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/12/the-beekeeper-of-aleppo-nottingham-playhouse-review">Continue reading...</a>

Jean smiles along with the studio audience laughter; it doesn’t occur to her to question the baked-in misogyny of the programme format. Not yet, at least.</p><p>Jean is a woman caught in an uncomfortable limbo between two worlds. She’s a newly minted lesbian, on the fringes of a community of louder, prouder dykes, and in the first flush of romance with Viv (Kerrie Hayes). She’s also a PE teacher in a north-east England secondary school in the late 1980s; exactly the kind of person who the Thatcher regime’s recently enacted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/17/uk.gayrights">section 28 </a>law – forbidding the “promotion of homosexuality” by local authorities – has in its crosshairs. For Jean – and McEwen’s performance is an intricate miracle of minute details and nervy flickers of alarm – the separation of work and life is an essential, but increasingly precarious, balance. That balance, to the frustration of Viv, who senses Jean’s reticence when it comes to fully embracing her sexual identity, is upended when one of her students, Lois (Lucy Halliday), encroaches on Jean’s closely guarded world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/12/blue-jean-review-rosy-mcewen-is-riveting-in-powerful-section-28-drama-georgia-oakley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Based on real events, this beautifully crafted novel follows an Irish priest smuggling allied troops and Jews out of Italy in 1943</p><p>J<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/03/joseph-oconnor-my-scepticism-about-monarchy-began-at-six-with-a-ladybird-book">oseph O’Connor</a>’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/26/shadowplay-joseph-oconnor-review">Shadowplay</a></em> won novel of the year at the 2019 Irish book awards and was shortlisted for the Costa Novel award. He also writes stage and screenplays, short stories, nonfiction and radio diaries. This formidable talent for writing across genres is reflected in his masterly 10th novel, which should reap similar plaudits.</p><p>Based on a true story, and several real characters, <em>My Father’s House</em> opens in September 1943 with wartime Rome as its memorable backdrop. The city is occupied by German forces and the Gestapo commander, Paul Hauptmann, rules with an iron fist. (His torture chambers are housed in the former German Cultural Institute, “his favoured interrogation tool is the blowtorch”.) The one place he can’t control is the Vatican City, deemed a neutral, independent country. It harbours diplomats, as well as priests, several of whom dedicate themselves to helping Jews and escaped allied prisoners get out of Rome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/12/my-fathers-house-by-joseph-oconnor-review-a-literary-thriller-of-the-highest-order">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Staircase’s Margie Ratliff, whose family nightmare became a TV sensation in the 2004 series, talks about a new film which looks at the ethics of ‘docu-tainment’</p><p>Some lives take on an uncontrollable life of their own. One of those belongs to Margie Ratliff, whose world changed the night before her 20th birthday when the woman she knew as her mother was discovered dead at the bottom of a steep staircase in the family home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The horrific events of that night in 2001 not only resulted in one of the most scrutinised court cases in American legal history, they also launched a new kind of global entertainment: the serial true-life crime documentary, the did-he-do-it?</p><p>Michael Peterson, a novelist and Vietnam war veteran and Ratliff’s adoptive father, was charged with the first-degree murder of his second wife, Kathleen. He protested his innocence, claiming Kathleen had fallen down the stairs at the end of an evening spent drinking by the pool. In order, he said, to make the legal process transparent, he invited a film crew from France, led by director Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, into the family home to record every detail of his preparation for trial. The film crew had full access to family breakfast tables and lawyers’ briefings and court rooms and prison cells. The defendant and his lawyer, David Rudolf, became stars of the show. Meanwhile, Michael Peterson’s devoted children – Ratliff and her sister Martha and their two adoptive brothers – had to do all of their grieving and a lot of their fast-forward coming of age in front of a camera.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/12/the-staircase-margie-ratliff-documentary-subject-hoop-dreams-square-wolf-pack">Continue reading...</a>

This week, my dear old friend (it must be at least 25 years old) nurtured a spice-scented aubergine dish seasoned with bay, chilli flakes and spices, its sauce a deep brick red from a recipe that included red wine and tomatoes.</p><p>I should have waited to lift the lid until the pot was on the table, when everyone could share the scent of the steam and its soft, earthy spice notes.

<p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon; Hampstead; Gillian Lynne, London</strong><br />Alex Kingston’s fine Prospero weathers an RSC concept storm; the 21st century erupts into a tale of 18th century gender subversion; and illusion captivates in a revival of Sam Mendes’s banking saga</p><p>In June, Daniel Evans and Tamara Harvey will take over as artistic directors at the RSC. Let’s hope they give it a shaking. When I started reviewing for the <em>Observer</em> 25 years ago, the RSC was the default provider of Shakespeare productions. Since then the Globe has captured hearts, often with bolder approaches to the plays, as have stagings at the Almeida, Sheffield, the National, the Donmar and Bath’s Ustinov. Productions at Stratford are seldom less than proficient, but I can’t remember when I last left with my heart beating faster at an interpretation.</p><p>Meanwhile too much of the surrounding experience – which primes the audience for what they see on stage – is discouraging. Public transport to Stratford-upon-Avon is always a struggle for anyone who doesn’t live nearby, and it’s particularly ironic that it helps to have a car to get to <em>The Tempest</em>. The climate crisis is one in a blizzard of ideas that threaten to overwhelm Elizabeth Freestone’s production. Tom Piper’s bold, tumbled design with repurposed plastic, verdigris drawbridges and a glowing forest makes its own climate case. Still, I am not convinced that weather disruption propels the play as thoroughly as it does <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. A jargon-heavy programme essay (“Prospero geo-engineers a storm experience”) left me more sceptical.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/12/the-tempest-rsc-stratford-alex-kingston-review-linck-and-mulhahn-hampstead-the-lehman-trilogy-gillian-lynne-sam-mendes">Continue reading...</a>

## Aimee Lou Wood: ‘I am a wrecking ball of emotion’

<p>Sex Education’s Aimee Lou Wood’s emotions simmer just below the surface. And it’s exactly this quality that makes her such a luminous actor. She opens up about bullying, bodies and playing Cabaret’s Sally Bowles</p><p>‘Be here, Aimee!’ Aimee Lou Wood said to herself, “Soak it in!” She was sitting with her hero Bill Nighy late last year, eating penne all’arrabbiata, and she was trying, really trying to be in the moment. She’d just won a Bafta, she was nearing the end of a life-changing project, acting in her first lead film role opposite Nighy in the Oscar-nominated <em>Living</em>, and her career was exploding, and she was 28, and she should have been high-fiving everybody she met, alive with gratitude and appreciation and champagne. But Nighy knew her by then, and knew what she was like. “And Bill said, ‘Don’t go into the hostile parallel world.’”</p><p>This, she explains, is where all your trauma is stored, and when you’re there – when she’s there – she reacts in ways that have helped her survive in the past, like, dissociating. “And I’m trying! But the present can be scary. I’m a wrecking ball of feeling.” She says all this – how she is training herself now to breathe, to “be present” – with the same grinning brightness one might expect from a person explaining what they had for tea, and I realise with a thrill that this is how our meeting will go. It’s this openness, in part, that makes her so luminous on screen, this grand vulnerability. And today she will dive straight into the dark meat of a conversation, our only small talk being her insistence that I read German spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle and calculate my astrological Saturn return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/12/aimee-lou-wood-interview-sex-education-actor-cabaret">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sometimes we need a gentle little something to help cope with our emotional demands</p><p>My trips to London are tricky these days. Whereas once I had lots of family there, now there are none. It feels strange and empty at times, and I fill that void with being fantastically busy and meeting up with lots of friends when I’m there. A packed diary is a great anaesthetic.</p><p>So, too, is chocolate, and I was craving something chunky (read about meeting my match with chunky in a few weeks’ time) and comforting. But I’ve lost my super-sweet tooth, so chocolate that is too full of sugar I can’t eat. <strong><a href="https://www.williescacao.com/willies-world/where-to-buy/">Willie’s Cacao</a></strong> 54% <a href="https://www.williescacao.com/product/milk-of-the-stars/">Milk of the Stars</a>, £2.35, is in my top 10 of milks.

Now concern about migrant ‘invaders’  is turning the continent, and other global regions, into fortresses</p><p>To drive into the heart of West Berlin on a dark, snowy night in December 1988 was to descend on to the cinematic frontline of the cold war.

<p>UN emergency relief coordinator says he expects tens of thousands more deaths after ‘worst event in 100 years in this region’</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>As the rescue efforts continue following the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, here is a summary of recent events.</p><p>The death toll from Monday’s earthquake has surpassed 28,000.

## Jacob Rees-Mogg’s crazed tilt at red tape is quixotic nonsense. We need regulation to survive | Will Hutton

<p>The MP is wrong: rules are integral to democracies and stop us from returning to the squalor of the Britain that he romanticises</p><p>The laziest attitude to strike in politics is to rail against red tape and regulation. Form-filling? Busybody, unelected bureaucrats interfering with our ancient freedoms and obstructing entrepreneurial wealth creation? It’s easy to utter our disdain, especially if the regulation has anything to do with the EU – the “corpse” to which Britain was shackled and from which it is now liberated. Hence the bill currently in the House of Lords, launched by Jacob Rees-Mogg during his stint as one of our shortest-lived secretaries of state for business, to end in one stroke a swath of regulation and the tyranny of EU bureaucrats. About <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/08/government-finds-extra-1400-laws-scrap-rees-mogg-brexit-bill">3,700 regulations</a> that emanated from the darkest city in Europe – Brussels – are to be scrapped by the end of the year.</p><p>Red tape for red tape’s sake? In truth, there is no such thing. Regulation is the foundation of our civilisation. I am delighted that older cars must have MOTs, that employees have a right to paid holiday, that the drugs the doctor prescribes are safe, that lead in paint is prohibited, that the pesticides used in gardens won’t kill us, that the water we drink is clean and that restaurant and pub kitchens are regularly checked. So too, although they will never admit as much, are the ardent deregulators and apostles of the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill set to revoke many of these “burdens” and “obstacles” to our freedom and prosperity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/12/jacob-rees-moggs-crazed-tilt-at-red-tape-is-quixotic-nonsense-we-need-regulation-to-survive">Continue reading...</a>

Seriously, what on earth happened to you?” I used to feel this huge pressure, particularly when I was younger – especially in my 20s – to make up some kind of superhero origin story. “Well, my grandma in Borneo used to take me around her garden…” (As she did, with all my many cousins, none of whom really care about plants now.) “I guess, growing up in the tropics meant I was physically around more plants as a kid, so there was more chance to become fascinated.” (Albeit in Singapore: a country better known back in the 1980s and 1990s for its hermetically sealed, <br />air-conditioned shopping malls.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/12/people-often-ask-me-what-do-you-like-so-much-about-plants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The democracies have confounded the Russian tyrant with their resolve to support Ukraine. That must be sustained in 2023</p><p>It was an easy mistake for a tyrant to make. When Vladimir Putin launched his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-has-invaded-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far">savage assault</a> on Ukraine in February last year, he did not just misjudge its valiant people and their determination to fight for freedom. He also misread the western democracies.</p><p>You can see why. As Russia’s military was beginning what was intended to be a lightning blitz to crush its neighbour, the UK’s clown car government was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/16/boris-johnson-scandal-that-even-great-trickster-cant-blag-his-way-out-of">being consumed</a> by Partygate.

America had rattled confidence in its leadership with the ignominious scuttle from Afghanistan.

<p>The Canadian<strong> </strong>director’s finely balanced drama about the abuse, secrets and shame of an isolated religious community boasts wonderfully nuanced performances, yet the real action lies in its knotty central argument</p><p>The Canadian writer-director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/12/sarah-polley-terry-gilliam-run-towards-danger-baron-munchausen-interview">Sarah Polley</a>’s superbly inventive adaptation of Miriam Toews’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/10/women-talking-miriam-toews-review">2018 novel</a> begins with a declaration: “What follows is an act of female imagination.” That phrase, taken directly from Toews, is pointedly double-edged, having been used by the elders of a remote religious colony to explain away years of drugged sexual assaults – attacks attributed to ghosts, demons, or hysteria (“wild female imagination”) that have left women and girls terrorised, pregnant or dead. When the assailants are finally caught and taken into custody “for their own protection”, the women have a brief window in which to <em>imagine</em> their future. Should they stay within the community that has raped and abused them, or leave, thereby casting themselves out of the Garden of Eden, estranged from the God in whom they still place their faith?</p><p>The ensuing Socratic debate resembles a cross between Arthur Miller’s 1953 stage play <em>The Crucible</em><em> </em>and Dutch film-maker Marleen Gorris’s electrifying 1982 feminist psychodrama <em>A Question of Silence</em>, played out within the makeshift courtroom of a hayloft. “How will we be forgiven, if not by the elders whom we have disobeyed?” demands Mariche (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/15/i-prefer-to-live-life-with-danger-and-darkness-jessie-buckley-and-bernard-butler-on-breakdowns-oscars-and-their-album">Jessie Buckley</a>), facing the prospect that “we will be forced to leave the colony if we don’t forgive the men”. “Is forgiveness that is forced upon us true forgiveness?” counters the strangely serene Ona (Rooney Mara), to which Judith Ivey’s Agata adds: “Perhaps forgiveness can, in some instances, be confused with permission.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/12/women-talking-review-sarah-polley-timeless-parable-sexual-abuse-mennonites-rooney-mara-claire-foy-jessie-buckley-frances-mcdormand">Continue reading...</a>

For centuries, her reputation was that of a scheming seducer.</p><p>Now Anne is being recast as a deeply religious woman who, far from plotting to become Henry’s second wife, bade her time for six years as a lady-in-waiting to the king’s consort, Catherine of Aragon. She deliberately never consummated her relationship with Henry until their “unofficial” marriage in November 1532 – just two months before their formal wedding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/12/anne-boleyn-reputation-as-temptress-recast-new-exhibition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A website alerts readers and viewers to the horrors in store for them. If only we had that much control in hospital rooms</p><p>Without really talking about it, my family and I have built little screens around ourselves, culture blinkers, which allow us to move through the world uninterrupted by sudden unexpected horrors. My sister has formalised the process: this morning she sent me a link to a website, <a href="https://www.doesthedogdie.com/">Does the Dog Die</a>, “crowdsourced emotional spoilers for movies, TV, books and more”. What you do is you put in the name of the film, say, you’re thinking about watching, and click to see if it contains anything you want to avoid seeing. A long list will appear, of potential triggers.</p><p>For instance, if you give it <em>The Last of Us</em>, the zombie series unfolding on telly right now, you will discover episodes one to three feature someone being burned alive, children dying, needles and, to be honest, a hundred scenes designed specifically for wild and screamy discomfort. Including one where a kind user, answering the question, “Is someone sexually assaulted?” has given a time-stamp warning for the scene where, “an infected [person] kisses Tess in order to transmit the infection using tendrils which protrude from its mouth”. In this show there is no, however, “copaganda” (police being shown as heroes), and the dog does not die.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/12/spoiler-alert-sometimes-real-life-could-do-with-a-trigger-warning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having written about his father and then his mother, the poet and writer now turns to his sisters in a heartfelt and delicate memorial</p><p>The poet and writer Blake Morrison has long made a habit of getting to know his closest relatives better only after they have died. I don’t mean this unkindly; in life, I’m sure he’s as dutiful and devoted (or not) as the next person. But there’s no ignoring the fact that the grave seems to release him, spurring his deepest thinking, his best prose and (perhaps) his most assiduous, open-hearted loving. In 1993, he published <em>And When Did You Last See Your Father?</em>, in which he exhumed his dad. In 2002, he gave us <em>Things My Mother Never Told Me</em>, about the several lives of his late mother. And now here he is with a third volume. “If you’re reading this, my sister is dead,” he writes on page seven, for the avoidance of doubt.</p><p>A better title for this book, in which Morrison turns his attention to his younger sister, Gill, and his half-sister, Josie, might have been The Fallout. At the heart of <em>Two Sisters</em>, after all, lies the story that furnished his first memoir: his father, Arthur, having an affair with a married neighbour called Beaty (Josie was their daughter; born in 1959, she was Blake’s junior by nine years). Once again, we’re reminded that the insistent question “But didn’t you <em>know</em>?” is singularly futile when it comes to relationships, particularly those that are clandestine – the trouble being that the head, the heart and the gut may all say different things at once. You <em>know</em> and yet you don’t know. In his childhood, as he explained first in <em>And When Did You Last See Your Father?</em>, Beaty and Josie were forever in plain sight, cherished friends who regularly joined the Morrisons at their holiday chalet in Abersoch; the likeness between Arthur and Josie was obvious. Yet the words “daughter” and “sister” went unspoken. Only when Arthur, Beaty and Kim (Morrison’s mother) were dead were DNA tests done, the results surprising no one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/12/two-sisters-by-blake-morrison-review-siblings-fatally-wounded-by-childhood">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘They save us’: Sally Muir on the art of drawing rescue dogs

<p>Scruffy or sleek, melancholic or mischievous… Sally Muir’s portraits of dogs capture the essence of unconditional love. And her latest collection on rescue dogs reveals much about cruelty – and kindness</p><p>When a toast is raised at a wedding, it is invariably to the bride. Not so when artist and author Sally Muir married the journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft back in 1990. That honour went to Fanny, Sally Muir’s “big-haired, lawless 80s mongrel” with whom she had fallen in love at first sighting in Battersea Dogs Home when she was 24 years old.</p><p>“Fanny was toasted as the person who brought us together,” laughs Muir, talking to me on Zoom from her studio at her Bath home, her grey whippet, Peggy, curled up in an old leather armchair behind her. “Geoffrey was mad about her.” And if he hadn’t been, would it have been a deal-breaker? The answer, after a moment’s delay is, of course, yes – her hesitation attributable to her comic timing, inherited, perhaps, from her late father, the comedy writer Frank Muir.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/12/they-save-us-sally-muir-on-the-art-of-drawing-rescue-dogs">Continue reading...</a>

## Aussie rules: surely it has to be shiraz

<p>Australia is much loved for its big-boned red wines, but its world-beating shiraz can be as subtle and nuanced as the French variety</p><p><strong>Kangarilla Road Shiraz, McLaren Vale, Australia 2020 (£14.99, or £10.99 for a mixed case of six bottles, <a href="http://majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>Australia has been the UK’s favourite source of wine in supermarkets and other merchants for more than 20 years now, with much of the country’s popularity down to its winemakers’ way with its most popular grape variety, shiraz. Sometimes known by its French name, syrah (of which more below), shiraz is responsible for just under a third of all the Australian wine sold in the UK, according to figures from the industry body, Wine Australia. And I would hazard a guess that most shiraz buyers have come to expect a certain set of qualities that at the very least approximate Majestic’s description of the blockbuster 16% abv Mollydooker The Boxer Shiraz (£24.99): “hugely full-bodied and voluptuous”. These red wines are smoothly rendered but powerful, and filled with dark fruit and warming sweet spice, such as the same retailer’s good-value (and, at 14.5% abv, more digestible) Kangarilla Road Shiraz.</p><p><strong>Ben Haines Grampians Syrah, Victoria, Australia 2021 (£17.69, <a href="http://stannarywine.com/">stannarywine.com</a>) </strong>Other reliably good providers of the classic sumptuous, fuller-bodied Aussie shiraz style include <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>, in the shape of the plummy spice-inflected Finest Barossa Shiraz 2019 (£10); Jim Barry, in wines such as the lavender-infused blackberry succulent The Lodge Hill Shiraz, Clare Valley 2018 (from £10.50, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/">The Co-op</a>; <a href="http://majestic.co.uk/">Majestic</a>); and Yalumba in the lush chocolately-bambly Yalumba Galway Barossa Shiraz 2021 (£12.99, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/">Waitrose</a>). But there has always been far more stylistic variety on offer in Australian shiraz than the caricature allows for. Tasting my way around the shiraz offerings at a recent gathering of Australian wine importers in London, for example, took me from the astonishing, evocative sinewy, salty, meaty, liquorice intensity of Argicola Ebenezer Shiraz, Barossa Valley 2021 (£70, <a href="http://swig.co.uk/">swig.co.uk</a>) to the graceful, perfumed delights of Ben Haines’s bottling from Victoria’s Grampians, via the chocolatey smoothness of Grant Burge Filsell Barossa Shiraz 2020 (£25.99, <a href="http://laithwaites.co.uk/">laithwaites.co.uk</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/12/aussie-rules-surely-it-has-to-be-shiraz">Continue reading...</a>

Reach out to your friends for support</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>Last year my brother died of alcoholism. My husband, our two primary school-age children and I are living with my parents. I am the main breadwinner. I have tried to support my parents through their grief, as well as financially supporting them. I feel the more I do, the more they expect of me; they are never satisfied with my efforts. It has made old childhood wounds of being unheard, unseen, unvalued and the pressure to be a good girl return to the surface. They also blame me for a lot of what happened to my brother and say things like: “We helped you more than him and you are ungrateful.”</em></p><p><em>My husband has gone from being a kind, caring man to an angry one. He tells me that he never loved me. I am about to move to the other side of the world, with my children for my job, and my husband pulled out at the last minute.

Risk management begins in prison with effective treatment programmes. These have all but disappeared. Management continues by establishing and maintaining links with people in allied organisations. Unfortunately, it’s almost impossible to get the assistance of psychiatric staff, who are overwhelmed by their workloads. Community drugs workers, often funded by local authorities, have vanished as funding dried up. Housing, employment and adult education services have little room for the homeless, drug-raddled and mentally ill people who leave prison with a discharge grant and little more. The crisis in probation is part of a wider crisis that has been brewing for more than a decade, and is systemic.<br /><strong>Rob Wakefield</strong><br />Nailsea, Somerset</p><p>Sonia Sodha asserts that more investment in children’s services is the answer to addressing the problem of male violence. She quite rightly identifies that “experience of childhood trauma for boys is associated with a higher propensity to violence in adulthood”. What she sidesteps is that childhood trauma experienced by boys is also caused by divorce and parental separation. How much more research do we need to accept the fact that boys denied the close support of their fathers during their formative years can cause very significant emotional damage? In some disadvantaged young men, the ticking timebomb begins with the loss of their father as a steadying influence on their lives.<br /><strong>Elizabeth Mueller</strong><br />Glasgow</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/feb/12/probation-breakdown-is-part-of-a-wider-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
