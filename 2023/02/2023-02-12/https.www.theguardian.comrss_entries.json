First coming to prominence with the EP <em>Welcome to the Winter </em>in 2014, she released pop-inflected collaborations with everyone from producer Jax Jones to Charli XCX, rapper Mr Eazi and house superstar David Guetta. A hit-making featured artist, Keen\u2019s own solo material has been uneven, and in 2021 she provided a reason, alleging on social media that her record label, Polydor, had been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raye/status/1409906686765240321\">holding back her first album</a> for seven years.</p><p>The much-anticipated release of her debut LP , following her exit from Polydor, heralds Keen\u2019s arrival as an independent artist. Her ear for a hook is apparent throughout its 15 tracks \u2013 on the thumping drums and bass-laden pulse of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dll6VJ2C7wo\">Escapism</a>, the head-nodding house of Black Mascara and balladic crescendos of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE144TIc1jY\">Ice Cream Man</a> \u2013 while her vocals soar on the singalong chorus of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cLIG8JiOyg\">Oscar Winning Tears</a>. There\u2019s a touch of pastiche on the doo wop of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZfzdklFtf0\">Thrill Is Gone</a>, but overall the record showcases a self-assured songwriter, capable of producing swaggering floor-fillers. <em><a href=\"https://raye.orcd.co/m21cb\">My 21st Century Blues</a> </em>is Keen\u2019s artistic rebirth.

Whether he\u2019s collaborating with <a href=\"https://peterbroetzmann.bandcamp.com/album/an-eternal-reminder-of-not-today-live-at-moers\">Californian noise rockers</a>, <a href=\"https://blackbombaim.bandcamp.com/album/black-bombaim-peter-br-tzmann\">Portuguese psych bands</a>, <a href=\"https://wishimage.com/broleigh\">Glaswegian pedal steel guitarists</a> or any number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/05/peter-brotzmann-chicago-tentet-cd-review\">free-jazz luminaries</a>, you\u2019re likely to hear him play in a big, gruff, fruity honk, making splurges of sound in the mid-range of his tenor saxophone. Tonight\u2019s gig, with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THIvOSU7B_U\">Mental Shake</a> quartet, revealed some unlikely tenderness in the tone of this fearsome avant gardist.</p><p>Now aged 81, hunched to the right of the stage, looking like a particularly hirsute Mike Leigh, Br\u00f6tzmann still plays with an extraordinary energy. He has long been a fan of the vibraphone \u2013 he\u2019s cited Lionel Hampton as an unlikely influence on his most famous LP, 1968\u2019s pan-European free-jazz odyssey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/nov/22/peter-brotzmann-machine-gun\">Machine Gun</a> \u2013 and featuring Chicago vibist Jason Adasiewicz in this band reveals hidden depths to Br\u00f6tzmann\u2019s playing. Adasiewicz sometimes tries to match Br\u00f6tzmann\u2019s intensity \u2013 he hits his instrument hard and percussively, plays dense, chromatic clusters of notes and sometimes plays the role that Bobby Hutcherson performed on Eric Dolphy\u2019s Out To Lunch. But Adasiewicz can also play in a more relaxed four-mallet chordal style, as pioneered by Gary Burton, using lots of pedal and playing sustained, unresolved, modal chords that bring out Br\u00f6tzmann\u2019s more melodic instincts. In the second half, when Br\u00f6tzmann switches from alto and soprano to the tenor sax, he responds to Adasiewicz with a series of simple, vibrato-heavy blues riffs, as if playing a collage of random three-note fragments from jazz standards.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/peter-brotzmann-review-free-jazz-saxophonist-on-fiercely-good-form\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/peter-brotzmann-review-free-jazz-saxophonist-on-fiercely-good-form", "date_published": "2023-02-12 14:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "England v Italy: Six Nations \u2013 live", "description": "<ul><li>Updates from the 3pm kick-off at Twickenham</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/10/marcus-smith-dropped-as-england-owen-farrell-italy-six-nations-rugby-union\">Borthwick drops Smith for Italy clash</a></li><li>Get in touch!

But there\u2019s no ignoring the fact that the grave seems to release him, spurring his deepest thinking, his best prose and (perhaps) his most assiduous, open-hearted loving.

Risk management begins in prison with effective treatment programmes. These have all but disappeared. Management continues by establishing and maintaining links with people in allied organisations. Unfortunately, it\u2019s almost impossible to get the assistance of psychiatric staff, who are overwhelmed by their workloads. Community drugs workers, often funded by local authorities, have vanished as funding dried up. Housing, employment and adult education services have little room for the homeless, drug-raddled and mentally ill people who leave prison with a discharge grant and little more. The crisis in probation is part of a wider crisis that has been brewing for more than a decade, and is systemic.<br /><strong>Rob Wakefield</strong><br />Nailsea, Somerset</p><p>Sonia Sodha asserts that more investment in children\u2019s services is the answer to addressing the problem of male violence. She quite rightly identifies that \u201cexperience of childhood trauma for boys is associated with a higher propensity to violence in adulthood\u201d. What she sidesteps is that childhood trauma experienced by boys is also caused by divorce and parental separation. How much more research do we need to accept the fact that boys denied the close support of their fathers during their formative years can cause very significant emotional damage? In some disadvantaged young men, the ticking timebomb begins with the loss of their father as a steadying influence on their lives.<br /><strong>Elizabeth Mueller</strong><br />Glasgow</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/feb/12/probation-breakdown-is-part-of-a-wider-crisis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/feb/12/probation-breakdown-is-part-of-a-wider-crisis", "date_published": "2023-02-12 06:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Quarter of a million children enter secondary school without basic maths and English", "description": "<p>Government set to fail target of 90% of pupils in England reaching set standard at age 11, research finds</p><p>Rishi Sunak has been warned that a target to boost the number of children entering secondary school with the expected standards of reading, writing and maths is \u201ca far cry from reality\u201d, amid new evidence that 275,000 pupils a year are leaving primary education without the right level of skills.</p><p>Ministers have set a target of ensuring 90% of children achieve the national curriculum standard in reading, writing and maths at the end of primary education by 2030.
