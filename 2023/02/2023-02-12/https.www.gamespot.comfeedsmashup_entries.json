Most of the time, they'll simply run away and when you attempt to catch them. One creature, however, is far deadlier. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy Graphorn guide to help you get this animal as a mount, as well as capture additional ones if need be.</p><h2>The Graphorn mount in San Bakar's Trial</h2><p>To be clear, the Graphorn is currently the only ground mount in Hogwarts Legacy. It won't become available until you complete San Bakar's Trial, which is one of the last few quests in the game. As such, you'll just need to progress further in the campaign until it becomes available.</p><p>Once you do start it, you'll go to Cragcroft Shore, which is in the southern half of the world map. Use Incendio or Confringo on the vines to reveal a Graphorn carving. From there, you're tasked with capturing a Graphorn. Its den is located in Clagmar Coast, at the southeastern tip of the map. You can use your broom or flying mount to reach the location faster.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-graphorn-mount-pet-san-bakars-trial-guide/1100-6511443/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-graphorn-mount-pet-san-bakars-trial-guide/1100-6511443/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-12 18:35:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "How To Catch A Phoenix In Hogwarts Legacy", "description": "<p>Hogwarts Legacy allows you to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beasts-vivarium-capture-tame-guide/1100-6511394/\">capture and tame several magical creatures</a>, eventually releasing them into your Vivarium. It's an animal sanctuary that's part of the Room of Requirement. Still, there's one creature of legend that's fairly elusive, though you do have a chance to acquire it. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you tame your own Phoenix pet.</p><h2>Phoenix Rising quest</h2><p>To catch a Phoenix pet in Hogwarts Legacy, you'll need to complete the Phoenix Rising quest. However, it won't be available until much later in the campaign. Here are some requirements:</p><ul><li>Finish the Niamh Fitzgerald's Trial main quest.</li><li>Complete all of Deek the house elf's sidequests, such as Plight of the House Elf and Foal of the Dead (which unlocks the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-breed-beasts-animals-guide/1100-6511438/\">Beast breeding mechanic</a>).</li></ul><p>Shortly thereafter, you're told that Deek needs your help once more. With the Phoenix Rising quest tracked, you'll want to head to the southern portion of the world map in a region called Poidsear Coast.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-phoenix-catch-tame-vivarium-guide/1100-6511442/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-phoenix-catch-tame-vivarium-guide/1100-6511442/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-12 18:34:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "M16: Pop Culture's \"Good Guy\" Rifle - Loadout", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1594/15941173/4097929-m16_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> From Call of Duty to Battlefield, the M16 is one of the most recognisable weapons in our video games.
