In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeacockTVCare/status/1624783792866004993?s=20&amp;t=MPil1jiyMnUzAYDZYcl1iA\">a post on Twitter</a>, the Comcast-owned NBCUniversal confirmed plans to stop offering free access to Peacock Premium to Xfinity subscribers on June 26th, 2023 (via <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/comcast-ending-peacock-premium-free-xfinity-1235293778/\"><em>Variety</em></a>).</p>\n<p id=\"HNuGVx\">Peacock Premium, which normally costs $4.99 per month, is an ad-supported plan that has been available to Xfinity customers at no extra cost since the service first launched in 2020. Details about the change first emerged in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/10zyp5s/xfinity_will_stop_providing_peacock_premium_for/\">post on Reddit</a>, which an NBCUniversal representative later confirmed to <em>Variety </em>and <a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/news/xfinity-customers-will-no-longer-get-peacock-premium-for-free\"><em>The Streamable</em></a>.</p>\n<div id=\"LrXQ40\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Hello Bob!

One Reddit user who tried the mod found that while adding the RGB LEDs doesn\u2019t draw a significant amount of power from the battery, it can cause pretty big issues with the Steam Deck\u2019s motherboard.</p>\n<p id=\"YsmWgb\">The \u201cRGBDeck\u201d mod started making the rounds on Reddit earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/10qxjvr/rgb_moded_steam_deck/\">with u/WUBBSY</a> documenting <a href=\"https://github.com/WUBBSY/RGBDeck/blob/main/README.md\">the process</a> of affixing a small microcontroller and LED strips to the device. They topped it off with a transparent backing from <a href=\"https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106\">JSAUX</a>, allowing the lights to shine through the case while the Steam Deck\u2019s switched on. The end result gives the Steam Deck a nice pop of color (in a very gamer PC kind of way).</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"C21sic\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RGBDeck?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RGBDeck</a> is assembled!  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenRGB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#...</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div></div>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/12/23596535/steam-deck-rgb-mod-warning\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/12/23596535/steam-deck-rgb-mod-warning", "date_published": "2023-02-12 19:13:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
