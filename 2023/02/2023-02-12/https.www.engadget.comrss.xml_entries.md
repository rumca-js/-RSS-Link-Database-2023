<p>If you primarily game on PC, there‚Äôs a good chance you own more than one component with RGB lighting. You may have even made the mistake of buying RGB parts from different manufacturers. If you just nodded your head, I know your pain. Getting all the lighting in your PC to sync is a nightmare. In a best-case scenario, you sourced all your RGB parts from one company and only need a single, likely buggy app to control them. At worst, you‚Äôre forced to use multiple third-party programs in a futile attempt to make everything play nice. And while apps like <a href="https://signalrgb.com/"><ins>SignalRGB</ins></a> promise to wrangle all your RGB parts, in my experience, they don‚Äôt work as great as advertised. All of that makes the news that Microsoft could be working on a native Windows 11 solution for controlling RGB lighting exciting.</p><div id="f11a3c02513e4d5d8ef7dd32b722b06f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">New settings for device lighting make an appearance in build 25295.

<p>After years of neglect, Valve is preparing to release a major update for <em>Team Fortress 2.</em> This week, the studio published a rare blog post on the <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/?tab=blog"><ins>official </ins><em><ins>TF2 </ins></em><ins>website</ins></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(via<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/tf2-team-fortress-2-update-new-content-summer-pc-valve-1850096628"><em><ins>Kotaku</ins></em></a>), asking the game‚Äôs community to submit new content to the Steam Workshop ahead of May 1st. ‚ÄúThe last few <em>Team Fortress </em>summer events have only been item updates. But <em>this </em>year<em>&nbsp;</em>[Valve‚Äôs emphasis], we‚Äôre planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update ‚Äì with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?!‚Äù Valve said.</p><p>By our count, the ‚Äúas as-yet-unnamed, un-themed, but still very exciting summer-situated (but not summer-themed)‚Äù update Valve has planned will go down as <em>TF2‚Äôs </em>first major content release since the company came out with the <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/jungleinferno/"><ins>Jungle Inferno update</ins></a> in 2017 for the game‚Äôs 10-year anniversary.

## Stellantis reveals pre-production variant of Ram 1500 REV

<p>When Stellantis showed off the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-first-look-ram-1500-revolution-bev-concept-ces-2023-223035895.html"><ins>Ram 1500 Revolution</ins></a> this past January, the automaker said the prototype would serve as a design template for Ram‚Äôs first electric truck. Now, more than a month later, Stellantis has shared a first look at the 2024 Ram 1500 REV, and wouldn‚Äôt you know, the pre-production model looks more like its gas-guzzling predecessors than the futuristic concept we saw at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-of-ces-2023-winners-220009997.html"><ins>CES 2023</ins></a>.</p><figure><img alt="An interior shot of the RAM 1500 Rev, showing off the truck's large infotainment unit.

Like Ford did with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-preview-video-170103332.html"><ins>F-150 Lightning</ins></a>, Stellantis has played it safe. The Ram 1500 REV features more modern-looking front- and rear-facing lights, but that‚Äôs about all that makes it look different from just about any other Ram in production right now. The interior of the vehicle is also more conservative. It doesn‚Äôt have that futuristic edge that was present with the Revolution. Judging from the images Stellantis shared, the production variant also won‚Äôt ship with many of the more outlandish features the automaker managed to find space for in the Ram 1500 REV concept. The new vehicle does come with a frunk though, so there‚Äôs that at least.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can reserve a pre-order spot for the 2024 Ram 1500 REV by placing a $100 deposit through the <a href="https://ramrev.com/"><ins>Ram website</ins></a>. With deliveries not scheduled to start until late next year, there‚Äôs plenty of time to wait for Stellantis to share more information before you make a decision about the EV. In the meantime, the Super Bowl ad the company plans to air later today to promote the Ram 1500 REV is pretty funny and well worth the watch even if you don't have any interest in buying a big electric truck.&nbsp;</p><div id="00a19032a93147d7ba4b03a5aa714a59"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div>

<p>Opera is going all-in on artificial intelligence. This week, the company <a href="https://blogs.opera.com/news/2023/02/opera-aigc-integration/"><ins>shared plans</ins></a> to integrate generative AI capabilities into its web browser, starting with ‚ÄúShorten,‚Äù a feature that will use ChatGPT to create summaries of articles and webpages.

However, whether people actually switch away from Chrome as a result of those additions remains to be seen.</p>

Thanks to a six percent discount, you can get the wearable for $749 right now. That‚Äôs only $10 more than the device was priced at during Black Friday last year. Moreover, Amazon has stock of most of the different bands Apple offers alongside the wearable.</p><p></p><p>Engadget Deputy Editor Cherlynn Low gave the Apple Watch Ultra a score of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html"><ins>85</ins></a> when she reviewed the wearable last fall. Chances are you already know if the Ultra makes sense for your workout needs. The inclusion of features like dual-frequency GPS and a longer-lasting battery compared to regular Apple Watch models make the Ultra ideal for those who frequently go hiking or want the most accurate tracking possible for runs. Other additions like a more durable design and bigger display are features any Apple Watch user can appreciate. Still, when you can buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html"><ins>Series 8</ins></a> model for half as much, most people are better off purchasing the Ultra‚Äôs more affordable sibling.

## Hitting the Books: NASA's Class 8 broke color barriers and glass ceilings alike

<p>America's first astronauts from the 1960s were all pulled from the highest ranks of the nation's military. As such, NASA's first few classes tended to conform to a rather specific demographic theme ‚Äî white, male, flattop haircut you could set a watch too. By the mid-70's however, the space agency had gotten with the times and opened up the spacewalking profession to more than former Air Force and Navy test pilots.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OZXctR3V5cy1NZXJlZGl0aC1CYWdieS1lYm9vay9kcC9CMDlRM0NEMTE0P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWthLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NTVlODk5My04YzMxLTQxMDMtOWI4Ny0xZTY4YTM0MTA0ZjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARjIMzZn_pV_CKDHeyvXG2uDsB-fVG01JIdB8UO2A3Xg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNew-Guys-Meredith-Bagby-ebook%2Fdp%2FB09Q3CD114"><em>The New Guys</em></a>, author Meredith Bagby follows the exploits of NASA's Astronaut class of 1978 ‚Äî "Class 8," America's first women, African Americans, Asian American, and gay person to fly to space ‚Äî from the team's selection through their mastering of cutting-edge technologies aboard the Space Shuttle and their history-making orbital missions.

We‚Äôve got a fire in the cockpit!‚Äù a man screamed, then his voice cut out. Within seconds, another desperate voice cut through the static.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a bad fire . . . !‚Äù the second man shouted in pain.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre burning up . . . !!!‚Äù a third howled.</p><p>Then the transmission faded into nothing but static.</p><p>In one of the many tiered seats in Mission Control, Ron McNair and his new classmates listened to a recording of the Apollo 1 fire. During a preflight test on January 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee had burned alive. Even though over a decade had passed since the accident, the pain and fear of the astronauts who perished was palpable to the room of new recruits.</p><p>The instructor surveyed the faces of the astronaut candidates. Are you sure you‚Äôre ready for this? The audio was a wake-up call, especially for those like Ron who had not served in the military and had never had a job with life-and-death consequences. If this reality was too much for any of them to accept, the instructor suggested, now was the time to go. No one budged.</p><p>A few weeks earlier, as Ron moved his family across the country from left-leaning Malibu, California, to the Lone Star State, the summer sizzled. Disco hits from the Bee Gees‚Äô, ‚ÄúNight Fever‚Äù and ‚ÄúStayin‚Äô Alive,‚Äù blared from the radio. Billboards advertised the new Hollywood blockbuster Grease, starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. In the nation‚Äôs capital, almost a hundred thousand demonstrators marched in support of the Equal Rights Amendment‚Äîat the time, the largest march for women‚Äôs rights in US history. Muhammad Ali was on the verge of making history at the Louisiana Superdome, becoming the first man to win the World Heavyweight title three times in a row.</p><p>When Ron and his wife, Cheryl, arrived in Houston, they found a little starter apartment before moving to Clear Lake along with the Onizukas and the Gregorys. Everyone that had kids‚Äîor planned to‚Äîwanted a lawn for football and a cul-de-sac for bike riding. The neighborhood‚Äôs proximity to the middle and high schools made it the obvious choice for families. Single astronauts like Sally Ride, Kathy Sullivan, and Steve Hawley settled into apartments right outside Johnson‚Äôs back gate with a short commute, volleyball court, and communal barbecue pit.</p><p>On the Monday after the July 4th holiday, Ron drove through the gates of Johnson Space Center for his first day of work. Looking up from his baffling acronym-filled schedule, Ron spotted a few of his classmates and followed them to Building 4, the home of Johnson‚Äôs Flight Crew Operations. Everyone was rushing to the Monday morning all-hands meeting, a staple of the Astronaut Office since the Mercury days.</p><p>Standing watch from their office doors, Sylvia Salinas, Mary Lopez, and Estella Hernandez Gillette, all in their twenties, took in the excitement as the new astronauts stormed the hallways. The Hispanic American administrative staff ‚Äî working in and around the Astronaut Office ‚Äî came to be known as the Mexican Mafia. As the liaisons for George Abbey and John Young, Sylvia and Mary, and later Estella, ran the show behind scenes, making sure things went smoothly in the Astronaut Office. Up until then, the astronauts they worked for were military men, older in age and more conventional in style; they did not fraternize with support staff. Now, ‚Äúkids like them‚Äù were rolling in. The arrival of Astronaut Class 8 was like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>A large conference table surrounded by two rings of chairs dominated Room 3025, the locus of the Monday meeting. Assuming the first ring was reserved for administrators and senior astronauts, Ron took a seat in the back row, as did the rest of his class. Everyone, that is, except the blond, mustachioed Rick Hauck, a US Navy commander who by military standards was the most senior-ranking pilot of their class. Hauck took a seat at the table. Some in the room gasped. Others eyed him with suspicion. <em>Wow, he must either be a fool or the most confident bastard among us.</em> Maybe both. Either way he made an impression.</p><p>Like Hauck, the fifteen fighter pilots in Ron‚Äôs class had plenty of swagger and bravado, and mixed easily with the veteran astronauts. The old guys, twenty-eight in all, including moonwalkers John Young and Alan Bean, whom Ron met during interview week, filled the inner circle. Among them were astronauts still itching for their first trip to space, like Bob ‚ÄúCrip‚Äù Crippen, the baby of the group at forty years old, and Richard ‚ÄúDick‚Äù Truly, both career military pilots who had flown for both the Navy and Air Force. These yet-to-fly guys were caught between programs, too late for Apollo and‚Äîso far‚Äîtoo early for the shuttle. Crippen and Truly were part of Astronaut Group 7, who had been transferred to NASA after the cancellation of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), a classified Cold War military project developed to acquire surveillance images from space. After a decade at the agency, the former MOL astronauts had only ever flown a desk.</p><p>Everyone here wanted a ticket to space, but the ten interesting people would be setting historical precedent, breaking barriers that in the past restricted people like them from space travel. Of the six women in the room, one would be the first American woman in space. While the Soviets had flown the first female astronaut, Valentina Tereshkova‚Äîbeing the first American woman in space would earn a prominent place in the annals of history. In 1978, no Black person had flown to space. Ron, along with Guy Bluford, and Fred Gregory would compete to be the first, while Ellison Onizuka would almost certainly be the first Asian American to fly. Guy and Fred, both Vietnam vets, and El, an Air Force test pilot, all spoke the military language of the old guys. Ron was an outsider even among outsiders.</p><p>John Young, chief of the Astronaut Office, began the meeting, mumbling ‚Äúa few forgettable words of welcome‚Äù while staring at his shoes. Though he had braved the depths of space four times, on both Apollo and Gemini, Young had not conquered public speaking. Compact, with a jockey‚Äôs build, Young was a handsome Navy devil with big ears and an aw-shucks demeanor that belied how truly meticulous he was. He preferred solving thorny engineering problems, to dealing with management issues, and yet here he was as head of the Astronaut Office. He explained to the new class that they were not yet astronauts; they were still astronaut candidates, or ‚ÄúAsCans‚Äù for short. Only after two years of training would they earn the title astronaut and a silver pin to mark the achievement.</p><p>Inspired by Navy and Air Force aviator badges, the pin depicted a trio of rays merged atop a shining star and encircled by a halo denoting orbital flight. The silver pin meant you were flight-ready, but the gold pin meant you had flown to space. <em>That‚Äôs when you make it.</em> Young then left the group with a bit of sage advice: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about nothing you know nothing about.‚Äù Got it. <em>So basically, keep our mouths shut.</em></p><p>As the old guys left the room, they once-overed the new guys. Quite simply, the old guys were a different generation. They were veterans, test pilots, and guys who had never worked with women or civilian graduate students. Underneath their pique was also perhaps a tinge of fear. The line to ride the bird just got a whole lot longer; maybe they would miss their chance altogether.</p><p><em>Who are these guys anyway? Hell, half of them are civilians, wet behind the ears, fresh off their mother‚Äôs teat. They traded in high grades and accolades, not in life-or-death.</em> The old guys shook their heads. Those Fucking New Guys. ‚ÄúThe Fucking New Guy,‚Äù a military term for the newest grunt in the unit, seemed to suit Astronaut Class 8 perfectly. So was born the official class nickname: TFNG. In polite company, the TFNGs referred to themselves as ‚ÄúThirty-Five New Guys,‚Äù but everyone knew what the term really meant.</p><p>After the meeting, secretary Sylvia Salinas handed the New Guys their official NASA portraits and asked them to create signatures for the auto-pen machine. The agency would print thousands of autographed photos. <em>Do thousands of people want our autograph?</em> Ron wondered. It‚Äôs astronaut insurance, a veteran astronaut quipped. <em>If you die, your family will have something to sell.</em> The joke did not get any laughs.</p>
