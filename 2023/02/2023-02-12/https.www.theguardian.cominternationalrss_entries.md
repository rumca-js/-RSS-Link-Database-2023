<p>Flights cancelled and severe weather warnings in place as North Island braces for category two cyclone to hit</p><p>Forecasters and weather monitoring agencies are forecasting huge swells around the North Island – and warning people to stay away.</p><p>National forecaster Metservice says the worst weather is still to come – and that it has already broken records for the most “red” weather warnings ever issued. Some of the key points from their statement at noon:</p><p>Cyclone Gabrielle is bearing down on the North Island, and despite widespread damage and disruption last night and this morning, the worst weather is still to come for many regions today.</p><p>“This is a major weather system and shouldn’t be taken lightly,” explains meteorologist Angus Hines. “We have a couple more days of wild weather ahead. We’ve never had such an extensive range of Red Severe Weather Warnings – which are the highest classification of Severe Weather Warning MetService can issue.”</p><p>“All of these places have already dealt with immense rainfall this year, and lots of them are in clean up mode from recent flooding,” says Angus.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we expect further flooding, slips power outages, and road closures Monday and Tuesday, prolonging this unprecedented wet summer.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches">Continue reading...</a>

I don’t remember this, because it was 42 years ago and I wasn’t there to make a memory. Thomas was only nine months old, and I wasn’t born yet. The strange reality I’ve come to accept is that if he hadn’t died – in an awful accident that haunts my parents and siblings still – I’d never have been born.</p><p>Thomas was a happy, sweet baby. In the too-few photos we have, he is smiling and dimpled. He looks like my other siblings, and me. The pictures are all hard copy, small with round corners, slightly yellowed. In one, he grins over my mum’s shoulder towards the camera and she gazes at Tom’s face in turn. I wish I could say exactly the right thing to save them both.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/13/after-my-brothers-death-my-parents-found-the-hope-to-try-again-i-am-that-hope">Continue reading...</a>

## Yo La Tengo: This Stupid World review – a welcome handbrake turn

<p>(Matador)<br />The New Jersey trio regain an edge of unpredictability while maintaining their warm sound on their 16th record</p><p>After a quarter of a century in which <a href="https://yolatengo.com/">Yo La Tengo</a>’s songs have gradually been shedding their more avant garde trappings for gentler, increasingly meditative ruminations (most notably on 2018’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/18/yo-la-tengo-theres-a-riot-going-on-review-improvised-meditative-for-you-too-shades-of-blue">There’s a Riot Going On</a></em>), <em>This Stupid World</em> feels like quite the handbrake turn. While their 16th album proper still sounds as warm as ever, they have regained their edge of unpredictability, with Ira Kaplan’s Velvets-indebted guitar work reclaiming centre stage.</p><p>The combination of pristine melody and fuzzed delivery on recent single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmA_d2DM57U">Fallout</a> recalls 1997’s sublime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7SdOtXI5R8">Sugarcube</a>, while the title track is wreathed in washes of ominous distortion. Meanwhile, Tonight’s Episode finds bassist James McNew reciting absurdist lyrics about yo-yos and guacamole atop a motorik groove worthy of psychedelic rockers Wooden Shjips. They can still do gorgeous introspection, too: Georgia Hubley’s vocals on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J9fV29AuOQ">Aselestine</a> sound eerily comforting, even as she sings: “Where are you?/ The drugs don’t do what you said they do.” It all makes for the New Jersey trio’s most engaging album since 2000’s <em>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/yo-la-tengo-this-stupid-world-review-a-welcome-handbrake-turn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A drug-by-drug guide talked beginners through marijuana, heroin, barbs and speed which was prescribed for weight loss</p><p>‘If you found one of these in your child’s pocket, would you know what it was?’ the <em>Observer</em> asked on 21 October 1973, introducing its guide to that year’s drugs scene, over a picture of a joint and a foil square of heroin. The dossier investigated how drugs reached Britain and the economics of the trade, interviewing users and smugglers. There’s a drug-by-drug layperson’s guide and a startling photo of a row of thriving marijuana plants growing next to a Scotland Yard officer’s desk (to appear in court as evidence, the caption explains).</p><p>Other surprises include an interview with a long-term addict recovering from an overdose who explains, ‘Gabs got her heroin prescribed by doctors who, before the law was altered in the late 1960s, were allowed to do so.’ Becky, another interviewee, says: ‘I don’t really use drugs any more,’ but explains she still takes ‘a few barbs’, smokes cannabis and has ‘a prescription for speeds from the doctor to help me with my weight’. Gerrard Street in Chinatown is described as ‘to the Chinese heroin trade what Covent Garden is to fruit and vegetables,’ with ‘thin, nervy customers hanging around in doorways.’ The price of drugs is fascinating, as past prices of everything are: £1.50 for 10mg of heroin; 12p for a speed pill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/12/hippy-daze-a-survey-of-the-uk-drugs-scene-1973">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House; Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>The American choreographer delights with a programme of rare wit, beauty and unshowy complexity. Elsewhere, a Vegas-style tribute to Leonard Cohen</p><p>There’s something about <a href="https://www.pamtanowitzdance.org/people">Pam Tanowitz</a>. A bright-edged clarity fills her works, illuminating the space around the steps, making you see movement just a little differently. It has taken the American choreographer, now 54, a long time to find the kind of success that sees her making work for companies such as New York City Ballet and the Royal Ballet. But the waiting seems to have distilled her vision, giving it a rare beauty, wit and sense of purpose. She compels attention.</p><p>The Royal Ballet has to date commissioned three of her works, shown here in a programme – two live and one on film – that <a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/everyone-keeps-me-new-pam-tanowitz-details">lasts just over an hour</a> but feels full of riches. It opens with a new piece, <em>Secret Things</em>, to a score for string quartet by <a href="https://www.annaclyne.com/">Anna Clyne</a>. At the start, dancer Hannah Grennell saunters through the musicians, looking at them thoughtfully before she begins to turn, eyes searching a fixed point, at the start of a lengthy, intricate solo full of contrasts between the graceful movements of dance and more natural notes when feet flex or bodies flop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/12/pam-tanowitz-secret-things-everyone-keeps-me-royal-ballet-review-dance-me-leonard-cohen-ballets-jazz-montreal-sadlers-wells">Continue reading...</a>
