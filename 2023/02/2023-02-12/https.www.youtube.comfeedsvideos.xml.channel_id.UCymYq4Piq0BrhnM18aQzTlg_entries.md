Find the components on Amazon - http://lon.tv/pzjs (affiliate link) -  Today I'm building my new live production PC! I plan on using Vmix after a successful two week trial. Please see the following FAQ on my component choices:

Why Intel?
Because that's what Vmix recommends. Vmix works with AMD processors but they are still recommending only Intel chips. Vmix also runs a little better on Intel as its more computational intensive - number of cores are not as important as the performance of the cores that are working the video processing. The unlocked processor was oddly less expensive vs. the regular i9-9900K

Why the Asus motherboard?
I have built systems primarily with Asus motherboards for the last 20 years. I've had good luck with them and like the brand. I also need PCIe lanes for the GPU but also the 4 way capture board I'm using. Eventually I'll upgrade the system to 10 gig ethernet.
