<p>Most water-cooled desktops have a system that cools the CPU, and maybe the GPU if it&rsquo;s extra-fancy. But that wasn&rsquo;t good enough for one intrepid user on the /r/watercooling subreddit. They spent months on possibly the most elaborate water-cooled desktop ever, cooling what appears to be every single internal component and then some. It&rsquo;s all topped off with fluorescent cooling fluid and enough LEDs to make it shine like a Terminator in an EDM rave. </p>

<p>According to user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/11czeee/she_is_complete_chief_kiss/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526884-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">psychoOC</a> (appropriate, and spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/this-fluorescent-gaming-pc-has-69-water-blocks-to-keep-it-frosty/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526884-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamer</a>), the desktop project uses a total of 69 individual water blocks, six 360mm and one 240mm radiators mounted externally to the computer desk, six coolant pumps operating at 100 percent capacity, two full gallons of coolant connected to massive reservoirs, and over 100 feet of tubing. The system uses two loops: four radiators for the CPU (Ryzen 7 7700X) and GPU (Radeon RX 7900 XTX), two others for cooling various portions of the motherboard, RAM, and lighting. Oh, and there are four vintage orange fans from 2004, of which the builder is especially proud. </p>

<p>And what did all that work accomplish? According to the poster, the system runs at just 26 degrees Celsius under load (78.8 Fahrenheit, just a few degrees over room temp). For the sake of comparison, a normal load temperature for the GPU can go over 100 degrees Celsius. There&rsquo;s only one word that can properly describe the setup: nice. </p>

## Hands on: How to use Bing Chat within Windows 11

<p>What&rsquo;s it like to use Bing Chat within Windows 11? It&rsquo;s remarkably like using it on the web, though easier to find.</p>



<p>Microsoft pushed a new feature update to Windows 11 on Tuesday. The unnamed update (which may be referred to as the February 2023 Update or Windows 11 22H2 Moment 2) includes <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522426/windows-11-february-update-adds-bing-ai-chat-tabbed-notepad-iphone.html">a decent number of features</a>, including screen recording, power recommendations, and more. But the flagship enhancement is the addition of Bing Chat, which is now integrated within Windows 11 for the first time.</p>



<p>With this update, Microsoft has enhanced the Search bar on the Windows 11 taskbar. Instead of just acting as a functional button, you can actually begin typing in it&mdash;though the Search box will open, just as before. </p>



<p>Look carefully, though, because when you do open the search box, you&rsquo;ll see two new icons: the Bing icon to the upper right, as well as an increased number of tabs at the top of the search box.  The tabs already included a list of options that included <em>Apps</em>, <em>Documents</em>, <em>Web</em>, and so on. Now they&rsquo;ll include a new entrant as well: <em>Chat</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 Search box that you can type in" class="wp-image-1526872" height="559" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Search-box-that-you-can-type-in.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="892" /><figcaption>You can now enter text in the Windows 11 Search box.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The behavior of the Search box will change depending on what you do with it: If you simply click on the search box, the various subject tabs, including Chat, won&rsquo;t appear. Instead, you&rsquo;ll see the Bing icon to the upper right, which offers to open the Search function within Microsoft Edge. If you began the search by typing in the box, the list of tabs will open, including the Chat option.</p>



<p>In either case, clicking on the Bing icon or selecting Chat from the tabs will take you to the same location, the Chat interface of Bing, or Bing Chat. (It&rsquo;s possible that this default behavior may be tweaked or updated; for instance, opening the Search box within Edge via the Bing icon may eventually take you to the Bing home page. For now, though, you&rsquo;ll end up in the same place.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Search box Bing Chat Bing icon search via Edge" class="wp-image-1526874" height="827" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Bing-Chat-within-Windows-Bing-icon-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Simply clicking the Search box within Windows opens this screen. You can access Bing Chat and Bing from the Bing icon to the upper right.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you want to perform a search using a traditional list of results, select <em>Web</em> from the list of tabs. It appears that, for now, <em>Chat</em> is the default option.</p>



<p>The Search box is also enforcing the use of Microsoft Edge, even if you&rsquo;ve instructed Windows to use a different browser, such as Google Chrome, by default. After switching the default browser from Edge to Chrome, we tried using the Search box again. As expected, the Bing icon (with the &ldquo;Open in Edge&rdquo; tooltip that&rsquo;s generated when you hover your mouse over the icon) opened Bing Chat in Edge. The <em>Chat</em> option did as well, however, with no indication that it was overriding user preferences. Microsoft executives have said previously that Bing Chat will eventually be supported on other browsers, but for now the only option seems to be Edge.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Search box Bing Chat " class="wp-image-1526875" height="870" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Bing-Chat-via-Search-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The &ldquo;true&rdquo; Bing Chat interface  opens when you begin typing in the Search box.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>We haven&rsquo;t tried using Bing Chat&rsquo;s integrated Search on a local account. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any notifications about limits Microsoft is enforcing on Bing Chat, though the company has limited Bing&rsquo;s creativity and placed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1519557/microsoft-expands-bing-chat-limits-but-becomes-boring.html">limits on the number of interactions per session </a>and per day. Those limits appear to be about six queries per session before Bing Chat asks you to change topics, and about 100 sessions per day. (Those numbers reflect Microsoft&rsquo;s decision at press time and will likely change.) </p>



<p>Microsoft is also adding &ldquo;temperature&rdquo; options to Bing Chat to allow you to choose between creativity and precision, but we haven&rsquo;t seen those options either within Windows&rsquo; settings or the web interface. Microsoft has said that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525247/asking-bing-chat-to-be-more-creative-will-decrease-its-accuracy.html">selecting a more creative version of Bing Chat will initially decrease its accuracy.</a> </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Bing Chat tell me a joke" class="wp-image-1526873" height="446" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-Chat-tell-me-a-joke.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>No matter what you select, however, you can only access Bing Chat for now via the Edge web browser.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Remember, too, that you can always <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507212/how-to-run-chatgpt-or-bing-as-a-windows-app">save Bing Chat or ChatGPT and run them as a Windows app</a>, too.</p>



<p>What it all boils down to, though, is that Bing Chat isn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; into Windows, as it uses the Microsoft cloud and the Edge web browser to generate results. It&rsquo;s essentially a shortcut&mdash;but one that&rsquo;s still easier to find and use than before.</p>

## Intel is already tied with AMD for desktop GPU sales
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526632/intel-is-already-tied-with-amd-for-desktop-gpu-sales.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526632/intel-is-already-tied-with-amd-for-desktop-gpu-sales.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>For decades, the market for desktop graphics cards has had two players: AMD (formerly ATI) and Nvidia. Intel decided to enter those hotly-contested waters in 2022 with its Arc series of GPUs along with similar dedicated offerings for laptops. According to a report on graphics card market share, Intel managed to grab 9 percent of dedicated desktop GPU sales by the end of the 2022 calendar year&mdash;the same amount of the market that AMD had for the same timeframe. </p>



<p>The figures <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/pc-gpu-shipments-decreased-15-4-sequentially-from-last-quarter-and-38-year-to-year/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526632-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">come from Jon Peddie Research</a>, which paints an otherwise dismal picture for the current GPU market, following <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470576/1470576.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">trends for PC sales in general</a>. The same report says that desktop graphics card sales in total dropped by 24 percent, the largest drop in over a decade. And 9 percent market share isn&rsquo;t exactly something you parade in front of the shareholders, especially when Nvidia continues to dominate with a near-monopoly at 82 percent. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Jon Peddie Research GPU sales graph Q4 2022" class="wp-image-1526725" height="614" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jpr-gpu-sales.png" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon Peddie Research</p></div>



<p>But taken in the context of a new competitor in an entrenched market segment, even one with the vast resources of a company like Intel, it&rsquo;s a stunning accomplishment. Arc desktop chips were maligned and delayed to the point where some industry analysts wondered if Intel was considering scrapping the entire multi-billion-dollar project. And the company still isn&rsquo;t ready to compete at the GPU high end, where the biggest slice of profit is made. But entering the space and grabbing a tie for the number two spot in less than a calendar year, by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/816728/intel-arc-gpus-might-be-the-new-budget-monsters.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">focusing on budget cards and specific performance targets</a>, can only be counted as a win. </p>



<p>For example, the Arc A750&mdash;which just <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recently got an official price cut</a> from $290 to $250&mdash;is our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">pick for the best 1080p GPU for ray tracing</a>. It&rsquo;s not the kind of blistering, benchmark-busting performance that gets you into a YouTuber&rsquo;s $10,000 fantasy PC build, but it <em>is </em>the kind of value that sells a hell of a lot of cards to people who want to play PC games on a budget. </p>



<p>On PCWorld&rsquo;s The Full Nerd podcast, Intel&rsquo;s Arc spokesman Tom Petersen told us, &ldquo;If you think about it, we&rsquo;re one of the few companies in the world that can enter a large market like discrete graphics&hellip;Nvidia will probably continue to ignore us, but AMD cannot ignore us. And it&rsquo;s going to become much more competitive over the years as we become more established.&rdquo; (25:20 in the video below.) It&rsquo;s worth noting that Petersen&rsquo;s last job was as Nividia&rsquo;s Director of Technical Marketing. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Arc&rsquo;s rise in the budget space is, indeed, impossible to ignore. It remains to be seen if Intel can leverage that momentum into a more dominant space on the high-end side of the GPU market and whether it has the will to enter that fight. </p>

## The latest LastPass fail came from an employee’s home PC

<p>Good grief, LastPass, could we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1483993/goto-says-lastpass-hackers-stole-encrypted-backups-and-keys.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">go a month without hearing about a security failure</a> from you folks? Keeping people&rsquo;s personal info safe is <em>literally your whole deal</em>. The company&rsquo;s latest statement on its highly-publicized hacks from 2022 shows that one of the key components of the incident was an employee&rsquo;s home computer. In layman&rsquo;s terms: a high-ranking employee was less than diligent with their personal machine. </p>



<p>According to the details of the investigation <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.lastpass.com/help/incident-2-additional-details-of-the-attack&amp;xcust=2-1-1526524-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">posted on LastPass&rsquo;s support system</a> (notably not in a press release or similar statement), the company says that one of its DevOps engineers was compromised via their home PC, which was specifically targeted and exploited using a &ldquo;vulnerable third-party media software package.&rdquo; Once that was achieved, the hackers used a keylogger to get the employee&rsquo;s master password, which then gave them access to Amazon Web Service encryption keys and LastPass&rsquo;s own encrypted shared data. </p>

## How to make a table of contents in Google Docs

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever found yourself scrolling endlessly through a long Google Doc, desperately searching for a specific section or piece of information, then you know the value of a well-organized table of contents. Luckily, creating a table of contents in Google Docs is a quick and easy process that can save you time and frustration. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, this feature isn&rsquo;t available for Google Docs on Android. If you want to insert a table of contents in your document, you&rsquo;ll need to use the desktop or iOS versions. Luckily for you, we&rsquo;ve assembled a step-by-step guide on how to create a table of contents.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-make-a-table-of-contents-in-google-docs-for-desktop">How to make a table of contents in Google Docs for desktop</h2>



<p>On your desktop PC, launch your browser of choice and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1525126-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">open Google Docs</a>. Next, open a document that contains multiple headings. If the document doesn&rsquo;t contain headings, you can&rsquo;t make a table of contents.</p>



<p>Once in the document, place your cursor on the location of the page where you&rsquo;d like to insert a table of contents. In our example, we&rsquo;ll insert the table of contents after the introduction and just before the first heading.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ToC location" class="wp-image-1525133" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ToC-location.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Next, click <strong>Insert</strong> in the toolbar at the top of the screen.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Click Insert." class="wp-image-1525135" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Click-Insert.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Scroll to the bottom of the Insert menu and hover your cursor over <strong>Table of contents</strong>. A sub-menu will appear with two table of content styles. You can pick either numbered or linked. The numbered table of contents adds the page number next to the respective heading. The linked table of contents adds links to each heading for quick access. Select the table of contents you want to insert.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Series ToC style" class="wp-image-1525141" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Select-a-ToC-style.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>The table of contents is now inserted in your Google Docs document.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Table of Contents in Google Docs." class="wp-image-1525145" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Table-of-contents-in-Google-Docs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>If you add more headings to the document after you insert the table of contents, you can refresh the table of contents to add the new headings by clicking the refresh icon to the left of the table of contents.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-make-a-table-of-contents-in-google-docs-for-ios">How to make a table of contents in Google Docs for iOS</h2>



<p>You can also insert a table of contents into a Google Docs document using an iPhone or iPad. Launch the app on your device and open the document that you want to add the table of contents to.</p>



<p>Once in the document, place the cursor in the spot where you&rsquo;d like to insert the table of contents by tapping that location on your screen. Next, tap the <strong>plus icon</strong>, which is the Insert option.</p>

<p>The first time I ever saw Nvidia&rsquo;s AI-infused DLSS 2 technology in action, I said it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394264/nvidias-magical-dlss-feature-could-be-coming-to-consoles.html">works like black magic</a>. Leveraging the dedicated AI tensor cores in GeForce RTX graphics cards let Nvidia run supported games much faster than before with little to no visual downgrade. Today, Nvidia is unleashing those same tensor cores on web videos with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445602/1445602.html">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> after unveiling the feature at CES 2023.</p>



<p>I spent the weekend playing around with the technology and I&rsquo;m thrilled to report that while there are a few minor DLSS-like caveats to be aware of, RTX Video Super Resolution is an absolute game changer on par with DLSS. If you watch web videos regularly, it&rsquo;s a compelling reason to consider Nvidia over AMD if you&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">shopping for a new graphics card</a> and use Chrome or Edge. But better yet, it&rsquo;s coming to existing RTX 30-series GPUs as well as Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX 40-series offerings.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="what-is-rtx-video-super-resolution">What is RTX Video Super Resolution?</h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a quick recap of how RTX Video Super Resolution&mdash;introduced today in Nvidia&rsquo;s new Game Ready Driver (531.14)&mdash;works.</p>



<p>As PCWorld&rsquo;s Keith May explains in the video below, after you activate RTX Video Super Resolution in the Nvidia Control Panel (more on that later), it runs any video displayed in Chrome or Edge through an AI algorithm designed to drastically improve the final image.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&ldquo;It runs [your video] through an algorithm that softens the darks and the blacks that get crushed and blown out and blocky, and then it&rsquo;s going to take all of your high-contrast areas&mdash;like user interface elements&mdash;and make them <em>really sharp</em>,&rdquo; Keith explained. &ldquo;The final image isn&rsquo;t going to be a true representation of what [native 4K video] would look like, because you&rsquo;re working with a 1080p source, but it&rsquo;s going to look substantially better.&rdquo;</p>



<p>And it absolutely does.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a bit more happening behind the scenes though. While Keith focused on upscaling a 1080p image to 4K in his CES video, RTX Video Super Resolution can automatically upscale a wide range of video resolutions, from lowly 360p all the way up to 1440p. It doesn&rsquo;t upscale at fixed resolutions either, instead adjusting to fit the size of the display window. &ldquo;Your 480p video will upres to 1080p on a 1080p screen (in full-screen mode) or somewhere between 480p and 1080p depending on the size of the playback window,&rdquo; Nvidia&rsquo;s Jordan Dodge told me, and my tests confirm the fact.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="rtx-video-super-resolution-works-like-black-magicusually">RTX Video Super Resolution works like black magic&hellip;usually</h2>



<p>Remember the first time you ever played a game on an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">adaptive sync G-Sync or FreeSync monitor</a>? The difference in moment-to-moment game feel was monumental, but it doesn&rsquo;t come across very well in screenshots that only capture a static image in time. RTX Video Super Resolution is similar, but you <em>can</em> spot some differences in freeze-frames. (I received access to the feature late Friday, when our production team was busy working on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">Ryzen 9 7950X3D coverage</a>, and was unable to capture video footage of RTX Super Resolution in action.)</p>

<p>First, though, I want to talk about the experience of using RTX Video Super Resolution. Once you&rsquo;ve tried it, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back to standard web video. I watched a wide variety of 1080p videos on my 4K displays, alternating between Firefox (which doesn&rsquo;t support VSR) and Chrome to see the difference between native 1080p and VSR-upscaled 4K in real time, and it&rsquo;s flat-out revolutionary.</p>



<p>The biggest difference can be seen in videos with a crisp, clear, production-quality 1080p image at a high bitrate. Watching <em>Holey Moley</em> on Hulu and <em>Drink Masters</em> on Netflix with RTX Video Super Resolution Active was transformative, even on VSR&rsquo;s lowest quality preset. (It offers four different quality levels, with varying levels of GPU performance impact. More on that later.) On Firefox, the 1080p video looks blurry and blocky in full-screen stretched across my 4K panel; turning on VSR in Chrome immediately ended that, delivering a crisp, clean image that left my jaw on the floor.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, neither Netflix nor Hulu lets you take screenshots due to copyright protections. I was able to take some screenshots of <em>Drink Masters</em>&rsquo; trailer on YouTube that somewhat highlight the potential of VSR, but YouTube&rsquo;s blockier lower bitrate native image means you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> see the full, borderline magical effect of RTX Video Super Resolution in the screenshots below.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture from the trailer introducing the contestants. (I recommend right-clicking these images and selecting &ldquo;view image in new tab&rdquo; to see them at full 4K resolution.) At native 1080p in Firefox, you see a lot of blurriness and blocky, jagged edges:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Firefox 1080p on 4K screen" class="wp-image-1525321" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Firefox-1080p-to-4K.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/iDG</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the same still, taken in Chrome with VSR&rsquo;s highest quality preset enabled. Not only is most of the blurriness gone&mdash;and what&rsquo;s left can be attributed to standard motion blur&mdash;but the edges now look incredibly crisp, and the enhanced clarity helps the colors pop more too. (Pay close attention to how the brightly-shirted contestants look so much better, the smoothness around the rightmost people, and even the legibility of the bottles in the back and the Netflix logo in the corner.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Chrome RTX VSR 1080p to 4K" class="wp-image-1525322" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chrome-1080p-to-4K.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/iDG</p></div>



<p>In close inspection, this static image may look <em>overly </em>crisp and smoothed out, with more sharpening than you&rsquo;d usually expect to see. It&rsquo;s something common to all the screenshots I took. But don&rsquo;t be fooled; RTX Video Super Resolution looks <em>stunning</em> in motion compared to standard web video, and you don&rsquo;t notice those potential nitpicks whatsoever when a video is playing. Like DLSS, VSR can be pixel-peeped in individual frames but the overall in-motion effect looks outstanding.</p>



<p>RTX Video Super Resolution also cleans up gameplay video on YouTube and Twitch to noticeable effect, but their lower bitrates somewhat stunt the impact. Watching a video of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPQ-nfP0RM0&amp;xcust=2-1-1525299-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Stodeh&rsquo;s favorite <em>Call of Duty: MW2 </em>DMZ moments</a> definitely looks better overall with VSR active, but it has more difficulty eliminating some of the blockiness and blurriness, especially in fast-moving scenes with complex gameplay occurring (such as when Stodeh failed a helicopter extraction and needed to pop smoke grenades with bullets whizzing by around the 1:35 mark of the linked video). It&rsquo;s still absolutely worth activating VSR, though.</p>



<p>&hellip;but there are limits to its effectiveness. I also watched the <em>Top Gun Maverick</em> trailer on YouTube, manually setting the resolution to 480p (a.k.a standard VHS definition) and watching it full-screen on my 4K display. As with DLSS, VSR&rsquo;s AI tensor cores can struggle when it&rsquo;s trying to upscale video with exceptionally low native pixel counts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Firefox 480p native at 4k" class="wp-image-1525319" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Firefox-480p-to-4k.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/iDG</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the native 480p video running in Firefox. It&rsquo;s blurry, like you&rsquo;d expect, but everything looks right.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Chrome RTX VSR 480p 4K" class="wp-image-1525320" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chrome-480p-to-4k.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/iDG</p></div>



<p>And here&rsquo;s the same still upscaled via RTX Virtual Super Resolution. Open the images in a new tab and pay particular attention to the right side of the guy&rsquo;s face. It looks even blurrier than the native 480p Firefox feed, with Nvidia&rsquo;s AI adding significant distortion to his cheek and even the shape of his eye. The edge of his hairline appears overly harsh as well. This is not just pixel peeping. Using VSR to upres 480p video to 4K looks <em>worse</em> than native, both in stills and in motion.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Chrome RTX VSR 480p 1080p" class="wp-image-1525318" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chrome-480p-to-1080p.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/iDG</p></div>



<p>&hellip;but all is not lost. Here&rsquo;s the same 480p still upscaled to 1080p instead. This much more reasonable jump in resolution results in a much clearer picture overall, once again delivering the same black magic-like leap in visual quality we saw when upscaling <em>Drink Masters </em>and <em>Holey Moley</em> from 1080p to 4K. All of the previously witnessed AI distortion is gone and the trailer looks fantastic in motion.</p>



<p>Bottom line? Treat it reasonably and RTX Virtual Super Resolution is an absolute game changer. Get extreme and things can start to go off the rails. Fortunately, most people won&rsquo;t be upscaling 480p video to 4K very often.</p>



<p>But how does RTX Virtual Super Resolution actually change your games?</p>

<p>Virtual Super Resolution uses your Nvidia RTX graphics card&rsquo;s GPU and tensor core muscle to achieve its effects, so it stands to reason that activating it can hinder gaming performance. The good news: It&rsquo;s only a concern when you&rsquo;re actively gaming and watching a video simultaneously. The less good news? RTX VSR will send performance plummeting if you do that, so you won&rsquo;t want to leave YouTube videos playing on a second screen while you&rsquo;re slaying noobs in <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>



<p>Nvidia actually offers four quality preset levels with VSR, with varying levels of visual effectiveness and performance impact. Level 1 is the least strenuous (while still providing a massive visual quality boost), while level 4 is the most. I repeatedly watched the first chapter of Stodeh&rsquo;s video with Windows 10&rsquo;s Task Measure running to get a feel for what each setting needed, keeping an eye on how much the RTX GPU was being utilized during the run. </p>



<p>Actual GPU utilization can vary depending on the complexity of the scene being upscaled, I discovered, but here&rsquo;s a broad look at the results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>RTX VSR off</strong> &ndash; between 4 and 33% GPU utilization, mostly 17-19%</li><li><strong>VSR 1</strong> &ndash; between 25 and 33%, usually 32%</li><li><strong>VSR 2</strong> &ndash; 24 to 35%, consistent 30-34%</li><li><strong>VSR 3</strong> &ndash; 29 to 35%, consistent 34 to 36%</li><li><strong>VSR 4</strong> &ndash; 44 to 46% consistent</li></ul>



<p>So turning on VSR even at its lowest level uses a substantial chunk of your GPU, but there&rsquo;s very little performance difference between VSR preset 1 and 3. Using preset 4 uses the most grunt, but also delivers by far the best visuals.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX VSR 1 GPU utilization" class="wp-image-1525323" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nvidia-RTX-VSR-1-preset-GPU-utilization.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Turning on RTX Video Super Resolution&rsquo;s lowest (1) quality preset while watching this Stodeh video resulted in the GeForce GPU running at 32 percent utilization pretty consistently.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/iDG</p></div>



<p>But what does that mean in practice? To measure VSR&rsquo;s impact, I ran <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s strenuous benchmark at 4K resolution and the Ultra graphics preset, to saturate the GPU, while also playing Episode 3 of Netflix&rsquo;s <em>Drink Masters</em> full-screen on my second 4K display, upscaling the native 1080p video with VSR on. I tested with both VSR 1 and 4 presets, and also tested whether activating DLSS and DLSS Frame Gen hurt performance even more, since both DLSS and RTX Video Super Resolution lean on Nvidia&rsquo;s tensor cores. Both the average frame rate and the minimum frame rate matter here, as minimum frame rates affect the overall feeling of smoothness in a game. The results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Native <em>Cyberpunk</em>, no video playing</strong> &ndash; 83.29 avg, 54.23 min</li><li><strong>Netflix video playing, VSR off</strong> &ndash; 81.78 avg, 40.40 min</li><li><strong>Netflix on, VSR 1 on</strong> &ndash; 48.74 avg, 39.66 min</li><li><strong>Netflix on, VSR 4 on</strong> &ndash; 44.55 avg, 36.97 min</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, playing a video on a second monitor while running <em>Cyberpunk </em>without VSR on doesn&rsquo;t really affect the average frame rate, but sends the minimum frame rate plummeting. That&rsquo;s to be expected when you&rsquo;re running a background video like that though. Flipping on VSR instantly tanks the average frame rate however, sending the frames per second plummeting by roughly 40 percent, <em>on top of</em> the standard drop in minimum frame rates that simply streaming a video entails.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s no real performance difference between VSR 1 and 4, however. But does that hold true when the tensor cores are being lit up by VSR and DLSS alike? Nope.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Native <em>Cyberpunk</em>, no video playing</strong> &ndash; 83.29 avg, 54.23 min</li><li><strong>Netflix on, VSR off, DLSS 3 (balanced) Frame Gen on</strong> &ndash; 110.48 avg, 72 min</li><li><strong>Netflix on, VSR 1 on, DLSS 3 (balanced) Frame Gen on</strong> &ndash; 106.44 avg, 69.86 min</li><li><strong>Netflix on, VSR 4 on, DLSS 3 (balanced) Frame Gen on</strong> &ndash; 87.27 avg, 61.66 min</li></ul>



<p>Turning on DLSS 3 Frame Gen immediately supercharges <em>Cyberpunk</em>&rsquo;s average and minimum frame rates alike, even with Nvidia Reflex disabled (as I did for my testing). With half the game frames being generated by Nvidia&rsquo;s AI cores, releasing stress from the GPU cores, flipping on VSR 1 barely affects performance whatsoever. But both the average and minimum frame times suffer with the more intensive VSR 4 enabled. It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that VSR&rsquo;s performance impact is lessened with DLSS 3 Frame Gen turned on, however, and even the worst-case DLSS/VSR 4 results deliver significantly better performance than <em>Cyberpunk </em>running without DLSS active.</p>



<p>All in all, I wouldn&rsquo;t run a VSR-upscaled video in a browser while gaming, because its performance impact can be tangible. It won&rsquo;t be an issue if you aren&rsquo;t gaming and watching simultaneously, however. If you want to watch vids while gaming, flipping VSR on or off is quick and easy.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="how-to-turn-on-rtx-video-super-resolution">How to turn on RTX Video Super Resolution</h2>



<p>Now that you know how RTX Video Super Resolution works, it&rsquo;s time to show you how to turn it on. You can&rsquo;t simply press a keyboard shortcut or flip a button in GeForce Experience. Instead, you need to dive into the slow, long-overdue-for-an-update Nvidia Control Panel.</p>



<p>First though, make sure you have what you need. Update your GeForce GPU to the latest Game Ready Driver, as today&rsquo;s release includes VSR support, and make sure either <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;xcust=2-1-1525299-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;xcust=2-1-1525299-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Edge</a> are fully updated as well. Your GPU drivers and browser both need to be on a modern build with VSR support for it to work. You&rsquo;ll also need to have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 30- or 40-series GPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Activate RTX VSR in Nvidia Control Panel" class="wp-image-1525317" height="711" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-setup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, right-click on your desktop and select Nvidia Control Panel. In the window that opens, select the <em>Adjust Video Image Settings</em> option in the Video section of the left-hand pane. Select the monitor you want to use VSR with, check the <em>Super resolution</em> box in the <em>RTX video enhancement</em> section, and choose a quality preset&mdash;I recommend 4, as it delivers the best experience and you don&rsquo;t want to run VSR videos while gaming anyways. Then click <em>Apply</em> and start your VSR upscaling engines.</p>



<p>If you want to disable VSR while gaming&mdash;and again, you should if you leave videos running in a browser while you play&mdash;just disable that checkbox and hit <em>Apply </em>once more.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="bottom-line-rtx-video-super-resolution-is-a-game-changer">Bottom line: RTX Video Super Resolution is a game changer</h2>



<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of words to say: Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX Video Super Resolution absolutely rocks.</p>



<p>You won&rsquo;t want to keep it constantly active if you watch videos while gaming, and I wish there was an easier way to flip it on and off via GeForce Experience or a hotkey, but those are minor gripes. Watching web videos with RTX Video Super Resolution active is like jumping from VHS tapes to Blu-ray discs. Once you try it, you won&rsquo;t want to go back to the way things were. If you watch a lot of videos in your browser, RTX Video Super Resolution is right up there with Nvidia Broadcast and DLSS as a killer GeForce feature, and a compelling reason to consider an Nvidia GPU over rivals. Bravo.</p>

## Huge Windows 11 feature update adds Bing AI Chat, tabbed Notepad, and more

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest feature update to Windows 11 arrives today, allowing you to access Bing AI Chat within Windows 11, quickly record a video snapshot of your screen, help lower your power bill, and even eventually control your Apple iPhone (yes, the iPhone!) directly from your PC.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest Windows 11 February 2023 feature update is actually more of a &ldquo;Moment,&rdquo; the name given to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/921158/microsoft-first-windows-11-moment-october.html">small feature updates</a> Microsoft tacked on to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1068123/windows-11-2022-update-arrives-smart-app-control.html">Windows 11 2022 Update</a> or 22H2. Microsoft called the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1356738/tabbed-file-explorer-more-new-windows-11-features-roll-out-today.html">October 2022 release of a new tabbed File Explorer</a> and other features a new &ldquo;experience,&rdquo; but has called this release &ldquo;an update.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll probably still see the <strong>winver</strong> command refer to it as &ldquo;22H2.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Either way, there are several new features to talk about. Keep in mind, though, that new Windows 11 features are delivered in two ways: Integrated Windows additions as well as apps. The former updates include the updated Bing AI Chat, controls for Windows Studio Effects, and more usable UI for tablets and 2-in-1 PCs. However, the manufacturer is also providing new or updated apps for Phone Link (with the new iPhone support as well as improved Android interactivity), an updated Chat app, and a redesigned Widgets and Quick Assist app.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-get-windows-11s-february-2023-update">How to get Windows 11&rsquo;s February 2023 update</h2>



<p>A preview of this new Moment 2, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/02/21/releasing-windows-11-build-22621-1343-to-the-release-preview-channel/&amp;xcust=2-1-1522426-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">released</a> to the Windows Insider Release Preview Channel last week, was still labeled as &ldquo;22H2&rdquo; within Windows.  (It didn&rsquo;t include the new, integrated Bing Chat.) You don&rsquo;t need to be in the Windows Insider program to access the new update, however. </p>



<p>To access the new update, Microsoft recommends that you open the Windows 11 Settings menu and go to <em>Windows Update</em>. Click the &ldquo;Check for updates&rdquo; button. You may see the new updates immediately or your device may have to wait. If you don&rsquo;t initially receive the update, it will be delivered as part of the March 2023 security release, Microsoft said. </p>



<p>Remember, Microsoft also updates individual apps via the Microsoft Store app. Open the Store app, navigate to the Library icon down in the bottom left-hand corner, and then click the &ldquo;Get updates&rdquo; button in the upper right-hand corner.</p>



<h2 id="whats-new-in-the-windows-11-february-2023-update">What&rsquo;s new in the Windows 11 February 2023 update</h2>



<h3 id="bing-chat">Bing Chat</h3>



<p>The February 2023 update to Windows 11 is most noteworthy for its integration of Bing Chat, the AI-powered chatbot that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">Microsoft launched on Feb. 9</a>. Though Bing Chat has traversed a whirlwind arc since then, providing unpredictable responses including <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507512/microsofts-new-ai-bing-taught-my-son-ethnic-slurs-and-im-horrified.html">racist slurs</a>, unexpected creativity, and even vague threats before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1519557/microsoft-expands-bing-chat-limits-but-becomes-boring.html">Microsoft limited Bing&rsquo;s interactivity</a> and dialed down its personality, the controversy has helped interest in Microsoft&rsquo;s new chatbot surge. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Bing Chat in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1525522" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-in-Windows.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Bing Chat will be built right into Windows, though it looks like it may open a Web browser to field the conversation.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest Windows 11 preview <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520692/windows-11s-terrible-taskbar-is-about-to-get-a-lot-more-useful.html">tweaks the Search box on the taskbar</a>, allowing you to type into the search box itself, like Windows 10. The actual update will allow you to translate that search term into a chat, much like you can do with the search box on Bing.com or in some versions of Microsoft Edge. What the update will <em>not</em> do is open the Bing Chat waitlist to all; you&rsquo;ll still need to wait until your virtual number is called. (You can already run <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507212/how-to-run-chatgpt-or-bing-as-a-windows-app.html">Bing Chat or ChatGPT as a Windows app</a>, provided you have access.)</p>



<p>Entering terms in the search box appears to open the Windows 11 Search box, which includes recent documents and apps, and allows you to enter your full query. It appears, however, that Windows and Bing will answer your response in a Web browser rather than within Windows itself. (It&rsquo;s unclear whether Microsoft will enforce using Edge to hold chats with Bing, but it seems likely&mdash;Microsoft encouraged users to make Bing and Edge their default search engine and browser, respectively to help boost them up the Bing Chat waitlist. But Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft&rsquo;s chief consumer marketing officer, has also said that &ldquo;over time we intend to bring it to all browsers.&rdquo;)</p>



<h3 id="an-updated-phone-link-for-ios-and-android">An updated Phone Link for iOS and Android</h3>



<p>Microsoft is also updating Phone Link, its app to connect your phone and your PC. Updates for Android phones will arrive with the February update, though Microsoft is characterizing the iPhone update as a &ldquo;preview,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s only available for members of the Windows Insider program right now.  (We would expect that the iPhone update will roll out soon, however.)</p>



<p>Tweaking <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link (formerly known as Your Phone)</a> to accommodate iPhones is an unexpected addition, though you&rsquo;ll probably notice a key limitation right away.  On Android, Your Phone allows to manage and control your Android phone via a Windows app on your Windows desktop. Not only can you place phone calls from your PC, but you can also send and receive texts, see notifications, and even interact with apps on your phone.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the preview version of Phone Link for the iPhone only allows some basic functionality. You can place calls, access contacts, and send and receive texts, with Windows notifications popping up whenever appropriate. Connecting your iPhone to your PC takes place via Bluetooth.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Windows 11 Phone Link for iOS better shot" class="wp-image-1525348" height="789" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phone-Link-for-iOS-better.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Phone Link for iOS looks a little bare-bones to begin with.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>However, that&rsquo;s all you can do, for now. Apple iPhone users will immediately recognize that only texts are supported, not iMessage. (For this, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486715/how-to-get-apple-imessages-on-windows-11.html">you&rsquo;ll need Intel&rsquo;s Unison app instead</a>.) You won&rsquo;t be able to respond to <em>any</em> group texts, nor send media, either. Those are serious limitations for iPhone users, but hey, it&rsquo;s a start.</p>



<p>Android users, however, will enjoy a richer experience, but remember, Microsoft has a weird love affair with Samsung in that owners of Galaxy and other Samsung-branded Android phones enjoy more features than other Android phones do. In this case, the update adds the ability to turn on your phone&rsquo;s hotspot feature via your PC, and continue where you left off, the website that you were browsing on your phone can now be accessed via your PC. </p>



<h3 id="built-in-screen-recording-with-snipping-tool">Built-in screen recording with Snipping Tool</h3>



<p>Users have a number of ways to record what they&rsquo;re doing within Windows, but they almost always require a separate app&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">Clipchamp, a Windows Web app</a> that offers the ability to record your screen, is one exception. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Snipping Tool screen recorder" class="wp-image-1523992" height="801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Snipping-tool-screen-recorder.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>There are a number of ways to capture screen recordings within WIndows, but Snipping Tool is designed to be one of the easiest.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ve always been able to use the ancient &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; function, the Xbox app, or the more modern Snipping Tool app to take a snapshot of a PC&rsquo;s screen. What you haven&rsquo;t been able to do is record how you&rsquo;re actually using your PC. (Outside of an Xbox game, that is.) That&rsquo;s what the new Snipping Tool screen recorder does. All you have to do is click it to start recording and click it again to stop. <em>Voila</em>! You now have a quick clip to share with friends.</p>



<h3 id="an-ai-powered-start-menu-and-file-explorer">An AI-powered Start Menu and File Explorer</h3>



<p>Windows Pro users, rejoice! AI will begin (actually) recommending files in the Start menu and in File Explorer. Remember, the &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; files within Start are the <em>most recent</em> files you&rsquo;ve used. Now, a Windows 11 Pro user who is joined to an Azure domain (aka, a business user) should find that Windows is recommending files that would be useful for your next meeting. </p>



<p>Likewise, Microsoft is also promising that File Explorer will start promoting recommended files as well. It&rsquo;s also promising faster search, though it&rsquo;s not clear whether that&rsquo;s simply through advanced indexing or trying to anticipate which files you&rsquo;ll soon be searching for.</p>



<h3 id="use-windows-to-help-lower-your-power-bill">Use Windows to help lower your power bill</h3>



<p>Windows now includes a new &ldquo;Energy recommendations&rdquo; (<em>Settings &gt; Power &amp; battery &gt; Energy recommendations</em>) to help mitigate the impact your PC has on your power bill. Remember, even a laptop can use dozens to hundreds of watts, and a powerful desktop can use even more. The new recommendations include everything from turning <em>off</em> your screensaver (turn off your screen instead!) to managing display brightness and color to putting your device to sleep quickly when not in use. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Energy Recommendations to save power" class="wp-image-1525524" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Energy-Recommendations.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows 11&rsquo;s energy recommendations.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Remember, Windows Hello and SSDs should mean your PC resumes almost instantly, so there&rsquo;s no reason to keep your PC powered on if it doesn&rsquo;t need to be.</p>



<h3 id="widgets-now-support-facebook">Widgets now support Facebook</h3>



<p>We&rsquo;ve been wondering when Widgets would integrate your social feed. A new look for Widgets&mdash;the hodgepodge of sports scores, weather forecasts, stock prices, and gossipy &mdash;now supports more content <em>including</em> Meta (Facebook) and Spotify. It&rsquo;s not clear what adding your Facebook feed will entail, since Facebook has traditionally used its site to gather its own data on your habits. From an example screenshot, however, it appears that Widgets supports Facebook Messenger, but not the full Facebook feed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Widgets in Windows 11 with Facebook and Spotify" class="wp-image-1525525" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Widgets.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Widgets exposes a lot of content that you might not necessarily need or want to see &mdash; which is why Microsoft is adding content from its more valuable properties, like Game Pass.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also be allowed to add Widgets that include content from Xbox Game Pass and Phone Link, too, Microsoft says. Otherwise, you can always <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394832/how-to-remove-the-widgets-button-from-windows-11.html">hide Widgets</a> from view.</p>



<h3 id="improved-voice-access-and-braille-support">Improved Voice Access and Braille support</h3>



<p>Voice Access was an intriguing introduction to Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update (22H2). It&rsquo;s a way to orally control your PC beyond just mere dictation. The February update promises a &ldquo;more flexible and enhanced solution,&rdquo; with improved scrolling support and support from apps from Word to File Explorer.</p>



<p>Microsoft is also promising improved Braille support, complete with three new &ldquo;Designed for Surface&rdquo; displays from HumanWare. These new displays will make switching between Narrator and other screen readers a &ldquo;seamless experience,&rdquo; Microsoft says.</p>



<h3 id="quick-assist-is-now-part-of-the-windows-apps-collection">Quick Assist is now part of the Windows apps collection</h3>



<p>You may not have had occasion to use Quick Assist, but chances are that you&rsquo;ve helped out a friend or family member who are having troubles with their PC. With Quick Assist, you can do so without leaving your desk.</p>



<p>Quick Assist isn&rsquo;t new: a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416103/windows-10s-quick-assist-lets-you-fix-dads-computer-from-your-desk.html">version of it has existed for years</a>, dating back to Windows 10. But the premise is simple enough. If you&rsquo;re the tech guru, you can ask your friend or relative to let you take control of their PC, supplying them a code to authenticate that you&rsquo;re originating the interaction. Conversely, you can offer control of your PC to a friend or relative, letting them remotely diagnose a problem from afar. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that both sides trust one another. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Quick Assist" class="wp-image-1523993" height="804" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Quick-Assist-app.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft is beefing up Quick Assist within Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>As long as the connection remains active, though, one party can &ldquo;drive&rdquo; the other&rsquo;s PC, taking care of whatever&rsquo;s needed. What&rsquo;s new is that the two parties can either share their screen <em>or</em> give up total control. There&rsquo;s also a new &ldquo;laser pointer&rdquo; that a user can use to highlight a control or button that the other can access.</p>



<h3 id="a-tweaked-tablet-interface">A tweaked tablet interface</h3>



<p>Microsoft already revamped the tablet interface for Windows 11 (in Windows 10, swiping in from the left opens the Task View; in Wndows 11 it opens Widgets) and it&rsquo;s tweaking it yet again. If you have a device like a Surface Pro 8 and detach the Surface keyboard, the Windows taskbar will now vanish automatically, instead of spacing out the icons. To see it again, you&rsquo;ll need to swipe up.</p>



<h3 id="smaller-additions">Smaller additions</h3>



<p><strong>Tabbed Notepad is here:</strong> Remember the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478585/tabbed-notepad-joins-improved-settings-spotlight-in-windows-betas.html">tabbed version of Notepad</a> that debuted in the Windows 11 betas this past January? It&rsquo;s now rolling out within Windows.</p>



<p><strong>Windows Chat has a new interface: </strong>We didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d see much need for Windows Chat when Windows 11 first launched and we still don&rsquo;t&mdash;there are just too many other ways to connect with your friends. Windows Chat uses the consumer version of Microsoft Teams and only a devoted Microsoft fan will use it to connect to friends outside of work hours. However, Microsoft says that the Chat interface has been revamped and now makes it easier than ever to preview video before joining a call.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Windows Chat" class="wp-image-1523995" height="794" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-revamped-chat-interface.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows Chat at least looks better within the February 2023 update to Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>Windows Studio Effects join Quick Settings: </strong>This isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal now, but it may be in a year or two. Windows Studio Effects tap dedicated AI functions in processors like the Qualcomm Snapdragon processors for PCs as well as some 12th-gen Intel Core processors. They provide AI-powered enhancements for video calls such as background blur, noise filtering, and some unique camera auto-panning features as well as Eye Contact. (See our reviews of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499055/samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360</a> for more.) Intel has already said that future processor generations will include dedicated AI blocks and AMD is expected to follow suit.</p>



<p>All Microsoft is doing is hauling out the Windows Studio Effects controls and placing them in the taskbar&rsquo;s Quick Settings, setting the stage for the future.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Windows Studio Effects" class="wp-image-1523997" height="812" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-studio-effects-in-taskbar.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>

## Windows 11 can finally manage iPhone texts and calls, with several catches

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft is finally doing something that it&rsquo;s never quite been able to do: connect Windows PCs to an Apple iPhone.</p>



<p>As part of the February 2023 update to Windows 11 that Microsoft announced today (technically, Moment 2 for Window 11 22H2) Microsoft announced that it is adding a preview of Phone Link for the Apple iPhone for Windows beta testers. That will allow owners of Windows 11 PCs who own an Apple iPhone to leave their iPhone in their pocket and control it remotely, via their PC, via Bluetooth. But there are still severe limitations compared to Android.</p>



<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398482/windows-10-mobile-is-finally-dead-how-to-take-your-data-and-move-on.html">pulled the plug on Windows Phone in 2019</a>, the company had a goal: connect Windows PCs to Android phones and iPhones to try to bridge the gap between phone and PC. (At the same time, Microsoft devoted considerable resources toward developing mobile apps for both platforms.) However, Microsoft found much greater success connecting to the more open Android platform, with an emphasis on Samsung phones. Microsoft&rsquo;s ambitions to connect the iPhone via <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link</a> (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402706/how-to-use-windows-10s-your-phone-experience.html">once called Your Phone</a>) went unfulfilled, and Microsoft has never said exactly why.</p>



<p>Now, however, Microsoft has taken its first steps to remedy that. Phone Link now connects to the iPhone, and you&rsquo;ll have the option of managing your iPhone contacts, placing and receiving calls, and sending texts via the Windows Phone Link app. There&rsquo;s a small catch, however: Microsoft considers this to be a preview, so the new Phone Link app with support for iOS will only be available for Windows Insiders (regardless of what test channel they choose) <em>and</em> only a small percentage of eligible users will receive the update.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-set-up-phone-link-for-ios">How to set up Phone Link for iOS</h2>



<p>According to Microsoft, those users who do have access to the updated Phone Link app will see the option of connecting either an iPhone or an Android phone on the initial setup screen. You&rsquo;ll then be asked to pair the two devices by scanning a QR code, as well as confirming that a numeric code sent to both devices matches up.</p>



<p>The important thing, according to Microsoft, is to enable the appropriate Bluetooth permissions on your iPhone. Once those are put in place, Phone Link will deliver basic iOS support for calls, messages, and contacts, Microsoft said. &ldquo;This means you will be notified directly through your Windows notifications,&rdquo; it said in a blog post.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Windows 11 Phone Link for iOS setup" class="wp-image-1525347" height="767" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phone-Link-for-iOS-setup.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The setup process for the Windows 11 Phone Link for iOS app requires you to pick your phone and set permissions.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll note, however, a major caveat: These are <em>SMS texts</em> that you can manage, not iMessages &mdash; a key selling point of the iPhone. Moreover, there are other gotchas, too.

</div>


<p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 is a remarkable laptop, not only benefiting from a chipset upgrade that make it faster and more powerful than predecessors, but also a design revamp that delivers a new and improved dual screen viewing experience.</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s even more impressive is that Asus manages to bundle all this into a chassis no bigger or thicker than that of a laptop with a single display. Granted you don&rsquo;t mind using a smallish sized trackpad, the Duo 16 is the kind of laptop that will entrance you with its visuals and impress you with its zippy performance in both games and productivity apps.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-specifications-and-features">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: Specifications and features</h3>



<p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 comes in CPU configurations up to AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX. The specifications of our review unit are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-design-and-build">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: Design and build</h3>



<p>Despite being a dual screen laptop, the Duo 16 looks every bit as stylish as any other Asus ROG gaming laptop. From its fine edges to the ROG slash and logo and dot matrix patterning on the top cover, it&rsquo;s remarkably elegant.</p>



<p>That styling, of course, helps to distinguish it from the more productivity-skewed dual screen laptops in Asus&rsquo;s stable, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus Pro Duo 14 &ndash; the Duo 16&rsquo;s closest relative being the more gaming focused Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 SE. But it also gives it that high-end appeal that makes you feel proud to show it off anywhere you go, whether that be your gaming den or workplace.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519656" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2022_ROG_Zephyrus_Duo_16_Scenario.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 looks every bit a high-performance gaming laptop thanks to ROG styling on the top cover. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>Asus deserves praise for squeezing two panels into such a lightweight and thin chassis. The Duo 16 measures just 0.81 x 13.98 x 10.47 inches, which amazingly puts it on par with some single display laptops like the HP Victus 16. It also weighs just 5.73 pounds, which means it&rsquo;s never a burden to carry around.</p>



<p>While the Duo 15 SE was a class act in its own right, Asus have pushed the envelope further, building upon that best-in-class design to make the Duo 16 the glaringly better option.</p>



<p>For one, its primary display is now bigger, bringing to life visuals in a more satisfying 16-inches. It&rsquo;s also taller and has thinner (4.3mm) bezels that frame it up in a 16:10 ratio instead of a 16:9 ratio that now feels a bit dated in the Duo 15 SE.</p>



<p>The main benefits of these changes are obvious: If you&rsquo;re a gamer, you will undoubtedly see more action in the periphery of the Duo 16&rsquo;s display. Creators, on the other hand, will revel in how much easier it is to compare spreadsheets, run apps side-by-side, or view multiple windows&mdash;all things that are now much simpler.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-keyboard-and-trackpad">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: Keyboard and trackpad</h3>



<p>Fitting two glorious displays into the Duo 16 has meant its trackpad is quite small&mdash;that&rsquo;s despite Asus increasing its size year-on-year. It&rsquo;s also positioned at the far right hand side of the laptop&rsquo;s chassis, which feels a bit awkward.</p>



<p>Despite these small grievances, the keyboard is both very comfortable and attractive. It sports spacious keys that are neither too bouncy nor too squishy, with generous 1.7mm travel between them.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519661" height="830" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Keyboard-edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Duo 16&rsquo;s keyboard makes use of every ounce of space.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The keyboard&rsquo;s per-key lit RGB backlighting is also a sight to behold, looking beautiful any time of the day. You won&rsquo;t get any unsightly halo effects around the keys either, even on the brightest setting. The RGB lighting can also be easily customized via the Aura Sync utility in the Armory Crate software app.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-dual-displays">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: Dual displays</h3>



<p>My review unit&rsquo;s QHD (2,560 x 1600 pixel) ROG Nebula HDR primary panel with 165Hz refresh rate produced superbly detailed images and smooth, consistent frames that made gaming and watching videos a blast. The 14.09-inch UHD ScreenPad Plus was similarly stunning, and being touch-sensitive, it saved me a ton of time &ndash; I could simply move files and icons around with my finger.</p>



<p>The primary display is powered by MiniLEDs with 512 zones of illumination, so it&rsquo;s a lot brighter than standard LED displays. I measured 1039 nits by my Lux meter, which trumps some rivals by nearly 600 nits of brightness. It also has a 1000:1 contrast ratio.</p>



<p>If that sounds like overkill, wait until you see the colors and darks it can produce; it renders some of the richest hues and deepest blacks I&rsquo;ve seen at this resolution, making it ideal for creative work involving photographs or shading. The color accuracy on this 100 percent DCI-P3, VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified panel is also top notch, so it&rsquo;s perfect for comparing images.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519629" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2022_ROG_Zephyrus_Duo_16_Front.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t get to try one, Asus also give you the option of a Dual Spec primary display. This lets you switch on a dime between a productivity-friendly UHD resolution with 120Hz refresh rate, or an esports-primed FHD resolution with 240Hz refresh rate. This is an excellent choice if you intend on using your Duo 16 for both work as well as competitive gaming.</p>



<p>In comparison to the Duo 15 SE, there&rsquo;s also much better visual continuity between the displays. This can be attributed to the new positioning of the ScreenPad Plus.</p>



<p>Just like in the Duo 15 SE, it tilts up at a 13-degree angle, but its new home 25 mm closer to, and directly below, the primary display renders the bottom bezel almost invisible, giving you a more comprehensive view of both panels at once.</p>



<p>To say this makes multitasking easier than in the Duo 15 SE is an understatement. For example, where before it would have taken me a whole second cross-referencing a gaming map or reading my Discord chats, in the Duo 16 it took just milliseconds.</p>



<p>One can only predict the impact this will have on users&rsquo; gaming performance or productivity. Suffice to say, it&rsquo;s going to make for a much more enjoyable experience overall.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-i-o-options-and-audio">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: I/O options and audio </h3>



<p>With games and video content now shared between my devices on a daily basis, I need my laptop to have an excellent selection of ports to keep up. Thankfully, the Duo 16 had just what I needed, including two USB-A ports and two USB-C ports, a HDMI 2.1 port and a microSD card slot for quick file swaps.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519668" height="712" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Left-side-ports-edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Duo 16 features a useful selection of ports for gamers and creative professionals.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Duo 16 also comes with next generation Wi-Fi 6E wireless connectivity, which harnesses an extra 1200 MHz on the 6G frequency band compared to standard Wi-Fi 6. This is a must have for gamers who want the fastest possible latency in high-performance games, but it&rsquo;s also really useful for content creators juggling large files in the cloud.</p>



<p>With not two or four but six speakers onboard, including dual force-cancelling woofers, the Duo 16&rsquo;s audio is surprisingly resonant for a laptop so thin. It also sounds very crisp. Dolby Atmos support also helps deliver a cinema-like surround sound experience, so watching movies with dramatic storylines is a real treat.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-cpu-performance">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: CPU performance</h3>



<p>The Duo 16 sports an 8 core, 16 thread Ryzen 9 6900HX mobile processor belonging to AMD&rsquo;s 6000 Series. This CPU has a base clock of 3.3 GHz and a maximum boost clock of 5.0 GHz &ndash; fairly decent operating speeds by anyone&rsquo;s standards.</p>



<p>AMD says its 6000 Series processors are 1.3x faster than the previous 5000 Series generation of mobile processors, which means the Duo 16 gets a nice speed boost over the Duo 15 SE. What&rsquo;s more, these chips are more energy efficient, benefiting from approximately 50 built-in power-management features, including some for the laptop&rsquo;s fan and cooling system.</p>



<p>While we didn&rsquo;t have benchmark scores on file for the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 SE, we did have results from a panoply of powerful laptops to compare and contrast our Duo 16&rsquo;s performance to. These included laptops featuring Intel&rsquo;s nearest CPU equivalent&mdash;the Core i7-12700H CPU, like the 2022 Razer Blade 17.</p>



<p>First test off the block was Maxon&rsquo;s Cinebench R20 Single-Threaded benchmark which tests just a single core of the Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU. Below, our graph shows the Duo 16&rsquo;s performance was just average compared to the comparisons.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519665" height="544" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cinebench-R20-Single-Threaded-performance.png?w=1200" width="1143" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>This result isn&rsquo;t all that unexpected; AMD&rsquo;s own benchmarks show only modest gains for Ryzen 6000 CPUs over previous generation CPUs in single-threaded tasks, but bigger gains in multi-threaded tasks. Nevertheless, the Duo 16 will still have no trouble running lightweight programs, or apps.</p>



<p>Still in the Cinebench R20 program, we completed the Multi-Threaded benchmark. Here, every core of our laptop&rsquo;s CPU was put to work rendering a detailed image on its primary display. At test&rsquo;s end, it scored 5,398, a result that proves it can easily handle AAA games or demanding productivity programs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519666" height="579" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cinebench-R20-Multi-Threaded-benchmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The free HandBrake utility was the next port of call. This is our go-to program to test how well a laptop can stay the course when processing a CPU-intensive task before it gets too hot and needs to throttle performance.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519670" height="552" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HandBrake-benchmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>As you can see in our graph, the Duo 16 finished in the quickest time of 1,018 seconds. Serious gamers, or creators that do encoding or video editing will be well encouraged by this result that implies the Duo 16&rsquo;s CPU can stay cool and power on, even when some competitor laptops fall by the wayside.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-gpu-performance">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: GPU performance</h3>



<p>Our Duo 16 review unit featured an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti discrete GPU&mdash;a very powerful RTX 30 Series card that&rsquo;s highly coveted by gamers and content creators alike for its ability to produce fast frame rates.</p>



<p>This almost-top-tier mobile GPU has a lot of powerful cores onboard, including 232 Tensor Cores and 53 Ray Tracing Cores. It also benefits from Nvidia&rsquo;s most up-to-date software support, including DLSS AI rendering and Dynamic Boost technology. Let&rsquo;s see how the Duo 16&rsquo;s RTX 3080 Ti fared in our graphical tests&hellip;</p>



<p>The 3DMark Time Spy 1.2 Overall benchmark provided a good snapshot of the GPU&rsquo;s abilities within the framework of our laptop&rsquo;s componentry. In this test, the Duo 16 placed second in our field of comparisons&mdash;more than proving its suitability for rendering high fidelity graphics in gaming or video applications.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519672" height="513" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Time-Spy-1.2-Overall-benchmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>In our first gaming benchmark for <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>, the Duo 16 outclassed the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition, but was pipped at the post by two of the most powerful gaming laptops released within the last 12 months&mdash;the Razer Blade 17 and Alienware X15 R2.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519673" height="549" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RoTTR-benchmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Finally, we ran the benchmark for the game <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. As you can see in the graph, the results are highly consistent with our previous results, in that the Duo 16 fell shy of producing framerates as high as the Razer Blade 17 or Alienware X15 R2, but still outpaced a collection of other very capable laptops.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519674" height="521" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SoTTR-benchmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>So, what&rsquo;s the verdict? Although it didn&rsquo;t top our charts, these results show the Duo 16 to be a strong performer in graphics-based tasks, which is no mean feat for a laptop with not one, but two displays. By demonstrating consistently high frame rates, we can confidently say the Duo 16 is wholly up to the task it was designed for.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-battery-life">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: Battery life</h3>



<p>To test the Duo 16&rsquo;s battery we juiced the laptop up to 100 percent charge then let it run down to standby by playing a 4K Hollywood movie on repeat. Following that, we examined the battery usage report which showed that the Duo 16 lasted just shy of the six hour mark.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1519675" height="580" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Battery-test.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>This is not surprising, nor a bad result for a gaming laptop. The battery longevity of gaming laptops is average at best, since they tend to have the most power-hungry hardware onboard. That said, in an unplugged gaming scenario the Duo 16&rsquo;s battery is likely to drain down in double time, so you can expect approximately three hours gaming when away from an outlet.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-conclusion">Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16: Conclusion </h3>



<p>Dual display laptops have always been an enthusiast&rsquo;s choice and at around $4,000 you&rsquo;ll have to be completely sold on the dual display experience to buy one. The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 doesn&rsquo;t change that fact, but it does make the proposition of switching to one incredibly appealing. Gamers and content creators will undoubtedly revel in the extreme power, beautiful visuals and excellent portability this laptop has to offer.</p>
