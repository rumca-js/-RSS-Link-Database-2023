In terms of performance, I only had a single issue with Scars Above. This review covers the PS5 version of the game, and the frame rate seems to hold pretty steady even when things get hectic. I didnâ€™t notice any serious frame drops or stutters. I did, however, have the game completely crash in the intro sequence. It gave me a bad feeling so I was braced for more lost progress due to semi-frequent crashes, but I only ever saw that one. 

There is a lot to like in Scars Above. If you can get past the issues with the character models and animations, there is a really fun, unique sci-fi shooter with an interesting story to experience.
