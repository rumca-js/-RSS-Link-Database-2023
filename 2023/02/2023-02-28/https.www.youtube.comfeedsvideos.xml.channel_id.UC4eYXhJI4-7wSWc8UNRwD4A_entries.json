Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.\n\nBobby Carter | February 28, 2023\nOmah Lay brought a calm demeanor and a bright smile to his time at NPR headquarters. By the third song of his Tiny Desk concert, \u201csoso,\u201d I realized that the Nigerian star was exercising lots of emotions through this set. The first two titles, \u201cBad Influence\u201d and \u201ci\u2019m a mess,\u201d are self-explanatory, yet the message of \u201csoso\u201d \u2014 that he\u2019s yearning for something to take his pain away \u2014 could get lost in the song\u2019s upbeat rhythms. At any rate, Omah Lay\u2019s performance showcases a songwriter grappling with all the feels, unafraid to share them with the world.  \n\nOmah Lay rose to prominence during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic with his debut EP, Get Layd. In a short time, he\u2019s joined the slew of African artists who\u2019ve dominated dance floors and infiltrated America with Afro-fusion music. The feat is extraordinary and bittersweet, given that when he first broke through, the music industry was in a frenzy and the clubs closed. But songs like \u201cLo Lo\u201d and \u201cFree My Mind\u201d resonated despite not booming in the big speakers, and he kept working until it was safe to come back out \u2014 and landed even more hits. He made the trip from Nigeria exclusively for the Tiny Desk and brought his band, The Raw Soundz, from Ghana, plus percussionist Boogie and singers Monet Shelton and Domo Abrams. Together, they flipped selections from Omah\u2019s catalog, including a new version of his hit \u201cunderstand\u201d with a twist. \n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cBad Influence\u201d\n\u201ci\u2019m a mess\u201d\n\u201csoso\u201d\n\u201cnever forget\u201d\nMedley: \u201cInfinity,\u201d \u201cbend you,\u201d \u201cunderstand\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmah Lay: vocals\nErnest \"Subroza\" Osei-Bonsu: guitar\nDonald Crentsil: keys\nKwabena Kyeremeh Adade: drums\nLeroy \"Boogie\" Greer: percussion\nSteve Millar: bass\nDomo Abrams: vocals\nMonet Shelton vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Mix: Josh Rogosin\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyouani\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Pilar Galvan\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #omahlay #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjczZIxr_0", "date_published": "2023-02-28 10:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
