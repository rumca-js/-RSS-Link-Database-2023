<p>You can’t fail to warm to the cheery young Mormons in this unprecedented documentary … even as they try to fill your emotional void with their beliefs</p><p>It’s early to call it but my fact of the year must surely be that Chorley – yes, that Chorley, halfway between Wigan and Preston – is the European centre of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mormonism">Mormonism</a>, the Lancastrian home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). It is the UK’s Salt Lake City.</p><p>I suspect that the documentary The Mormons Are Coming is a direct result of this fact reaching the ears of a BBC researcher who, after a disbelieving shake of the head and a quick online search to confirm, got on the phone to the nearest commissioner and informed him that Auntie had a duty to bring this extraordinary news to the people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/28/the-mormons-are-coming-review-lovely-kind-and-deeply-unsettling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It says much for Fulham’s progress under Marco Silva that they dropped their standards and still reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. There were a few wobbles, a few worrying moments, but the final score felt right. Leeds United had simply not done enough in the final third and, although there were some encouraging signs for Javi Gracia, he will demand better finishing when they return to west London to face Chelsea on Saturday.</p><p>Gracia will know that Leeds need more of an edge if they are going to stay in the Premier League. Their away form remains wretched – only two wins on the road all season – and they still lack oomph in both boxes. Fulham were far more decisive. They could rely on two moments of class, one from João Palhinha, the other from Manor Solomon, and are one game away from a trip to Wembley.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/28/fulham-leeds-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As someone from an ethnic minority, my dad was much more likely to die from Covid. So why won’t the inquiry address structural racism?</p><p>My dad, Zahari Ngah, died of Covid-19 on 7 February 2021. He was 68 years old, and had no underlying health conditions. He was a Malaysian national, who came to the UK in the 1970s to study. He settled here, trained and qualified as a clinical psychologist and a child and adult psychotherapist. He worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years, and he cared deeply and sincerely for the health service and the democratisation of mental healthcare.</p><p>In his spare time Dad worked with refugees and asylum seekers. In the weeks before his death he texted us – we couldn’t be with him in hospital – to remind us to donate to the Unicef Yemen appeal, and sent us a song for Grenfell. He was a caring man, who was always thinking of others.</p><p>Safiah Ngah is a member of and spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/28/fathers-death-covid-racist-system">Continue reading...</a>

So when courts are as stretched as they seem to be, with a backlog of hundreds of thousands of trials, is it really in the public interest to prosecute peaceful protesters at all? Is it ever justifiable for non-violent defendants to be held in prison – some for many months – before their cases even make it to court? What is the cost of all of this, from the public money being spent on trials and imprisonment to the huge toll that incarceration and prosecution take on alleged criminals?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/should-climate-activists-be-punished-at-all">Continue reading...</a>

<p>International adventures will be the crucial contributor but the UK operation is not irrelevant to the wider story</p><p>Tim Steiner, chief executive and co-founder of Ocado, has learned over 20 mostly loss-making years how to put a positive spin on the numbers, but he has excelled himself. As the group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/ocado-losses-retail-sales-decline-customers-shop">reported a thumping full-year loss of £501m</a>, caused in large part by a huge earnings reversal in its UK joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer, Steiner claimed the same operation had “shown its resilience”.</p><p>Really? OK, the UK business added customers and online market share, but they were about the only metrics going in the desired direction. Turnover fell 3.8% as customers trimmed the size of their online baskets and top-line earnings from the joint venture collapsed from £150m to minus £4m. Rather than a show of resilience, this looked more like a demonstration of how the online grocery model can be horribly inflexible from the point of view of the operator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/feb/28/the-long-term-seems-to-be-getting-longer-for-online-grocer-ocado">Continue reading...</a>

## Israeli settlers on the rampage isn’t a shock – it’s daily life for Palestinians in the West Bank

<p>It’s no accident that the Israeli army didn’t stop the violence in Huwara: such intimidation is key to how the state rules over my people</p><p>Hundreds of Israeli settlers descended on Sunday night on the Palestinian town of Huwara near Nablus in the West Bank. They assaulted Palestinian civilians, shot one dead and set dozens of buildings and cars on fire. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/27/israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank-escalates-huwara">rampage occurred</a> in one of the most militarised territories in the world. Yet as far as we were concerned, the Israeli army, the strongest in the Middle East, was missing in action.</p><p>Witnessing such a violent rampage, many observers resort to calls for a “return to calm” in Palestine. But such feeble calls are no longer adequate – if they ever were. One cannot ignore the recurrent nature of <a href="https://www.btselem.org/settler_violence_updates_list">settlers’ violence</a> and the way it acts as a pillar of Israel’s rule over the Palestinians. The infliction of violence with impunity, the army’s <a href="https://www.btselem.org/settler_violence">enabling of this violence</a> and the denial of basic rights embody the existing order. Sunday’s rampage is thus a manifestation of the status quo in Palestine, not an exceptional occurrence or momentary disorder.</p><p>Nimer Sultany is reader in public law at Soas University of London.

<p>On the eve of her debut solo album, the founder of the feminist punk band explains why she never wore stilettos (you couldn’t run away from Teds in them) and how she fell in love with painting</p><p>I Play My Bass Loud, the debut solo record by film-maker, painter and punk musician Gina Birch, is an album of manifestos. The title track is a Walk on the Wild Side-esque ode to taking up space with an instrument usually seen as auxiliary. There are songs raging against injustice and about proudly branding yourself a feminist. And then there’s I Will Never Wear Stilettos, an anarchic, tongue-in-cheek dub song about the virtues of comfortable footwear. “In punk, shoes seemed to be quite important. We wore brothel creepers and the Teds didn’t like that – they used to chase the punks,” says Birch, laughing. A founder of seminal feminist punk band <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/nov/05/the-raincoats-reform">the Raincoats</a>, much of her youth was spent running from undesirables – hence the no stilettos rule. “At least you could run in brothel creepers!”</p><p>Today, 67-year-old Birch has gone sans footwear. We’re sitting on blue couches in her chaotic and charming north London home, Birch resting her tea on an amp as she discusses why, 44 years after she laid a DIY rock blueprint with the Raincoats’ eponymous 1979 debut, she is finally releasing a solo record. In the early 2000s, Birch got the music production software Logic Pro 9, thought “Oh, I’ll give that a crack”, and over the next two decades built up a catalogue of demos filled with samples and AutoTune and allusions to political flashpoints such as Occupy and Pussy Riot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/28/hairy-legs-scary-gina-birch-punk-raincoats-stilettos">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Wane to lead England through to 2025 World Cup in France</li><li>Senior players offer crucial support to coach in RFL review</li></ul><p>Shaun Wane will continue as head coach of the England men’s rugby league team through to the next Rugby League World Cup in 2025. Despite the disappointment of missing out on the final of last year’s World Cup on home soil, the Rugby Football League have confirmed that Wane will remain in post for another three years and for the next tournament in France.</p><p>England were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/samoas-stephen-crichton-breaks-england-hearts-with-golden-drop-goal">beaten by Samoa in extra-time in the semi-finals of last year’s World Cup</a> in London, but Wane has retained the backing of the playing group despite that result. The Guardian understands that senior RFL officials, led by the chairman, Simon Johnson, conducted an extensive review in the off-season which included crucial conversations with senior England players. They all gave their backing for Wane to continue in the role.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/28/shaun-wane-to-stay-on-as-england-rugby-league-head-coach-despite-world-cup-disappointment">Continue reading...</a>

## Fossil fuels kill more people than Covid. Why are we so blind to the harms of oil and gas? | Rebecca Solnit

<p>Were we able to perceive afresh the sheer scale of fossil fuel impact we might be horrified, but because this is an old problem too many don’t see it as a problem</p><p>If fossil fuel use and impact had suddenly appeared overnight, their catastrophic poisonousness and destructiveness would be obvious. But they have so incrementally become part of everyday life nearly everywhere on Earth that those impacts are largely accepted or ignored (that they’ve also corroded our politics helps this lack of alarm). This has real consequences for the climate crisis. Were we able to perceive afresh the sheer scale of fossil fuel impact we might be horrified. But because this is an old problem too many don’t see it as a problem.</p><p>Human beings are good at regarding new and unfamiliar phenomena as dangerous or unacceptable. But long-term phenomena become acceptable merely because of our capacity to adjust.

We saw this with Covid-19, where in the first months most people were fearful and eager to do what it took to avoid contracting or spreading the disease, and then grew increasingly casual about the risks and apparently oblivious to the impacts (the WHO <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">charts</a> almost 7 million deaths in little over three years).</p><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

<p>We’ve all heard of the ‘lipstick effect’ and the ‘hemline index’ as indicators of the overall economy. But perhaps there is another gauge we should consider ...</p><p>OK, I’m calling tit: we’ve reached peak cleavage. Over the years I’ve selflessly and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/16/hip-cleavage-new-summer-trend-ridiculous-cleavage-history">diligently kept abreast</a> of ridiculous cleavage trends. Which is harder than it sounds, let me tell you, because there has been no end of them. The year 2000, for example, saw the advent of “toe cleavage”. According to Manolo Blahnik, something of an expert on foot-related matters, “you must only show the first two cracks”. A decade later, everything was different: 2012 was the year of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/11/underboob-bum-slip-new-female-body-parts">sideboob</a>. Then <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2295205/Is-bum-slip-new-boob-Kate-Moss-Miley-Cyrus-Rihanna-fans-cheeky-flash.html">the Daily Mail</a>, which knows a thing or two about cleavage, predicted the “side boob’s days could be numbered” and it was the “bum slip’s” time to shine. Along this journey we’ve seen various fashionistas declare the advent of male cleavage, side cleavage, no cleavage and hip cleavage.</p><p>I know all this is a lot to take in, but bear with me here because there has been an important new development in the cleavage wars. According to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/22/model-gabrielle-epstein-reveals-bikini-trend-circumboob/">New York Post</a>, 2023 is the year of the “circumboob”. This is when you wear something that manages to show pretty much everything but the nipple. The year’s general aura of chaos has spilled over to fashion trends and now “sideboob, innerboob <em>and</em> underboob” have converged into one circum-trend. I know that the New York Post is not always to be trusted, but I have it on good authority that this new trend can be spotted out in the wild. I’ll put money on it: the circumboob is legit.

<p>Two young British directors drive the Pamir Highway in a superficial travelogue that reveals little about themselves or the women they meet along the way</p><p>Do you remember when friends would go somewhere on holiday, or maybe take a gap year, and when they got back you had to sit for hours as they showed you all the photographs they took on the trip? Some people would even put together a slideshow: there would be pictures of locals they met who were <em>so</em> interesting, the food they ate, the scenery they saw and so on. You walk away happy that they had a good time and that the experience opened their eyes to new cultures and all that, but the truth is: most people’s illustrated lectures on their travel experiences are crushingly dull.</p><p>Sadly, that also goes (mostly) for this documentary made by two young British directors Hannah Congdon and Catherine Haigh, fresh out of university and who have the means and ability to do the 2023 version of this son et lumière show. For reasons never quite clearly explained, the pair decide to drive the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20190102-pamir-highway-a-wild-ride-across-central-asia">Pamir Highway in Central Asia</a> in a Toyota SUV for a couple of months, stopping along the way to meet people they contacted through Instagram and other social media platforms. Their planned route takes them from Kyrgyzstan through Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and while they get a flat tyre at one point and come a cropper with a detour that doesn’t work out, nothing bad really happens. Some of the women they meet work with battered women in their communities, or are midwives, or even speak about the medieval phenomenon of bridal kidnapping which still goes on in the region, but the directors never tarry long enough to explore any of these issues in depth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/28/women-behind-the-wheel-review-well-meaning-road-trip-across-central-asia-gets-stuck">Continue reading...</a>

Their new play is about the male gaze, especially its effect on adolescent girls. Directed by Julia Head, Flies is a tender and impassioned study of the cusp between girlhood and womanhood. But it takes on too much in 70 minutes and ends up sweeping across the surface and speaking in generalisations.</p><p>Cat Fuller’s stage design is set up like a photo shoot, with seven performers captured in a camera’s gaze. It is clear these characters are marooned inside the bounds of the backdrop roll; when they stray beyond it, an explosive flash of the camera sends them scarpering back. This perilous state is made explicit with meta-theatrical references to William Golding’s Lord of the Flies.</p><p>At <a href="https://shoreditchtownhall.com/whats-on/flies-2023">Shoreditch Town Hall, London</a>, until 11 March</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/28/flies-review-shoreditch-town-hall-charlie-josephine">Continue reading...</a>

The orthodoxy, as underlined by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/25/wales-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">the Wales v England game</a> in Cardiff at the weekend, is that moving the ball in your own half is mostly a mug’s game.

<p>This Netflix comedy special is a gift for viewers bereft by the loss of Stath Lets Flats. Comedy doesn’t get more punishingly funny or magnificent than this</p><p>If, like me, you find yourself in a state of bereavement about the loss of Stath Lets Flats, the news that its creator and star, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/13/jamie-demetriou-year-in-tv-not-shutting-door-on-stath-lets-flats">Jamie Demetriou</a>, had turned his attention to an hour-long Netflix sketch comedy special – entitled A Whole Lifetime with Jamie Demetriou – might have prompted some complicated feelings.</p><p>On one hand, hooray. Demetriou has spent the last few years developing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/19/jamie-demetriou-interview-stath-lets-flats">one of the most unique voices in British comedy</a>. His characters – particularly Stath – show a flair for awkward, marble-mouthed slapstick, while hinting at a deep sense of desperation. Any comedy special he makes is likely to plough the same territory, which has to be a good thing. After all, some Jamie Demetriou is better than none.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/28/a-whole-lifetime-with-jamie-demetriou-i-laughed-harder-and-for-longer-than-i-can-remember">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Haleh, an Iranian woman who has lived in Britain since the age of 15, says 'our lives have changed forever' after the brutal murder of a young woman in Tehran last September. Mahsa Amini was arrested by the Iranian morality police for wearing her hijab 'improperly', but collapsed and died in custody a few days later. Her death sparked huge international outrage and protest. In the UK, the Iranian community continues to turn out weekly to show solidarity with the movement in Iran, spearheaded by women and teenagers, demanding fundamental rights for women and pushing for a change in Iranian leadership. We join part of the British movement, an activist group called United4Mahsa, to see how members are showing support and spreading awareness about the situation in Iran</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/feb/28/living-in-britain-fighting-for-rights-in-iran-the-lives-that-are-lost-are-not-in-vain-video">Continue reading...</a>

## Bandit review – shallow crime caper is saucer-eyed over real-life 1980s bank robber

<p>Josh Duhamel charms as ‘flying bandit’ Gilbert Galvan, who pulled off nearly 60 robberies across Canada, but this light-hearted retelling lacks any insight</p><p>Bandit is one of those true-crime films where you come away with the impression that the film-makers have spent a bit too long hanging out with their subject, sitting in smoky bars listening to tall tales about the good ol’ bad days. It’s sincere enough but tells an utterly hokey and indulgent story about armed robber <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Galvan">Gilbert Galvan</a>, who went on a stick-up spree across Canada in the 1980s, pulling off nearly 60 robberies in three years targeting banks and jewellers. Newspapers called him “the flying bandit”.</p><p>The film paints Galvan’s crimes as more or less victimless – repeatedly showing what a polite and cordial bank robber he is, never firing a gun. It’s a glossy old-fashioned movie, mixing a bit of action with tongue-in-cheek comedy. Josh Duhamel gives a performance that’s all charm and no depth as Galvan, a career criminal we first meet escaping from a Michigan prison and hightailing it north of the border. In Ottawa, he changes his name to Robert Whiteman and gets into the armed robbery business, bankrolled by a local criminal hardman (Mel Gibson, about as menacing as a fairy cake).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/28/bandit-review-shallow-caper-josh-duhamel-mel-gibson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Up for a fourth Oscar thanks to Mrs Harris Goes to Paris, Jenny Beavan talks about her bohemian childhood, her early work with Merchant Ivory and how she deals with difficult actors</p><p>If you spot a woman trying to surreptitiously take a photo of you on the bus – you’d have to look interesting – there’s a fair chance it might be Jenny Beavan. “I am the biggest people-watcher ever,” says Beavan, the British costume director who is up for her fourth Oscar next month. She took a secret photo the other day, she says, of “a fabulous woman. I don’t know whether she was from a sect or something – she was wearing white and had the most extraordinary white hat on. She was amazing; she looked like a sort of strange clown. I snuck a photo.” Elements of it might make it into a film – “I might be doing something to do with ghosts” – but it will be squirrelled away in Beavan’s mind, even if she can’t find the actual photo now to show me. She sighs and puts her phone away.</p><p>We are sitting in her office at the back of her beautiful London house, where she has lived for more than 30 years. Beavan has a straightforward, no-nonsense manner, but she’s also incredibly warm, her grey curls bouncing around her face, so the effect isn’t austere but fun and surprisingly comforting. If you were a film star, you would think nothing of telling her all your secrets while she was dressing you. Does she get good gossip? “Oh yeah,” she says, with a glint of mischief. “It’s like the confessional. Thank God I’ve got a really pants memory and can’t remember a thing, because I do hear some fairly intimate stuff. I’ve been very good, I’ve never divulged.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/costume-and-culture/2023/feb/28/i-couldnt-be-less-interested-in-fashion-the-designer-who-dressed-mad-max-and-cruella-and-changed-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

## This deal could have been done in 2021 – but the last thing Brexiteers wanted was to get Brexit done | Fintan O'Toole

<p>The leave ultras rely on their Eurosceptic grievances – no wonder Boris Johnson created the disastrous protocol in the first place</p><p>Is the grievance factory about to shut up shop at last? The Northern Ireland protocol is the last outpost of the once mighty manufacturing empire that produced, in industrial quantities, self-pitying narratives of Britons oppressed by Brussels. Now, perhaps, that assembly line has finally juddered to a halt.</p><p>The paradox of the Brexit project for its own advocates is that its very success has cut off the pipeline of complaint that fed their teeming springs of outrage. The protocol was the last excuse for throwing the old shapes, the one remaining arena in which the grand game of Euro-bashing could be played. It is not surprising that there are those – Boris Johnson, much of the European Research Group (ERG), part of the Democratic Unionist party – who can’t bear to part with it.</p><p>Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/28/deal-2021-brexiteers-get-brexit-done-eurosceptic-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Baz Luhrmann’s dreamlike, alien biopic takes profound liberties with the truths of Elvis’s life to instead capture his messianic status in American culture</p><p>It’s a bit of received wisdom that biopics, generally, may be seen as Oscar bait: a genre of films that have been militantly designed to impress Academy voters based on how closely they resemble recent history. The track record dictates that playing a real person wins you an Oscar – as was the case for seven of the last 10 best actor winners.</p><p>The same logic may not apply for Austin Butler’s turn as Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis. Only in the flimsiest, most surface-level sense is this a biopic – it takes profound, drastically misrepresentative liberties with the truths of Elvis’s life – and in name alone is Butler actually playing Presley. The film, and Butler’s performance, are far greater than that: he is playing Presley as he exists in the cultural imagination, the man who saved American culture and who could unite American politics, a kind of messianic figure who had to use his God-given power to rebuild a world in flux. In other words, he is essentially playing Superman – and Elvis, true to that, plays like Luhrmann’s concession to a superhero film, filled with two-faced enemies creeping in the shadows and shady lobbies looking to thwart our hero at every turn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/28/why-elvis-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The subjects of The Staircase, Hoop Dreams, Capturing the Friedmans and others contribute to this thoughtful film about the duty of care film-makers owe those whose stories they tell</p><p>If you’ve seen the sensational true crime documentary series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/08/the-staircase-review-true-crime-documentary-kathleen-peterson">The Staircase</a>, you’ll know the story. In 2001, after Kathleen Peterson was found dead at the bottom of the stairs at her home in North Carolina, police suspicion turned to her novelist husband Michael Peterson. When he allowed a documentary team to film what happened next, Peterson said it was because he was worried about getting a fair trial. His adopted daughter, Margaret Ratliff, 20 at the time, grief-stricken and terrified that her dad could be facing the death penalty, agreed to be part of the film. The loss of her privacy in the years since has been devastating, she admits now. “I can’t tell you how painful it is, reliving my mum’s death over and over again.”</p><p>This super-thoughtful and sensitive documentary also interviews the “stars” of other well-known documentaries. Arthur Agee was a 14-year-old basketball prodigy from a tough neighbourhood in Chicago when film-makers arrived to shoot <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/hoop-dreams-review-basketball-doc-slam-dunks-the-power-of-hope">Hoop Dreams</a>.

## We’re All Just Fine by Ana Penyas review – home truths in a tyrant’s reign

<p>Rich in detail, this award-winning debut explores the evolution of Spanish womanhood through drudgery, dictatorship and liberation</p><p>In 2018, the illustrator Ana Penyas became the first woman to win Spain’s national comic award for her debut graphic novel, <em><a href="https://anapenyas.es/estamos-todas-bien/">Estamos Todas Bien</a></em> (<em>We’re All Just Fine</em>) and now, at last, here it is in English, translated by Andrea Rosenberg. A word of warning, however. This is a book that demands – and repays – close attention. I had to read it twice before I fully noticed all that was going on some of its pages and only after studying Esther Claudio’s excellent notes on the text did some other things become clear to me. If the story it tells is universal – Penyas is interested in all the ways in which the domestic labour of women has been, and still is, undervalued – its gorgeous richness is born of specificity. It really does help to know, say, that Jabón Lagarto was a particularly harsh soap, once popular in Spain for washing clothes by hand.</p><p><em>We’re All Just Fine</em> traces the histories of Penyas’s grandmothers, moving between the present day, in which she patiently interviews them over bowls of home-cooked food, and the Francoist Spain in which they grew up, surrounded by the ever-present military police whose job it was to enforce strict social control. In some ways, the two matriarchs could not be more different. While Maruja has depressive tendencies – the result, perhaps, of an arranged marriage that left her lonely and isolated – Herminia, whose background is more unconventional, still has a subversive streak. But both remember the bad old days, when women were required to be nothing more than beautiful drudges, however fierce their spirit. As she talks to them, Penyas is painfully aware of her own privilege. It’s not only that she has the freedom to pursue her career; she still benefits from their maternal training, just as her parents did before her (when she visits, her grandmothers will not let her even so much as wash up).</p><p><em>We’re All Just Fine</em> by Ana Penyas, translated by Andrea Rosenberg, is published by Fantagraphics (£22.99).

## I get aroused by thoughts of my wife’s past liaison – and would like us to use it for role play

<p>It is only recently that she has opened up about her relationship with a colleague. How can I suggest we take this further as an erotic fantasy?</p><p><strong>My </strong><strong>wife and I have been happily married for 47 years. Right after we graduated from college, I wanted to get married and she was reluctant because she thought we were too young. That summer she had a brief relationship with a co-worker at a summer job. </strong><strong>For a long time she didn’t talk openly </strong><strong>about the extent of their physical contact, but recently, almost 50 years later, she </strong><strong>told me they “made out” but never had sex. I always </strong><strong>fantasised </strong><strong>about them having</strong><strong> a more physical relationship, including sex, </strong><strong>which arouses me.</strong><strong> I would now like to role play about her time with this other guy. What can I do to </strong><strong>persuade her to play along?</strong></p><p>If role playing is something that you as a couple have enjoyed in the past, you could simply let her know that the notion of her being sexual with her former co-worker arouses you, and suggest it as the theme of your next playtime. But not everyone is comfortable with that erotic style. Role playing involves elements such as maintaining a character in the way actors do, using your imagination to come up with words and actions that fit the scenario, and dressing the part – in an erotic context. It is important that whatever occurs between a couple is fully consensual. If your wife is not accustomed to role playing, be careful to approach it with sensitivity. Never try to coerce her into doing something she finds uncomfortable or distasteful. Role playing can be especially tricky when true personal material is involved. Some people do not feel safe replicating real-life scenarios during role play, either because they feel too exposed, or because the scenes conjure up unpleasant memories, or because they are afraid they might be exposing someone else. Some people even fear that what may be revealed could be held against them later in a non-erotic setting. It would be wise to preface any request for role playing by assuring her that you will not assume whatever she creates in the role play is accurate.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>The racist abuse aimed at the Real Madrid striker is becoming routine and there seems to be little appetite to drive change</p><p>In 1997, Roberto Carlos was racially abused while playing his first clásico for Real Madrid. Barcelona fans made monkey chants every time he touched the ball, held up racist banners and even scratched the word “monkey” on his car as a special treat for him to find later.</p><p>No charges or punishments were issued and if, after complaining publicly, Carlos was hoping for a little professional solidarity at this most harrowing of moments, he was out of luck. “This man talks a lot, he talks too much, he doesn’t know our fans and he hasn’t been here for long enough to justify these things,” Barcelona’s central midfielder retorted that day, a Spain international by the name of Pep Guardiola.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/28/vinicius-junior-real-madrid-racism-fans-la-liga">Continue reading...</a>

## Bad City review – retro homage to 80s Japanese thrillers is elegantly pulpy

<p>A taskforce of honest cops is assembled to tackle the gangsters menacing Kaiko City. Many punches are thrown in choreographed style</p><p>Director Kensuke Sonomura started off as a stunt performer and coordinator, so it’s no surprise that his second directorial effort contains lashings of hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, just as the climactic cops v gangsters showdown is about to kick off, elderly lawman Torada (Hitoshi Ozawa) urges everyone not to use silly, unsporting guns, and miraculously both sides agree and go to it with fists and knives. It’s just as well because, hitherto, almost every time someone has fired a gun in anger in this film they have missed the target. Does that mean all those movies where folks hit their target with one bullet are lying? Or is this one, where everyone is pants at shooting, the misrepresentation? Either way, it’s almost enough to make you question your core beliefs in the efficacy of cinematic firearms.</p><p>Anyway, if you like watching actors and stunt folk battle it out, this is great stuff but the connecting plot strung between fights is more of a chore. In fictional Japanese metropolis Kaiko City, corruption is rife and it all seems to stem from Wataru Gojo (Lily Franky) who has designs on redeveloping a poor part of the city. As Gojo is announcing his bid to become Kaiko’s mayor, we see a bathhouse of lushly tattooed yakuza get wiped out by a single long-haired squinting assassin (Tak Sakaguchi). Is he working for Madam (Rino Katase), queenpin of the Korean mafia in Kaiko, who rather entertainingly dresses like someone trying to shoplift all the stock from a Versace boutique at the same time. The chief prosecutor and his assistant put together a taskforce of honest cops from the Violent Crimes unit, and place Torada in charge, even though up until now he’s been in jail on charges that connect him to Madam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/28/bad-city-review-crime-and-choreographic-violence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What do you say to someone whose wife prefers photographs of deceased authors to him?</p><p>Henry and Ida Frankel live in a cosy three-bedroom apartment in New York’s Washington Heights. Henry, a softly spoken retired architect of 85, is a short, handsome man with a bald head and small ears. Ida is even shorter, with fine white hair coiled in a bun. Although she is usually smartly turned out, smelling of powder and lavender, only Henry knows how much effort this entails. Whenever he tries to cut her nails, give her a bath or change her clothes, Ida’s small face contorts into something unrecognisable; she becomes like a fierce, cornered animal.</p><p>Henry’s and Ida’s families moved to New York from Austria in 1935, when both were 10 years old. They met at the City College of New York, and in 1948, two years to the day after graduation, they married. Allowing for the usual ups and downs, their marriage was a good one. They liked the same novels and films and shared a love of chamber music. Their apartment is lined with books and a large collection of Deutsche Grammophon LPs. There isn’t a CD in the house because, as Henry explained, they couldn’t bear to betray their beloved vinyl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/28/dinner-with-proust-how-alzheimers-caregivers-are-pulled-into-their-patients-worlds">Continue reading...</a>
