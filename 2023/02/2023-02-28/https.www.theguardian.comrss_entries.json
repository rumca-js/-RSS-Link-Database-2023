But long-term phenomena become acceptable merely because of our capacity to adjust. Violence against women (the leading form of violence worldwide) and slower forms of environmental destruction have been going on so long that they\u2019re easy to overlook and hard to get people to regard as a crisis. We saw this with Covid-19, where in the first months most people were fearful and eager to do what it took to avoid contracting or spreading the disease, and then grew increasingly casual about the risks and apparently oblivious to the impacts (the WHO <a href=\"https://covid19.who.int/\">charts</a> almost 7 million deaths in little over three years).</p><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Over the years I\u2019ve selflessly and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/16/hip-cleavage-new-summer-trend-ridiculous-cleavage-history\">diligently kept abreast</a> of ridiculous cleavage trends. Which is harder than it sounds, let me tell you, because there has been no end of them. The year 2000, for example, saw the advent of \u201ctoe cleavage\u201d. According to Manolo Blahnik, something of an expert on foot-related matters, \u201cyou must only show the first two cracks\u201d. A decade later, everything was different: 2012 was the year of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/11/underboob-bum-slip-new-female-body-parts\">sideboob</a>. Then <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2295205/Is-bum-slip-new-boob-Kate-Moss-Miley-Cyrus-Rihanna-fans-cheeky-flash.html\">the Daily Mail</a>, which knows a thing or two about cleavage, predicted the \u201cside boob\u2019s days could be numbered\u201d and it was the \u201cbum slip\u2019s\u201d time to shine. Along this journey we\u2019ve seen various fashionistas declare the advent of male cleavage, side cleavage, no cleavage and hip cleavage.</p><p>I know all this is a lot to take in, but bear with me here because there has been an important new development in the cleavage wars. According to the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/02/22/model-gabrielle-epstein-reveals-bikini-trend-circumboob/\">New York Post</a>, 2023 is the year of the \u201ccircumboob\u201d. This is when you wear something that manages to show pretty much everything but the nipple. The year\u2019s general aura of chaos has spilled over to fashion trends and now \u201csideboob, innerboob <em>and</em> underboob\u201d have converged into one circum-trend. I know that the New York Post is not always to be trusted, but I have it on good authority that this new trend can be spotted out in the wild. I\u2019ll put money on it: the circumboob is legit.

A word of warning, however. This is a book that demands \u2013 and repays \u2013 close attention. I had to read it twice before I fully noticed all that was going on some of its pages and only after studying Esther Claudio\u2019s excellent notes on the text did some other things become clear to me. If the story it tells is universal \u2013 Penyas is interested in all the ways in which the domestic labour of women has been, and still is, undervalued \u2013 its gorgeous richness is born of specificity. It really does help to know, say, that Jab\u00f3n Lagarto was a particularly harsh soap, once popular in Spain for washing clothes by hand.</p><p><em>We\u2019re All Just Fine</em> traces the histories of Penyas\u2019s grandmothers, moving between the present day, in which she patiently interviews them over bowls of home-cooked food, and the Francoist Spain in which they grew up, surrounded by the ever-present military police whose job it was to enforce strict social control. In some ways, the two matriarchs could not be more different. While Maruja has depressive tendencies \u2013 the result, perhaps, of an arranged marriage that left her lonely and isolated \u2013 Herminia, whose background is more unconventional, still has a subversive streak. But both remember the bad old days, when women were required to be nothing more than beautiful drudges, however fierce their spirit. As she talks to them, Penyas is painfully aware of her own privilege. It\u2019s not only that she has the freedom to pursue her career; she still benefits from their maternal training, just as her parents did before her (when she visits, her grandmothers will not let her even so much as wash up).</p><p><em>We\u2019re All Just Fine</em> by Ana Penyas, translated by Andrea Rosenberg, is published by Fantagraphics (\u00a322.99).

How can I suggest we take this further as an erotic fantasy?</p><p><strong>My </strong><strong>wife and I have been happily married for 47 years. Right after we graduated from college, I wanted to get married and she was reluctant because she thought we were too young. That summer she had a brief relationship with a co-worker at a summer job. </strong><strong>For a long time she didn\u2019t talk openly </strong><strong>about the extent of their physical contact, but recently, almost 50 years later, she </strong><strong>told me they \u201cmade out\u201d but never had sex. I always </strong><strong>fantasised </strong><strong>about them having</strong><strong> a more physical relationship, including sex, </strong><strong>which arouses me.</strong><strong> I would now like to role play about her time with this other guy. What can I do to </strong><strong>persuade her to play along?</strong></p><p>If role playing is something that you as a couple have enjoyed in the past, you could simply let her know that the notion of her being sexual with her former co-worker arouses you, and suggest it as the theme of your next playtime. But not everyone is comfortable with that erotic style. Role playing involves elements such as maintaining a character in the way actors do, using your imagination to come up with words and actions that fit the scenario, and dressing the part \u2013 in an erotic context. It is important that whatever occurs between a couple is fully consensual. If your wife is not accustomed to role playing, be careful to approach it with sensitivity. Never try to coerce her into doing something she finds uncomfortable or distasteful. Role playing can be especially tricky when true personal material is involved. Some people do not feel safe replicating real-life scenarios during role play, either because they feel too exposed, or because the scenes conjure up unpleasant memories, or because they are afraid they might be exposing someone else. Some people even fear that what may be revealed could be held against them later in a non-erotic setting. It would be wise to preface any request for role playing by assuring her that you will not assume whatever she creates in the role play is accurate.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don\u2019t send attachments).
