But nothing is more devastating than losing family photos, important work reports, school essays, and more. The good thing is that data loss is 100% avoidable and it's always human error.

From Blu-ray, to LTO, to cloud storage, and more... there are a lot of very affordable (and very expensive) ways to backup and archive your data shown in this episode and by the end of it, you'll have a good idea of what you need to do to save your own stuff!\n\nFollow me on Twitter - http://twitter.com/snazzyq\nFollow me on Instagram - http://instagram.com/snazzyq", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB4kwfY2w7A", "date_published": "2023-02-28 16:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
