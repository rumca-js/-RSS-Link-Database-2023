With the launch of PlayStation VR 2, Destiny 2's Lightfall expansion, and Atomic Heart in the rearview mirror, March 2023 is loaded with the return of iconic survival-horror, 18 holes of golfing bliss, and superstars dropping elbows from the top rope.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kicking off March is a brand-new souls-like from the team behind Nioh, as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty mixes Team Ninja's talent for brutal hack-and-slash action with Chinese history and a dark fantasy world to explore. If you'd prefer a different kind of souls-like experience that also mixes in some retro gaming influences, then the Castlevania pack for Dead Cells will take you right back to Dracula's castle for a throwdown with the lord of vampires.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">PC gamers can add another PlayStation title to their collection with The Last of Us Part 1, and if you're after a more personal type of drama that can only be solved inside with hurricanranas off the top rope, then lace up your boots and get ready to headline Wrestlemania in WWE 2K23. Bt off course, the <em>real </em>big game of March is the return of an icon, a global force of nature known as Peppa Pig, who sets off on a globetrotting adventure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If Peppa's trip around the world is too much for you to handle, you can dive into the dark atmosphere of Resident Evil 4 Remake instead. After Dead Space Remake raised the bar for what a reborn game should be capable of and aim for, it'll be fascinating to see how Resident Evil 4 Remake improves on the original and how it measures up to EA's masterpiece.

When even the authorities can't stop him, they come in with a cow tranquilizer and gas everyone inside. Eden is the only survivor of the slaughter, having wandered into the corn, where she spent nearly a week before the authorities found her. She's then \"adopted\" by the town pastor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sometime later, the surviving adults meet to discuss an offer from \"big corn\" to grow GMO corn, loaded with pesticides and other chemicals that ruin their crops. From there, the town has no choice but to take part in a subsidy to <em>not</em> grow corn.

The Steam version of one of the campiest entries in the beloved series recently received <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/21690/view/3660900859086284016?l=english\">a small patch</a> that removes support for the long-dead Games for Windows Live. The good news is that this also restores the default split-screen feature to the game, which was disabled on PC due to GFWL.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you aren't familiar, Games for Windows Live was a key part of a Microsoft initiative to connect PC games to its servers. The service launched in 2007, never saw much uptake, and was retired in 2014. These days, it's better-known for causing glitches and compatibility issues in games from that era--the original Dark Souls being perhaps the most notable example--requiring developers to issue patches for old games in order to resolve that. It apparently took Capcom 14 years to get around to it, but if you're playing a game with GFWL issues, it's usually best to check the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_5\">PCGamingWiki</a> to see if fans have developed workarounds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Resident Evil 5 was the first game in the series to truly focus on co-op play, allowing two players to experience the entire game together from beginning to end. It is generally regarded as significantly worse than the game that proceeded it, the landmark <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-trailer-teases-special-demo-coming-soon/1100-6511786/\">Resident Evil 4</a>, which will soon receive a full remake. RE5 arguably marked the beginning of a dark era for the series, which bottomed out with the almost universally reviled RE6. RE5 is also notable for the controversy surrounding its depiction of African people, which was widely condemned as racist <a href=\"http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/11312.58174.pdf\">at release</a>. Its wildly campy final sequence, in which player character Chris famously punches a boulder, is also considered memorable by fans.</p>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/14-years-in-resident-evil-5-removes-games-for-windows-live-fixes-split-screen/1100-6511907/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-28 17:12:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Next-Gen Nintendo Console Coming Late 2024, Report Says", "description": "<p>A new report has shed more light on the video game industry landscape as it relates to the overall size and health of the market, and in particular, it claims the PlayStation 5 is expected to increase its lead over the Xbox Series X|S in the time to come.

That game wasn't always the success it has grown into being, though, and Yoshida said the team learned hard lessons from its failed launch, and it's tried to apply those to its latest project as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Because the project had failed and we had failed our audience, we lost the trust of that audience,\" Yoshida told GameSpot, via translator. \"We lost the trust of the media, and the first thing we had to do was regain that trust before we could rebuild the game. We learned that the best way to rebuild that trust is by being honest and straightforward with what we can do, what we can't do, why we can't do it, why we can do it. It's all about that communication, being open and being honest and showing the player and the fanbase and the media that we can be trusted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Learning how important that was in Final Fantasy XIV, we're able to bring that over into Final Fantasy XVI. We're trying to be honest with what we're creating with Final Fantasy XVI, for example, right out of the gate. We could've just said, yeah, this game is great, it's everything you imagined, and try to promote it that way. But we came out and said, 'Okay, we're not an open world.' That's one of the first things we said, knowing that a lot of players would be like, 'What? It's not an open world?' But by explaining why we're not an open world, why we made these decisions and what they bring to the game, hopefully that shows the player that we're being honest with them and so that they can go into the experience knowing what we are aiming for.

It was only a matter of time before that focus on action took precedence over the role-playing elements, and it appears that Final Fantasy XVI is finally the moment the ratio has flipped. As a longtime fan of the traditional Final Fantasy games, I wasn't quite sure what to think of this development. The turn-based classics are still some of my favorite gaming experiences of all time. But after an extensive hands-on with the game, I've come around on this direction for the series, or at least this entry in it. If Final Fantasy is an action franchise now, at least it's shaping up to be a damn good one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This isn't to say that the game lacks fantastical elements like mythical beasts and magic spells, but those are used to complement the story and action, rather than as a layer of menu abstraction. In the fictional, high-fantasy world of Valisthea, an extremely small number of mortals are innately gifted as Dominants--hosts for supernatural Eikons, which longtime Final Fantasy fans will recognize as summoned creatures like Ifrit and Ramuh. Eikons are essentially weapons of mass destruction, and the various nation-states use their Eikons as symbols of their power and culture. The Dominants are respected, feared, and sometimes even exploited by their respective nations as the implied threat of the Eikons keeps other nations in check. The protagonist Clive's brother, Joshua, was given a place of honor as the Dominant of Phoenix, the aspect of fire. Clive's journey is one of revenge, as an attack from an invading army and a mysterious, previously unseen Eikon left his younger brother dead.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">My play session took place when Clive was in his 20s, obsessed with vengeance, and throwing his lot in with revolutionaries who are looking to overthrow the social order. This segment of the story tightly focused on just three major characters, which helped illustrate how the political and magical machinations play out amid interpersonal relationships. Clive was accompanying Cidolfus Telamon--this game's Cid, another Final Fantasy mainstay--who is both a freedom fighter for magical refugees and the Dominant of Ramuh, the aspect of lightning. Their mission brought them to a castle guarded by Benedikta Harman, the Dominant of Garuda, aspect of wind--and apparently, Cid's old flame. Clive was also accompanied by his loyal and very-good-boy dog Torgul, who acts as a constant companion character in battle.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-goes-full-on-action-game-spectacle-and-it-rules/1100-6511844/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-goes-full-on-action-game-spectacle-and-it-rules/1100-6511844/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-28 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Final Fantasy XVI Is A Lot Like God Of War, And Its Director Knows It", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Final Fantasy XVI is barely recognizable as a Final Fantasy game. After years of merely flirting with a more action-oriented approach, this one fully embraces a new role as a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-goes-full-on-action-game-spectacle-and-it-rules/1100-6511844/\">big-budget action game spectacle</a>. The high-fantasy setting of warring kingdoms is accentuated by larger-than-life superpowered beings: Dominants, human hosts for otherworldly summoned creatures. This new take on Final Fantasy is kinetic and hard-hitting, and very little like anything we've seen in the series before.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, in practice it often feels less like a Final Fantasy game, and more like a God of War. The hard-hitting melee action combat is punctuated by huge action set-pieces thanks to the larger-than-life clashes between hulking Eikons. These creatures, recognizable to Final Fantasy fans as classic summons like Ifrit, Ramuh, and Garuda, are essentially weapons of mass destruction kept by the disparate kingdoms as their individual shows of power. In practice, their presence means huge-scale Eikon battles that are individually tailored to be unique experiences.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The similarity to God of War and its over-the-top action isn't a coincidence, as the game director of FFXVI is a long-time fan of the series from its very first game in 2005. He acknowledges it was an influence on his work, and the mission structure of Final Fantasy XVI follows very closely to the more recent God of War games, thanks to a hub that leads to your main quest objectives and sidequests.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-is-a-lot-like-god-of-war-and-its-director-knows-it/1100-6511847/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-is-a-lot-like-god-of-war-and-its-director-knows-it/1100-6511847/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-28 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Final Fantasy XVI Producer's \"Pride As A Gamer\" Influenced New Take On Difficulty Settings", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Final Fantasy XVI is going in a more action-oriented approach than any previous game in the series. To help players who aren't as accustomed to that style of game, it's introducing a new variable difficulty system that is dictated not by selecting options in a menu, but by equipping specific pieces of equipment. Producer Naoki Yoshida said that the spark of the idea came from his own sense of pride as a gamer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"I'm going to be 50 years old this year,\" Yoshida told GameSpot, via translator. \"That said, I consider myself a gamer and I have my gamer pride. When playing a game, you always get that part at the beginning where it says, 'Select your difficulty: easy, medium, hard.' And again, I have my pride as a gamer, so I'm never going to choose easy. I'm always going to choose medium or hard. But then when you die that first time it says, 'Do you want to change the difficulty to easy?' I hate that. I have my pride as a gamer and I hate that.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoshida explained that he wanted to make a system that didn't put players into a position in which they feel like they're being insulted, so he turned to game director Hiroshi Takai and combat director Ryota Suzuki for a solution. The result was a set of five special accessories--two of which are equipped by default if you choose Story Mode, but all of which are available to equip even if you don't--that each target a specific type of challenge that players might struggle with. One ring automatically uses your potions, for example, while another lets you hit complex combos with just one button. This allows players to change up the accessories at will to make up for any deficits.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-producers-pride-as-a-gamer-influenced-new-take-on-difficulty-settings/1100-6511849/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-producers-pride-as-a-gamer-influenced-new-take-on-difficulty-settings/1100-6511849/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-28 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "How Final Fantasy XVI Blends High Fantasy With Sci-Fi", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Final Fantasy XVI takes place in a high-fantasy setting, having drawn comparison to big-budget series like Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings.

There is actually a little bit of that in the game. It's just that we haven't introduced it yet in our promotion.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yoshida explained that one story element in Final Fantasy XVI involves an advanced, sky-faring civilization that existed 1,500 years before the game takes place. Some kind of calamity that people simply call \"The Fall\" happened to that civilization that caused it to collapse, both figuratively and literally, and all of its advanced technology came crashing to the ground. The remnants of that ancient society are scattered across the world, and the protagonist, Clive, will find pieces of it and learn more about their history and what happened to them.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-final-fantasy-xvi-blends-high-fantasy-with-sci-fi/1100-6511850/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-final-fantasy-xvi-blends-high-fantasy-with-sci-fi/1100-6511850/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-02-28 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Forspoken Dev Luminous Productions Is Getting Merged Into Square Enix", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Square Enix <a href=\"https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2023/html/20230228_announcement_EN.html\">is absorbing Forspoken dev Luminous Productions</a> into the larger organization, effective May 1.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Luminous Productions released a statement addressing the merger, promising it'll remain \"entirely focused\" on Forspoken from now until May 1.
