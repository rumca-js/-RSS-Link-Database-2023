## Demeo Review

Demeo reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PlayStation VR2, PlayStation 5, Meta Quest 2, and PC.

Demeo is a delightful alternative to the mechanically engrossing (albeit burdensome) tabletop RPGs and board games to which it lovingly pays homage. It might not offer the same width or depth as a true RPG, and it may not satisfy a pen-and-paper purist’s love of creating and growing with their own heroes, but it’s such an enjoyably compact yet intelligently riveting experience that, if you can get past its occasional bugs, Demeo is a great introductory game for anyone who’s interested in seeing what D&amp;D or VR is about.

Scars Above reviewed on PlayStation 5 by Axel Bosso. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

"Scars Above shows a lot of potential in its third-person shooting, fun elemental reactions, and a good number of creatures to experiment with. The thrill of setting out to discover a new alien world is short-lived, however, due to the weapons and gadgets in your arsenal quickly growing so powerful that nothing poses a threat. And while there are a few excellent environments to explore, everything within them – the characters, story, and universe – feel weak and underdeveloped, giving you few reasons to stop and smell the alien roses once you’ve blasted your way through."

The voice of #TLoU Joel is finally coming to HBO’s The Last of Us live-action series. The legendary voice actor, Troy Baker, is set to make his live-action debut in the hit series, as revealed in #TheLastofUs #HBO teaser for episode 8. Troy is a master impressionist, so it’ll be interesting to see his take on James - will it be a pitch perfect recreation or will he showcase his acting chops to reinterpret the character in his own way? As for Ashley Johnson, who voices Ellie in the video games, we’ve yet to see her make an appearance. But as Neil Druckmann teased roughly a year ago, she and Troy will both be taking on “surprising” roles in the live-action series. From one Pedro Pascal series to another, the Mandalorian might not be as buttoned up as The Last of Us, with co-creator Jon Favreau stating he doesn’t know how the show’s gonna end. And finally, Pokemon is one franchise that’ll never stop, unless it’s in motion. And with the latest partnership with Netflix, stop-motion is the game in Pokemon Concierge: the new series coming to Netflix thanks to its collaboration with The Pokemon Company.

Resident Evil Village VR reviewed on PlayStation VR2 by Taylor Lyles.

Resident Evil Village VR is far more than just a gimmicky afterthought, adding enough improvements and tweaks to justify fans of both the series and virtual reality reliving Ethan’s not-so-great European vacation one more time. While the controls be a little cumbersome as you take the time needed to master them, and the VR perspective can cause a few awkward viewing angles, this is still a very enjoyable return to an already great game.
