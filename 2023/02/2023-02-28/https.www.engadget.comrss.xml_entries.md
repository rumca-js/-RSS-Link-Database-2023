<p>Twitter is once again tightening its rules around what users are permitted to say on the platform. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1630660503402848257"><ins>introduced</ins></a> an updated “violent speech” policy, which contains some notable additions compared with previous versions of the rules.</p><p>Interestingly, the new policy prohibits users from expressing “wishes of harm” and similar sentiments. “This includes (but is not limited to) hoping for others to die, suffer illnesses, tragic incidents, or experience other physically harmful consequences,” the rules <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech"><ins>state</ins></a>. That’s a reversal from Twitter’s previous policy, which explicitly said that “statements that express a wish or hope that someone experiences physical harm&quot; <em>were not</em> against the company’s rules.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Statements that express a wish or hope that someone experiences physical harm, making vague or indirect threats, or threatening actions that are unlikely to cause serious or lasting injury are not actionable under this policy,” Twitter’s previous policy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221219033731/https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-threats-glorification"><ins>stated</ins></a>, according to the Wayback Machine.</p><p>That change isn't the only addition to the policy. Twitter’s rules now also explicitly protects “infrastructure that is essential to daily, civic, or business activities” from threats of damage. From the rules:</p><blockquote><p>You may not threaten to inflict physical harm on others, which includes (but is not limited to) threatening to kill, torture, sexually assault, or otherwise hurt someone. This also includes threatening to damage civilian homes and shelters, or infrastructure that is essential to daily, civic, <strong>or business activities</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>These may not seem like particularly eyebrow-raising changes, but they are notable given Elon Musk’s previous statements about how speech should be handled on Twitter. Prior to taking over the company, the Tesla CEO stated that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html"><ins>his preference</ins></a> would be to allow all speech that is legal. “I think we would want to err on the side of, if in doubt, let the speech exist,” he said at the time.</p><p>It’s also not the first time Twitter’s rules have become more restrictive since Musk’s takeover. The company’s rules around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-rules-about-location-sharing-amid-elonjet-controversy-005013326.html"><ins>doxxing</ins></a> changed following his dustup with the (now suspended) @elonjet account, which shared the whereabouts of Musk’s private jet.</p><p>Twitter didn’t explain its rationale for the changes, but noted in a series of tweets that it may suspend accounts breaking the rules or force them to delete the tweets in question. The company no longer has a communications team to respond to requests for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-updates-violent-speech-policy-to-ban-wishes-of-harm-214320985.html?src=rss

## The White House’s $39 billion chip-making giveaway starts today

<p>When President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-signs-chips-and-science-act-145820799.html">signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law in 2022</a>, it put $52 billion in tax credits and funding on the table to help bolster the semiconductor industry in the US, with $39 billion specifically earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing incentives. Now, we're starting to see how that initiative is going to play out: The Biden Administration has officially launched the first <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/biden-harris-administration-launches-first-chips-america-funding">CHIPS for America funding opportunity</a>, laying out the application process for &quot;projects to construct, expand or modernize commercial facilities for the production of leading-edge, current-generation and mature-node semiconductors.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;first&quot; in first funding opportunity is the key word here: At the start, CHIPS for America is specifically looking to fund projects that align with the program's &quot;vision for success&quot; that seeks to have a number of leading-edge logic fabrication facilities and DRAM chip manufacturers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chips-and-science-act-funding-plan-biden-administration-semiconductors-chips-144633914.html">by the end of the decade</a>, as well as hitting specific production capacity goals for &quot;current-generation and mature-node&quot; semiconductors. The program plans to offer more funding opportunities for R&amp;D and manufacturing equipment facilities at a later date. Applications for those programs won't launch until late Spring and Fall of 2023, but the CHIPS Program Office is open to receiving statements of interest from hopeful applicants.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The program also includes strict guardrails for how funding is used. Applicants who are awarded CHIPS funding will be prohibited from using the payments for stock buybacks or to pay out dividends, and payments will be tied to meeting specific milestones. It'll be awhile before the first recipients of CHIPS funding are announced, but hopeful projects can begin submitting applications on March 31, 2023. Want all the details?

## Google’s Pixel Watch gets Fall Detection starting today

<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/fall-detection-on-pixel-watch/">announced</a> that it’s rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html">Pixel Watch</a> fall detection starting today. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-12-apple-watch-4-falls-heart-problems.html">Apple Watch feature</a> of the same name launched in 2018, Google’s version also uses motion sensors and algorithms to determine if you’ve fallen and need help. However, Google says it won’t accidentally call emergency services for winter sports accidents, as the Apple Watch’s crash detection has done.</p><p>If the Pixel Watch detects a possible fall and a lack of movement for about 30 seconds, it will vibrate, emit an alarm and display an onscreen message checking on you. If it wasn’t a bad fall, tap the “I’m OK” button to dismiss the alert; tap “I fell &amp; need help” if you want it to call 911. Otherwise, the sound will continue for about a minute and grow louder in its final seconds. If you still haven’t responded to the alert by then, it will contact emergency services automatically, playing them an automated message requesting help at your location. (You’ll also have the option of speaking to the 911 operator from the watch.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can activate the feature on the “Updates” page in the Watch Companion app on your paired phone or in the Pixel Watch’s Personal Safety app.</p><p>Google says its fall detection should avoid false positives. “Worried that doing burpees or hitting the ski slopes will trigger an accidental emergency call?” Google wrote in its announcement post. “Your Pixel Watch knows the difference between taking a hard fall and performing a vigorous physical activity or even quickly recovering from a small stumble — thanks to our machine learning algorithms and rigorous testing. The motion sensors and algorithms can monitor for a sudden impact and your body’s responses and instinctive reactions to falling. We trained this process using a broad variety of human and simulated fall data and other motion patterns to accurately detect real falls and minimize potential false alarms.”</p><p>Google adds that you can supply data to help it improve the feature by toggling the “Help improve fall detection” option. This will send the company motion-sensor data of any events detected as falls.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-watch-gets-fall-detection-starting-today-204521485.html?src=rss

## ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ will arrive in theaters two days early

<p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> is <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/super-mario-bros-movie-release-date-spring-1235274239/">bumping up</a> its release date. The animated adventure will now open on April 5th in over 60 markets (it was previously slated for April 7th). Giving the movie a five-day opening over Easter weekend is an old Hollywood trick that could help pad its initial earnings and lead to marketing-friendly headlines touting its early success.</p><p>The film stars the voices of Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Chris Day as Luigi, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong and Jack Black as Bowser. It was initially scheduled to release in December, but Illumination and Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-delayed-april-2023-045613598.html">announced</a> early last year they were pushing it back to this April. Throughout April and May, the movie will release in ten additional Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European markets; Japan’s release is timed to coincide with the Golden Week Holidays on April 28th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The movie will mark Mario’s first big-screen starring role since 1993's ill-fated <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, starring Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi, which bombed at the box office but became something of a “so bad it’s good” cult classic in later years. Before that, children of the late 80s and early 90s enjoyed <em>The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!</em>, a live-action / animated series starring Captain Lou Albano and Danny Wells.</p><div id="b859b798c05f4329adec2a458f3d116c"></div><p>The upcoming Mario film could be a barometer for audiences’ appetites for video game movies. Hollywood adaptations of gaming IPs have a long track record of (rightfully) bombing with box offices and critics. Still, HBO’s excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-season-one-hbo-review-080135969.html"><em>The Last of Us series</em></a> has been a notable exception that Nintendo and Illumination would love to continue on the big screen.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-arrive-in-theaters-two-days-early-194505444.html?src=rss

<p>Nishad Singh, a co-founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ftx/"><ins>FTX</ins></a>, has pleaded guilty to US federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Singh, who was FTX's director of engineering, is the third member of Sam Bankman-Fried's inner circle to agree to cooperate with prosecutors in the case against him. Former executives Caroline Ellison and Zixiao "Gary" Wang previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/two-top-fbx-executives-plead-guilty-to-fraud-and-are-cooperating-with-prosecutors-101009292.html">pleaded guilty</a> to fraud charges.</p><p>Singh pleaded guilty to six criminal counts, including wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the US by violating campaign finance laws.

He claimed the donations were intended to bolster the political influence of FTX and Bankman-Fried (aka SBF), according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZnR4LWNvLWZvdW5kZXItbmlzaGFkLXNpbmdoLXBsZWFkcy1ndWlsdHktdG8tZnJhdWQtY2hhcmdlcy1kOTkzNmM4NyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmZhOTcxYjEtNTk4YS00YmY2LWIxYjQtOWY5YjUxNmU2MDE0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYUzUswMOnGenupkaxGsPi-1ILTTjxkIVbzibnl-hcgN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Famp%2Farticles%2Fftx-co-founder-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-charges-d9936c87"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>.

## Tesla selects Monterrey, Mexico as the site of its next Gigafactory

<p>Tesla's Investor Day isn't here quite yet, but we may already know one of the company's biggest announcements. According to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Elon Musk has promised to build the automaker's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tesla-mexico-musk-lopez-obrador-07e5223eecd63b7af8330879ff1312b3">next gigafactory in northern Mexico</a> — specifically in Monterrey, the capitol of the northern state of Nuevo Leon. It's a deal that's been in the works for some time: Late last year, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musk-eyes-potential-investment-mexicos-nuevo-leon-state-sources-2022-10-24/">Musk visited Nuevo Leon</a> to meet with the Governor of the region.</p><p>Even so, there were some questions about if Tesla could get approval to build in the area — after Monterrey suffered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/dams-taps-running-dry-northern-mexico-amid-historic-water-shortages-2022-06-20">severe water shortages</a> in 2022, President López Obrador said the government would not grant permits for water-hungry factories. After a series of phone calls with Elon Musk, Tesla was granted an exception. “There is one commitment that all the water used in the manufacture of electric automobiles will be recycled water,” López Obrador said of the call, adding that the factory would also represent &quot;a considerable investment and many, many jobs.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for what Tesla plans to build in Monterrey, Mexico? We'll have to wait a day to find out. The Mexican President wasn't clear on exactly what the new factory would be producing, though it's worth noting that Tesla has already announced a massive expansion of its facility in Reno, Nevada, where it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-3-6-billion-expansion-nevada-gigafactory-055246273.html">investing $3.6 billion to build a battery factory and mass produce the Telsa Semi truck</a>. López Obrador noted that we can expect to hear more details on Wednesday, March 1st — and hey, <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-date-2023-investor-day">that's Tesla Investor day</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-selects-monterrey-mexico-as-the-site-of-its-next-gigafactory-192534657.html?src=rss

## LG's 2023 OLED TVs arrive in late March starting at $1,299

<p>LG has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-begins-us-rollout-of-2023-oled-tv-lineup-301757787.html">detailed</a> pricing of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html">2023 OLED TVs</a> just as they're about to ship. The flagship G3 and mainstream C3 (pictured) models are now set to arrive in late March, with pre-orders available on March 6th. The C3 starts at $1,299 for a relatively compact 42-inch set, and scales up to $5,299 for the giant 83-inch version. The G3 begins at $2,499 for a 55-inch panel and climbs to $6,499 for the 83-inch edition.</p><p>The entry B3 series won't be ready until April. It starts at $1,699 for a 55-inch TV and tops out at $3,299 for a 77-inch set. LG is promising pricing for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-signature-m3-oled-tv-zero-connect-160030192.html">wireless M3</a> and transparent OLED T &quot;at a later date.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As we mentioned in January, the G3 receives the most upgrades this year. It delivers up to a 70 percent brighter picture through a booster feature, and its new zero-gap design helps with wall mounting. It also boasts a a9 Gen 6 processor with improved image rendering and audio processing, including support for harmonizing the built-in speakers' output with recent LG soundbars.</p><p>The C3 shares the benefits of the a9 Gen 6 chip, but it's otherwise a modest upgrade over last year's C2. However, it may represent a better value than the B3, particularly at the middle &quot;sweet spot&quot; sizes. The $2,499 65-inch C3 costs just $100 more than a B3 equivalent with a worse processor (the a7 Gen 6) — you might as well spend the slight premium for a set that will last longer.</p><p>Whether or not LG's roster fares well against the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-77-inch-s95-qd-oled-tv-goes-on-sale-for-4500-094444385.html">Samsung S95C</a> isn't clear. Samsung's set is slightly brighter than LG's latest and offers a gaming-friendly 144Hz refresh rate. Only the 77-inch S95C is available at the moment, though, and LG has both Dolby Vision HDR support (Samsung is still sticking to HDR10+) as well as a wider variety of sizes and performance tiers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lgs-2023-oled-tvs-arrive-in-late-march-starting-at-1299-175513466.html?src=rss

## A first look at Tecno's Phantom V Fold, a surprisingly affordable foldable phone

<p>Tecno, a relatively unknown mobile brand on our side of the world, surprised us with a pop-out portrait lens on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-x2-pro-retractable-portrait-lens-113011384.html">Phantom X2 Pro</a> flagship phone back in December. For its MWC event today, the Chinese company brought us the Phantom V Fold, which happens to be the first horizontally-folding phone to be powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9000+ processor (hello, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-hands-on-fixing-the-foldables-shortcomings-150021728.html">Oppo Find N2 Flip</a>!), rather than something from Qualcomm. This usually means a lower entry barrier, which is always a good thing.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-vs-europe-price-availability-133824755.html">Honor's Magic VS</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-2-leica-pricing-availability-124434422.html">Xiaomi's Mix Fold 2</a>, the Phantom V Fold has opted for a body that's wider than Samsung's counterparts — just not as wide as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-foldable-phone-pricing-availability-101858317.html">Oppo's</a>. Tecno's &quot;virtually crease-free&quot; foldable screen comes in at 7.85 inches with a 2,296 x 2,000 resolution, and on the other side, you're greeted by a 6.42-inch 2,550 x 1,080 sub-screen. Both AMOLED panels feature a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. As far as durability goes, the claim here is that &quot;the device is capable of 200,000 folds,&quot; which matches that of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, though that's just half of what the Chinese competition has achieved lately.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Tecno Phantom V Fold" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/2e371dc0-b789-11ed-bfd3-b62ce17e9f98" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Phantom V Fold comes with a complete set of cameras, too. On the rear side, there's a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel telephoto camera (2x optical zoom) and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera. These are surrounded by an eco-friendly back cover — in black or white — composed of recycled plastics. Then you get two punch-hole selfie cameras: a 16-megapixel one on the foldable screen, and a 32-megapixel version on the outer screen. The latter is fine for video calls on that smaller screen, but you'd probably want to unfold the phone and use the main camera instead for better selfies.</p><p>Tecno didn't cheap out on the battery here, either. The Phantom V Fold packs a 5,000mAh battery with 45W fast charge. This reaches 40-percent charge in 15 minutes, or 100-percent charge in 55 minutes. That's a tad slower than the Chinese competition, but it still beats the Galaxy Z Fold 4 — assuming you don't mind missing out on wireless charging.</p><figure><img alt="Tecno Phantom V Fold" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/47476fe0-b789-11ed-b78d-6e010897e3bc" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the software side, the Phantom V Fold runs on Tecno's HiOS 13 Fold based on Android 13. The company claimed that it's customized the folding experience on its device for the top 1,000 most downloaded apps globally, and 90 percent of which have also been optimized for split-screen and multi-window modes.</p><p>So how much more affordable is the Phantom V Fold? Well, not bad. The base model with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage costs $1,099, whereas the 512GB variant is asking for $1,222. These are very competitive when compared to Samsung and even Honor outside of China, though prices will vary across countries — namely India, in this case, followed by various African and Latin American countries where Tecno is usually active in.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-v-fold-pricing-availability-mwc-2023-174526995.html?src=rss

## Samsung Galaxy S23+ review: A solid phone that’s probably not worth the upgrade

<p>Despite what companies would like you to believe, you don’t need to get a new phone every year or two. So while Samsung’s 2023 lineup of its Galaxy S flagship phones may seem underwhelming when compared to the last generation, it’s not a bad thing that these devices offer little reason to upgrade. It’s just that after having said the same thing about the 2022 models, as well as competing phones from Apple and Google, it feels hard to be excited about non-folding smartphones anymore.</p><p>Like most of the competition, Samsung has focused on tweaking the S23 series’ camera and software features, alongside small adjustments to display and design. We’ve also got the typical processor upgrade and promised battery life improvements, which are objectively good things on paper, but in reality don’t impact your daily use that much.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve already reviewed the S23 Ultra which, thanks to a large screen, onboard S-Pen and 200-megapixel camera, is aggressively targeted at power users. For everyone else looking to get a new Android phone, there’s the S23+ or the S23. Samsung hasn’t made the smallest model available to review yet, so we’re focusing on the Plus model here. If you’re considering Samsung’s middle child, it’s probably only worth it if you’re currently using something at least three years old or if you’re outside the US.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>One of the most noticeable changes between the S23+ and its predecessor is this year’s cleaned up appearance. The two phones are basically the same, save for the shiny camera housing on the back of the older model, wrapping around the top left corner. Samsung introduced this “contour cut” housing on the S21, and I grew to like the aesthetic, especially on the lavender and pink versions.</p><div id="26f6a85570324128a67ab1ab9ba20da7"></div><p>Looking at the S22+ and S23+ side by side, I’m ambivalent – they’re both inoffensive. Whether you prefer the cleaner look depends on your personal taste. Functionally, nothing is too different between the two designs — the S23+ wobbles slightly less, but that was never a huge deal on the S22. I liked the lavender color of our review unit, as well as the green version I saw at Samsung’s hands-on event, but the cream and black options bore me.</p><p>In terms of physical dimensions, the differences between the two generations are negligible. They’re practically the same weight, width and length and exactly the same thickness. The S23+ is slimmer and lighter than the Pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 14 Plus, though those two have larger displays.</p><h2>Display and audio</h2><p>Speaking of, one area that Samsung did somewhat improve on the S23+ is its screen. Yes, it’s mostly the same as before, with the same size, same FHD+ resolution and an up to 120Hz refresh rate. By now you probably have heard reviewers like myself extol the virtues of screens with high refresh rates and how great they are for scrolling your Instagram or Reddit feeds. The S23+ is no exception.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the top half of the Galaxy S23+ held in a hand. In the background is a blurred out fence. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/e077b260-b6da-11ed-9475-e88612aa4f87" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>But it’s now capable of hitting up to 1,750 nits when outdoors compared to 1,200 nits before, meaning it should be easier to read in sunlight. There haven’t been many sunny days recently, so it’s been hard to put this to the test. But, the S23+ still offers a vibrant, colorful screen as is typical for Samsung’s mobile products.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, when it comes to audio, the Galaxy S23+ is as good as any flagship smartphone. That is to say it offers clear vocals and ample volume, but is slightly lacking in bass. Voices of The Weeknd, SZA and Rihanna all sounded clear in the songs that I listened to, though the instruments in the latter's cover of <em>Love On The Brain</em> sounded a little messy.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The triple rear camera system on the S23+ is the same as before. That is to say, its main 50-megapixel sensor is accompanied by a 10MP telephoto and a 12MP ultrawide. Up front, though, the S23+ has a new 12MP sensor with an f/2.2 aperture and 80-degree field of view.</p><figure><img alt="The purple Galaxy S23+ held in mid-air with its rear cameras facing out, held in mid-air with two hands." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/047edf30-b6db-11ed-af3b-208c63116e36" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>As a professional pixel peeper (™), I could make out just the <em>slightest </em>difference in sharpness between selfies taken with the S22+ and S23+, specifically in the highlighted strands of my hair. There was some distortion in the pictures taken with the older phone, whereas the same lines were tack sharp on the 12MP version. Overall, though, barring some general color temperature variations, it was hard to tell the two images apart.</p><p>Compared to the Pixel 7 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro, the S23+ has a slight advantage in retaining detail, thanks to its dual-pixel autofocus as well. I shot some selfies with a friend as we were cackling maniacally one night, and Samsung’s flagship was the only one that retained the gorgeous greens, purples and blues in her hair, while capturing every individual strand of her eyelashes. You could even see the texture of the pigmentation in her purple eyeshadow.</p><p>The Pixel’s 10.8MP front camera  managed to capture the hues in her hair too, but its picture simply wasn’t as detailed or clear. Meanwhile, the iPhone’s 12MP photo barely showed any of the colors in my friend’s tresses.</p><p>Though they remain unchanged, the S23+’s rear cameras are still pretty capable. In most situations with adequate light, they deliver pictures that are similar in quality to the Pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro. My shots of the New York cityscape one overcast day all showed slightly different coloring. The S23+ had the deepest, brightest blue, while the Pixel was the most neutral. Samsung’s 3x telephoto lens let me get the closest to faraway buildings and still get crisp pics, though Google’s algorithms still made for clean results.</p><p>In low light, however, the Pixel consistently outdid the S23+, with better exposure and retention of clarity in my numerous shots of mouth-watering food. Whether it’s a shiny fried shrimp or a plate of tantalizing scallops, the Pixel delivered more even highlights than the S23+. Google’s portrait mode also consistently kept subjects in focus, although every now and then the S23+ would produce a photo with surprisingly accurate outlines of my subjects.</p><p>While it’s not at the same level as Google’s or Apple’s flagship cameras, the S23+ isn’t lagging far behind and offers some versatility for those looking to take shots from a distance.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>This year marks the first time Samsung is using a Snapdragon processor in all variants of the Galaxy S series, regardless of where they’re bought. That means if you were relegated to using a version with Samsung’s own Exynos chip in the past, getting an S23 would be a bigger upgrade for you than someone in the US. Exynos models have been criticized for performance and battery life drawbacks compared to their Snapdragon counterparts, so trading your S22 in for an S23 would make more sense in Europe or Asia than in the US.</p><p>The S23 series is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, which is a customized version of Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line mobile processor. It has slightly higher clock speeds than the regular edition, so if this is the only deciding factor for you when choosing between a Galaxy and, say, a OnePlus, then know that this difference is extremely slight.</p><figure><img alt="The Galaxy S23 Plus held in mid-air. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/b9946380-b6e1-11ed-b7fe-74116746f3af" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>In daily use, the S23+ felt as zippy as any of the new phones I’ve tested lately. Whether I’m dragging and dropping my face between apps, learning Japanese on “Hey Japan,” mindlessly scrolling on Instagram or trying to get into <em>Genshin: Impact</em>, the S23+ never hiccuped. I generally expect pretty smooth performance out of new phones like this, so I can’t say I’m especially impressed, and it’s probably more realistic to evaluate performance after a few months with the phone.</p><p>I can, however, talk about how impressive the battery life has been. In general the S23+ has matched the Pixel 7 Pro that I also carried around while testing their cameras, and both devices stuck around for longer than two days without a charge. Granted, I wasn’t heavily using either during that time, mostly whipping them out to take photos and videos throughout the day.</p><p>On our video rundown battery test, the S23+ clocked a whopping 25 hours, which beats pretty much every phone we tested in 2022, as well as the Galaxy S23 Ultra and OnePlus 11.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>It might feel like nitpicking, but with so few meaningful changes, the S23+ doesn’t feel like it’s worth upgrading to if you’re using an S22 or S21. That is, at least, if you’re in the US. Those who are living with an Exynos version of an older Galaxy flagship will likely find a greater improvement in performance and battery life, making it a more worthy upgrade.</p><p>But just because the S23+ isn’t chock full of surprises and updates doesn’t mean it’s not a good phone. It still ranks up there as one of the best Android phones around. Samsung has consistently delivered capable phones with thoughtful software and features in the last few years and with the S23+, it continues to be a serious contender for those looking for an excellent Android phone.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html?src=rss

## Google expands Gmail client-side encryption to more users

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/">Google</a> says client-side encryption (CSE) is <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/gmail-and-calendar-client-side-encryption">now generally available</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gmail/">Gmail</a> after it enabled the feature on Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets and Meet last year and in Calendar <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/client-side-encryption-google-calendar.html">earlier this month</a>. The company opened a CSE beta for Gmail and Calendar <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/12/client-side-encryption-for-gmail-beta.html">late last year</a>, but now all organizations on a Google Workspace Enterprise Plus, Education Plus or Education Standard plan can enable the privacy protection feature. The option isn't available on personal Workspace plans or Google accounts just yet.</p><p>Although Workspace &quot;encrypts data at rest and in transit by using secure-by-design cryptographic libraries,&quot; CSE gives organizations total control over their encryption keys. &quot;Starting today, users can send and receive emails or create meeting events with internal colleagues and external parties, knowing that their sensitive data (including inline images and attachments) has been encrypted before it reaches Google servers,&quot; Google <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/gmail-and-calendar-client-side-encryption">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="GIF showing Google Workspace users how to turn on Gmail client-side encryption in the compose panel.

The compose panel will turn blue and may read &quot;New encrypted message.&quot; Meanwhile, in Calendar, you can click the shield icon next to an event title to add &quot;additional encryption&quot; to the description, attachments and Google Meet call.</p><p>Encrypting the likes of Drive files and Calendar events is certainly welcome, but CSE protections may be most effective in Gmail. Organizations are perhaps more likely to send emails externally than share files or calendar invites with third-parties, after all. In any case, Google says that all essential Workspace apps are now covered by CSE.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-expands-gmail-client-side-encryption-to-more-users-171226086.html?src=rss

## Hitman studio IO Interactive is making a fantasy RPG game

<p>Now that IO Interactive (IOI) has wrapped up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-free-upgrade-172153197.html"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em></a>, it’s moving on to the next logical step: a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-bond-game-io-interactive-153230729.html">James Bond game</a>. But the studio is also moving in a more surprising direction, as it announced today that it’s making an online fantasy RPG. “This idea — that a diverse group of individuals with different skills and strengths can work together and become more than the sum of their parts — is what inspires us,” the studio <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy">wrote</a> in a blog post.</p><p>Of course, IOI didn’t go into much detail about the project, which it describes as “just the start of our journey into this new world we are making.” However, it did say memories of tabletop fantasy RPGs influenced the decision. “From the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> books compelling you to choose your path, alone, against wizards, lizards, and thief kings. To the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight found around the tabletop. For some it meant taking the role of a game master: Part storyteller, part AI opponent, part guide, part villain. For everyone around that table it meant creativity, imagination, building a world together, and a shared goal in creating a great game experience.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The indie studio says the game will be a new IP designed to “entertain players and expand for many years to come.” It says all of its studios, including locations in Copenhagen, Malmö and Barcelona, will work together on the project.</p><figure><img alt="Teaser image for an upcoming James Bond game from IO Interactive. It shows the classic Bond sights image with the text &#x00201c;Project 007&#x00201d; in the center." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/f381ee40-b787-11ed-bfdd-4e37b692cead" style="height: 972; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>IOI will develop the RPG alongside its upcoming James Bond game, codenamed “Project 007,” which it’s working on with license holders MGM and Eon Productions. It seems a natural fit for the studio, as it could take the beloved core Hitman gameplay, create a new story with new maps, add a James Bond coat of paint and have a game many people would love to play. (It could change its formula more than that, but it won’t need a radical departure.) IOI has said its title would be its own Bond story that won’t use the likenesses of any established Bond actors; the studio even said it could become another spy trilogy. The title doesn’t yet have a release date.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitman-studio-io-interactive-is-making-a-fantasy-rpg-game-165722089.html?src=rss

B&amp;H's listing says the deal is only scheduled to last through Tuesday. Note that only the Space Gray model is discounted.</p><p></p><p>This deal applies to the entry-level 14-inch model, which includes a new M2 Pro chip with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. The 14.2-inch Mini-LED display has a resolution of 3,024 x 1,964 and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling.

Although that review was based on a higher-power configuration than this discounted model, the general benefits are the same here. The new MacBook Pro is essentially just a speed bump, but it remains a fast and sturdily-built notebook for power users. Its display is still superb, its keyboard and trackpad are still comfortable, its speakers are still top-notch and its battery life can still genuinely last beyond a full work day. On the flip side, the whole thing is still expensive (even with this discount) and hardly upgradeable, but that's a familiar story for Macs. This entry-level model also comes with a 67W charger, while the more expensive configurations include a faster 96W adapter in the box.</p><p>The one major upgrade here is the new chip. To be clear, this variant of the M2 Pro isn't worth the upgrade for most owners of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">prior MacBook Pro</a>, and its graphics performance is still clearly behind the M2 Max chip available in the pricier Pro models. Because of the way its NAND chips are configured, this entry-level model's storage performance is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/24/macbook-pro-ssd-performance-drop/">technically slower</a> than the last entry-level 14-inch Pro as well.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, this is still a powerful notebook. Any storage drop-off isn't likely to be noticeable the vast majority of the time, and the CPU and GPU performance here is still a nice jump for most looking to upgrade from an older Intel-based Pro.

## Flipboard is leaning into Mastodon — and away from Twitter

<p>Flipboard is the latest service to embrace Mastodon as Twitter becomes increasingly chaotic under Elon Musk. The news reading app, whose founder was once on Twitter’s board of directors, is now going all in on the Fediverse.</p><p>The company announced that it’s integrating Mastodon into its main app, so that users can browse their feeds much the way they can “flip” through their Twitter timelines. Flipboard is also starting up its own Mastodon instance in an effort to encourage broader adoption among its user base.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, the two updates are the first “very initial steps” of a broader plan to embrace the decentralized social networking protocols that have been popularized by Mastodon over the last year. Instead of relying on the “proprietary social graphs” of services like Twitter and Facebook — both of which have become increasingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html"><ins>hostile</ins></a> to outside developers — Flipboard could instead be centered around ActivityPub, the open source protocol that powers Mastodon and <a href="https://alternativeto.net/feature/activitypub-support/%5C"><ins>the rest</ins></a> of the decentralized services that make up the “Fediverse.”</p><p>“As we embrace ActivityPub at Flipboard, we’ll effectively allow anyone who's on Mastodon to follow a user on Flipboard, and to follow a Flipboard magazine, and vice versa,” McCue says in an interview. “What ActivityPub enables is a common, open social graph.” This means that services like Flipboard and Mastodon could eventually be interoperable with other platforms that have pledged to adopt ActivityPub, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/"><ins>Tumblr.</ins></a></p><p>The shift is especially notable for Flipboard given its once deep ties to Twitter. McCue served on Twitter's board of directors between 2010 and 2012, and Twitter once reportedly <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=111c4362-0f7f-48fd-83a0-5cf398008667&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxMTFjNDM2Mi0wZjdmLTQ4ZmQtODNhMC01Y2YzOTgwMDg2NjciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS8yMDE1LzUvMjUvMTE1NjI5MTgvdHdpdHRlci1oYXMtaGVsZC10YWxrcy10by1hY3F1aXJlLWZsaXBib2FyZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmQwYjAxZTQtZTRhMi00YTI3LWFjNWQtYjI4MzQ1MDMyZTBlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5wqDxox6dq9PeEJW8THREbQn_HjxUkx2OWq57NZN-Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2015%2F5%2F25%2F11562918%2Ftwitter-has-held-talks-to-acquire-flipboard"><ins>considered</ins></a> buying the app. But now, McCue says the current state of Twitter “is quite sad for a lot of people who were advocates and participants in the whole Twitter ecosystem.”</p><p>And, with Twitter set <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html"><ins>to end</ins></a> its free API, it’s not clear how much longer Flipboard will be able to maintain any kind of functionality with the service. “It's total chaos over there,” McCue says, referring to Twitter since Musk took over the company. “The writing on the wall is that I don't see [Flipboard’s] Twitter integration lasting much longer.”</p><p>But McCue describes Mastodon and the Fediverse as a kind of antidote to the Musk-induced chaos. “We need to get out of this world where one person can basically dictate how these communities of people are interacting with each other,” he says.</p><p>Of course, there are still questions about whether Mastodon will ever be more than a relatively niche Twitter alternative. The platform has seen explosive growth since last spring when Musk announced his takeover bid for Twitter, but the growth has since <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/"><ins>leveled off</ins></a>. And the decentralized nature of the platform isn’t necessarily intuitive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html"><ins>for newcomers</ins></a>. McCue acknowledges that the Fediverse is still waiting for its “Netscape moment” (he was an executive at the browser company in the late ‘90s at the peak of the Web 1.0 era), but he predicts that other mainstream services may start looking at Mastodon more strategically as well.</p><p>“I think you're going to see, in the coming months, companies like us start to integrate ActivityPub and advocate to publishers and content creators that they should build a presence in the Fediverse,” he predicts. “Once that starts to reach critical mass …  then I think you're gonna get that Netscape moment.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/flipboard-is-leaning-into-mastodon-and-away-from-twitter-160036103.html?src=rss

## Realme's GT3 phone with 240W fast charging is getting a global release

<p>Realme, a sister brand of Oppo, is finally bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-neo5-240w-supervooc-charging-100557408.html">240W SuperVOOC</a> fast charging tech to the international market by way of a familiar-looking device. Freshly announced at MWC, the Realme GT3 is identical to the Chinese GT Neo5 model, meaning it benefits from the same rapid charging speeds: a quick 80-second connection with the custom 12A cable will replenish the 4,600mAh battery to 20 percent, and a 9.5-minute session will get it fully charged.</p><p>To cope with the extra heat from the higher charging power, the GT3's battery is covered with a massive vapor chamber liquid cooling system, and this is complemented with various safety sensors plus a fireproof design. The battery will apparently maintain at least 80-percent health after 1,600 charging cycles (at 240W) — doubling that of the industry standard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Realme GT3" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/21dc8770-b754-11ed-b7ef-f576f4bb2cac" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>Realme threw in a small C-shaped RGB lighting ring — dubbed &quot;Pulse Interface System&quot; — sandwiched between an NFC ring and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 icon on the back (yep, no love for the newer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chip-offers-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-230008445.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> here). These are all housed inside a translucent window next to the camera module, with the customizable light ring indicating the battery level, incoming calls, notifications and camera countdown. See? RGB isn't just for showing off.</p><p>As with the GT Neo5, the GT3 packs a 50-megapixel main camera (featuring a Sony IMX890 sensor and optical stabilization), an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera. Flip to the other side, you'll find a 6.74-inch 2,772 x 1,240 AMOLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate, an under-display fingerprint reader and a 16-megapixel punch-hole selfie camera. The infrared remote blaster at the top is here to stay, and likewise with the Dolby Atmos stereo speakers.</p><figure><img alt="Realme GT3" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/421165a0-b74b-11ed-9c7e-48eebccaf589" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>The Realme GT3's charging speed may not match Xiaomi's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-300w-charging-five-minutes-062341344.html">five-minute</a> record claim from earlier today, but at least it is already available in the market. Starting at $649, this Android 13 device comes in four flavors, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage being the base model, and maxing out with 16GB RAM plus 1TB of storage for the special variant.

<p>Federal law enforcement is once again dealing with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-contained-cybersecurity-incident-172130292.html">cybersecurity breach</a>. The US Marshals Service (USMS) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/27/us-marshals-service-suffers-major-security-breach-that-compromises-sensitive-information-senior-law-enforcement-officials-say.html">reports</a> that it suffered a serious ransomware attack on February 17th. The perpetrators compromised sensitive data on a stand-alone system, including personally identifiable info for some USMS employees, third parties and the targets of investigations.</p><p>We've asked the USMS for comment. The agency tells <em>CNBC</em> that it disconnected the affected system from the network after discovering the attack, and that the Justice Department has launched an investigation. Senior officials briefed on the ransomware determined it was a &quot;major&quot; event on February 22nd.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The service hasn't identified potential culprits or named any impacted divisions or programs. A <em>CNBC</em> source claims the ransomware didn't touch the Witness Security Program. The USMS has reportedly created a workaround to maintain its activities, including hunting fugitives.</p><p>Word of the breach comes just over a week after the FBI said it &quot;contained&quot; a security incident on its network. Ransomware has also been problematic for various levels of government and public institutions in the past several months. The city of Oakland went so far as to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oakland-declares-state-of-emergency-ransomware-attack-092310131.html">declare a state of emergency</a> in February following an incursion, while Los Angeles' Unified School District also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lausd-ransomware-attack-data-leak-153630032.html">reeled from a digital heist</a> last fall.</p><p>The US government has escalated its fight against ransomware in the past two years. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-ransomware-meeting-212310054.html">brought 30 countries together</a> to address ransomware in 2021, and recently succeeded in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hive-ransomware-doj-fbi-disruption-193249866.html">disrupting a major ransomware group</a> that stole hundreds of millions of dollars from victims.

<p>Luminous Productions, the studio behind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/forspoken/"><em><ins>Forspoken</ins></em></a>, will soon close shop. Its team will be folded back into parent company Square Enix and tasked with working on other projects. The publisher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-27-final-fantasy-xv-luminous-productions-new-ip.html"><ins>set up the studio</ins></a>, which included the developers behind <em>Final Fantasy XV,</em> in 2018 to work on new franchises, but <em>Forspoken</em> was its only game as a standalone studio.</p><p>In a statement, Luminous said that its team will move back directly under Square Enix's umbrella starting on May 1st. In the meantime, the developers will continue to work on an update to address <em>Forspoken</em>'s performance issues, as well as an expansion that's slated to arrive this summer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;When we established Luminous Productions in 2018, our vision was to make AAA games that fused technology and artistry to deliver completely new play experiences,&quot; Luminous <a href="https://twitter.com/LumiPro_EN/status/1630449903385329665">wrote on Twitter</a>. &quot;Having the chance to do just that has been a dream come true.&quot;</p><div id="1c249cac57504bafaf65dde8e6a0a89b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">An Update from Luminous Productions <a href="https://t.co/fbDENflRhj">pic.twitter.com/fbDENflRhj</a></p>— Luminous Productions (@LumiPro_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LumiPro_EN/status/1630449903385329665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>In <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2023/html/20230228_announcement_EN.html"><ins>a statement</ins></a> of its own, Square Enix said it's absorbing the Luminous team as &quot;part of the company’s efforts to further bolster the competitive prowess of the group’s development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy.&quot; It added that Luminous is &quot;equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group’s ability to develop HD games.&quot;</p><p>This is hardly the first time that Square Enix has taken swift action against its studios after projects failed to meet expectations. Last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/embracer-acquires-eidos-square-enix-montreal-and-other-studios-for-300-million-091019083.html"><ins>sold off</ins></a> three Western studios — Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal and Square Enix Montréal — as well as franchises like Tomb Raider and Deus Ex to Embracer Group for a relatively small price of $300 million. The move came after the likes of <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>(which didn't sell well enough despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-staff-best-favorite-games-2021-150045585.html"><ins>strong reviews</ins></a>) didn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-didnt-meet-square-enixs-sales-expectations"><ins>sell as well as Square Enix hoped</ins></a>.</p><p><em>Forspoken </em>is one of the highest-profile games of the year to date. However, Square Enix released it in January to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forspoken-review-ps5-pc-a-magical-world-with-several-cracks-140051257.html"><ins>a so-so reception from critics</ins></a>. It's not yet clear how well the game has performed commercially.&nbsp;</p><p>Steam data indicated that <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, a game from <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> studio Tango Gameworks that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hi-fi-rush-release-date-205659375.html"><ins>announced and released</ins></a> on the same day, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/in-their-debut-week-hi-fi-rush-outperformed-forspoken-on-steam/"><ins>outperformed </ins><em><ins>Forspoken</ins></em></a> in their first week of release on the platform. That's despite <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> being available on Game Pass and costing $30 versus the $70 Square Enix charged for <em>Forspoken</em>. In fairness, the data only takes into account sales on Steam from the same week, not preorders or purchases from Steam key sellers.</p><p>In any case, that's not a great look for Luminous or <em>Forspoken</em>. Square Enix gobbling up the team spells disappointing news for any fans of <em>Forspoken </em>who were hoping for a sequel. Meanwhile, Luminous used a proprietary engine to create <em>Final Fantasy XV</em> and <em>Forspoken</em>. It's not clear what the future holds for the Luminous Engine after the merger either. Whatever happens, here's hoping the folks from Luminous aren't stuck working on Square Enix's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-symbiogenesis-nft-parasite-eve-155218372.html"><ins>NFT nonsense</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/forspoken-studio-luminous-productions-will-be-folded-into-square-enix-153805323.html?src=rss

## Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phones are the first to support built-in 'iSIMs'

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-19-its-esim-time.html">Never mind eSIMs</a> — your next phone might have a more advanced way of connecting to your carrier. Qualcomm and Thales have <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/02/qualcomm-and-thales-unveil-world-s-first-gsma-compliant-isim-wit">confirmed</a> the certification of the first user-ready Integrated SIM, or &quot;iSIM.&quot; It promises the same card-free digital sign-ups and security as eSIMs, but is built directly into a phone's main processor. Your phone doesn't need a dedicated chip, saving space and (hopefully) money.</p><p>The companies don't say which phones will be the first to use iSIMs. The technology supports the same remote provisioning standard as eSIMs, however. Your provider won't necessarily need to update its systems to support iSIM-based devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's no guarantee phone makers will pass any savings along to you. The reduced footprint could make room for slightly larger batteries and other components, though. More importantly, this might encourage more manufacturers to use digital SIMs by making the tech easier to implement. With that said, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is a high-end platform. You may not see wider adoption until more affordable chips (and thus lower-priced phones) offer iSIM support.</p><p>The timing is convenient, at least. Many phones now include eSIM support, while American iPhone 14 and 14 Pro models <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-sim-card-195422014.html">don't have physical SIM trays</a>. The conventional SIM card is on the decline, and iSIM could hasten that transition by making its virtual counterpart more commonplace.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/snapdragon-8-gen-2-isim-support-150031144.html?src=rss

## Bing AI is coming to the Windows 11 taskbar, of course

<p>Three weeks after introducing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html?uuid=EKHYvtgJk9IGt34A1043">new AI-infused Bing</a>, Microsoft is ready to shove it into Windows 11 with an <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.windows.com%2Fwindowsexperience%2F%3Fp%3D178108&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmorui%40microsoft.com%7Cc4242b7bf2c24ea7c84f08db047c9801%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638108705396321432%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Dqquc4kV51545k%2F5iZuTnK9V6F%2FBymIBxP87enPOPK0%3D&amp;reserved=0">update coming today</a>. If you're in the Bing AI preview, you'll be able to access all of its new features from the search box in the Windows 11 taskbar. Just imagine a slightly more streamlined version of what we saw with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">Bing AI on Edge</a>: In addition to general web searching, you can ask Bing natural language queries and its intelligent chatbot will reply conversationally. If you don't have access to the new Bing yet, you can still sign up for access on <a href="https://www.bing.com/new">Microsoft's waitlist</a>.</p><p>The impetus here is pretty clear. Now that people are <em>finally</em> talking about Bing in a less derogatory way, Microsoft is aiming to infuse it into the very core of Windows 11. No need to open up Edge or switch your primary web browser. Last week, the company also rolled out the Bing AI preview on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-brings-its-bing-ai-chatbot-to-mobile-apps-and-skype-173839923.html">mobile apps and Skype</a>. More so than the expanding access, though, we'll be keeping a close eye on how Microsoft is improving Bing's capabilities, while also trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-already-reversing-some-of-the-limits-it-put-on-bings-ai-chat-tools-212138986.html">limit some of its bad behavior</a>. Remember folks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">chatbots are just very good predictive text generators</a>, not arbiters of truth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img alt="Showing Phone Link connectivity with an iPhone, including text messages and voice calls." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/e4900750-b6ba-11ed-b0b9-ebf242e360bb" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>If you don't give a lick about Bing AI, this latest Windows 11 update is still packed with plenty of intriguing new features. For one, Windows Insiders will be able to test out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-supports-limited-iphone-syncing-in-preview-140005285.html">Phone Link for iPhones</a>, which will let you make calls and send texts from within Windows. (This follows Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-icloud-photos-update-214218257.html">iCloud integration in Windows 11's Photos app</a>.) Android users with Samsung phones, who have had access to Phone Link for a while now, will also be able to easily turn on their Wi-Fi hotspots and transfer their browser sessions.

## Windows 11 Phone Link supports limited iPhone syncing in preview

<p>Microsoft is taking its first steps towards bringing iPhone syncing to Windows 11. The company announced today that the Insider preview of Phone Link would support iPhones starting this week. The feature (which has undergone several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-07-windows-your-phone.html">name changes</a>) has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-your-phone-175356621.html">worked with Android phones</a> since as far back as 2015.</p><p>The initial preview will only sync calls, messages and contacts from your iPhone to a Windows 11 PC. (It will show them like regular Windows notifications.) However, there are some limits: You won’t be able to reply to group messages, and sending media in messages is also unsupported. Still, it’s a big step in the right direction for a feature that has thus far excluded the countless people who use both iPhones and Windows PCs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft says Phone Link for iPhones will only roll out to “a small percentage” of Windows Insiders this week; it explicitly states that not all Insiders will initially see the option. Instead, the company will expand the preview to more Insiders as it gathers feedback from the first batch of testers. Further, access is cloud-based, so there won’t be a specific version of the Phone Link app that instantly lets you use the preview.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot of a Windows 11 desktop showing the Phone Link app with the " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/0c81aec0-b48c-11ed-b5ff-e044ac0c1564" style="height: 1007; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>If you’re one of the lucky few accepted, you’ll see an option to link your iPhone in the Phone Link app. After choosing it, it will guide you through the steps to pair your phone and PC over Bluetooth (including scanning a QR code). You’ll also need to confirm a code and grant permissions on both the Windows and iOS sides to ensure everything syncs up.</p><p>The feature follows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unison-iphone-android-windows-pc-integration-162018285.html">Intel’s Unison app</a>, which supports calls, messages, notifications and file transfers between phones (including iPhones) and Intel PCs. Several third-party apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-26-airdroid-2-update.html">AirDroid</a> have offered similar functionality for years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-supports-limited-iphone-syncing-in-preview-140005285.html?src=rss

## GravaStar's latest speaker looks like a tiny crawling robot

<p>GravaStar, known for science-fiction-inspired speakers with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-gravastar-bluetooth-speaker-futuristic-robot-tws.html">surprisingly solid sound</a>, introduced a new model today. In addition to playing music, the Supernova Bluetooth speaker doubles as a lantern — while resembling something that belongs in the Star Wars prequels. The company pitches it as a camping companion that ticks the boxes for music, lighting and oddball novelty.</p><p>The speaker has a metallic body made from a zinc alloy. Its lantern-like design can produce customizable lighting effects while changing color to the music’s rhythm. On the audio front, it has 25 watts of power and a rating of 90db with a three-inch full-range speaker and half-inch high-frequency tweeter. It also supports stereo pairing if you buy two of them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The speaker weighs 2.2 lbs and has a handle with collapsible legs. GravaStar estimates up to seven hours of battery life and a Bluetooth distance of up to 20 meters. The Supernova speaker / lantern is available to order today for $180. The company tells Engadget that it will ship by the end of March.</p><figure><img alt="A cute robot charger (mech-inspired) sitting on a wooden desk.

The Alpha65 charger has one USB-A and two USB-C ports. In addition, it uses GaN (gallium nitride) tech, which should make it faster and more energy-efficient than standard silicon chargers. Finally, it includes a synchronous rectification chip to help reduce power loss when converting AC to DC. The Alpha65 charger costs $60 and is available to order starting today.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gravastars-latest-speaker-looks-like-a-tiny-crawling-robot-140001000.html?src=rss

<p>Starting today, more people around the world will be able to access hundreds of games on Windows through Microsoft's subscription service. The company is <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/02/28/pc-game-pass-preview-40-new-countries/">expanding</a> its PC Game Pass preview program to 40 more countries around the world, bringing its total number of territories to 86. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-rebrand-035131086.html">Previously known</a> as the Xbox Game Pass for PC, the service includes access to new Xbox Game Studios releases from day one, member-only benefits in Riot Games, an EA Play membership and titles by Bethesda, which officially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">became part of Xbox</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this is a preview version of the service, interested users will have to install the Xbox Insider Hub app and sign up to join the Insider Program before they can start playing.

## Europe’s music streaming antitrust case against Apple will now focus on ‘anti-steering’ clauses

<p>Back in 2021, the European Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-eu-antitrust-apple-music-spotify-103100952.html">issued antitrust charges</a> against Apple after deciding that the company may be abusing its dominant position when it comes to music streaming apps. The commission sent the tech giant a Statement of Objections listing issues that it believes warrant further investigation. In it, the EU's executive body outlined its issues with Apple, namely making developers use its payment system and preventing them from telling subscribers about alternative (and often cheaper) payment options outside of iOS apps. Now, the commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1217">announced</a> that its antitrust investigation will only touch upon the second issue, or the &quot;anti-steering obligations&quot; Apple imposes upon developers.&nbsp;</p><p>Its revised Statement of Objections drops its position regarding the legality of the company making developers use its in-app payment system. It's going all in on the anti-steering allegations instead, citing  concerns that Apple's rule prevents developers from notifying users about more affordable subscription prices elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The commission said these anti-steering obligations imposed upon developers are &quot;unfair trading conditions&quot; in breach of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU'). It explained that the obligations are &quot;neither necessary nor proportionate for the provision of the App Store on iPhones and iPad,&quot; that they're detrimental to Apple users who'll likely end up paying more, and that they negatively affect music streaming app developers &quot;by limiting effective consumer choice.&quot;</p><p>This particular antitrust case was a result of the complaint <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-spotify-apple-complaint-eu-app-store.html">Spotify filed against Apple</a> in 2019, wherein it accused the tech giant of having discriminatory practices designed to suppress competitors to Apple Music. If the commission decides that Apple has indeed broken antitrust laws, then it could prohibit the conduct that's in breach of the rules — in this case, preventing developers from pointing users to external payment options — and could fine the company up to 10 percent of its annual turnover worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-28/european-commission-apples-abuses-harm-consumers/">In a statement</a>, Spotify welcomed the European Commission's announcement, noting that regulators are &quot;sending a clear message that Apple must play fair and let competition work&quot;:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The European Commission has once again made it abundantly clear that consumers are the ultimate victims of Apple’s abusive and anticompetitive behavior—and putting a stop to it is a top priority. Apple’s anti-steering rules, which prohibit Spotify and other developers from telling consumers about deals or promotions through their own apps, mean that users are deprived of opportunities to save money and enjoy a higher quality service. That directly harms consumers. With each passing day, Apple continues to choke competition and smother innovation. The European Commission today is sending a clear message that Apple must play fair and let competition work. Momentum is on the side of consumers but they deserve final resolution—and soon.</p></blockquote><p>Apple told <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hcHBsZS1mYWNlcy1yZXZpc2VkLWNoYXJnZXMtb3Zlci1tdXNpYy1zdHJlYW1pbmctZnJvbS1ldS00NWY1NTNmZD9tb2Q9ZTJ0d2QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmMTI0MTg3LTM5N2EtNDJlYi05MTkzLWI2YmU4Y2VlMDJlZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbpxhWuFSky7p7AIUnnUXiY6TqaZSUJNh5yVIgdY8A4E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fapple-faces-revised-charges-over-music-streaming-from-eu-45f553fd%3Fmod%3De2twd"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> that it was pleased the scope of its case had been narrowed and that it hopes the commission &quot;will end its pursuit of a complaint that has no merit.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eu-music-streaming-antitrust-case-apple-focus-anti-steering-clauses-123405739.html?src=rss

<p>Almost four years after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-28-pokemon-sleep.html"><ins>it was announced</ins></a>, <em>Pokémon Sleep</em>, a mobile game that tracks your sleep,<em>&nbsp;</em>is finally on the way. According to yesterday's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-pokemon-direct-event-will-take-place-on-february-27th-153032910.html"><ins>Pokémon Presents event</ins></a>, it’ll arrive sometime <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-sleep-will-finally-arrive-this-summer-153806988.html">this summer</a>, after it was meant to debut in 2020. It features Snorlax (of course) and Professor Neroli, a Pokémon sleep researcher. The idea is you leave your phone next to you when you go to bed, and it analyzes your sleep… somehow.</p><p>There’s also Pokémon Go Plus +, a new physical device that connects to both <em>Pokémon Sleep </em>and<em> Pokémon Go</em>. For the former, you press the button when you go to bed and again when you wake up to track your sleep data, presumably instead of needing your phone. Pokémon Go Plus + (yes, that’s its name) follows the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-17-pokemon-go-plus-hands-on.html"><ins>original Pokémon Go Plus</ins></a> peripheral, which emerged in 2016.

<p>FromSoftware has confirmed the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/10l33j5/according_to_leaked_discord_conversation_lance/">rumors</a> that had been circulating since earlier this year that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-12-million-copies-18-days-105555964.html"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> is getting a big DLC. In an announcement posted on the game's Twitter account, the Japanese developer said that an upcoming expansion entitled <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is currently in development. It also shared a key artwork for the expansion, but it has yet to reveal details on what it's going to be about and when it's going to be released.&nbsp;</p><div id="087d5b96e4884a1e9edb3f492f1a9ad8"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rise, Tarnished, and let us walk a new path together.<br />An upcoming expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, is currently in development.<br />We hope you look forward to new adventures in the Lands Between. <a href="https://t.co/cjJYijM7Mw">pic.twitter.com/cjJYijM7Mw</a></p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1630478058103734274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>On its company account, FromSoftware also <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1630477908522270722">wrote in Japanese</a> that it might take a bit of time for the company to announce further news about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. It remains to be seen how big the expansion is going to be, and if it's going to add a substantial amount of gameplay to the already vast world of <em>Elden Ring.</em>&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FromSoftware's announcement comes shortly after <em>Elden Ring's</em> first release anniversary on February 25th. Bandai Namco, the game's publisher, expected to sell 4 million copies in five weeks.

<p>OnePlus is having quite an eventful Mobile World Congress. In addition to revealing its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-oneplus-11-concept-phone-includes-pc-like-liquid-cooling-143017072.html">experimental phone</a> that it envisions to have liquid cooling capabilities, the company has also announced that it will be launching its first foldable smartphone in the second half of 2023. With this revelation, OnePlus has confirmed previous rumors that it's working on a foldable device similar to Samsung's offerings. The company <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-foldable-teaser-3280364/">teased</a> a mysterious Q3 2023 launch with what seemed to be silhouettes of devices that fold in the background at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-review-price-release-date-cameras-150015371.html">OnePlus 11</a> event earlier this month, but it fell short of saying what exactly it would be releasing.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its confirmation, OnePlus remains tight-lipped on what a foldable device from the company would entail. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-v-fold-oneplus-v-flip-listing/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported in January that it found two trademark listings with the China National Intellectual Property Administration for a OnePlus V Fold and a OnePlus V Flip. In today's announcement, OnePlus only talks about one smartphone, so it's unclear if it's actually developing two at the moment. All Kinder Liu, President and COO of OnePlus, had to say at the event was:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Our first foldable phone will have the signature OnePlus fast and smooth experience. It must be a flagship phone that doesn't settle because of its folding form, in terms of industrial design, mechanical technology, and other aspects. We want to launch a device that aims to be at the pinnacle experience of today’s foldable market.&quot;</p><p>The company promised to release more details about its foldable device in the coming months. Aside from that, it also shared its plans to build a more cohesive ecosystem within the next three to five years. It said the ecosystem will enable OnePlus to provide seamless connection across its phones, tablets, wearables and internet-of-things devices.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-will-launch-its-first-foldable-smartphone-later-this-year-110040331.html?src=rss

## Polar is bringing its fitness tracking tech to rival watches

<p>Polar isn't as big a name in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html">fitness watches</a> as competitors like Garmin, but it believes it has a way to extend its footprint: license its technology to those rivals. The company is now making 25 fitness algorithms available to some companies. &quot;Powered by Polar&quot; watches can use the brand's activity, health and sleep tracking know-how in combination with their own hardware and services. Third parties won't have to pour years of research into their products just to get started, Polar claims.</p><p>The first watch to use Polar's framework is Casio's new G-Shock G-Squad GBD-H2000. There aren't many official details at tis stage, but the sequel to the GBD-H1000 is <a href="https://www.g-central.com/customer-receives-g-shock-gbd-h2000-by-mistake/">expected</a> to feature a similarly chunky design while adding Polar's fitness science and a gyroscope. It should still include solar-assisted charging, GPS and a host of sensors that include an altimeter, barometer, compass and thermometer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Polar isn't a complete stranger to offering fitness tech to business customers, such as online tracking tools. It has solutions for coaches, fitness classes, schools and teams. However, this is the first time it's providing tech directly to the competition. In theory, this brings advanced fitness tracking to a wider range of devices, and might let watchmakers consider fitness products that simply weren't options before now.</p><p>To some extent, though, this is an acknowledgment that Polar's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polar-pacer-pacer-pro-running-watch-2022-090008278.html">in-house watches</a> aren't the strongest sellers. The firm describes itself as a &quot;top 10 player&quot; in wearables, but that still leaves it trailing the heavyweights. Garmin was the only fitness-first watch brand whose shipments cracked the top five in the second quarter of 2022, according to Canalys <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-wearable-band-market-Q2-2022?ctid=2943-be5227d4e6a3aa3f2b55b2b16c20419d">estimates</a>, and it had 5.5 percent of the market. Algorithm licensing could help Polar boost its profits and influence regardless of how its device sales fare.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/polar-fitness-tracking-for-third-party-watches-100045709.html?src=rss

## LastPass says hackers broke into an employee PC to steal the company's password vault

<p>LastPass has <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/incident-2-additional-details-of-the-attack">posted an update</a> on its investigation regarding a couple of security incidents that took place last year, and they're sounding graver than previously thought. Apparently, the bad actors involved in those incidents also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/">infiltrated</a> a company DevOps engineer's home computer by exploiting a third-party media software package. They implanted a keylogger into the software, which they then used to capture the engineer's master password for an account with access to the LastPass corporate vault. After they got in, they exported the vault's entries and shared folders that contained decryption keys needed to unlock cloud-based Amazon S3 buckets with customer vault backups.</p><p>This latest update in LastPass' investigation gives us a clearer picture of how the two security breach incidents it went through last year were connected. If you'll recall, LastPass revealed in August 2022 that an &quot;unauthorized party&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-hacked-no-user-data-was-compromised-064640557.html">gained entry</a> into its system. While the first incident ended on August 12th, the company said in its new announcement that the threat actors were &quot;actively engaged in a new series of reconnaissance, enumeration, and exfiltration activities aligned to the cloud storage environment spanning from August 12th, 2022 to October 26th, 2022.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-reveals-another-security-breach-075158853.html">announced</a> the second security breach in December, it said the bad actors used  information obtained from the first incident to get into its cloud service. It also admitted that the hackers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-lastpass-hack-was-worse-than-the-company-first-reported-000501559.html">made off with</a> a bunch of sensitive information, including its Amazon S3 buckets. To be able to access the data saved in those buckets, the hackers needed decryption keys saved in &quot;highly restricted set of shared folders in a LastPass password manager vault.&quot; That's why the bad actors targeted one of the four DevOps engineers who had access to the keys needed to unlock the company's cloud storage.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://pnr.ouryahoo.com/story/engadget_us/dd4a2b1d-58ca-4d3b-81b5-f78ae871407c">support document</a> (PDF) the company released (via <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-devops-engineer-hacked-to-steal-password-vault-data-in-2022-breach/"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a>), it detailed the data accessed by the threat actors during the two incidents. Apparently, the cloud-based backups accessed during the second breach included &quot;API secrets, third-party integration secrets, customer metadata and backups of all customer vault data.&quot; The company insisted that all sensitive customer vault data aside from some exceptions &quot;can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user's master password.&quot; The company added that it doesn't store users' master passwords. LastPass also detailed the steps it has taken to strengthen its defenses going forward, including revising its threat detection and making &quot;a multi-million-dollar allocation to enhance [its] investment in security across people, processes, and technology.&quot;</p>

## Xiaomi's 300W demo fully charges a phone in five minutes

<p>Back in late October, we saw Xiaomi releasing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redmi-note-12-discovery-edition-210w-hypercharge-064020788.html">210W mobile charging tech</a> by way of its Redmi sub-brand, and this was eventually beaten by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-neo5-240w-supervooc-charging-100557408.html">240W version</a> from Realme — part of the Oppo and OnePlus family — in early February. Given that it's MWC week, today Xiaomi swiftly responded with a whopping 300W demo, which brought the charging time down to a little under five minutes — almost half that of the two aforementioned achievements. Xiaomi added that this new 300W charger comes in the same size as its earlier 210W counterpart, thanks to a better modular design plus heat dissipation on the inside.</p><p>The 300W demo featured a Redmi Note 12 Pro+ modified with a 4,100mAh battery, which is a little smaller than the 4,300mAh in the 210W Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition (and the Realme has a far more generous 4,600mAh). As you can see in the video, the phone reached 20 percent in just a little over one minute, followed by the 50 percent mark in 2 minutes 12 seconds, and then 100 percent in just a little under 5 minutes. The power meter indicated a peak input of a little over 290W for the charger, and it also managed to sustain 280W and above for around two minutes at one point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company said the battery here pack more powerful 15C cells (as opposed to the 10C cells in the Discovery Edition), which consist of new carbon materials in place of some of the conventional graphite parts, thus reducing the electrodes' thickness by 35 percent. Together with an improved electrolyte formula, this lithium ion battery can pack a higher power density with a faster charge and discharge rate, while apparently reducing the amount of heat produced in the process. These ultra-thin cells are then stacked with thermal materials in between as part of a new &quot;sandwich&quot; design, in order to optimize heat dissipation while making better use of internal space. As far as safety is concerned, Xiaomi claimed that there are over 50 features built into the system to keep tabs on the current, voltage and temperature on each charging chip.</p><p>Xiaomi's announcement today has definitely set another milestone for the mobile industry, though the company didn't mention whether this 300W charging tech will be mass produced. Nor did Xiaomi share figures on charging cycles, which makes for a sober reminder of how battery lifespan can be affected by higher charging power.</p>
