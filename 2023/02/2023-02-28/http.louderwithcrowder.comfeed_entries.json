At age six, Jazz and their family started making television appearances about the struggles that come with being a transgender child. </p><p>Jazz's documentary-style TV show <em>\"I Am Jazz: A Family in Transition,\" </em>premiered in 2011, and Jazz's fame skyrocketed from there.

That's just a transphobic conspiracy theory. </p><p>Despite all of these gender-confirming procedures, including three total surgeries due to complications, Jazz recently told their mother Jeanette that they never feel like themselves. </p><p>Jazz said through tears, \"You know I can't get out of my head. It doesn't stop.\" Jeanette tried to console Jazz, saying \"you're your own worst enemy.\" </p><p>Jazz continued, \"I just want to feel like myself.

You're young and fifteen. She's an elderly woman suffering from cancer. You're a big enough loser targeting the elderly.

Again, this woman is known as \"Grandma\" to an entire neighborhood. That neighborhood chased the carjacker down.</p><p>Some details are missing in the story, such as what happened when he was caught. But according to the police report the scumbag left in an ambulance. I won't fault the neighbors being too busy jolly stomping this guy to think to record themselves doing so.
