  <p id="96nXbn">Recently, it was announced that Twitter would only offer SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23605073/twitter-blue-charge-sms-2fa">to its Twitter Blue members</a> (those who are willing to pay $8 a month on Android or $11 a month on iOS). To tell you the truth, my first reaction was: just as well. If you want to use 2FA to secure your social media or another account, using text messaging is not the way to go. You’re much better off using either a third-party authenticator app or a hardware security key.</p>

  <p id="YiRBW3">Disney’s latest live-action adaptation will be streaming later this spring. The company revealed today that <em>Peter Pan &amp; Wendy</em>, billed as a “reimagining” of the 1953 animated film and the original play, will premiere on April 28th.

<p id="BAkkyN">The news came alongside the first full trailer for the film, which stars Alexander Molony as Peter, Ever Anderson as Wendy, and Jude Law as Captain Hook. The movie is directed by David Lowery, who was behind the 2016 adaptation of<em> Pete’s Dragon</em> and the fantasy film <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618625/a24-the-green-knight-screening-room-streaming-august-18th"><em>The Green Knight</em></a> from 2021. “We wanted to invigorate our retelling with emotional sincerity, an open heart, and a grand yearning for adventure,” Lowery...</p>

  <p id="8S6hqB">The EU has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1217">updated its antitrust case</a> against Apple and the control it wields over music streaming services on iOS with potentially good news for complainant Spotify. </p>
<p id="MNvm9b">The European Commission, the EU body investigating the charges, says Apple breached antitrust laws by stopping rival music firms like Spotify from advertising where and how users could subscribe to their apps. This update to the case does not constitute a final ruling, and it’s now up to Apple to marshal a defense and prove the charges wrong.</p>
<p id="MUcj9W">Spotify first made a complaint against Apple in 2019, with the European Commission opening an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073">investigation</a> in 2020.

  <p id="GpDBIf">One of 2022’s biggest games, <em>Elden Ring</em>, is getting what looks to be its first major expansion: DLC content titled <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. </p>
<p id="BjaNQG">Developer FromSoftware announced in a tweet this morning that the DLC was officially under development, though the company did not share when we might expect a release. </p>
<p id="GgpbCE">A <a href="https://www.eldenring.jp/newsdetail/news_detail_230228_1.html">short blog post</a> confirmed the DLC will be coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam. It also said a “follow-up report is still a little ahead” (translation from Japanese via Google) so we can hopefully expect more details sooner rather than later. </p>
<p id="S7OLKI"><em>Elden Ring</em> DLC is hotly-anticipated content for a number of reasons. <em>Elden Ring</em> has been a massive success, selling more than 20 million units worldwide, and FromSoftware...</p>

  <p id="61QOOU">Google has announced that Gmail’s client-side encryption mode is now generally available for businesses and educational organizations, after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/16/23513243/google-gmail-client-side-encryption-beta-enterprise">launched in beta last year</a>. The feature makes it so even Google itself can’t see the contents of the emails it’s hosting, with data being “encrypted before it reaches Google servers.” The company says this can be helpful for companies that have to meet strict compliance or privacy standards.</p>
<p id="qMDLyC">In a blog post on Tuesday, Google writes that client-side encryption for Gmail gives customers “sole control over their encryption keys — and thus complete control over all access to their data.” Users can encrypt emails they’re sending within their organization, as well as emails they’re sending to other...</p>

  <p id="yK61IQ">Aventon announced a new electric cargo bike, the Abound, which the California-based company describes as “an efficient alternative to driving a car around town.” With a 750-watt motor, a variety of accessories, and a total weight rating of 440 lbs, the Abound is designed to be a versatile, safe, and affordable mobility option for anyone looking to do less driving in their life. </p>
<p id="7t3lbs">Aventon is <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/14/aventon-level-2-review-commuter-electric-bike/">mostly known</a> for its fat-tired, adventure-themed road bikes, so a cargo bike was never a guaranteed addition to the company’s lineup. That said, Aventon brought a lot of the same attention to detail to the Abound as it did with previous models, which should help give the bike a bit of a leg-up compared to other low-cost models.</p>
