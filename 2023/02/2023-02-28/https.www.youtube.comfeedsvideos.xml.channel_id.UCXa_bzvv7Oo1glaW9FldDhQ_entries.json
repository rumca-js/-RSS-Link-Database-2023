This review covers the PS5 version of the game, and the frame rate seems to hold pretty steady even when things get hectic. I didn\u2019t notice any serious frame drops or stutters. I did, however, have the game completely crash in the intro sequence. It gave me a bad feeling so I was braced for more lost progress due to semi-frequent crashes, but I only ever saw that one. \n\nThere is a lot to like in Scars Above. If you can get past the issues with the character models and animations, there is a really fun, unique sci-fi shooter with an interesting story to experience.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20rz0CriC3I", "date_published": "2023-02-28 09:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
