The night before, a raging cyclone had traversed the east coast, thrashing the land, raising the rivers and cutting power. The flood would be described as eerie, silent, creeping; or a roar, or the sound of a busted water main, depending on where you lived in relation to the river that snakes through the settlement.</p><p>I live in the rural town of Te Wairoa in northern Hawkes Bay. The town is remote and nestled on a state highway along the east coast, between Napier to the south and Gisborne to the north, and enclosed by Te Urewera, a protected area, home to the Ngāi Tūhoe iwi. Wairoa is one of a handful of towns in the country where Māori comprise the bulk of the population: 62% of about 4,960 residents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/the-day-the-flood-came-watching-the-river-swallow-wairoa">Continue reading...</a>
