## The 25 Best Video Game Remakes

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4088432-bestremakes.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With an excellent remake of Dead Space now available and Resident Evil 4's remake on the horizon, now is a great time to look at the games that have set the gold standard for what a revisit to a beloved property should offer. While a remaster takes an existing game and spruces it up with crisper visuals, sound design--and if you're lucky--all of the premium DLC that accompanied the original release, a remake has a much bigger job to do. It has to recreate the appeal of the original game, modernize it, and still find a way to draw in a whole new generation of potential fans with its mix of classic and modern sensibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">The video game industry has a great track record when it comes to remakes, with the last decade alone being responsible for numerous fresh takes on fan-favorite properties. We've seen Square Enix chart a brave new direction for Final Fantasy VII with 2020's retina-searing Remake chapter and go back to the PSP past with a new take on Crisis Core; Capcom has raised the bar for remakes with its multiple returns to Raccoon City; and Nintendo is no stranger to compelling you to pay twice for the same game.</p><p dir="ltr">We've gathered up 25 of the best video game remakes below. Each one is a unique showcase of nostalgia, successfully reborn for a new age.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085711-crisiscore.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The return of Crisis Core in 2022 might have billed itself as a comprehensive remaster, but this excellent prequel to Final Fantasy VII leans much closer toward remake territory. Still retaining its PSP DNA, Crisis Core's Reunion build is visually on par with last-gen games and rebuilds its combat system to be more in line with the current Final Fantasy VII remake project. It's still the same game from 2007 that drained your PSP battery with its cleverly digestible design, but better than ever in a newer and shinier package that puts the spotlight back on Final Fantasy VII's underrated hero Zack Fair.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crisis-core-final-fantasy-7-reunion-review-conflict-resolved/1900-6418009/">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Core-Final-Fantasy-Reunion-PlayStation/dp/B0B5B2B2S1?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dead Space Remake</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4094277-deadspaceremake.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Was a remake of Dead Space necessary in 2023? That's up for debate, but after arriving in grand and gory style, EA Motive's return to the blood-soaked corridors of the USG Ishimura is <em>essential </em>gaming. Still able to jolt you awake with brilliant scare tactics and incredibly lavish set design, Dead Space Remake is a new gold standard for what a trip back in time should be. Thoughtful tweaks, welcome quality-of-life changes, and subtle twists make this reimagined classic more frightening than ever before and a strong contender for game of the year.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/">Dead Space Remake review</a></em>.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Space-Xbox-X/dp/B0BGW86RBN?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Demon's Souls</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085712-demon%27ssoulsps5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">A remake of one of From Software's most beloved games--and the blueprint for the studio's distinctive style--by another studio might sound like heresy, but developer Bluepoint delivered a faithful and technically impressive return to Boletaria. Not just a showcase for the impressive technology of the PS5, Bluepoint's stab at Demon's Souls is both respectful to the source material and full of moments where the studio finds its own voice. It looks like a million bucks, has consistently smooth performance, and it's a time capsule for Souls games that can easily hold its own against From Software's later entries.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/demons-souls-review-shield-up/1900-6417611/">Demon's Souls PS5 review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Destroy All Humans!</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085713-destroyallhumans.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the more memorable games of the PS2 era, this delightfully cheesy slice of alien invasion paranoia is still a blast to play. An interactive B-grade movie given an impressive makeover, Destroy All Humans is essentially a collection of small sandboxes in which you can cause havoc, while the more modern shooting mechanics and movement are a welcome upgrade. Even with some dodgy audio work--dulling a tremendous performance from Richard Horvitz, in which he essentially reprises his Invader Zim role--and some questionable stealth, Destroy All Humans is a cult-classic that's worth revisiting.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destroy-all-humans-review-two-arms-two-legs-and-an/1900-6417516/">Destroy All Humans review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Destroy-All-Humans-Nintendo-Switch-Standard/dp/B0924VVXGQ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy VII Remake</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085714-finalfantasyviiremake.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Many years in the making, Square Enix's return to Midgar is more than just a mere remake. With fan expectation at an all-time high, Final Fantasy VII Remake cleverly ducks the impossible comparisons to the original game and instead works to forge its own path forward, an ambitious new direction that will unfold across two more games. While plenty of familiar plot beats remain intact, the gorgeous presentation, gameplay that straddles the line between modern and classic RPG action, and wild swerves in the third act serve to make the return of Cloud Strife and the Avalanche group an exciting journey into mystery.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/">Final Fantasy VII Remake review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZS80PC2?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085715-fireemblemechoesshadowsofvalentia.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Ever since the release of Fire Emblem Awakening on the Nintendo 3DS, Fire Emblem fans have been feasting on the reborn franchise. With a storied history and a bunch of games to its name, the decision to remake one of the earliest games in the Fire Emblem series might have been an odd one, but it's a move that resulted in the excellent Shadows of Valentia hitting the scene. A combination of challenging tactical gameplay, user-controlled relationships, and a much more focused narrative, this chapter in the Fire Emblem Echoes series is a satisfyingly lengthy dive back into the past.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fire-emblem-echoes-shadows-of-valentia-review/1900-6416681/">Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Echoes-Valentia-Nintendo-Standard/dp/B01N12ES3A?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4088425-ghost%27s%27ngoblinsresurrection.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The original Ghosts 'n Goblins is an exercise in patience, as that arcade and home console classic is infamous for its high level of difficulty and unrelenting challenge. Fast-forward a few decades, and Capcom decided to bring back the brave knight Arthur for a revitalized run against titanic creatures that go bump in the night. While the difficulty and action was kept intact, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection uses the RE Engine to create a gorgeous new take on familiar landscape, letting the art design run rampant to create some of the most distinctive levels around. You'll want to appreciate the beauty of these stages, but with a merciless mob of monsters hunting you down constantly, you won't get that chance unless you flex some medieval might.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-review/1900-6417643/">Ghost's 'n Goblins Resurrection review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Ghosts-Goblins-Resurrection-Standard-Digital/dp/B08W5BBCMS?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Black Mesa</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085716-half-lifeblackmesa.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Black Mesa is a Half-Life remake born from a unique situation, one that may not ever be replicated in the gaming industry. A labor of love from Half-Life fans, Black Mesa didn't only get a nod of approval from Valve, it got permission from the digital distribution to be sold on its Steam platform as well. It's not hard to see why Valve was ready to give this fan project its blessing, as the project lovingly recreates Gordon Freeman's day from hell with improved visuals, welcome tweaks to the campaign, and a caring eye for small details.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Last of Us Part I</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085718-thelastofusparti.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With a big-budget HBO adaptation out in the wild, developer Naughty Dog decided to get the ball rolling on its beloved post-apocalypse franchise by returning to the original game and giving it a major uplift in 2022. While there aren't any major improvements to be found outside of the refreshed PS5-level graphics, The Last of Us Part I does offer a host of minor changes that add some major quality-of-life updates to the package. Bringing the first game up to the same standard as its critically acclaimed sequel, this version of The Last of Us is the definitive edition of the game that still delivers a one-two punch of emotional storytelling and gorgeous presentation.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/">The Last of Us Part I review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Last-Us-Part-PlayStation-5/dp/B0B3QWRQL8?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Link‚Äôs Awakening</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085719-legendofzeldalink%E2%80%99sawakening.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Link's Awakening already received a re-release on Game Boy Color, but in 2019, Nintendo made certain that its fanbase had no excuses to miss out on this cult-classic adventure starring the hero in green. As expected, the visuals are quite a few notches above the pair of Game Boy titles; Koholint Island has a few new collectibles to discover; and there's a toyetic energy to the package. Link's Awakening still remains incredibly faithful to the original game, balancing on a tightrope between new-school visuals and old-school gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening/">The Legend of Zelda: Link‚Äôs Awakening review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Links-Awakening-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SG15148?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085720-legendofzeldaocarina.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Few games have created a seismic shift in the industry like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but decades later, the magic of that evergreen classic was reinvigorated on the Nintendo 3DS. Taking the N64 original and reimagining with a 3D upgrade and the challenging Master Quest difficulty mode, the 3DS version adds just the right amount of extra content to an already phenomenal game. If you haven't played it yet and you can get your hands on a 3DS, consider this to be the definitive version of Ocarina of Time.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d-review/1900-6320103/">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Ocarina-Time-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B003O6E800?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Live A Live</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085721-livealive.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Almost three decades ago, Live A Live earned itself an audience of diehard fans and a permanent place on any feature discussing the best JRPGs of all time. Criminally overlooked--in part because it was only released in Japan--Live A Live was way ahead of the curve and finally got a chance to flex its muscles in 2022 with a grand remake. Imagine a game with several main characters, dozens of hours of story, and a timeless feel to its design, and then combine that with effortlessly charming visuals and a superb soundtrack. That right there makes for a terrific game, and a remake that's ready to stand the test of time once again as it cultivates a new audience.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/live-a-live-review-live-laugh-love-live-a-live/1900-6417919/">Live A Live review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://howl.me/ci9AvGpmcYf?u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mafia: Definitive Edition</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085724-mafiadefinitiveedition.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">For anyone who feels that sandbox games are simply far too bloated in the modern age, Mafia: Definitive Edition feels like a welcome return to simpler times. It still has its share of collectibles to uncover, but they play second fiddle to a game that still has a cleverly constructed story, vibrant locations to explore at the turn of the 20th century, and impressive facial capture technology. While it still has some dated gameplay mechanics, they aren't enough to distract from a thrilling descent into the world of organized crime and mayhem.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-definitive-edition-review-an-offer-you-could-probably-refuse/1900-6417570/">Mafia: Definitive Edition review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Mafia-Definitive-PlayStation-4/dp/B088MX9L66?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085726-metalgearsolidthetwinsnakes.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the more divisive entries in the Metal Gear franchise, GameCube-exclusive Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is still a fascinating remake of a PlayStation blockbuster that makes interesting detours from the original game. It has a more action-packed flair for the cinematic and the first-person view for shooting inherited from Metal Gear Solid 2 makes a big difference, while re-recorded audio and improved AI makes this remake a gem of a bygone era of Nintendo gaming.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes-review/1900-6090958/">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes review</a>.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metroid: Samus Returns</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4100988-metroidsamusreturns.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Metroid II: The Return of Samus is one of the more underrated entries in the Nintendo series, but as time has proven, it's a masterpiece of design and gameplay. Breaking free of its monochromatic prison on the Game Boy, Mercury Steam's remake of the game is an outstanding return to 2D form, a riveting adventure that has the DNA of more modern Metroid experiences mixed in with classic action, exploration, and cleverly designed levels. One of the best Metroid games of all time feels even better in this remake, and even if nostalgia isn't a driving factor for you, the aggressive gameplay and fiendish puzzles make it an essential part of any 3DS library. Meanwhile, the original Game Boy version is currently available in the Nintendo Switch Online library.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-samus-returns-review/1900-6416751/">Metroid: Samus Returns review</a></em>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metroid Zero Mission</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085730-metroidzeromission.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">If you needed to describe Metroid Zero Mission in one word, it'd be "comprehensive". Originally popping up on the Game Boy Advance and later on Nintendo's Wii U eShop, Metroid Zero Mission is a stunning overhaul of the original NES Metroid. It's overstuffed with new ideas, levels, and power-ups, creating a Metroid buffet that you can gorge yourself on. It has the action, atmosphere, and unrelenting challenge of the original game in its digital DNA, and decades later, it's still one of the best Metroid experiences that you can dive into. Hopefully Nintendo adds it to the Nintendo Switch Online GBA catalog.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-zero-mission-review/1900-6087505/">Metroid Zero Mission review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085731-oddworldnew%27n%27tasty%21.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When a remake is crafted with pure love and passion for the original game, it shows in the final product. Oddworld: Abe's Odysee - New 'n' Tasty is a prime example of this approach, a delicious second course of cunning platforming and devious puzzle-solving set on a grim alien world that's both imaginative in design and an advert for considering a vegan lifestyle. Almost identical to its source material but clever enough to know when to take a detour, Abe's adventure felt better than ever in this loving tribute to the PS1 original.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review/1900-6415825/">Oddworld: Abe's Odysee - New 'n' Tasty review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Oddworld-New-Tasty-NSW-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B08FV5JV5J?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085733-pokemonheartgold.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There's been no shortage of Pokemon remakes over the years, but if you had to pick the best of the new bunch, Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver wins that race easily. After all, these are the best Pokemon games of all time. Released on the Nintendo DS--and with a novel PokeWalker accessory to boot--the remakes of Pokemon Gold and Silver are still the best pocket monster games that you can play more than a decade later. They've got charming pixel art, plenty of new elements, and enough gotta catch 'em all energy to power Ecruteak City for a few lifetimes. It's a shame these games, like many older Pokemon cartridges, go for ridiculous prices from resellers these days.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-heartgold-review/1900-6257800/">Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085732-pokemonlet%27sgopikachu.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time that the original mainline Pokemon games have gotten a remake--FireRed and LeafGreen are beloved Game Boy Advance titles for a reason--but Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee is easily Pokemon at its most approachable. Structurally similar to the original games, Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee makes a few bold changes with its new catching mechanics and lack of HMs. These ideas help make a vibrant world stand out even more, and with each Pokemon looking better than ever thanks to the Switch hardware, these changes make an iconic journey well-worth taking again.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-lets-go-eevee-review/1900-6417036/">Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Lets-Go-Eevee-Switch/dp/B01N7RE3HB?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4100987-rc2016.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The original Ratchet &amp; Clank was a turning point for PlayStation when it first arrived in 2002, a game that helped spearhead a new franchise of action-platformers while establishing an iconic duo. Fast-forward to 2016, and the return of Ratchet &amp; Clank resulted in a rejuvenated blast from the past. The changes made to the debut adventure were rather significant compared to a lot of the games on this list, and included: significant narrative differences, revised story arcs of key characters, new characters, and reworked environments. Even with these major differences, Ratchet &amp; Clank retained the heart and charm of the original. The arsenal of wacky guns were more fun to use than ever before thanks to updated controls, gorgeous visuals, fluid animations, and breathtaking effects. It remains an endearing return to a classic franchise, and it helped reintroduce the franchise to a whole new audience at the time.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ratchet-and-clank-review/1900-6416403/">Ratchet &amp; Clank review</a></em>.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Ratchet-Clank-Hits-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DNN5X3M?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4085734-residentevil2remake.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">After Resident Evil 7 put the franchise back on track, Capcom looked to the past to chart the future of its zombified series. Using bleeding edge graphics from the RE engine, Resident Evil 2 rose from its grave and got a new lease on life. It's a gory masterpiece of tension, action, and perfectly executed chills in the heart of Raccoon City. An expanded story, fascinating easter eggs, and challenging gameplay makes this the gold standard for survival-horror remakes.

Shadow of the Colossus is one such game, and years later, developer Bluepoint Games brought its haunting beauty back to life and ready for a new audience.

A game of hard-fought victories and brutal opposition, Firaxis' reboot adds a layer of tension between each turn that is palpable, a complex war economy to invest in, and several opportunities to make decisions with haunting ramifications.

Chronicling the fall and rise of the unstoppable Kazuma Kiryu, the Kiwami games are straightforward recreations of the originals that make dozens of tweaks to their core structures. Beyond these thoughtful changes, they're both the fantastic action games that kickstarted a new franchise for Sega, and contain all the heart, absurdity, and bone-crunching brutality of these cult-classics.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yakuza-kiwami-review-back-in-action/1900-6416738/">Yakuza Kiwami review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Kiwami-PlayStation-Hits-4/dp/B06Y5YYCQW?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4578|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />

<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has left so many threads dangling in the past several years--remember that giant hand that emerged from the Earth in Eternals? Nobody in the MCU does, apparently. No recent cliffhanger has been bigger than that at the end of Loki Season 1. We knew at the time that what happened would lead to the next big overall big bad of the MCU, but we've had little sense for what it meant in the present.</p><p dir="ltr">But now, six movies and five seasons of TV later, the MCU has followed up on that cliffhanger for the first time in Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania. It's kind of an indirect follow-up, but it's enough that we can make some pretty confident inferences.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania, as well as Loki Season 1. It also features speculation about Loki Season 2.</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-tells-us-about-loki-season-2/1100-6511652/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Hogwarts Legacy Review - Sleight Of Hand

<div><p><i>Hogwarts Legacy is developed by Avalanche Software, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game has been embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/">how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community</a>. In this article, you will also find links to trans creators you can support, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-help-trans-people-by-donating-to-charity/1100-6511097/">charities you can donate to</a>.</i></p></div><p dir="ltr">It's difficult to find someone oblivious to the world of Harry Potter. For many it was a property that grew up with them, with both the book and film series persisting in the zeitgeist for decades. It's confusing then that it's taken this long to get a game that promises to deliver on the fantasy of becoming a wizard or witch within that universe; attending classes, learning spells, engaging in mischief, and exploring the grandeur of Hogwarts Castle. Hogwarts Legacy delivers on that promise, to a degree. Its adaptation of this universe is undeniably the most extensive yet, allowing you to truly explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas like never before. But it's also stuck too keenly in the present (and sometimes, past) of open-world game design, reducing much of what you do to repetitive checklist activities in a world that is disappointingly barren.</p><p dir="ltr">Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the late 1800s, although you might be hard-pressed to notice that from the way characters speak or by the clothes they wear, which look ripped straight out of the films set in the late 1900s. You play as a prodigal witch or wizard of your own creation, this time fighting against a goblin uprising led by one particularly nasty one named Ranrok. This props up a predictable and surprisingly sporadic narrative, with main beats and progression only taking place every few hours as you complete the requisite quests around them, which are often barely related. There's so little screen time for many of the main characters that you struggle to get a sense of their motives, especially so in the case of Ranrok, who only appears to deliver a line or two to some subordinates before he disappears for a couple of hours. It robs him, and the story, of any sense of emotional tension, reducing it to nothing more than "talented good student takes out bad powerful goblin" by the end.</p><p dir="ltr">While trying to stop a potentially cataclysmic uprising, you'll also be required to juggle the duties that come with being a newly inducted fifth-year at Hogwarts. Being both a new and older student means you get to enjoy the thrills of learning some familiar spells from earlier years, but also have access to a wide range of more advanced ones as the year progresses. The initial introduction to each class is captivating, from partaking in duels in Defence Against the Dark Arts or being subjected to a screaming Mandrake in Herbology. These are some of the moments where Hogwarts Legacy is at its strongest, recapturing the sense of wonder that has made this world so enticing to so many. The mechanical components of each class, however, fall woefully short. The small minigame used to convey wand movements for each spell feels ripped out of the series' very first video game entry nearly two decades ago, while many of the activities introduced shortly after are brief, uninteresting, and usually used as a means to fill your map with many more instances of the same thing. They quickly extinguish any glimmers of hope that the school aspect to your time at Hogwarts will be as engaging as many of these classes might seem from the outside.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

But once you really get to know Apex's newest gun, you'll soon find that Nemesis makes an excellent sidekick. Perfect for those desperate moments when your whole squad is knocked and you're facing two enemies alone, Nemesis' ability to deal devastating damage in a short amount of time makes it ideal for facing enemies when the odds are stacked against you. But a beast as powerful as Nemesis can only reach its full potential when tamed, and the weapon can initially be a bit hard to control.

Unlike the L-STAR, overheating Nemesis will actually improve the weapon's performance. The longer you fire the weapon, the more it warms up, firing more rapidly as it reaches its peak firing speed. Nemesis begins to cool down once your finger is off its trigger, but the cooldown isn't instant, so pulling the trigger regularly will ensure the weapon is at its peak rate of fire when in use.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-nemesis-weapon-guide/1100-6511169/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The latest Genshin Impact update brings two new characters, Dehya and Mika, and sees the return of the Windblume Festival.</p><p>Dehya is a five-star Pyro Claymore user. She has been a long-time cast member, active throughout the Sumeru storyline. Dehya can place Fiery Sanctum fields causing AoE Pyro damage when enemies take damage. She also mitigates damage for other characters in the party, taking it on herself. Activating her elemental burst will see her enter a Blazing Lioness state where she can deal extra fire damage with her fists.</p><p>Mika is a four-star Cryo Polearm user. He also wields a crossbow and thereby can attack enemies at range. Other party members will benefit from an increased attack weapon when around Mika. His elemental skill will also give other party members higher physical damage. His elemental burst heals other party members and grants the Eagleplume state, which enables party members to gain health from performing normal attacks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-version-3-5-adds-two-new-playable-characters-and-a-variety-of-events/1100-6511650/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/">Diablo III</a> Season 28 is coming on February 24, and it will forever change how Blizzard's critically-acclaimed ARPG is played thanks to a new account-wide progression system.</p><p dir="ltr">As previously detailed by Blizzard, the star of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-3-season-28-will-introduce-an-all-new-meta-progression-system/1100-6510938/">Season 28 is the Altar of Rites</a>, an account-wide progression system that will allow players to unlock some seriously game-changing perks and legendary potions for the entirety of the season across all characters. These perks are unlocked via a talent tree where each subsequent perk requires increasingly rare items and materials to be sacrificed at the Altar of Rites.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Uncover The Rites of Sanctuary in Diablo III Season 28. <br />Coming soon.<br />Learn More: <a href="https://t.co/TC1CbhzRfW">https://t.co/TC1CbhzRfW</a> <a href="https://t.co/oTqRPK18Nz">pic.twitter.com/oTqRPK18Nz</a></p>  ‚Äî Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1626657750326337565?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">February 17, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">These perks aren't just simple stat boosts. They can range from items no longer having level requirements to huge flat damage or movement speed bonuses. There's even a perk that makes it so pets can pick up and salvage items, Torchlight-style. Unlocking all 26 perks and three legendary potions via the Altar of Rites will reward players with the Wings of Terror cosmetic, letting them sport the look of the Lord of Terror himself.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-3-game-changing-season-28-begins-february-24/1100-6511651/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## What Super Nintendo World Is Like--And How Miyamoto Helped Build It

<p dir="ltr">It's strange to think that there are still new frontiers of achievement available for a person with a career as illustrious as Shigeru Miyamoto. At this point, he and his Nintendo cohorts have shaped entertainment and pop culture around their barrel-rolling apes and pipe-hopping plumbers in a way that has stood the test of time. Its games have been cultural touchstones for multiple generations of people.</p><p dir="ltr">But, somehow, Nintendo and Miyamoto's successes continue to reach new heights. Walking through Super Nintendo World, an area of the Universal Studios' Hollywood park that has been modeled to look like the Mushroom Kingdom, is surreal. It feels like the world we've hopped, skipped, jumped, and butt-stomped through but captured in a bottle for people to explore. And when you're standing in a real place that looks like a virtual world you've formed such an intense attachment to, it's difficult not to be caught up in the wonder of it all.</p><p dir="ltr">Doubly so when you spot all the little details of the Mushroom Kingdom, lovingly brought to life and carefully placed so that, no matter where your sightline is, there's something that will delight. Being in Nintendo World activated instincts that I've honed through years of playing Mario games as almost involuntary responses. I watched a Koopa Trooper shuffling along a grassy platform and immediately began judging what the best distance to launch onto its head would be. As I scanned the giant green pipes and yellow coin blocks, my eyes were pulled away from the life-sized Mario and Luigi snapping selfies and towards a distant 1UP mushroom, and I thought to myself, how do I get up to that?</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-super-nintendo-world-is-like-and-how-miyamoto-helped-build-it/1100-6511647/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin/">Like A Dragon: Ishin</a> takes the Yakuza formula and places it in the 1860s, where a revolution is happening in Japan. The game has plenty of equipment and items that you have to manage and if you picked up the deluxe version of the game or preordered it, you might have some DLC items that you want to use in-game. Unfortunately, if you want to use any of your DLC items, you will need to track down Bakumatsu Bob, the clown samurai. Here's where and how you can claim your DLC items in Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find Bob</h2><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4100758-mapforbob.png"><img alt="Bob can be found in Teradaya, which is located in the southern part of Fushimi." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4100758-mapforbob.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Bob can be found in Teradaya, which is located in the southern part of Fushimi.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Bob can be found in a backroom in <strong>Teradaya</strong>, where Sakamoto Ryoma lives in Kyo. When you enter the building head straight to the back right area of the building, where Bob can be found. Speak to him and you can claim your DLC packs and items. During this process, you must claim a single item, save the game, and repeat, for as many DLC items as you have to collect.</p><p>If you are looking to collect any bonus trooper cards, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-ishin-features-kenny-omega-and-rahul-kohli-as-powerful-summons/1100-6510878/">special guest trooper cards featuring Kenny Omega and Rahul Kohli</a>, you have to wait until Chapter 5 to pick up these DLC packs. The reason for this is you don't get access to the trooper card system until Chapter 5, at which point you can claim the extra cards and add them to your collection.</p>

## Like A Dragon: Ishin Combat Guide: Skills And Fighting Styles Explained

<p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin/">Like A Dragon: Ishin</a> forgoes the usual setting of the Yakuza series, it does share the majority of its DNA with those games. In particular, it borrows from Yakuza 0, including its four fighting-style system, which allows you to switch between four distinct methods of fighting on the fly. While this allows a ton of flexibility in the way you approach combat, it also means you need to understand and balance four skill trees, along with relevant equipment and items. Here's everything you need to know about combat in Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The four styles of combat</h2><p dir="ltr">Like A Dragon: Ishin features four styles of combat: Brawler, Swordsman, Gunman, and Wild Dancer. The Brawler style focuses on unarmed hand-to-hand combat, while Gunman and Swordsman focus on the single weapon featured in their name. Lastly, Wild Dancer combines the use of a sword and a gun, creating a hybrid style of fighting. As for which of these fighting styles you should use, the combat in Like A Dragon: Ishin allows you enough flexibility that it primarily comes down to personal preference, although you will want to try and balance out your usage of each class. The reason for that is that <strong>XP and skill points are earned mostly on an individual basis for each class.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">The four skill trees</h2><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4101178-skilltree.png"><img alt="Each fighting style has its own skill tree and its own level." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4101178-skilltree.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Each fighting style has its own skill tree and its own level.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Each fighting style has its own skill tree and its own skill points in the form of orbs. There is a fifth type of orb called the training orb, which is awarded as you level up overall. Each orb type can only be used in its specific skill tree, while the training orb can be used in any skill tree, letting you either over-level your preferred class or keep another up to speed. <strong>Training orbs can be swapped with class orbs from their skill slot</strong>, so feel free to use them early on. The reverse is not true, so any class orbs spent cannot be swapped out with training orbs. While most skills can be obtained as soon as you reach them in the tree, there are a few locked skills and paths in each class tree.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-ishin-combat-guide-skills-and-fighting-styles-explained/1100-6511644/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Blizzard developers who attended a recent virtual town hall meeting are outraged following comments made by Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, whose defense of controversial and unpopular policies like stack ranking and a return to office mandate has reportedly dealt a serious blow to morale at the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/culture/q-a-with-blizzard-leadership-on-return-to-office-bonuses-leaves-devs-fuming">Game Developer</a>, a recent company-wide Q&amp;A session where Ybarra answered pre-selected questions left employees reeling. Ybarra reportedly downplayed the news that employees would only be receiving 58% of their usual profit-sharing bonus, despite the last quarter being a record-setting one for Blizzard that saw the company's "highest quarterly net bookings to date," according to Activision Blizzard's fourth quarter <a href="https://investor.activision.com/node/35836/pdf">earnings report</a>. Ybarra reportedly suggested executives were not making substantially more than rank-and-file employees, a statement that did not go over well.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked how company leadership planned to retain talent once employees are forced to return to the office for at least three days of the week starting in July, Ybarra reportedly didn't have any such plan. Instead, he simply said that at the end of the day, people need to do what makes them happy, and if the company's goals and an employee's personal goals don't align, that employee needs to "do what will make [them] happy." Many employees saw his statement as encouraging people unhappy with Blizzard's return to office mandate to simply quit the company.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-company-wide-meeting-reportedly-made-employees-feel-extremely-unimportant-and-unsupported/1100-6511643/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

A new entry into the world of Souls-likes, Bleak Faith will have a combat system inspired by the Souls series we've all come to expect from the genre, but notably its class and perk systems are inspired by the Dragon Age series.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In the game, you explore an "unrelenting, interconnected world inhabited by fierce creatures and astonishing bosses," called the Omnistructure.

A spin-off from the mainline series that's set in 1860s Kyoto, Ishin has plenty of familiar faces, an original storyline focused on revenge, and combat that blends samurai action with the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-ishin-features-kenny-omega-and-rahul-kohli-as-powerful-summons/1100-6510878/">summon a former AEW champion</a> to give you a boost in battle.</p><p>Reviews for the game are now live ahead of its February 18 launch, and as expected, Ishin is full of the melodrama, absurd violence, and weird diversions that developer RGG Studio is known for. While the game has received a substantial upgrade to its visuals when compared to the PS3 original, several aspects of its design are still archaic according to critics, some of whom say it feels dated when compared to later games in the franchise.</p><p>"Take the faces, voices, and over-the-top theatrics that have made the Yakuza franchise renowned, and transport all that back to 19th century Japan," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/">Like a Dragon: Ishin review</a>. "Even though the context has changed, swapping the gangs of the modern criminal underworld for political factions in a tumultuous time in history, Ishin is yet another example of what developer RGG Studio does best: melodramatic storytelling."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-like-a-dragon-ishin/1100-6511636/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A VFX artist has created a fake trailer for Netflix's The Witcher season 4, which replaces Henry Cavill's Geralt of Rivia with his soon-to-be replacement, Liam Hemsworth.</p><p>The deepfake video was created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@stryderHD/about">Matthew Anthony</a>--via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-deepfake-replaces-henry-cavill-with-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt">Eurogamer</a>--and gives fans of the series a look at what Hemsworth could look like as the Butcher of Blavikin instead of Cavill, who has played the character for two seasons and a third yet to arrive. The two-minute deepfake depicts the actor's face digitally imposed over Cavill's in a variety of scenes taken from the Netflix series. For example, moments where he's simply talking and interacting with characters such as Jaskier and Ciri.</p><div>          </div><p>However, scenes with complicated fight scenes performed by Cavill are not featured in the deepfake, so fans won't know what Hemsworth could look like wielding a sword until season 4 eventually drops.

## Like A Dragon: Ishin Review - Rewriting History

<p dir="ltr">Take the faces, voices, and over-the-top theatrics that have made the Yakuza franchise renowned, and transport all that back to 19th century Japan. The result is Like A Dragon: Ishin, an enticing period piece that also includes the series' action-brawler gameplay and ridiculous hijinx. Even though the context has changed, swapping the gangs of the modern criminal underworld for political factions in a tumultuous time in history, Ishin is yet another example of what developer RGG Studio does best: melodramatic storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been a long time coming as Yakuza: Ishin, originally a PS3/PS4 game from 2014, was not previously localized and brought to the West like other entries in the franchise. This new version lands somewhere between a remaster and remake, but it is based on older iterations of Yakuza games which makes Like A Dragon: Ishin feel dated in several respects, particularly in moment-to-moment gameplay. Still, its fundamentals are solid and the main draws of the franchise remain intact, hooking me with its characters and twists that had me eager to see its historical fiction unfold from chapter to chapter.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of the glitz and glam of Kamurocho, Ishin takes us to late-Edo period Japan, around the time of the end of the samurai class and just before the country's modernization. In the same way previous Yakuza games offer a sort of virtual tourism, Ishin's vivid reconstruction of Japan's past (albeit with more creative liberties) delivers the same thrills. The streets are filled with menacing men wanting to cut you down as you mind your business strolling through the markets, restaurants and bars represent the era's cuisine, and tons of side content reflect the culture and traditions of the time. While it may not be as dazzling as the neon-lit streets of the modern day, the more low-key setting of Kyo (which is now modern-day Kyoto) is refreshing and a welcome change of pace that lets the Yakuza formula thrive once again within a framework it is comfortable with.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-ishin-review-rewriting-history/1900-6418031/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>2023 has seen mass layoffs in tech and gaming sectors, but over at Sega, the house of Sonic has announced a 30% salary increase for employees, beginning in July. Sega says that the increase is part of its strategy to "invest in human resources" so that it can create a more comfortable working environment.</p><p>"We will continue our efforts to realize a system that allows our employees to grow while realizing diverse work styles, and to provide further experiences that move the heart globally," <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pdf/release/20230217_soj_compensation_e.pdf">Sega said</a> in a statement. According to the game publisher and developer, this increase will see starting monthly salaries rise 35% in total from $1,634 to $2,228. On an annual salary basis, the average increase rate will work out to a 15% increase across the company, Sega added.</p><p>This announcement comes shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-pay-its-workers-10-more/1100-6511268/">Nintendo confirmed that it will pay its workers 10% more</a>, as Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida urged companies to increase salaries to offset the rising cost of living due to inflation. Sega's ability to offer a hefty salary increase comes in the wake of its latest big-budget game, Sonic Frontiers, exceeding the company's expectations.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-is-giving-its-employees-significant-raises/1100-6511624/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>For the second time this week, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has increased its stake in Nintendo and has become its largest outside shareholder. The sovereign wealth fund, through its Savvy Games Group division, had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-6-of-nintendo/1100-6510503/">originally owned just over 6% of the video game company</a> when the year began, but it now has an 8.26% investment in Nintendo.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-17/saudi-arabia-becomes-largest-outside-shareholder-of-nintendo">Bloomberg</a>, this puts Savvy ahead of Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund but behind Nintendo, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/stock/information/index.html">which has a 10.35% holding of shares</a> in itself as of September 2022. "I think PIF is not even done and wouldn't be surprised if it continues to increase its stake in Nintendo going forward," industry consultant Serkan Toto said to Bloomberg.</p><p>Saudi Arabia under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has made a concerted effort recently to invest in the video game industry, and with a $38 billion budget earmarked for Savvy, it has been on a major spending spree.

However, the executive told The Verge that the company "will adjust our style to the E3 way as we can."

## Destiny 2: Lightfall Will Let You Pay To Skip The Campaign

<p>One of the ways that Bungie keeps its lights on while developing Destiny 2, which has a free-to-play model mixed in with premium add-on content, is through the use of Character Boosts. Currently, you can spend 100 Silver to gain a rank on the season pass track and unlock rewards, but with Lightfall, there'll be a few extra options available.</p><p>Starting with this year's expansion, players will see one of two types of boosts on their character screen depending on their progress. The Lightfall Character Boost appears when you hit the soft Power cap with a character but haven't completed the campaign yet, and provides the selected character with a set of high Power level gear. This won't allow you to skip the campaign <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twab-02-16-2023">according to Bungie</a>, but the second option will let you pay to fast-forward through the new narrative content.</p><p>As its title implies, the Lightfall Campaign Skip Boost appears after you complete the Lightfall campaign and allows you to skip the new storyline with a selected character. If you select this option, you'll gain a set of high Power level gear if your main character has hit the Soft Cap and unlocks the new Strand abilities for that Guardian. It's worth noting that paying for a boost means that you'll lose out on any items or gear that you would have normally picked up during the course of the campaign, and skipping it doesn't count as having completed Legendary mode or any of the post-campaign missions, leaving the associated Triumphs unfulfilled.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-will-let-you-pay-to-skip-the-campaign/1100-6511619/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Ant-Man movies haven't been the box office juggernauts that many of the other movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have, but Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania nonetheless has quite a weight on its shoulders. The little series that could is kicking off the MCU's newest phase and announces the arrival of a new main villain for the entire franchise: Kang the Conqueror.</p><p><em><strong>Warning: The following contains Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie and wish to remain unspoiled, stop reading now.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">That being the case, Quantumania doesn't quite take the standard Marvel approach with its mid-credits and post-credits scenes. Typically, one of these scenes (the mid-credits) will be some sort of tease for the future, while the other is more of a funny gag. In Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp, for example, the mid-credits scene showed Scott Lang getting trapped in the Quantum Realm while his family was snapped by Thanos, and the post-credits scene was a jokey clip of a giant ant playing drums.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-post-credits-scenes-explained/1100-6511616/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
