One of the latest exposés was at Anchorage School District in <a href="https://midmichigannow.com/news/nation-world/this-is-for-kids-father-cut-off-from-reading-sexually-explicit-library-book-to-alaskan-school-board-jay-mcdonald-anchorage-alaska" target="_blank">Alaska</a>. </p><p>Jay McDonald attended last week's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-him-book" target="_blank">school board</a> meeting and read a passage from "Let's Talk About It: The Teen's Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human." The book is a graphic novel criticized for its sexually explicit imagery and commentary. It was recently pulled from Florida school libraries. </p><p>McDonald starts speaking at around 1:05:00 in the video below. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p><br /></p><p>McDonald read a portion of the book dedicated to "sexting," which gave teens tips on sending nude photos. Because what else could you want from a school library?</p><p><em>"Don’t forget to crop out your face, hide your birthmarks and scars, and edit out your piercings and tattoos, and don't forget to tell your sweetie how hot they look. Let them know you appreciate the little gift they've sent you."</em></p><p>McDonald then stopped to remind the board that the book was for kids. But he was quickly interrupted by board vice president Carl Jacobs, who asked him to stop reading and defer his complaints to the Superintendent. Some members disagreed since McDonald hadn't violated any rules. The matter was put to a vote, and the board voted for McDonald to stop reading. </p><p>This isn't the first time a school board has become uncomfortable with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-filthy-book" target="_blank">pornographic books from school libraries.</a> It's insane that, though adults can't stand to hear even a portion of these books themselves, they vote to keep them in the libraries and allow <em>children</em> to read them. </p><p>McDonald has since withdrawn his children from the school district and will homeschool them for the foreseeable future. Which might soon be the way for any American family hoping to preserve their children's innocence. </p>

She was trying to convince the defendant to appear in her documentary. The defendant had permission to record her and ultimately declined to be in the film. </p><p>At one point during the meeting, Pelosi said the famed QAnon Shaman was innocent: <em>"The Shaman did noth(ing)..What did the Shaman do?

## Nikki Haley attacks Ron DeSantis over "Don't Say Gay," but does so from the right

Not lame name-calling or low-energy memes. Or people like Stephen Colbert and George Soros who know how easily manipulated certain politicians are. Nikki Haley (who is running for president) took a shot at Ron DeSantis (who is rumored to be running) over his "Parental Choice in Education" bill. Unlike <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/larry-hogan-ron-desantis" target="_blank">whatshisface from Maryland who just wanted to get on CNN</a>, Haley attacked DeSantis on the right.</p><p>Florida's "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=don%27t+say+gay" target="_blank">Parental Choice in Education Bill</a>" says that there would no longer be any sexual instruction in grades pre-K thru 3. Critics say it was literally fascism and claimed the bill prevented teachers from saying "gay." Haley came out and said the bill doesn't go FAR ENOUGH (shout out to <a href="https://www.bizpacreview.com/2023/02/17/nikki-haley-takes-shot-at-ron-desantis-and-florida-parental-rights-law-1333659/" target="_blank">BizPacReview</a>).</p><p>"There was all this talk about the Florida bill — the ‘don’t say gay bill.’ Basically what it said was you shouldn’t be able to talk about gender before third grade. I’m sorry. I don’t think that goes far enough. [...] When I was in school you didn’t have sex ed until 7th grade. And even then, your parents had to sign whether you could take the class. That’s a decision for parents to make."</p><p>A solid hit, and she's right. Fourth grade is still too early. It was fine for the debate in 2022. Leftists were in meltdown over being told they couldn't sexualize <em>any</em> child. Pointing out how fourth grade was a cut-off helped illustrate how gross the left is. And DeSantis won the debate handily. </p><p>But everything resets now. The debate going into the primary, as we're looking at NATIONAL policies, is over why third/fourth grade is the cut-off. Kids ten and eleven years STILL shouldn't have an activist teacher pushing their radical gender and sexual ideologies on them. </p><p>Solid criticism by Nikki Haley. As a DeSantis supporter, I'd be curious to hear his response.</p><p><p>

"Controversial" in the "slay queen vs ewww gross" aspect. Add one more to the "eww gross" column. WWE Hall of Famer Bill Goldberg.</p><p>Goldberg revealed on his "CarCast" podcast he was not a fan of the performance.  In fact, he was disgusted by it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><blockquote>I thought Rihanna was frickin horrible. I mean, I was disgusted by it. That’s all. Let’s just say that. I thought it was horrible. I thought it was disgusting. I thought it was horrible.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>As LwC's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=wwe" target="_blank">resident wrestling nerd</a>, I would be ill-serving the reader if I didn't use this as an opportunity to share the greatest Bill Goldberg-related clip of all time: Big E discussing Goldberg as his dream opponent.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">New Day Podcast, Big E's dream opponent being Goldberg <a href="https://t.co/AgCJv1c1at">pic.twitter.com/AgCJv1c1at</a><br />— Divine (@Divinemind91) <a href="https://twitter.com/Divinemind91/status/1518697845196476417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Or point out how wrestling Twitter was quick to criticize a performance themselves.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Goldberg: “I’m disgusted by Rihanna’s performance”<br /><br />also Goldberg: <a href="https://t.co/TjIcFJ9Iew">pic.twitter.com/TjIcFJ9Iew</a><br />— NHATional Scissoring Day ✂️ (@nhathaniel_h) <a href="https://twitter.com/nhathaniel_h/status/1626363408214855680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Goldberg's biggest issue with Rhianna was the crotch-grabbing and hand-sniffing. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rihanna-super-bowl-halftime" target="_blank">As reported on LwC</a>, let's set aside her backup dancers looking like dystopian doctors in hazmat suits coming to arrest you for playing catch with your daughter in 2020. Rihanna appeared to grab her crotch, then sniff her hand. Because of course she did.</p><p>She also grabbed her butt for some reason. Which is apparently supposed to "trigger" far-right viewers, but personally, we were just left confused.</p><p>Personally, like most Super Bowl half-time shows, I didn't find the performance worth having a strong opinion about either way. Rihanna rushed through her hits, and lip-synced most of it. It wasn't Prince playing "Purple Rain" in the rain, nor was it Janet Jackson's titty popping out. </p><p><p>

## ‘We want to be heard’: Parents demand school board do something about our favorite ginormous fake-knocker'd shop teacher

Halton is home to Oakville Trafalgar High School, which is home to beautiful and brave trans teacher -- and 2022 Louder with Crowder Dot Com Woman of the Year -- Kayla Lemieux. Parents demand their voices be heard about what they call Lemieux's questionable fashion sense.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I don't remember my shop teacher looking like this🧵 <a href="https://t.co/pHHr58Zspa">pic.twitter.com/pHHr58Zspa</a><br />— Royce Lopez (@hippojuicefilm) <a href="https://twitter.com/hippojuicefilm/status/1570173548571893761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Parents want the school to develop a "professionalism policy," which the school board says they are unable to do over a teachers' union dispute. Until the new union contract is rectified, the school board is unable to implement any new policies. They are also unable to create a dress code policy for staff -- had Lemieux been a student, how they/them dress would be inappropriate -- over what is called "equity and human rights issues."</p><p>A lawyer representing a group of parents claim the school board's "decisions should be guided by a concern for our children." A parent told the school board, “You cannot prevent parents from issuing feedback or recommendations with respect to their own children." They must both be new here.</p><p>This is all as reported by <a href="https://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ts/news/gta/2023/02/15/we-want-to-be-heard-halton-parents-voice-frustrations-as-board-grapples-with-teacher-dress-code.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Peterborough Examiner</a>, which adds the need for a professionalism policy "surfaced after a shop teacher last fall showed up at Oakville Trafalgar High School wearing sheer tight shirts on top of large fake breasts with protruding nipples — photos of which went viral, garnering international headlines."</p><p>On behalf of international headlines, guilty!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-suspension" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Students threatened with suspension, forbidden from taking any more photos of Kayla Lemieux">Students threatened with suspension, forbidden from taking any more photos of Kayla Lemieux</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canadian-teacher-poolside" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Shop teacher Kayla Lemieux with those enormous fake knockers debuts their new poolside look">Shop teacher Kayla Lemieux with those enormous fake knockers debuts their new poolside look</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-dance-recital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Trans teacher with ginormous fake breasts sneaks into children's dance recital, asked to leave by parents">Trans teacher with ginormous fake breasts sneaks into children's dance recital, asked to leave by parents</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-skydiving" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Our favorite beautiful and brave 'chesty' shop teacher goes skydiving, but not all of 'her' makes it">Our favorite beautiful and brave 'chesty' shop teacher goes skydiving, but not all of 'her' makes it</a></li><li><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: That trans shop teacher with enormous fake chesticles?

<p>For what it's worth, last fall <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-rumor" target="_self">the anon boards started to report</a> the teacher -- when identifying as a male -- was almost fired for "toxic masculinity" and would tell his shop class of impressional young boys how silly the idea of things like gender-neutral bathrooms is. That wasn't redpilling enough, so "Kayla" was born.</p><blockquote>He's now upping the ante to exploit the very clown world the school and society itself has created. His long game is most likely to get fired, then sue for discrimination.</blockquote><p>The fact that America didn't learn of this Canadian import for a year is questionable. As is the fact that her/she (mmmm chocolate) "dead" name has yet to be revealed. </p><p><p>

## CNN co-host storms off after Don Lemon's "women past their prime" claim, and even Brian Stelter is chirping about it

He attempted a sexist comment against Nikki Haley. Had it just been that, since Haley is Republican and this is CNN, it would have been fine. But Lemon <strong></strong>(pronounced "le'mon" -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gutfeld-tucker-cuomo-lemon" target="_self">shout out Tucker Carlson</a>) instead insulted all women over a certain age. Co-host Poppy Harlow who is on the cusp of that age stormed off during a commercial break and hid in the bathroom.</p><p>First, in case you missed Don Sour Lemon's comments, here it is. He took issue with Nikki Haley saying politicians over the age of 75 should be given a cognitive test. For the sake of context, Sour Lemon has since apologized to all who were offended. Though not to Nikki Haley.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Don Lemon: "Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime. Sorry, when a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s, and 30s, and maybe 40s…"<br /><br />Poppy Harlow: "Are you talking about prime for like child bearing?"<br /><br />"Don’t shoot the messenger! I’m just saying what the facts are! Google it!" <a href="https://t.co/n1HmtkWTpl">pic.twitter.com/n1HmtkWTpl</a><br />— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/townhallcom/status/1626234363674505224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Now, maybe Don Lemon and I have different experiences with the ladies... </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="b11d3" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33047139&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>But if I may be allowed to offer a dissenting opinion, my experience with women in their 40s and 50s is that they are MOST DEFINITELY still in their prime.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/16/poppy-harlow-leaves-cnn-set-after-tense-exchange-with-don-lemon/" target="_blank">the New York Post</a>, 40-year-old co-host Poppy Harlow took exception to these comments and stormed off. A source to The Post says Harlow took a “well-timed bathroom break" and was "followed into the restroom by co-host Kaitlan Collins," adding "the tense relationship between Lemon, Collins and Harlow has been smoldering for months." </p><p>The source goes on to say this may have been the final straw. And that CNN president Chris Licht is going to squeeze Lemon out of the show.</p><p>Here's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-brian-stelter-prostitute" target="_blank">where Brian Stetler</a> comes in. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Stelter took a break from live-tweeting Fox News to generously re-tweet the drama at his now former employer. As you know, Stelter got fired from CNN for what critics claim was him being a failure of a media personality and sucking at life. Meanwhile, Don Lemon only got demoted to a morning show. Maybe these tweets are Stelter being a good media reporter. Or maybe he's a jealous little hater.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"Don has the day off." In case anyone's wondering, <a href="https://twitter.com/donlemon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DonLemon</a> really was scheduled to be off the air today — he even talked about it on the show yesterday <a href="https://t.co/24SdL7ZKAn">pic.twitter.com/24SdL7ZKAn</a><br />— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1626552854101037056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Today's cover: Poppy Harlow leaves CNN set after tense exchange with Don Lemon <a href="https://t.co/hpRJ2NOZK1">https://t.co/hpRJ2NOZK1</a> <a href="https://t.co/GE2QfSarQO">pic.twitter.com/GE2QfSarQO</a><br />— New York Post (@nypost) <a href="https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1626550970011230211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Variety's <a href="https://twitter.com/bristei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bristei</a> writes: "The premise of a good morning-news show is that it helps viewers wake up with their morning coffee.
