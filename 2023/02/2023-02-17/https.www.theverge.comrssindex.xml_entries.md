  <p id="ROvlRm">Amazon is making its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/alexa-multi-room-audio/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21480962011">multiroom audio platform</a> more convenient to control with your phone. A recent update to the Alexa mobile app introduced a new capability that lets users manage and move their music between Echo devices (or groups of multiple speakers) within the app itself. (Previously, you needed to use voice commands to perform some of those actions.)</p>
<p id="Y1mWBE">Now, it’s all doable through a menu that lets you move music to any group or Alexa device with a couple of taps — no talking necessary. In our brief time trying it so far, it’s pretty intuitive, and anyone that’s controlled music via AirPlay or Spotify Connect shouldn’t have much trouble figuring this out. Amazon’s current lineup of Echo speakers includes the standard Echo, Echo Dot,...</p>

It’s a small feature, but one that could be a really useful way for streamers to direct fans to interesting channels — and importantly, it’s a user-controlled tool.</p>
<p id="engusH">With the new feature, streamers can enter “@[channel]” into a stream title to create a link. If you, as a viewer, hover over one of those links, you’ll see a small card that lets you visit that person’s stream, follow them, or check out their social networks they’ve opted to highlight. </p>

As it turns out, you<em> </em>can buy a number of great gifts without completely draining your savings account, which makes it easy to pick up a present for your anniversary, a birthday party, or one of the many other gift-giving occasions strewn throughout the year.</p>

  <p id="bSpfex">Now that the Super Bowl and Valentine’s Day are behind us, the next holiday on deck that’s inexplicably linked to major sales promotions is Presidents Day. While this US holiday is meant to honor the historic legacy of our highest office, capitalism dictates that it’s now just about deals on stuff like TVs and maybe a day off (if you’re lucky).</p>
<p id="9oQies">Well, thankfully, there <em>are </em>some worthwhile sales going on — and not just on mattresses or whatever your local small businesses are hawking.

  <p id="4KyrLF">It’s hard to admit, but it’s all too easy to get caught up in obsessive behavior occasionally, especially when it comes to entertainment. It can be a TV series, a game, a series of novels, a comic book universe... It’s the kind of thing where you look up and suddenly realize that it’s 2AM and you have to get up early for work, and then you think, “Well, one more episode won’t hurt,” or, “If I try one more time, I can survive into the next round.”</p>
<p id="u5Uq98">We asked the staff of <em>The Verge</em> what their current media obsessions were. Here are the answers we got, divided into four categories: games, TV series, books, and music. Maybe you even share the enthusiasm they have for some of these.</p>

The Mate SUV, as it’s called, targets families looking to replace a car — something that’s not only possible, but preferred in bicycle-friendly cities like Copenhagen, where Mate was founded. </p>
<p id="5Vt7wL">Electric cargo bikes aren’t cheap, unless you compare the price to that of a car.
