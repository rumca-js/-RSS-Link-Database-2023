<p>‘Private companies’ conclusion likely to fuel criticism that downings were overreaction amid pressure over initial balloon discovery. Plus, there may be a reason you want to sleep more in winter</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Joe Biden has broken his silence on unknown aerial objects shot down over North America during the past week, assessing that they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/16/biden-objects-china-spy-balloon-surveillance">“most likely” operated by private companies or research institutions</a> rather than China.</p><p><strong>How will the government decide what poses a risk in the future?</strong> The president said the US was developing “sharper rules” around unknown aerial objects. These would help “distinguish between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not”.</p><p><strong>What has China said?</strong> China has denied that the balloon was a surveillance airship. Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said the balloon’s entry into US airspace was “an unintended, unexpected and isolated event”, adding: “China has repeatedly communicated this to the US side, yet the US overreacted by abusing the use of force and escalating the situation.”</p><p><strong>What </strong><strong>has the White House said</strong>? “We understand the residents are concerned – as they should be – and they have questions. That’s all understandable,” said the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. “And we’re going to get to the bottom of this.”</p><p><strong>What else is happening?</strong> At least five lawsuits have been filed against the railroad, which announced this week that it was creating a $1m fund to help the community while continuing to remove spilled contaminants from the ground and streams, and monitoring air quality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/17/first-thing-latest-objects-shot-down-over-us-not-linked-to-china-biden-says">Continue reading...</a>
