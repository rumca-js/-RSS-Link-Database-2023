Along with The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Maze Runner is definitely on the list of the most well-known within that genre.\n\nThe Maze Runner definitely raises some questions though. Like did they REALLY try everything to reach the top of those walls? How much time did these people spend naming things?

Do any questions get answered in this movie?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Maze Runner.\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nVelma Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4K_sxI5Ui8\n\nAvatar The Way Of Water Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBPO76TGUQ\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7c1RPv_DT4", "date_published": "2023-02-17 20:15:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
