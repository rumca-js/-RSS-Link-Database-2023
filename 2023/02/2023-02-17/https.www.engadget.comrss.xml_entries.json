The discount applies for the all four colorways, including green, white, purple and black. We gave the buds a solid <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html\">score of 84</a> when we reviewed them, saying they were premium-level buds at an affordable price \u2014 and now that's even more true.&nbsp;</p><p>While they offer active noise cancellation, it doesn't match the world-silencing ANC of top-tier (and more expensive) buds, but they do an okay job of muffling distractions. The sound quality is improved over the previous generation, offering ample base and balanced levels, especially with the EQ presets. The buds are also smaller and more comfortable than their predecessors. The Galaxy Buds 2 only sport a IPX2 rating, which is fine for going out in a drizzle, but might not stand up to sweaty workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The buds work great with a Samsung phone and integrate nicely with Samsung's Galaxy Watches. If you use an iPhone, they'll pair up, but you'll miss out on a lot of control. Those who've adopted Apple's ecosystem are probably better off going with Apple's AirPods.

Ably performing the functions of a TV, monitor and smart home hub, it usually sells for a round $600, but Amazon has it for $350, which is a new all-time low. Note that the $350 price tag only applies to the white version, and only on the configuration that includes the VESA adaptor along with the stand.</p><p>It has a bright display that delivers deep blacks, but only offers a 60Hz refresh rate, which isn't ideal for gaming. It has two USB-C ports and one micro-HDMI port \u2014 not a ton of inputs but it does help the screen keep its sleek design. It also includes a detachable webcam that can mount up top.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike a standard monitor, the M8 comes with Samsung's Tizen OS built in, as on a Samsung smart TV. That means you can easily run streaming apps without being connected to a computer. Also like a TV, it comes with a remote.

This configuration runs on Intel\u2019s Core i7 processors, using NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 4050 graphics cards. It's got 16GB of RAM, plus the aforementioned terabyte of storage. Overall, it's thin and light, weighing just shy of four pounds and measuring 0.64 inches thick.</p><p>Ports include HDMI, a microSD slot, two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C, one USB-A and a 3.5mm audio jack. The keyboard is roomy and the trackpad is huge. It also packs a 1080p webcam and an updated quad speaker system. While we haven't had the chance to fully test and review the Book 3 Ultra, if you can't wait for the full verdict and want it soon after it releases on February 22nd, you can snag a free storage upgrade with a pre-order.&nbsp;</p><h2>OnePlus 11</h2><p></p><p>When <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-review-price-release-date-cameras-150015371.html\">we reviewed</a> OnePlus's latest phone, we liked the fact that you got a good amount of phone for a  competitive price.

That gives you 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $699, which is the price of the smaller, 8GB/128GB model.&nbsp;</p><p>The standout feature of the OnePlus 11 is the incredibly fast charging. When juicing up using the included cable and adapter, 100W charging gets the phone from empty to full in about 25 minutes. That said, there's no wireless charging. But with a battery that lasted 20 hours in our rundown test and only needs 10 minutes on the cable to get to 50 percent, it's easy to overlook the absence.&nbsp;</p><p>The Android phone runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and comes with a great, 6.7-inch 2,048 \u00d7 1,080 OLED screen that can reach up to 120Hz refresh rates. The camera array includes a primary 50-megapixel sensor,  a 115-degree ultrawide 48MP camera and a 32MP telephoto camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Sony A90J BRAVIA XR OLED 4K TV (55-inch)</h2><p></p><p>Image quality has always sets Sony TVs apart in the past and, while other companies are closing the gap, higher end Sony's will never disappoint.

We've seen the device go on sale a handful of times <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-price-pre-order-104039969.html\">since it arrived</a> last year, but right now the 32-inch display is available for $350 at Amazon, which marks a new all-time low. That beats the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-smart-monitor-m-8-falls-to-a-new-all-time-low-of-400-142218789.html\">previous low</a> by $50 and comes in about $155 below this SKU's average <a href=\"https://keepa.com/#!product/1-B0B89L2WNV\">street price</a> in recent months. The discount only appears to apply to the monitor's white finish, however.</p><p></p><p>As a computer display, the Smart Monitor M8 is decent, but not perfect. It uses a VA panel, so it should deliver solid contrast with deep blacks. It can also get bright enough, reaching up to about 400 nits. Its viewing angles won't be as wide as you'd get from a good IPS screen, however, and its basic 60Hz refresh rate isn't ideal for gaming. It also lacks <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-05-best-tv-settings.html\">local dimming</a> for improving that contrast further. The built-in stand isn't especially adjustable, and connection-wise, you only get 2 USB-C ports and a micro-HDMI port. That said, the overall design has a clean, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-studio-display-review-mac-monitor-154504997.html\">Apple-esque</a> aesthetic, and the panel should look particularly nice in a darker room.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The main appeal of the Smart Monitor M8 is that extra functionality. Samsung's Tizen platform doesn't have the cleanest UI, but here it allows you to stream apps like Netflix, HBO Max, YouTube and the like even when the monitor isn't connected to a PC. A remote is included for navigating the OS, and you can beam content directly from an iPhone via AirPlay.

At launch, the PS5 offered only 667GB of space for storing your games, with no way to increase that. While that was fine for some (like me), others (like my son) were forced to perform a near-daily juggling act that involved frequently deleting and redownloading games due to the PS5\u2019s small SSD and the apparent need to have constant access to every Call of Duty game.</p><p>Now, you can increase your PS5\u2019s available storage by slotting in a standard PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD. If that mess of acronyms has you recoiling, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s not all that complicated, and if you want to know which drives we recommend, you can skip to the end.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>How much storage do I need?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Sony PlayStation 5 gaming console.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/341eb080-1ec1-11eb-bffb-88f330aaaf35\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Aaron Souppouris / Engadget</div></figure><p>The PS5 will accept drives between 250GB and 4TB in capacity. If you already own a PlayStation 5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you want. If you\u2019re buying an SSD with a new PS5, or buying for someone else, though, it\u2019s more difficult to tell.</p><p>PS5 games are a little smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you\u2019re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mwii-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-no-russian-170044023.html\"><em>Modern Warfare II</em> and <em>Warzone</em><em>2.0</em></a> will require more than 200GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up almost one-third of the PS5\u2019s internal storage. If you\u2019re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you\u2019ll be good to store between six to 10 games on your PS5 internally before running into problems.</p><p>One additional thing to consider is your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the \u201cyou can just download it again\u201d rationale doesn\u2019t really work out. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you\u2019ll want to play them at some point makes sense.</p><p>Off the bat, there's basically no point in going for a 250GB drive. Economically, 250GB drives aren\u2019t that much cheaper than 500GB ones, and practically, that really isn\u2019t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives, coming in at around $80 to $140, are a decent bet, but the sweet spot for most is to opt for a 1TB drive, which should run you between $160 and $250. That will more than double the space you have available for games without breaking the bank. (Seagate\u2019s official 1TB Xbox Series expansion card, for comparison, sells for <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZWFnYXRlLVN0b3JhZ2UtRXhwYW5zaW9uLVNvbGlkLVN0YXRlL2RwL0IwOEszUzZXSk0_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taWstMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU3NTEzM2RjLThjMTYtNDU5Yi05YmY4LTZmMzg5MmNkN2M3NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWYqA3XdwtIAt__AJTdDj3gF3vqXWgBTdsRt5Of1gaGN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSeagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State%2Fdp%2FB08K3S6WJM\">$220</a>.)</p><p>If you have the money, 2TB drives sometimes offer marginal savings per gigabyte, and can often be found when other models are out of stock. Unless you\u2019re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB models should mostly be avoided, as you\u2019ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p><p>One final note: While the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that\u2019s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB SSD, you'll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games.</p><h2>What about external SSDs?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Samsung T5 SSD\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f9a78850-01b4-11ec-bdf1-6047ddc9fc71\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Samsung</div></figure><p>These are dramatically cheaper than the high-end internal SSDs, but there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PS4 games, or storing PS5 titles. This is useful if you have anything but the best internet \u2014 it\u2019s faster to move a PS5 game out of \u201ccold storage\u201d on an external drive than it is to re-download it \u2014 or just want a large number of PS4 games to hand.</p><p>Due to the limitations here, you don\u2019t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X6 and Samsung T5 being options we\u2019ve tried and can recommend.</p><h2>What SSDs are compatible with PS5?</h2><h2></h2><p>The official answer to this question is an \u201cM.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.\u201d But even within that seemingly specific description, there are still more things to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.</p><p>For speed, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0f845666-5cc0-42c7-863d-d873ae1b6087&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=PlayStation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZjg0NTY2Ni01Y2MwLTQyYzctODYzZC1kODczYWUxYjYwODciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGxheXN0YXRpb24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3N1cHBvcnQvaGFyZHdhcmUvcHM1LWluc3RhbGwtbTItc3NkLyNtaW4iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU3NTEzM2RjLThjMTYtNDU5Yi05YmY4LTZmMzg5MmNkN2M3NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAc8uKbsYWnTQxryFbJ-m42NXSvrXAQQXVa430BYLCdUs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsupport%2Fhardware%2Fps5-install-m2-ssd%2F%23min\">Sony says</a> drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly \u2014 such as <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> \u2014 would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn't match the Gen4 x4 spec.</p><p>In our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don\u2019t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven\u2019t found issues yet, that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be games that will be problematic down the line. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony\u2019s spec is not huge, and you may as well cover all your bases.</p><p>Slightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most bare SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 42mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.</p><p>It should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require \u201ceffective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.\u201d The maximum height supported by Sony\u2019s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be \u201cbelow\u201d the drive. This previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair\u2019s MP600 Pro LPX and Sabrent\u2019s Rocket 4 Plus, would not fit within the PS5\u2019s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that take care of those considerations.</p><p>That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often much cheaper, and it\u2019s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.</p><p>The only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat. So, head to your PC component seller of choice, and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is \u201claptop NVME heatsink,\u201d as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They\u2019re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as \u201cPS5 heatsinks.\u201d</p><p>One recommendation is this <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IZWF0c2luay1Db3BwZXItQ29wcGVyJUVGJUJDJThDLVNpbGljb25lLVRoZXJtYWwvZHAvQjA3UU5SUDlISz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1pay0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTc1MTMzZGMtOGMxNi00NTliLTliZjgtNmYzODkyY2Q3Yzc3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXHHVFCgcP2am_p2O047u4wyz1ldvhuDHiQrDg4n61Nr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHeatsink-Copper-Copper%25EF%25BC%258C-Silicone-Thermal%2Fdp%2FB07QNRP9HK%3F\">$7 copper heatsink</a>, which attaches to the SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and really, performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn\u2019t find anything metal that didn\u2019t keep temperatures under control. When you\u2019re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall including the thermal interface material and has a simple method of installation that\u2019s not going to cause any headaches.</p><p>Now, if all of that was very boring, here are some ready-to-go recommendations:</p><h2>Best PS5 SSD: Corsair MP600 Pro LPX</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlRMk1XMjFGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzUxMzNkYy04YzE2LTQ1OWItOWJmOC02ZjM4OTJjZDdjNzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcyTGBC9fwwm7DX2Oq2ZLPIcMU6xWzj9ECB35LQMD6_r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09Q2MW21F\">Corsair MP600</a> Pro LPX makes it to the top of our list for checking all the boxes.

With read speeds of up to 6,600MB/s, the P5 Plus is only marginally slower than our top pick, and you can frequently find the 1TB model for as little as $80 when it\u2019s on sale. Expect the 2TB variant to set you back about $180 when on discount.</p><h2>Other great options</h2><h2>Samsung 980 Pro</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019re not familiar with companies like Crucial or Corsair and want to go with a more recognizable brand, there\u2019s no bigger player in the NVMe space than Samsung.

It comes with a unique heatsink that you install in place of the storage expansion slot\u2019s metal cover. Sabrent claims this design improves cooling performance.

Western Digital sells a Sony-licensed model of the SN850 that comes in 1TB and 2TB variants. The former should set you back about $180135, while the latter costs about $300.</p><h2>How to install an SSD in a PS5</h2><p>Before attempting to add more storage to your PS5, ensure that you have Sony\u2019s latest software installed. Once you're up-to-date, installation of a PS5 SSD is fairly straightforward. Sony recommends a #1 Phillips or crosshead screwdriver, but this isn't rocket science. Any crossed screwdriver of a similar size will do fine.</p><p>Begin by powering down your PS5, unplugging everything, removing the stand and flipping it over to its underside. If you have the regular PS5, that\u2019s the side with the disc drive; if you have the Digital Edition, it\u2019s the side without the PlayStation logo cutout.</p><p>Sony has a video guide to popping off the outside cover <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CaAY-jAjm0w?t=133\">here</a>, but the gist is you gently lift up the opposing corners and slide the panel toward the flat end of the console. There\u2019s a knack to this, and it requires very little effort or strength. If you\u2019re not getting it, rather than force it just readjust your grip and try again. A member of our video team managed to break one of the tabs on our review unit doing this in the past so\u2026 yeah, don\u2019t force it.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony PlayStation 5 SSD slot\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ebf0c2f0-01b7-11ec-afbf-853a752af0d1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you\u2019ve got everything open, you\u2019ll see a rectangular piece of metal with a screw holding it in place. Remove that screw, and you\u2019ll be able to access the drive bay.</p><p>You\u2019ll see five holes inside, each numbered corresponding to the standard SSD drive lengths I mentioned earlier. The one numbered 110 will have a metal insert and screw inside. You need to unscrew the screw with a screwdriver, and then unscrew the insert with your fingers and move it to the relevant hole. Your eyes should tell you which is the right one for your drive, but it\u2019s most likely going to be 80.</p><figure><img alt=\"PlayStation 5 SSD slot\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e67cea90-01b4-11ec-bbfb-4b7c19b43bb9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Aaron Souppouris/Engadget</div></figure><p>Then take your SSD \u2014 mine is a 980 Pro I bought on Prime Day with a $2 piece of aluminum attached to the top \u2014 and slot it in. The slot is at the edge closest to the number \u201c30,\u201d and SSDs are keyed to only fit in one way, so again, no force is required. If it\u2019s not sliding in, don\u2019t force it. You\u2019ll notice the SSD doesn\u2019t sit flat \u2014 that\u2019s fine, and is as intended.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony PlayStation 5 SSD upgrade\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cbfb0a40-01b8-11ec-affd-fd9517dd0c1c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once the SSD is seated, take the screw you removed from the insert, line it up with the little notch at the end of your SSD, and push down so it meets the insert. Give the screw a few turns \u2014 it doesn\u2019t need to be very tight \u2014 and you\u2019re done.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony PlayStation 5 SSD upgrade\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4dcf1fc0-01b9-11ec-a75f-13723fe12887\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Replace the metal cover and screw it down, and then slide the plastic outer shell back on. When you first turn on the PS5, it\u2019ll prompt you to format the drive. Do that! You have now successfully expanded your console\u2019s storage, and can set about downloading and moving games to it. Personally, I moved all of the PS4 games I had to the new drive, along with all of my clips and screenshots. The PS5\u2019s built-in SSD is always going to be the most compliant, so I\u2019m keeping my important stuff there.</p><p>We'll be updating this guide as more SSDs come to market and onto our test bench, so feel free to bookmark it for when you need it.</p><p><em>Igor Bonifacic contributed to this report.</em></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-17 14:16:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Fitbit is removing open groups, adventures and challenges from its app", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-2022-sense-2-versa-4-inspire-3-130037942.html\">Fitbit</a> says it's working on enhancing the app experience to focus on providing its users with the best fitness tools, and its efforts to do so apparently include sunsetting a handful of features. Starting on March 27th, open groups, as well as all Fitbit challenges and adventures, will no longer be available on the Google-owned fitness company's app. The company said these features &quot;have limited use,&quot; which likely means people haven't been using them enough to warrant their continued development and update.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike closed groups that are invite-only, open groups allow anybody in the community to join by sending in a request. Users can find them by going to Groups in the Community tab within the app and then finding ones that seem like a good match. People were asking the company to make open groups <a href=\"https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/Create-open-groups-on-Community-in-app/idi-p/3176028/page/2\">easier to create</a> when the pandemic lockdowns started \u2014 apparently, groups created through the app are automatically made private \u2014 and the Fitbit team said they'd consider adding the functionality.

Adventures incentivize people to walk by unlocking virtual trails like the Valley Loop in Yosemite Park and 180-degree views of landmarks that can be found along them based on their step count. Users will lose any trophy or award they earned from these challenges when they leave the app, but they can download their data before March 27th. Finally, the company will also be killing Fitbit Studio, its tool for creating apps and watchfaces, and will only continue supporting its <a href=\"https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/\">command-line interface</a> tools for app creation in the near future.&nbsp;</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-removing-open-groups-adventures-challenges-app-140024841.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-17 14:00:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Withings\u2019 luxury weighing scale is amazing, if inessential", "description": "<p>I wonder how often technology journalism is <em>aspirational</em> rather than useful, like when you watch car reviewers testing million dollar rides.

What then to make of Withings\u2019 newest smart scale, the Body Scan Connected Health Station, which is priced at <em>four hundred British pounds</em> (around $479)? That\u2019s mad money to pay for any smart scale, especially when you can get a great scale from Withings for a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/withings-body-digital-scale-41-percent-off-amazon-125029119.html\">quarter of that price</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/withings-latest-scale-has-a-handheld-lead-to-measure-fat-in-different-body-parts-010059582.html\"><ins>Withings\u2019 Body Scan</ins></a> was actually announced back at the start of 2022, but the usual gamut of regulatory hurdles means it\u2019s only now making its debut in <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d3b3fb13-488a-4810-a40f-ee84ae8f2918&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Withings&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkM2IzZmIxMy00ODhhLTQ4MTAtYTQwZi1lZTg0YWU4ZjI5MTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2l0aGluZ3MuY29tL3VrL2VuL2JvZHktc2NhbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDZlYjM3MTEtNGU4YS00MWE5LWJmMjEtODE5ODg5YTBkNDBkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAafBabqBeSZ3NYdIiDtvKoJf0jHpglxDUf2HEsifqlWd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.withings.com%2Fuk%2Fen%2Fbody-scan\"><ins>Europe</ins></a>. It\u2019ll arrive in the US at some point in the future, but given the FDA\u2019s sausage machine it\u2019s hard to get anyone to commit to a firm date. The intervening year has also dented the price, which was originally set at $300 before <a href=\"https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415416989073-Body-Scan-Announcement-FAQ\"><ins>costs and the semiconductor crisis</ins></a> pushed things ever northward.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Withings is, and was, selling this on the basis that it\u2019s not just a smart scale but a bigger suite of comprehensive body analysis tools. It\u2019s supposed to be the equal of sort of gear you might find at a high-end gym or a low-end clinical setting. It analyzes your segmented body composition, runs a six-lead ECG, measures your nerve activity and monitors your vascular age. It\u2019ll also use Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to monitor the sweat levels in your feet to look for signs of neuropathy.</p><p>My first impression is that it looks like someone glued Withings\u2019 cheaper Body Comp scale to its own weighted base and it feels wonderfully solid. So too does the grip, which you\u2019ll need to do any of the fancy body-analysis tests during your morning weigh-in. It\u2019s held in place with a thin but sturdy-looking braided tension-reel cable that I\u2019m sure will survive a lot but, that said, I\u2019m not going to leave it in the vicinity of my children.</p><p>Withings has the setup process down to a fine art: Wake the scale, open its Health Mate app, give it your WiFi password and sit back. The mandatory software update took all of two minutes and then you can set a weight loss goal inside the app. Weigh in for five days in a row, and it\u2019ll then be set and ready to give you suggestions on how better to improve your lifestyle. You\u2019ll also be shown a series of how-to guides teaching you how to get the best out of your new hardware.</p><p>Not that there\u2019s much to learn: Get on the scale, hold the grab at pelvis height and wait 90 seconds for it to do its thang. It\u2019ll run the gamut of tests measuring your weight, body fat, muscle mass, visceral fat, ECG, Pulse Wave Velocity, vascular age and nerve health. It\u2019ll then relay those data points to you in a big, bright, bold and easy-to read manner, followed by the day\u2019s weather and an indicator about the local air quality (pulled from an online service).</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of Withings' Body Scan connected health station at an angle against a wooden floor in my bathroom.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/af1acbf0-ad19-11ed-88d7-8ea03c13bd55\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p></p><p>I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at scales, and some scales like to put a lot of data on a very small screen to the point where it\u2019s unreadable. Withings has nailed the UI here, and despite the full color display, the layout is clean and everything is super easy to read. Especially at 7am when you\u2019ve just staggered out of the shower and you don\u2019t yet have your glasses on. Fonts are clear, trend lines are chunky and cleanly differentiated from the background. It seems simple, but you\u2019d be surprised how many companies <em>don\u2019t</em> get this stuff right. The sense of details being sweated extends to the fact the scale has a vibration motor, telling you when the process has started and finished.</p><p>I\u2019ve always praised Health Mate as Withings\u2019 secret weapon in the health-tech wars, with its clean UI and depth of data. I was concerned that, as its devices get more powerful, it\u2019d start to feel flabby or cluttered, but the card layout on its home screen remains easy to digest. Each lozenge presents a small graph that just shows the trend rather than stuffing it full of individual data points. And it\u2019s only when you press into each sub menu that you can see the information in its more precise glory.</p><p>It\u2019s early days, but there\u2019s been nothing on the analysis that feels like it\u2019s wrong, although it\u2019ll need a lot of calibration testing to prove that definitively. The segmented body composition is certainly spot on, highlighting the areas of my body that are carrying the most timber. And it\u2019s nice, easy to understand, and sobering (delete as appropriate) to see the healthy and unhealthy parts of my body. Having all of this laid out with Withings\u2019 new Health+ coaching system, too, which will start offering suggestions about how I can improve, is also a benefit.</p><p>I know people will disagree with me, but I like the fact that the Body Scan has an integral, USB-C charged battery with a rated life of a year. Some folks prefer having AAA batteries instead, but I always feel that when you\u2019re spending this much on a scale, being tasked with buying batteries on top makes me feel like I\u2019m being nickel-and-dimed. I\u2019m also of the opinion that any recurring revenue service has to work pretty hard to justify my cash, but I\u2019ve not yet had enough time with Health+ to say if it does or not.</p><p>There is the problem that all of this data may not be taken very seriously by your physician if you rush in asking for help. A medical practitioner in the UK, who asked not to be named, said that while the inclusion of a six-lead ECG in a bathroom scale was impressive, they wouldn\u2019t be swayed by the results it produced. Instead, they would look at the symptoms the patient was presenting, their medical history, and would run their own ECG before making any judgment. And that there was a risk of data being misinterpreted by novice users and using it to make poor decisions.</p><p>So, on one hand, I\u2019ve got nothing but praise for Withings\u2019 Body Scan Connected Health Station, which is the pinnacle of what a smart scale can be right now. And I\u2019m certainly thrilled at the idea that you can have this wealth of data all collated in a single place for better monitoring of your health. But, and it\u2019s the most obvious <em>but</em> in the world, I\u2019m not sure anyone really needs to spend this much money on one. Especially if you already have a smart scale and a smartwatch that can do some sort of heart health analysis with an ECG.</p><p>In many ways, it\u2019s like one of those car reviewers showing you what you could have if you had a spare million in your checking account. Yes, it\u2019s well made, does everything you could ask for, and does it all within one of the best health tech ecosystems on the market. But for this money? You can get to work just as well in a Toyota as you can in a Maybach.</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/withings-body-scan-connected-health-station-is-amazing-if-inessential-140001021.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-17 14:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Did the PlayStation VR2 arrive too late?", "description": "<p>The PlayStation VR2 is here, and it\u2019s mostly great!

Square Enix isn\u2019t reinventing the turn-based RPG for this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-12-octopath-traveler-review-switch-rpg.html\">sequel</a>, instead expanding and (mildly) correcting some of the weaker parts of the original. There are new battle dynamics and moves, a well-utilized day-and-night game mechanism, and shared stories that attempt to convey a connection between the eight narratives. But it\u2019s still a casual one. If <em>Final Fantasy XV </em>was about four best buddies going on a road-trip, then <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> is more like an Uber Pool rideshare. There might be friendly small talk, but there\u2019s still not enough of a meaningful connection between the eight protagonists.</p><figure><img alt=\"Octopath Traveler 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c897b550-ae47-11ed-ac5f-6ec42e3d0984\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo</div></figure><p><em>Octopath Traveler 2 </em>doesn\u2019t offer any technical graphical upgrades I need to explain, although there seems to be a little more detail to both the sprites and environments. It\u2019s still a pretty game. Half of the appeal is how games like this coax my memories of 16- and 32-bit games.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Having said that, the team behind this series has realized they can play with the scale a bit more: this is the Nintendo Switch, not a SNES.  In some of the opening scenes for Hikari the warrior, characters rush past a crowd of 40 or so fighting in a desert. Developers Acquire and Team Asano have amped up the cinematic cutscenes a little more, too. Cameras will pan out and around your characters, as they brood on cliff faces, or as they\u2019re forced to kill their abusive parents.</p><p><em>OP2</em> tries, only ever so slightly, to convey the idea that you\u2019re on a collective journey. Once you\u2019ve chosen your main character (who will be \u2018locked\u2019 into your party until you complete all five chapters of their story), you\u2019ll bump into other travelers. Then you\u2019ll be given the option to play through their origin story, or circle back to it at the local tavern at a time that\u2019s suitable for you.</p><figure><img alt=\"Octopath Traveler 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c8b46510-ae47-11ed-9e71-bcd58df0d387\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Occasionally there will be some minor banter elements, called \u201cshared stories\u201d where two characters will share a few scenes together. These often connect stories and offer up some rewards. Still, it\u2019s a little too infrequent \u2013 and not enough to get the impression this is a team of heroes helping each other to save the world from various calamities \u2013 or become a global dance superstar. (Yes, that\u2019s someone\u2019s aim.)</p><p>Osvald, the scholar, starts his journey in prison, accused of killing his wife and child. He\u2019s this game\u2019s defacto black mag,e with an array of elemental attacks. Still, this time, given his gritty backstory, his path actions (abilities and interactions you can make with non-playable characters in towns, and generally any time outside of battles) aren\u2019t your typical black mage traits. One is scrutinize, a risky way of gleaning information from characters, while the other is mug, where you can duel pretty much any NPC you come across, and steal their possessions if you win.</p><p>However, with eight characters, many path actions overlap. Castti, an item expert and apothecary, can inquire for the same information you can get from scrutinizing, without any risk \u2013 she just has to be a high enough level. Meanwhile, Thron\u00e9, the thief, can steal during daylight hours, giving the same results of a mugging without the fight.</p><p>Alongside those skills, each character also starts with a unique talent, offering battle abilities or passive skills that others won\u2019t be able to use, even after unlocking secondary classes.</p><figure><img alt=\"Octopath Traveler 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c87c6520-ae47-11ed-bfaf-63b37633000f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Like the original, the battle system comes into its own once you can switch around job roles. To do so, however, you\u2019ll need to find the guild for each job to unlock it. Some are easy enough to find \u2013 I came across two of the \u2018secret\u2019 jobs entirely by accident \u2013 while others are eluding me even now, 60 hours into the game, at roughly level 60 across my party. Where are you, hunter guild!?</p><p>More effort has been made to tonally differentiate the eight tales of <em>Octopath Traveler 2 </em>compared to its predecessor. With Temenos the cleric, who works as some sort of blasphemy hunter/mystery solver, gets a few scenes where he\u2019s trying to solve crime scene mysteries. It\u2019s not exactly <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, with all the clues there, twinkling away, waiting for you to walk up to them, but it helps to make the chapters feel different to the others.</p><p>Partitio, the merchant, likewise, has a story that feels like some whimsical K-drama, as this entrepreneur makes friends of enemies and travels the world striking deals. He gets an oddly bizarre montage of his final deal striking, hopping on ships and visiting a few secondary characters you probably already forgot. The aforementioned Castii starts the game with amnesia (ah that video game classic), and if there\u2019s anything shared across most of the characters, it\u2019s the sense that most of them are unreliable narrators. Rounding out the cast you have Agnea, the dancer, and Ochette, the hunter. (Not all eight will resonate with everyone, will they?)</p><p>Even the final chapters for each of the eight characters only results in a few extra banter scenes. I\u2019m playing through the final chapters for each character, and if it's anything like <em>OP1</em>, this will probably unlock a true final area, dungeon and boss. At this point, I doubt all the themes and story will coalesce into a satisfying conclusion \u2014 there\u2019s been some allusions to a \u2018shadow\u2019, but that\u2019s true of 90 percent of all RPGs. /I\u2019ll be happy with another challenging boss.</p><figure><img alt=\"Octopath Traveler 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c87c6520-ae47-11ed-b6f9-d2d011095bdb\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo</div></figure><p>The battle dynamics follow the same formula of the last game: you aim to break the enemies\u2019 defenses through applying elemental and weapon weaknesses. Break them, and they\u2019ll stop attacking \u2014 or reset the charge-up to their high damage abilities \u2013  allowing you to do increased damage, or carefully heal and prepare for the next part of the fight. Once again, you\u2019ll be able to boost attacks as a battle continues, augmenting damage or extending the length of strengthening spells and other boons.</p><p>The sequel adds latent powers, a limit-break styled super attack unique to each character. For some, this allows them to handily perform two actions at once, while others will deal augmented damage or supercharge spells and physical attacks. This was how I found my favorite characters and they seemed to stick around the squad longer. (Thank you for your service, Thron\u00e9.)</p><p>Day and night affect the entire game, and thankfully it\u2019s an easy trigger button that you can tap at any time outside of a battle. There are benefits to fighting during night, depending on the characters. Thron\u00e9 and Temenos offer debuffs and buffs at the start of nighttime fights, although it seems like fights are generally tougher than during the day. You will also come across different enemies depending on the time of day. This transition will also move NPCs around the town, or make them disappear entirely. The music also thoughtfully segues between the two states, which is a nice touch. Yet again, <em>OP2</em> has a polished soundtrack, filled with orchestral bangers and several battle-theme earworms.</p><p><em>OP2</em> builds on the strengths of the first game, with lots of non-linear options to the story, with enough of a difference between chapters to break it all up. However, there still isn\u2019t quite enough cohesion between the travelers and the tales they weave.</p><p><em>Octopath Traveler 2 launches on Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and Steam on February 24th.</em></p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/octopath-traveler-2-review-eight-different-stories-but-not-enough-connection-090045893.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-17 09:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Tesla denies firing New York workers in retaliation for union activity", "description": "<p>Tesla has <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/in-response-false-allegations\">denied</a> that it terminated employees at its Buffalo, New York Autopilot facility in response to a new union campaign.

In a blog post, Tesla called their accusation a &quot;false allegation&quot; and said that those who were let go lost their jobs because of their own doing.&nbsp;</p><p>The company explained that it conducts performance reviews every six months and that workers are graded 1 to 5 for each cycle. It &quot;helps them calibrate their work,&quot; Tesla wrote, and they will be let go if they fail to meet their performance expectations. These reviews are apparently conducted everywhere Tesla has a facility, with the most recent cycle covering July 2022 through December 2022. Tesla said it identified the people who will be let go on February 3rd, over a week before organizers sent their letter to Musk, and that managers were told way back in December that low performers will start exiting the company on the week of February 12th.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Moreover, the company explicitly stated that 4 percent of the employees on the Autopilot labeling team was let go due to their poor performance reviews. (Tesla said it only learned in hindsight that one out of the 27 impacted employees is part of the union campaign.) They received prior feedback, Tesla said, but &quot;they did not demonstrate sufficient improvement.&quot; If you'll recall, the union organizers in Buffalo are in charge of labeling data for Autopilot. They previously told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-14/tesla-autopilot-workers-launch-union-campaign-in-buffalo-new-york-tsla?uuid=DmLNhMI14MIA9j7J0378\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> that they're fighting for better pay and working conditions that reduce production pressures.&nbsp;</p><p>The workers said Tesla monitors their keystrokes to determine how much time they spend on each task and how many hours they spend working in a day. They've reportedly been skipping bathroom breaks, as a result. But in Tesla's response, it said that time monitoring is only there &quot;to calculate how long it takes to label an image,&quot; so &quot;there is nothing to be gained by delaying bathroom breaks.&quot; The report that Tesla pressures its employees is &quot;categorically false,&quot; it added. Tesla didn't mention anything regarding the employees' complaint about not having a voice in the company's though: Workers previously said that talks of forming a union began after management shut down an internal chatroom where they can air their grievances.&nbsp;</p>", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tesla-denies-firing-new-york-workers-retaliation-union-activity-060322521.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-02-17 06:03:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
