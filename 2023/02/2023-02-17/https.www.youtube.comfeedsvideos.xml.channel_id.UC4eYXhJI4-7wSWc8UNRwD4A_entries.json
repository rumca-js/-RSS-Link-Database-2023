Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.\n\nMitra I. Arthur | February 17, 2023\nTrumpeter Theo Croker arrived at the Tiny Desk with an unmistakable air of chill, an easy smile on display. That chill is the result of a clear musical approach and determination that dates back to Croker\u2019s teenage days forming big bands and fearlessly pushing the bounds of the music played by his grandfather, trumpeter Doc Cheatham. His reach includes collaborations with a variety of musicians: vocalists Ari Lennox and Jill Scott, rappers J. Cole and Wyclef Jean and mentors including NEA Jazz Master Dee Dee Bridgewater and saxophonist Gary Bartz. Croker\u2019s latest two albums, LOVE QUANTUM and BLK2LIFE // A FUTURE PAST, showcase Croker\u2019s journey as a trumpeter, composer and producer in expanding the music commonly known as jazz with hip-hop, R&amp;B and electronic sounds.\n\nCroker\u2019s performance here is a stripped-down version of a Theo Croker show you might see these days. His first composition, \u201cJAZZ IS DEAD,\u201d is anchored by a bassline provided by Eric Wheeler that stayed in my mind for days. The declarative title is sure to catch attention and elicit questions, but listen to the lyrics to understand Croker\u2019s determination to both reclaim, and expand, the form. \u201cThe Messenger\u201d features a dazzling solo from pianist Michael King, leading into Croker\u2019s trumpet dancing over the melody. The joy in \u201cHappy Feet (for dancers),\u201d featuring the rich vocals of MALAYA, will have you adding the song to your next party playlist. The last song in the set, \u201cNo Escape from Bliss,\u201d is an aptly named calming and contemplative resolution to the performance. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cJAZZ IS DEAD\u201d\n\u201cThe Messenger\u201d\n\u201cHappy Feet (for dancers) (feat.
