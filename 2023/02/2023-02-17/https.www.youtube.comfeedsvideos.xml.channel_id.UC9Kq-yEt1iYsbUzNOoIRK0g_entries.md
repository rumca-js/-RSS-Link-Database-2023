The past two decades have been jampacked with multiple movie franchises focused on teens stuck in some kind of game-based dystopia where their lives are at risk and everyone is dressed in gray. Along with The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Maze Runner is definitely on the list of the most well-known within that genre.

The Maze Runner definitely raises some questions though. Like did they REALLY try everything to reach the top of those walls? How much time did these people spend naming things? How do they know what grievers are if they only come out in the maze at night, and nobody has survived a night in the maze? Do any questions get answered in this movie?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Maze Runner.
