One with high stakes, in real time. They cycle through the options: advance to the ball, or sweep to reach its pitch? Reverse sweep to find gaps? Open a stance to avoid being closed off? Attack early to push catchers back? Every choice has threats that it nullifies and new ones it invites, especially with quality purveyors of spin making counter-adjustments at the other end.<br /><br />On the first day of the Delhi Test, Peter Handscomb looked to have solved the puzzle. For a time, Usman Khawaja found a way too. On a pitch that offered sharp turn from ball one even if it was slow enough to sometimes play off the surface, their partnership in the middle of the innings was worth 59, while Khawaja was the consistent presence in helping add 108 beforehand and Handscomb in another 94 afterwards. A total of 263 does not equal cricketing riches, but it was an advance on the previous week\u2019s capitulation in Nagpur.</p><p>The fact that their contributions came from both ends of the top six was vital, after Ravichandran Ashwin knocked out the middle. Before the series, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne were the players expected to carry the campaign against spin, while Ashwin\u2019s off-breaks were supposed to sow havoc among Australia\u2019s left-handers. Instead he knocked over both right-handers within three balls, using his unexpected line from wide around the wicket.<br /><br />It was turn that did Labuschagne, the ball dipping to muddle the timing of his bat across his front pad, then straightening to hit him in front. Ashwin knew it was out, even if umpire Nitin Menon didn\u2019t, and the record was soon corrected. Smith\u2019s delivery was angled sharply across him and skidded on straight when he expected turn, drawing a flicker of movement of his hands towards the ball. Perhaps that slower surface let him catch up with it and provide a catch behind.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/17/australia-would-do-well-to-give-peter-handscomb-time-up-the-order-to-solve-india-puzzle\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/17/australia-would-do-well-to-give-peter-handscomb-time-up-the-order-to-solve-india-puzzle", "date_published": "2023-02-17 20:46:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Lee Mason leaves PGMOL by \u2018mutual consent\u2019 after error in Arsenal game", "description": "<ul><li>VARreferee failed to spot offside in Arsenal draw with Brentford</li><li>PGMOL thanks Mason for his \u2018dedicated service to the game\u2019</li></ul><p>Professional Game Match Officials Ltd has confirmed that VAR referee Lee Mason has left the organisation by mutual consent.</p><p>Mason caused controversy last weekend after failing to spot an offside in the buildup to Brentford\u2019s equaliser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/18/brentford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">against Arsenal</a> and he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/05/efl-incredibly-frustrated-with-technology-failure-as-pgmol-reviews-var\">not been selected as a VAR</a> for the next round of Premier League fixtures.

And second the deliciously more-ish scenes of chaos at Paris Saint-Germain as the current Qatari football project confirmed its status as the most thrillingly grotesque entity in European club football.</p><p>It is worth stating this simply: Qatar buying United would be an absolute disaster for the team, the Premier League and Uefa. And not just for reasons such as human rights abuses, which nobody really seems to care about, or the fact nation-state ownership is by definition unhealthy, and foreign policy never benign. In the end none of this really seems to cut through. What makes an impact is basic footballing competence. We hear talk already of how \u201cclassy\u201d Newcastle\u2019s Saudi owners are, which is no doubt a huge comfort to those the state has classily beheaded, or gay people in Saudi being (classily) tortured.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/17/qatar-buying-manchester-united-would-be-a-disaster-just-look-at-the-state-of-psg\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/feb/17/qatar-buying-manchester-united-would-be-a-disaster-just-look-at-the-state-of-psg", "date_published": "2023-02-17 19:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "India accuses BBC of tax evasion amid Modi documentary row", "description": "<p>Country\u2019s finance ministry claims broadcaster has not fully declared its income and profits</p><p>India\u2019s finance ministry has accused the BBC of tax evasion, saying that it had not fully declared its income and profits from its operations in the country.</p><p>Indian tax authorities ended three days of searches of the British broadcaster\u2019s New Delhi and Mumbai offices on Thursday night.

She did not, as Monbiot writes, simply say \u201cOh, OK\u201d and leave it at that when he declined to answer her question by saying it wasn\u2019t relevant. She persisted: \u201cOh. No, it might not be [relevant]. Just thought it might be interesting.\u201d So the conversation seemed to be heading in the direction recalled by the official before the tape cuts out.<br /><br />Monbiot also refers to the programme\u2019s editing of a brief clip from a former student leader, Izzy Lenga. It is true that through no fault of her own, her comments about the source of antisemitic abuse from left and right became mixed up in the editing and we should have made that distinction clearer \u2013 Hitler from the right and Holocaust denial from the left. That is why the BBC later clarified the position.<br /><br />However, supporters of Jeremy Corbyn have become particularly exercised by this brief clip as if it invalidates the entire 59 minutes of the programme. It does not. Holocaust denial from the left like that experienced by Izzy Lenga has led to expulsions of Labour members for neo-Nazi views. Furthermore, the entire programme has been successfully defended in three separate defamation cases and adjudged by the broadcasting regulator Ofcom to have complied with the Broadcasting Code on both accuracy and impartiality.<br /><strong>John Ware</strong><br /><em>Reporter, Panorama<br /></em><strong>Neil Grant<br /></strong><em>Executive producer, Panorama</em></p><p>\u2022 George Monbiot\u2019s piece offers a rare glimpse of an alternative perspective on the Labour antisemitism crisis.

There\u2019s just too much of it, from too many angles, all of the time. If there isn\u2019t a new TV show dropping on one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/feb/10/the-guide-netflix-disney-apple-hbo\">countless \u2018pluffixed\u2019 platforms</a> Gwilym wrote about last week, then there\u2019s a must-see film in cinemas, or a two-hour podcast I have to listen to entirely then have an opinion on. This is how culturally saturated I am: it wasn\u2019t until the second draft of this paragraph that I even remembered <em>the concept of music</em>. Albums! Songs! Dance trends! It\u2019s exhausting! No wonder the Grammy committee heard 50 seconds of a Harry Styles song on TikTok and just went: \u201cYou know what? Give him album of the year.\u201d</p><p>A new trick I have pioneered, then, is consuming outside of the hype cycle. I mainly do this with TV but you can do it with whatever, really. Recently \u2013 as in, over the long dying weeks of Dry January \u2013 I slowly meandered through three of last year\u2019s biggest and most talked-about TV series, cut shorn of the context of time-sensitive hype: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/severance-review-ben-stillers-workplace-fantasy-might-make-your-mind-explode\">Severance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/bad-sisters-review-sharon-horgan-pitch-black-comedy-is-murderously-good\">Bad Sisters</a>, and the last two half-series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/16/more-profound-than-breaking-bad-goodbye-better-call-saul-the-show-like-nothing-else-on-tv\">Better Call Saul</a>. I also watched the entirety of Euphoria at a time when no one was tweeting about it or doing memes about it on Instagram, which was its own interesting personal experiment \u2013 it turns out I have already seen every single frame of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/02/euphoria-most-loved-hated-tv-show\">Euphoria</a> in a screenshot, but I have never seen them joined together and sped up in what the industry calls \u201cfootage\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/17/the-guide-euphoria-better-call-saul\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/17/the-guide-euphoria-better-call-saul", "date_published": "2023-02-17 11:45:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Peter Bradshaw\u2019s Bafta predictions: who will win \u2013 and who should?", "description": "<p>Cate Blanchett, Brendan Gleeson, Park Chan-wook? \u2026 our critic weighs up who will leave Sunday\u2019s ceremony with an award</p><p><strong>Will win</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/11/tar-review-cate-blanchett-is-perfect-lead-in-delirious-sensual-drama\">T\u00e1r</a><br /><strong>Should win</strong> T\u00e1r<br /><strong>Shoulda been a contender</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/20/aftersun-review-charlotte-wells-luminous-father-daughter-drama-paul-mescal\">Aftersun</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/17/bafta-award-predictions-who-will-win-and-who-should-win\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/17/bafta-award-predictions-who-will-win-and-who-should-win", "date_published": "2023-02-17 11:35:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How is Sunak succeeding in a deal where three UK prime ministers have failed?", "description": "<p>Few would have expected the technocratic, cautious PM to be the leader able to help close one of the deepest wounds of Brexit</p><p>It has taken three prime ministers, three Northern Ireland secretaries, seven lawsuits by the EU and an epic breakdown of relations with Ireland before surgery was finally performed on one of the deepest wounds caused by Brexit.</p><p>The UK and the EU are inching closer to a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol and \u2013 if Rishi Sunak pulls it off and faces down opponents in the DUP and European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 he will have achieved something that eluded Theresa May and Boris Johnson.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/17/how-sunak-is-inching-to-a-northern-ireland-deal-where-those-before-him-failed\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/17/how-sunak-is-inching-to-a-northern-ireland-deal-where-those-before-him-failed", "date_published": "2023-02-17 11:33:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bootycandy review \u2013 thrilling, uproarious comedy explores Black queerness from every angle", "description": "<p><strong>Gate theatre, London<br /></strong>Inventive direction and a spectacular cast make the London transfer of Robert O\u2019Hara\u2019s kaleidoscopic off-Broadway play a spiralling, high-energy triumph</p><p>Robert O\u2019Hara is a tease.

In theatre, too. So this distinctive revival of Tom Kempinski\u2019s 1980 play about Stephanie Abrahams, a former star violinist who consults a psychiatrist to help deal with her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, is jolted by a decisive change \u2013 recasting the psychiatrist, Dr Feldmann, as a woman. Suddenly their combative weekly sessions don\u2019t replicate Stephanie\u2019s vexed relationship with her father but chime with memories of her mother \u2013 ardently supportive but dying young, leaving Stephanie to battle alone. Her defensive carapace is now threatened by disease.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald\u2019s musician sits beside a squat and unrevealing cactus. Maureen Beattie\u2019s doctor must prise open an equally unyielding patient, emotion by emotion, leaf by leaf. It could seem schematic, yet Simon Kenny\u2019s circular stage, slowly revolving, becomes an intimate arena for their furious battle of wills. There\u2019s a second crucial element in Richard Beecham\u2019s production: the duet becomes a trio with a violinist who plays on the threshold of each session. Quivering, soaring, this lost and lonely sound (composed by Oliver Vibrans) reminds Stephanie of everything that gave her meaning and all she is losing to illness.</p><p>For Stephanie, urged to attend by her composer husband (the Daniel Barenboim to her Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, though Kempinski disclaimed the connection), the sessions are a joust. She mocks, sulks, throws tantrums, but the scalding lava of unexamined feeling lies beneath Fitzgerald\u2019s corrosive growl and glare. Beattie refuses provocation and is comfortable with silence, except for one calculated outburst at her truculent patient. Despite the Jewish director, would this excavation of parental tensions and aspirations land differently with a Jewish cast, matching the implied identities? Even so, Beattie and Fitzgerald make the air crackle. A box of tissues sits between them \u2013 only late in the play does Stephanie take one, with a slow, reluctant rasp.

A \u201ctotalitarian\u201d China, she says, poses a global threat to the \u201cfree world\u201d. Britain should help rally regional countries against Beijing by building a \u201cPacific defence alliance\u201d and an \u201ceconomic Nato\u201d.<br /><br />Truss also calls on G7 states, which will meet in Hiroshima in May, to prepare to impose tough sanctions on China if it further escalates its military intimidation of Taiwan. The self-governing island should be admitted to international organisations from which it is currently excluded, she says \u2013 a red rag to Beijing. This stance echoed her previous, provocative call for Britain to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10963343/Now-Liz-Truss-says-Britain-send-weapons-help-TAIWAN-amid-fears-invasion-China.html\">supply weapons direct</a> to Taipei.<br /><br />Truss is right to suggest relations with China are at a critical point, illustrated by the absurdly hyped flap in the US that accompanied the shooting down of a Chinese surveillance balloon. But her proposals, if actively pursued, could intensify east-west tensions, deepen the divide and boost Russia\u2019s attempts to ally itself with Beijing \u2013 while doing little or nothing to enhance international security.<br /><br />Her Tokyo speech raises two broader questions: is Truss truly looking for workable ways to mitigate the aggressive posture of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, or is she just posturing for hard-right, anti-China audiences in Westminster and Washington? Her position, including on the selective decoupling of economic relations, undercuts Sunak, who, like Joe Biden, has declined to classify China as a \u201cthreat\u201d.<br /><br />Second, does Truss truly believe that Britain is still a global power with the political will, financial wherewithal and military firepower to intervene effectively in dangerous geopolitical crises thousands of miles from its shores? If so, she is truly delusional. Alone and adrift in a post-Brexit vacuum she helped create, Britain\u2019s ability to influence world events is diminishing rapidly. The defence and security of Europe, of which it is a part, and not the Asia-Pacific region, is the UK\u2019s primary strategic concern. Politically, she cannot admit that axiomatic fact.<br /><br />Empty threats do not make good foreign policy \u2013 and we have been here before. In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/uk-leading-g7-allies-to-weaken-putins-military-arsenal\">Mansion House speech</a> last year, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, Truss insisted Russian troops must be forced back to pre-2014 borders \u2013 meaning expelled from Crimea and all of Donbas. \u201cWe are going to keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine,\u201d she declared. You and whose army, Liz? Did she mean UK forces should launch a ground war against Russia? The Kremlin certainly thought so.<br /><br />Truss has hit repeat play in Tokyo, proving again that loose talk costs other people\u2019s lives. There is no doubt Xi\u2019s threats to subjugate Taiwan by force, his bullying of neighbours such as the Philippines, his colonisation of the South China Sea and his criminal treatment of the Uyghur and Tibetan peoples are shocking and alarming. But it is likewise clear, or should be, that Xi, despite his domestic problems, will not be deterred by a former colonial power with blood on its hands that poses no credible kinetic or economic challenge. The danger, instead, is that he may double down \u2013 with Taiwan in his gunsights.

The Team India physio is running out for running repairs but after a short break Siraj resumes. After taking 38 balls to get past two runs in Nagpur, Warner hasn\u2019t scored from his first 14 balls here. He\u2019ll be sweating on a run to get off the mark.

The ball slipped out the side of his hand there and he has the ignominy of waiting for the umpires to call it as a no-ball or a wide. It\u2019s a wide and he follows it with one that gets past Srikar Bharat the \u2018keeper to notch a fifth bye in just the third over. Khawaja cashes in on Shami\u2019s troubles by rolling his wrists on the fifth and sending it to the fine leg rope. There\u2019s a catcher there but he had no chance. Interesting stat from the first Test: despite all the talk of spin and the deployment of silly points and leg slips, none of the close-in men took a catch as 22 of the 30 wickets were unassisted.
