<p>Twitter is once again delaying the rollout of its paid API. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1625234161010343941?s=20&amp;t=5JZCxb_suWmAWL-kQDkZWw"><ins>tweet</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/13/twitter-delays-new-paid-api-launch-by-a-few-more-days"><em><ins>AppleInsider</ins></em></a>, the company said Tuesday it needs more time to complete work on the redesign. “As part of our efforts to create an optimal experience for the developer community, we will be delaying the launch of our new API platform by a few more days,” Twitter posted.</p><p>When the company first announced it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html"><ins>shutting down its free APIs</ins></a>, Twitter said it would cut access off on February 9th. It later pushed back the cutoff date to February 13th without warning. Elon Musk hasn’t said much about how paid access to Twitter’s APIs could work other than to suggest the company <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621259936524300289?s=20&amp;t=ZBEy_AYiHtl0OCOHzW3nqA"><ins>will charge $100</ins></a> per month and add “ID verification” to limit bot abuse.

<p>One of the Bay Area’s most popular ferry routes is going electric. The Angel Island Ferry is partnering with Pacific Gas and Electric Company to retrofit one of its watercraft, <a href="https://angelislandferry.com/the-angel-island/"><ins>The Angel Island</ins></a>, as an EV. As part of the partnership, PG&amp;E will help install charging infrastructure at the Angel Island ferry terminal and boost electrical transmission to the facility, so that the 59-foot-long Angel Island can carry residents and tourists without polluting the San Francisco Bay. Another company called <a href="https://greenyachtsales.com/"><ins>Green Yachts</ins></a> will carry out the work of retrofitting the ship with an electric propulsion system.</p><p>According to PG&amp;E, the electrified Angel Island will be California’s first zero-emissions, short-run ferry once it starts carrying passengers sometime in 2024. California is one of a few places where electric ferries are about to become a more common sight. In Canada, British Columbia’s BCFerries service recently began rolling out <a href="https://www.bcferries.com/in-the-community/projects/introducing-island-class-ferries"><ins>battery-hybrid ferries</ins></a> that can carry 47 vehicles between the mainland and outlying islands. Outside of North America, Stockholm, starting this year, plans to trial one of the world’s fastest electric passenger vehicles. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-24/world-s-fastest-electric-ferries-are-coming-to-stockholm?sref=10lNAhZ9"><ins>Candela P-12</ins></a> will carry passengers between the city center and the suburban island of Ekerö.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## TikTok creators might soon put some videos behind a paywall

<p>TikTok might use a simple strategy to keep growing: help creators make extra money. <em>The Information</em><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiYTBhNGNkYy1jZWM4LTQxNmEtOWU5My1lMTFiODE3OTEyOWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaW5mb3JtYXRpb24uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3Rpa3Rvay10dXJucy10by1uZXctdGFjdGljcy10by1zcHVyLWdyb3d0aC1hcy1ib29tLXRpbWVzLWVuZD9yYz13aGYwZmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcxNTg2NzEzLTJlNzEtNDQ3Ni1iOTNjLTQ4N2Q5NmNiNDY5OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaZqeMck_GnslJiQFHaLcXrtW8MNECNFx8NGnVQB3ABP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ftiktok-turns-to-new-tactics-to-spur-growth-as-boom-times-end%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd">sources</a> claim TikTok is developing a paywall feature that would let producers charge $1 (or a price of their choice) to access a given video. While it's not clear exactly how the system would work, this would help influencers profit directly from their hottest clips.</p><p>The social network is also considering a revamp of its Creator Fund amid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-stars-creator-fund-payouts-222006327.html">complaints about low payouts</a>, according to the sources. TikTok would require a much larger follower count (100,000 versus 10,000), but could pay eligible creators more as a result. The fund might also reward users who produce longer videos that make good use of the recently raised <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-time-limit-10-minutes-174130936.html">10-minute limit</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement to Engadget, TikTok didn't directly comment on the supposed plans but said it was "committed" to devising new ways to make the service "valuable and rewarding" for creators. It's not clear when the paywall would be available, but the revised Creator Fund could launch as soon as March. The company is reportedly testing the new funding system in Brazil and France.</p><p>The additional rewards might be necessary. While TikTok's American user base <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html">surged during the pandemic</a>, that audience levelled off in 2022. Paywalls and a new Creator Fund could keep social media stars posting videos on TikTok where they'd otherwise drift toward Instagram or Snapchat. The firm already has a YouTube-style program that shares ad revenue, but it's only available to a handful of top-tier users.</p><p>Any boost is contingent on TikTok surviving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-tiktok-convince-the-us-its-not-a-national-security-threat-173030115.html">allegations that it's a national security threat</a>, mind you. Federal and state politicians are pushing to ban TikTok on at least government devices over concerns the Chinese government might use the app for spying and propaganda. The company has long denied these accusations, and its CEO is poised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-ceo-congress-shou-zi-chew-privacy-security-china-201928160.html">testify before a House committee</a> in March. If it can't persuade officials, however, any US growth strategy could quickly fall apart.</p>

<p>An artificial intelligence agent recently flew the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lockheed%20martin/"><ins>Lockheed Martin</ins></a> VISTA X-62A training aircraft for over 17 hours. VISTA (which stands for Variable In-flight Simulation Test Aircraft) can use software to simulate the performance characteristics of other aircraft. On this occasion, it mimicked a human pilot instead.</p><p>The flight took place during a testing period in December. This is the first time that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ai/"><ins>AI</ins></a> has been engaged in such a way on a tactical aircraft, Lockheed says. The aim is to use the platform to test aircraft designs that can be flown autonomously.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;VISTA will allow us to parallelize the development and test of cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques with new uncrewed vehicle designs,&quot; US Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) director of research Dr. M. Christopher Cotting <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2023-02-13-VISTA-X-62-Advancing-Autonomy-and-Changing-the-Face-of-Air-Power"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>. &quot;This approach, combined with focused testing on new vehicle systems as they are produced, will rapidly mature autonomy for uncrewed platforms and allow us to deliver tactically relevant capability to our warfighter.&quot;</p><p>Lockheed's skunk works division worked with Calspan to build VISTA for the USAF TPS at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Among other things, the VISTA program <a href="https://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article19.html"><ins>has been used</ins></a> to develop the virtual heads-up display and voice command input system for the F-35 Lightning II.</p><p>The USAF recently upgraded the VISTA X-62A with Lockheed's Model Following Algorithm (MFA) and System for Autonomous Control of the Simulation (SACS). When integrated, these systems help VISTA carry out advanced flight tests that harness autonomy and AI.</p>

<p>After far too many delays to count, <em>Dead Island 2 </em>has a new release date once more. This time, however, publisher Deep Silver is pushing the game up by a week. Instead of arriving on April 28th as previously planned, the game will now hit consoles and PC on April 21st. “You asked for it, you got it. <em>Dead Island 2</em> went gold and it’s coming out a week early,” the company said on Twitter.</p><p>Notably, the change of release date means <em>Dead Island 2 </em>won’t land on the same day as <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>.

## Blue Origin made solar cells by smelting simulated Moon dust

<p>Whether or not Blue Origin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-moon-artemis-172023096.html">puts a lander on the Moon</a>, it might play a key role in sustaining lunar operations. Jeff Bezos' spaceflight company has <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/blue-alchemist-powers-our-lunar-future/">revealed</a> that it can produce solar cells and transmission wire using simulated Moon regolith. The firm's Blue Alchemist technique uses molten electrolysis to separate the lunar soil's aluminum, iron and silicon from bound oxygen to extract key materials. The process can build solar cells, cover glass and aluminum wire using only sunlight and the reactor's silicon.</p><p>This approach would not only save explorers the trouble of importing material, but would be kinder to both the Moon and Earth. There are no carbon-based emissions, no chemicals and no need for water. The resulting solar cells can operate on the Moon for over a decade despite a &quot;harsh&quot; environment, Blue Origin claims.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>Ars Technica</em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/blue-origin-makes-a-big-lunar-announcement-without-any-fanfare/">explains</a>, Blue Origin is pitching this as a solution for NASA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-1-moon-mission-successfuly-returns-to-earth-175007566.html">Artemis program</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-program-explained-moon-mars-colonization-video-143013129.html">missions to Mars</a>. The space agency could establish bases or other long-term installations while minimizing the environmental impact. While the concept of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html">using regolith to build outposts</a> isn't new, earlier efforts have largely focused on habitats rather than the power supplying those off-world facilities.</p><p>Whether or not Blue Origin's tech reaches NASA is another matter, as the company has a mixed relationship with the US administration. While NASA is backing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-backs-blue-origins-orbital-reef-space-station-220247282.html">Orbital Reef space station</a> and will use New Glenn to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-new-glenn-escapade-science-mission-mars-110049165.html">fly a science mission to Mars</a>, it lost a key lunar lander contract to SpaceX and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">failed in its challenge</a> of the $2.9 billion deal. As novel as Blue Alchemist tech may be, it's not guaranteed to win business.</p>

<p>Whether you’re heading to a physical campus, taking classes online or a mix of both, a laptop is sure to be the control center for your studies. Getting a new machine can better help you stay on top of your schedule and handle your furious multitasking with dozens of tabs devoted to research while you write your essays. Given we’re still dealing with ongoing inflation and the global chip supply shortage, you might be concerned about rising prices or what might be in stock. The good news is, companies are still making a ton of new notebooks, and there are plenty of models for you to consider. We compiled this guide to help you choose the best laptop for college.</p><div id="41f8c2a853214211ba83ad965192cfa4"></div><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Since the introduction of Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks and Windows 11 last year, not much has changed significantly. Apple unveiled its new M2 system-on-chip (SoC), alongside two laptops that are equipped with it, including a redesigned MacBook Air. Meanwhile, new PCs keep getting announced, with models this year typically powered by 12th-gen Intel processors or the latest AMD Ryzen chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though the shift to ARM-based systems has been successful for Apple, the PC industry is still struggling to keep up, and Windows on ARM is still tough to recommend. Snapdragon laptops may look and feel sleek, offer excellent battery life and built-in cellular radios, but they’re typically quite expensive, especially considering their limited app compatibility.</p><p>Speaking of, most laptops with top-of-the-line specs can cost you around $1,800 to $2,000 these days. For most college students, though, a midrange machine might be enough. Depending on your field of study, you could get by with an Intel Core i3 processor or equivalent, with at least 6GB of RAM. If you need to run specialized software for design or programming, consider upgrading to a beefier system with more memory. On the other hand, if you do most of your coursework online or in a browser, getting a Chromebook could save you a lot of money.</p><p>You’ll also want to pay attention to a device’s weight. There are a lot of premium ultraportables in the 13-inch category, with chips like Intel’s Core i3 or i5, that cost around $1,000. And if that’s too expensive, you’ll still have respectable options in the $600 to $800 range, but they might be heavier and use older, slower processors. I’ve included our favorite budget-friendly model in this best laptop for college roundup but we also have a complete guide to more-affordable laptops that you can check out as well.</p><p>With some laptop makers deciding to get rid of headphone jacks this year, it’s important to check specs lists when you’re shopping for newer machines. If you don’t have wireless headphones or use equipment that plugs into the 3.5mm jack, you’ll want to steer clear of devices like Dell’s new XPS 13 Plus.</p><p>Finally, while most laptops in 2022 offer WiFi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, the compatible routers or other devices that would enable those faster connections aren’t very prevalent yet. Chances are, your campus WiFi might still be stuck on an older setup, so it’s not crucial that you get a system with the latest standards yet. Of course, it doesn’t hurt to get a laptop that’s future-proof, but just know that of all the things to look out for, WiFi 6E shouldn’t be a dealbreaker in your decision-making process.</p><h2>Best Apple: MacBook Air</h2><p></p><p>It's hard to beat Apple's MacBook Air if you want a powerful machine for college that won't weigh you down. You actually have two good options this year — the new <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLU1hY0Jvb2stTGFwdG9wLWNoaXAvZHAvQjBCM0M3TUpYMz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1oby0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDAzM2UyYjUtNjEwZS0zZjE1LTlkNTYtYWE3NGI1ZDM4OGUzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS2g6tUfy0de3kh1TCAN5Rh6tsNdEniZSnm0Gki9uVyN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3C7MJX3">M2-powered MacBook Air</a> and the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhONUtXQjlIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWhvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMDMzZTJiNS02MTBlLTNmMTUtOWQ1Ni1hYTc0YjVkMzg4ZTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATv3O9c5WIi1z-l-9iX6Si4gyiPWMALovPEEa0Cqgp3E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5KWB9H%3F">MacBook Air M1</a>. The M2 laptop earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">score of 96</a> from us for its impressive performance, gorgeous 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and its refined design that's even thinner than the M1 machine that came before it. Our biggest gripe with this laptop is its price — the M2 MacBook Air will set you back $200 more than the M1, so you're looking at spending at least $1,199 if you want the latest and greatest from Apple.</p><p>However, even though it’s older, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3HSUbz2">Apple M1 MacBook Air</a> is a solid machine, outperforming many PCs while maintaining a fanless design. You’ll still get a great keyboard and excellent battery life, along with a nice Retina display. Of course, it uses a 720p webcam, while the new model has a sharper 1080p setup housed in a notch. The latter also has thinner display bezels that make it look more modern, as well as a MagSafe port that lets you keep charging while still having access to the device’s two USB-C ports. But if you’re already living a largely wireless life and don’t mind a not-so-great camera, you might find the M1 MacBook Air is a better deal.</p><h2>Best Windows: Dell XPS 13 Plus</h2><p></p><p>The best PC has long been Dell’s well-rounded XPS 13 series and I still recommend it to anyone that doesn’t want a Mac. Yes, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMveHBzLTEzLXBsdXMtbGFwdG9wL3NwZC94cHMtMTMtOTMyMC1sYXB0b3A_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMDMzZTJiNS02MTBlLTNmMTUtOWQ1Ni1hYTc0YjVkMzg4ZTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUX8XHAEwjau-62bVaFlPDBPdkUGpU08OVgl-J6jl2rX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-13-plus-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9320-laptop%3F">new XPS 13 Plus</a> lacks a headphone jack, and we haven’t got one in to test yet. But the XPS 13 is a well-rounded machine and reliable workhorse that will get you through classes and late-night writing sessions without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dells-xps-13-plus-ultraportable-no-headphone-jack-180043410.html">XPS 13 Plus</a> offers a lovely OLED screen with impressively thin bezels and packs a roomy, comfortable keyboard. It also features a new minimalist design that looks more modern. I’m not sure about the row of capacitive keys at the top in lieu of traditional function keys, but from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dells-xps-13-plus-ultraportable-no-headphone-jack-180043410.html">our time with an early sample</a>, they at least worked.</p><p>If you don’t like the changes Dell has made to the XPS 13, or if you definitely need a headphone jack, the older generations are still solid options. There’s also the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-2-pro-360-hands-on-price-specs-availability-180001246.html">Samsung Galaxy Book 2 Pro series</a>, which feature beautiful OLED screens and sharper webcams in thin and light frames. I also like Microsoft’s Surface Laptops, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-4-review-2021-bigger-better-ultraportable-133047360.html">the most recent edition</a> offers great performance and battery life, albeit in an outdated design.</p><h2>Best for gaming: Razer Blade 15</h2><p></p><p>Just because your laptop might primarily be for school or work doesn’t mean you can’t use it for fun. Those looking to game on their machines should prioritize responsive screens and ample ports for their favorite accessories that can best help them defeat their virtual enemies. If you’re considering a gaming-first machine that you can use for school, check out our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">guide to buying a gaming laptop</a>.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-15-2022-review-a-real-treat-if-youve-got-the-cash-160032467.html">Blade series</a> is also one of the most polished gaming laptops around.</p><p>Students looking for something cheaper and more portable should consider the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-amd-ryzen-radeon-173016459.html">our favorite model</a> last year. The main reason it got bumped down a notch is because the 2022 refresh is almost $600 more expensive. It’s still a solid gaming laptop though, with an excellent display, roomy trackpad and plenty of ports in spite of its thin profile.</p><h2>Best Chromebook: Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook</h2><p></p><p>If you can do most of your schoolwork through web-based apps, a Chromebook is worth considering. Sure they don’t generally look fancy, nor have high-end specs. But they’re often more affordable and have longer battery life. Our favorite Chromebook is <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZW5vdm8tQ2hyb21lYm9vay1pMy0xMDExMFUtSW50ZWdyYXRlZC04MkI4MDAwNlVYL2RwL0IwODYzODNIQzc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taG8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAwMzNlMmI1LTYxMGUtM2YxNS05ZDU2LWFhNzRiNWQzODhlMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd3iiVuX3I6PEVbdROi-x46n1mE55T8QqYyBvPLttExd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-Chromebook-i3-10110U-Integrated-82B80006UX%2Fdp%2FB086383HC7">Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook</a>, which Engadget’s resident Chrome OS aficionado Nathan Ingraham described as “a tremendous value.”</p><p>This laptop nails the basics, with a 13-inch Full HD touchscreen, a fantastic keyboard and a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor. The 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage may sound meager, but in our testing the Flex 5 held up in spite of this constraint. It’s also nice to see one USB-A and two USB-C ports, eight-hour battery life and a 360-degree hinge that makes it easy to use the Flex 5 as a tablet. That’s a bonus, especially now that Chrome OS supports Android apps.</p><p>Though the Flex 5 is almost two years old by now, it’s a solid device for around $400. In fact, you can sometimes find it on sale for as little as $300, making it a great option for a student looking for a basic browser-based machine on a tight budget.</p><h2>Best budget: HP Pavilion Aero 13</h2><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a student laptop under $800, your best bet is <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YTBlODg3MC00Y2Y4LTRiZGEtOTM1Yy1hZjdjMDBjMjhlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHAuY29tL3VzLWVuL3Nob3AvbWRwL2xhcHRvcHMvaHAtcGF2aWxpb24tYWVybz8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAwMzNlMmI1LTYxMGUtM2YxNS05ZDU2LWFhNzRiNWQzODhlMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb5RLCce45eeCA5JYgIT6XCkjuzPkGWdxfiarysYXb8F&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Flaptops%2Fhp-pavilion-aero%3F">the HP Pavilion Aero 13</a>. For $750, you’ll get a Full HD screen with a 16:10 aspect ratio and surprisingly thin bezels, as well as a comfortable keyboard and spacious trackpad. Importantly, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html">Aero 13</a> provides relatively powerful components compared to others in this price range, with an AMD Ryzen 5000 series processor and Radeon graphics. Plus, it has a generous array of ports and enough juice to last you the entire work day and then some.</p><h2>Best Convertible: Microsoft Surface Pro 9</h2><p></p><p>For those who need their laptops to occasionally double as tablets, the Surface Pro series is a no-brainer. Compared to notebooks with rotating hinges, tablets with kickstands are often much slimmer and lighter.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">Pro 9</a> also has a 120Hz display that makes scrolling long documents or spreadsheets feel much faster, and you can drop the refresh rate down to 60Hz if you want to conserve battery life.</p><p>We also like Microsoft’s Type Covers and the Surface Pens, though it’s worth noting that they’ll have to pay extra for both if you want them.

## Bigscreen's first VR headset is supposedly the world's smallest

<p><a href="https://www.bigscreenvr.com/">Bigscreen</a> is best known for its namesake virtual social platform, but it's now getting into VR headsets — and it thinks it has a way to stand out in a crowd of powerful but bulky rivals. The company has introduced the Beyond, a PC-only wearable it claims is both the &quot;world's smallest&quot; VR headset and extremely light at just under 6oz with a strap. For context, even a simple competitor like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-flow-lightweight-vr-headset-150014421.html">HTC Vive Flow</a> weighs 6.6oz. This isn't a stripped-down device, either, as it includes two 5K (5,120 x 2,560) 90Hz OLED displays, six-degrees-of-freedom tracking and three-element pancake optics that reportedly eliminate the screen door effect (where you can see the gaps between pixels) while reducing bulk and providing a decent 93-degree horizontal field of view.</p><p>The company isn't relying on a marvellous new technology to achieve the size reduction. Rather, it's making a number of strategic sacrifices. Instead of adjusting knobs and other controls to get an ideal fit, Bigscreen asks you to scan your face using an iPhone app (sorry, Android fans) to produce a custom-fitted Beyond design. You even need to buy custom prescription lenses if you normally wear glasses. The six-degree tracking relies on external SteamVR Base Stations rather than built-in cameras, and built-in headphones are only available with an optional &quot;Audio Strap.&quot; You plug into a PC through a link box that supplies both video and power.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Bigscreen Beyond VR headset optics" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/a0b34b30-a89d-11ed-afa3-08894ae9e266" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bigscreen</div></figure><p>The Beyond supports the SteamVR platform and will work with any compatible controllers (including the Vive and Valve's Index) and full-body trackers. You'll need that compatibility, too, as Bigscreen doesn't ship controllers in the box. You'll need a reasonable powerful computer, too, with at least a quad-core processor and GeForce RTX 2070- or Radeon RX 5700 XT-class graphics.</p><p>The Beyond is available to pre-order today for $999, and will ship to the US in the third quarter of the year (read: summer). Canada and Europe will get their units in the fourth quarter, while Australia, New Zealand and Japan will have to wait until the very end of the year. Other countries are coming in 2024, Bigscreen says. The company chalks up the lengthy rollout to the longer manufacturing times needed for customized headsets.</p><p>Whether or not the Beyond is a good value may depend on your uses and expectations. It's less expensive than clunkier, lower-resolution alternatives like the $1,500 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html">Meta Quest Pro</a> and $1,099 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vive-xr-elite-hands-on-ht-cs-even-more-portable-answer-to-the-meta-quest-pro-ces-2023-203019745.html">HTC Vive XR Elite</a>, but those are also standalone headsets that include controllers and, crucially, can be shared with other users. You're also out of luck if you use games and apps that don't use SteamVR. If you meet all the criteria, though, this may be one of the few high-end headsets you can comfortably wear for extended periods.</p>

## The best gaming mouse in 2023

<p>If you regularly play games on a PC, a good mouse will give you greater control over your cursor, add a few more buttons you can customize to your liking and generally make your downtime more comfortable. In competitive games, the best gaming mouse won’t magically make you unstoppable, but its faster response time and extra inputs should make for a more pleasurable and responsive experience as you continue practicing.</p><p>Exactly which gaming mouse will work best for you is a matter of preference – how well its shape fits your hand and how well its feature set suits your particular gaming needs. Over the past three months, though, we set out to find a few options that might fit the bill, be they for FPSes, MMOs or anything in between. After researching dozens of mice, testing around 20, and playing countless hours of <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>CS: GO</em>, <em>Halo Infinite </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> (among others), here’s what we’ve found, with some general buying advice on top.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What to look for in a gaming mouse</h2><h3>Wired vs. wireless</h3><p>Buying a wireless gaming mouse used to mean sacrificing a certain level of responsiveness, but thankfully, that’s no longer the case. Over the last few years, wireless tech has improved to the point where the difference in latency between a good wireless gaming mouse and a tried-and-true wired model is barely perceptible.</p><p>Note, however, that we’re strictly talking about mice that use a 2.4GHz connection (over a USB dongle), not Bluetooth. Many wireless models support both connection options, which is great for travel, but Bluetooth’s latency is generally too high to be reliable for gaming.</p><p>Going wireless still has other trade-offs, too. Battery life is improving all the time, but with their higher performance demands and, oftentimes RGB lighting, wireless gaming mice tend not to last as long as traditional wireless models. You shouldn’t expect more than a few days of power from a rechargeable mouse you use regularly. Beyond that, good wireless gaming mice usually come at a much higher cost than their wired counterparts.</p><p>That’s not to say the premium isn’t worth it: Who wants yet <em>another</em> cable on their desk? Plus, you may need a wireless model if you hate the feel of “cable drag” or if your gaming PC is located in an awkward spot. Many wireless gaming mice come with a cable you can hook up in a pinch as well. But if price is any sort of concern, a good wired mouse is usually a better value.</p><h3>Comfort and grip types</h3><p>Everyone’s hands are different, so at the end of the day, calling one mouse “more comfortable” than another is mostly subjective. Ensuring your comfort is the most essential step when buying any mouse, though, so we’ve done our best to consider how each device we tested works with large, average-sized and small hands alike.</p><p>We also considered how each device accommodates the three grip styles most people use while holding a mouse: palm, fingertip and claw. As a refresher, a palm grip is when your whole hand rests on the mouse, with your fingers resting flat on the main buttons. A fingertip grip is when you steer the mouse solely with the tips of your fingers, with your palm not in contact with the device at all. A claw grip is when your palm only touches the back edge of the mouse, with your fingers arched in a claw-like shape toward the buttons.</p><p>In general, most people use a palm grip, which tends to offer the greatest sense of control – though, depending on the size of your hand, you may need your mouse to be a specific length to use it comfortably. A fingertip grip can allow for more rapid movements, while a claw grip is something of a balance between the two. <a href="https://switchandclick.com/mouse-grips/">Switch and Click</a> has a good breakdown if you’d like a bit more detail, but we’ll note below if a mouse isn’t well-suited for a particular grip style. For what it’s worth, yours truly is a claw gripper most of the time.</p><h3>Build quality and design</h3><p>A good gaming mouse feels sturdy and won’t flex or creak when used strenuously. We also valued mice without any overly sharp angles or grooves that could be awkward for most people to hold. And while most gaming mice have plastic exteriors, not all plastic is created equal, so we looked for finishes that were smooth, not too slick and capable of withstanding the sweaty palms that often come with competitive gaming sessions.</p><p>The gaming mouse market is mostly split between two design styles: ergonomic and ambidextrous. Ergonomic gaming mice are almost always made with right-handed users in mind and often feature dedicated thumb rests. Ambidextrous mice are more symmetrical and designed to be used with either hand (though they may not have extra buttons on both sides). Which shape works best for you is largely a matter of personal preference.</p><p>A gaming mouse’s feet, meanwhile, should provide a consistent glide and reduce the friction between your mouse and the surface beneath it as much as possible. For the best performance, look for feet made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene">PTFE</a> (aka Teflon). All feet will eventually wear down, but many mice come with spares, and most manufacturers sell replacements if needed.</p><p>As for flashy RGB lighting, it’s a nice bonus, but little more than that. Still, if you’ve already kitted out your setup with RGB, having a mouse with adjustable lighting effects can add to the fun (and more consumer tech could stand to do things for pleasure’s sake). More practically, some mice let you assign custom lighting settings to separate profiles, which can make it easier to see which one you’re currently using.</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>Gaming mice have gotten lighter and lighter in recent years, with some models we tested weighing as little as 45 grams. Your mouse doesn’t <em>need </em>to be that light – anything under 80g is still fairly low, and it’s not like a 100g mouse feels like an anchor. Regardless, a low weight makes it easier to pull off repeated fast movements, with less inertia. That said, some players still enjoy a little bit of bulk in their gaming mouse (relatively speaking), especially with games that aren’t as reliant on twitchy reactions.</p><p>To reach those lower weights, some manufacturers have released gaming mice with “honeycomb”-style designs, which come with several cutouts in the outer shell. These mice can still perform great, but having a bunch of holes that expose the internal circuit board to possible sweat, dust and detritus isn’t the best for long-term durability. We generally avoid recommending models with this design as a result.</p><h3>Switches, buttons and scroll wheel</h3><p>A growing number of gaming mice use optical switches instead of mechanical ones. Since these involve fewer bits making physical contact, they should generally be more durable and less prone to unwanted “double-clicks” over time. Mice with mechanical switches still have plenty of merit, but they carry a little more long-term risk in a vacuum.</p><p>Since most people will use their gaming mouse as their <em>mouse</em>-mouse, we valued models whose main buttons have a softer feel when pressed, with enough travel to make inadvertent actuations less frequent. But even this is a matter of preference: You may want lighter buttons if you play games that call for constant clicking. Also, we looked to testing from <a href="https://www.rtings.com/mouse/tests/control/latency">sites like Rtings</a> to ensure each mouse we recommend has a sufficiently low click latency, meaning your clicks will register with minimal lag.</p><p>Beyond the standard click panels, a good gaming mouse should also have customizable buttons for quick macros or shortcuts. For most games, shoot for at least two extra buttons on the thumb side that are easy to reach and difficult to press by accident. Lots of mice have more buttons, which can be a plus, but not if they force you to contort your fingers to avoid hitting them. For MMO mice, having at least 12 side buttons is preferable in order to access as many hotbar commands as possible.</p><p>As for the scroll wheel, it should have distinct, ratcheted “steps” that aren’t too resistant but make it clear when you’ve actually scrolled. Its texture should be grippy, and it shouldn't make any distracting amount of noise when used. The wheel should also be clickable, giving you another input to customize for certain games (e.g., to control the zoom on a sniper rifle).</p><h3>Sensors and performance</h3><p>Some are more proficient than others, but generally speaking, the optical sensors built into most modern gaming mice are more than fast and accurate enough for most people’s needs.</p><p>While shopping for gaming mice, you’ll see a number of terms related to sensor performance. To be clear, a gaming mouse’s responsiveness doesn’t come down to just one spec. But for clarity’s sake, here’s a rundown of the more noteworthy jargon:</p><ul><li><p>DPI, or dots per inch, is a measure of a mouse’s sensitivity. The higher the DPI setting, the more your cursor will move with every inch you move the mouse itself. Many gaming mice advertise extremely high DPIs that top out above 20,000 or 30,000, but that’s largely marketing fluff: Few people play above 3,000, with 800 a common sweet spot. This concept is also referred to as CPI (counts per inch), which <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/DPI-vs-CPI/">is probably</a> the more accurate term, though DPI is used more often.</p></li><li><p>IPS, or inches per second, refers to the maximum velocity a mouse sensor supports. The higher the IPS, the faster you can move the mouse before it becomes incapable of tracking motions correctly.</p></li><li><p>Acceleration goes with IPS. In this context, it refers to how many Gs a mouse can withstand before it starts to track inaccurately.</p></li><li><p>Polling rate is a measure of how often a mouse tells a computer where it is. In general, the more frequently your mouse reports information to your PC, the more predictable its response time should be. Anything at 500Hz or above is fine for gaming. The current standard, and likely the sweet spot for most, is 1,000Hz.</p></li><li><p>Lift-off distance is the height at which a mouse’s sensor stops tracking the surface below it. Many competitive players like this to be as low as possible in order to avoid unintended cursor movements while repositioning their mouse.</p></li></ul><h3>Software and onboard memory</h3><p>It doesn’t take long to find horror stories about bugs and other niggling issues caused by gaming mouse software, so the ideal app is one that doesn’t force you to use it all the time. It should let you adjust as many of the aspects above as possible, ideally to several distinct profiles. Preferably, you can save your settings directly to the mouse itself, letting you pick your customizations back up on another device without having to redownload any software. All this is most important on Windows, but Mac compatibility is always good to have, too.</p><h3>Warranty and customer support</h3><p>Most major gaming mice brands offer warranties between one and three years. The longer and more extensive a manufacturer’s program is, the better. This is the case with most consumer tech, but we note it here because the gaming mouse market is particularly flush with products from less-than-household names, many of which you may see hyped up on YouTube, Reddit or elsewhere around the web. A bunch of these more obscure mice are genuinely great, but if you ever buy from a more niche brand, it’s worth checking that some level of customer support is in place. We’ve made sure our picks aren’t riddled with an abnormal amount of poor user reviews.</p><h2>Best for most: Razer Basilisk V3</h2><p></p><p>Of the gaming mice we tested, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYXplci1CYXNpbGlzay1DdXN0b21pemFibGUtRXJnb25vbWljLUdhbWluZy9kcC9CMDlDMTNQWlg3P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTNlYjI4ZS00NzMwLTRhZDUtYjQwNi0yNzgzMWE3MGUwY2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYNGujdFBAVEMm9foxZdG5eh7mFBxuoug4tm7vcbQRFk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming%2Fdp%2FB09C13PZX7">Razer Basilisk V3</a> offers the most complete blend of price, performance, build quality and wide-ranging comfort. It’s typically available between $50 and $70, and for that price it provides a sturdy body with a pleasingly textured matte finish and a shape that should be comfortable for each grip type and all but the smallest of hands. It uses durable optical switches, and its main buttons are large, relatively quiet and not fatiguing to press repeatedly.</p><p>The Basilisk V3 has a total of 11 customizable buttons, including two side buttons that are easy to reach but difficult to press by accident. There’s a dedicated “sensitivity clutch” on the side as well, which lets you temporarily switch to a lower DPI for more precise aiming (though it's the one button that may be harder for smaller hands to reach without effort). Beneath those buttons is a well-sized thumb rest. The thumb wheel on top is loud and a bit clunky, but it can tilt left and right, and a built-in toggle lets it switch from ratcheted scrolling to a free-spin mode. That’s great for navigating unwieldy documents.</p><figure><img alt="The Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse rested on a black mouse pad, with RGB lighting emitting from its logo, scroll wheel and underside." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/732b7070-a983-11ed-bdf6-f5ef4cfb2312" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>At roughly 100 grams, the Basilisk V3 is on the heavier side for twitch shooters, but its PTFE feet let it glide with ease, and Razer’s Focus+ sensor helps it track accurately. The weight shouldn’t be a major hindrance unless you really take competitive FPS play seriously. (And if that's the case, see our premium recommendations below.) Either way, the included cable is impressively flexible, and the mouse’s RGB lighting is fun without being garish. Razer’s Synapse software is Windows-only and can be naggy with updates but makes it easy enough to set profiles and adjust DPI, polling rate, macros and RGB effects. You can also save up to five profiles to the mouse itself, though your lighting customizations won’t carry over.&nbsp;</p><p>The Basilisk V3 is an ergonomic mouse designed for right-handed use.

It’s pricey at $150, but its superlight (63g) wireless design and top-notch sensor make it exceptionally responsive. While smaller-handed folks may find it a bit too tall, most should find its gently curved shape to be comfortable over long gaming sessions, regardless of their grip type. Its two side buttons are largely easy to reach and nothing about its body creaks or flexes. The scroll wheel is soft and quiet, while the main buttons feel satisfying but not overly sensitive.

Its design is likely too small and flat for palm-grippers with large hands, its scroll wheel feels somewhat mushy, and its rubbery cable isn’t ideal. It uses mechanical switches, too. But the rest of it is smooth, reasonably light (85g) and sturdily built for the money, plus its shape plays well with fingertip or claw grips. It’s also available in snazzy lilac and blue finishes alongside the usual black or white.</p><p>There are two customizable buttons on the right side – plus a DPI cycle button on top – but the G203’s design is otherwise ambidextrous. The RGB lighting around the bottom of the device is tasteful, and Logitech’s G Hub software makes it simple enough to tweak settings on both Windows and macOS. There's no onboard memory, however.</p><figure><img alt="A blue Logitech G203 Lightsync gaming mouse rested on top of a black mouse pad on a desk." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/cc5d9b50-a983-11ed-bf1f-b86f44596c8e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>While the Logitech Mercury sensor within the G203 is a few years old and technically lacking compared to most newer alternatives, it’s consistent and responsive enough to yield few complaints. The set of PTFE feet help, too. You wouldn’t go out of your way to get the G203 to win competitive games of <em>Counter-Strike</em>, but it’s perfectly fine for most games.</p><p>If you’d rather get a wireless mouse on the cheap, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Mb2dpdGVjaC1MSUdIVFNQRUVELVdpcmVsZXNzLUdhbWluZy1Nb3VzZS9kcC9CMDdDTVM1UTZQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTNlYjI4ZS00NzMwLTRhZDUtYjQwNi0yNzgzMWE3MGUwY2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYf3W-S4Vvx_poFXUjQgQHIsSwEqIHylIVNzEzR4D4A-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-LIGHTSPEED-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse%2Fdp%2FB07CMS5Q6P">Logitech’s G305 Lightspeed</a> has more or less the same shape and build quality, but adds a more advanced sensor.

It’s ancient, having launched <a href="http://engadget.com/2012-06-14-logitech-g600-mouse-targets-button-craving-mmo-gamers.html">way back in 2012</a>, and as such it uses mechanical switches and a laser sensor (the Avago S9808) that can be less precise than a more modern optical sensor. It’s hefty at 133g, and it has a wide body that’s not ideal for small hands or fingertip grips. Plus, its cable isn’t particularly flexible, and its scroll wheel and main buttons are just <em>OK</em>.</p><p>Hear us out, though. The G600 is far from the only mouse in this style to be on the larger side, and any performance shortcomings it may have will be difficult to notice in an MMO. Outside of faster action games, it tracks fine. For large and average hands, particularly those that use a palm grip, the G600’s sloped shape should be comfortable. Plus, the scroll wheel can tilt left and right.</p><figure><img alt="The Logitech G600 MMO gaming mouse rested on top of a black mouse pad on a desk." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/eea5b300-a983-11ed-8bf6-35696c0ca225" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>The most important thing an MMO mouse can do is let you access several in-game commands with minimal effort. The G600 does that, supplying 12 customizable side buttons that are angled in a way that distinguishes them without constantly forcing you to look down. Few MMO mice make these buttons “easy to reach,” but the G600 does about as well as one can.</p><p>The mouse’s killer feature, however, is a third click button, which sits under your ring finger and brings up an entire second set of commands when pressed. This means you can access up to <em>24</em> different inputs with just one hand, which is a godsend in MMOs that ask you to juggle multiple hotbars’ worth of commands. Being able to get through your “rotations” in a game like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> without having to contort your fingers around the keyboard is hugely convenient. This feature isn’t exclusive to the G600, but it’s not commonplace either. Best of all, this mouse is affordable, typically retailing around $35. There are certainly <em>nicer</em> MMO mice available, but the G600’s functionality is enough to make it the best value in its market.</p><h2>Other honorable mentions</h2><figure><img alt="A white gaming mouse called the Ninjutso Sora rested on top of a black mouse pad on a desk." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/0afb9330-a984-11ed-8fc1-932404a51991" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODJMUk1ZNTM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta3AtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhM2ViMjhlLTQ3MzAtNGFkNS1iNDA2LTI3ODMxYTcwZTBjYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXFmNxidvZLA2UOMdo60bwleREGcJYUGfDFFS1r62wic&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB082LRMY53">Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite</a> is a better-built alternative to the G600 with a more modern optical sensor.

## The Morning After: A Japanese restaurant combats 'sushi terrorism' with AI cameras

<p>Many people in Japan have been outraged by a recent trend dubbed &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/japanese-conveyor-belt-restaurant-ai-cameras-sushi-terrorism-204820273.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">sushi terrorism</a>.&quot; Videos across social media show people carrying out all kinds of unhygienic acts, like licking the spoon for a container of green tea powder. Another video, which has more than 98 million views on Twitter, showed a person licking the top of a soy sauce bottle and a teacup's rim before putting them back at a branch of the Sushiro chain. The company said it has replaced all the soy sauce bottles and cleaned every cup at the affected restaurant.</p><p>To combat this gross trend, one chain, Kura Sushi, said it would use artificial intelligence to look for &quot;suspicious opening and closing of sushi plate covers,&quot; <em>Nikkei Asia </em>reported. The company plans to upgrade existing cameras, used to track the dishes customers take from conveyor belts to determine their bill, by early March. If the system detects suspicious behavior, it will alert employees.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Comcast is ending free Peacock access for Xfinity subscribers

<p>Comcast subscribers are about to lose a big perk: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-16-nbc-peacock-launch-details.html">free access</a> to Peacock streaming. Since it launched in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nbc-peacock-launch-everything-you-need-to-know-191032095.html">April 2020</a>, the ad-supported version of Peacock Premium has been provided to Xfinity TV and broadband customers at no charge. Starting on April 3rd, it will no longer be offered to new subscribers, and as of June 26th, existing customers won't get it either, NBCUniversal has confirmed to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/comcast-xfinity-subs-losing-peacock-free-access-1235520530/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p><p>The news was first noted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/10zyp5s/xfinity_will_stop_providing_peacock_premium_for/">Reddit</a> via screenshots posting more details. &quot;Customers will be presented with discounted offer details within the Peacock app,&quot; an internal message reads. &quot;Stay tuned for offer details and more information.&quot; NBCU has also sent messages to customers that they'll be able to purchase Peacock Premium at a discounted price, which has yet to be determined.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Last month, Peacock <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-stops-offering-its-free-tier-to-new-subscribers-195856662.html">stopped offering</a> the free ad-supported standalone service to new users. At the time, the company said it believed Peacock's paid tiers were the best way to experience the service. More likely, it's because despite counting 20 million subscribers in 2022, up 9 million from the year before, Peacock has yet to turn a profit for NBCU/Comcast.&nbsp;</p><p>The company's plan was always to phase out free Peacock access for Comcast users, a spokesperson told <em>Variety</em>. By next year, it aims to hit 100,000 hours of programing divided between original series, licensed TV, movies, live sports and more. Its buzziest original hit right now is Rian Johnson's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poker-face-season-one-preview-160035861.html"><em>Poker Face</em></a>, and it also streams popular classic TV fare like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-25-the-office-netflix-nbc.html"><em>The Office</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
