  <p id="ANPMac">With the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 series, the company finally added temperature sensors to its smartwatches. The only thing was that the sensors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23310395/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review-smartwatch-wear-os-3#:~:text=Hardware%2Dwise%2C%20the,future%20health%20features.">didn’t really <em>do</em> anything</a> when the smartwatches launched last year. But that’s about to change. Samsung is partnering with fertility app Natural Cycles to bring <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-natural-cycles-partner-advanced-temperature-based-cycle-tracking-galaxy-watch5-series/">temperature-based period tracking to the wrist</a>.</p>
<p id="LMYfRs">Samsung’s <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-natural-cycles-partner-advanced-temperature-based-cycle-tracking-galaxy-watch5-series/">press release</a> says the feature will give users “more detailed insight” into their cycles but is a little vague on what those insights are. Advanced period tracking as well as digital fertility features come in several forms. For instance, Apple uses the temperature sensors on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables">Apple Watch Series 8</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps">Ultra</a> to give menstruating users retrospective ovulation estimates.

  <p id="3iMQH7"><em>Cosmic Smash</em>, a sports and puzzle game from Sega arcade systems and the Dreamcast, is being “reimagine[d]” for the PlayStation VR2, according to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/02/13/c-smash-vrs-reimagines-segas-iconic-futuristic-sports-puzzler-for-ps-vr2-demo-out-next-month/">a Sony blog post</a>. The new version will be called <em>C-Smash VRS</em> (which apparently “stands for VR and Versus”), and while it doesn’t have a release date yet, Sony has announced that it’ll be releasing a demo for the game on March 23rd. </p>
<p id="Pzx4rD"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru5zu53eErg">The trailer</a> shows off what appears to be a space theme and a small slice of gameplay where someone smacks a ball toward an opponent and wall. Sega advertised the original game as a mix of “virtual reality squash” and block-smashing gameplay, similar to titles like <em>Blasterball</em> or <em>Breakout</em>.

  <p id="pLnehO">Apple has released iOS 16.3.1, which includes “optimizations” for the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro’s Crash Detection feature that’s been criticized by some search and rescue personnel for setting off false alarms during winter activities like skiing and snowboarding. The update also includes fixes for iCloud settings and Siri requests for Find My, and Apple has released new software for tvOS, HomePods, and the Mac as well.</p>
<p id="wEeNGU">The Crash Detection feature on new iPhones and Apple Watches is meant to alert emergency services if you’re unresponsive after a “severe car crash” and is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213225">on by default</a>. But as people have been hitting the slopes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23547137/apple-iphone-crash-detection-emergency-sos-watch-snowboarding-skiing">some officials have said</a> that the feature’s resulted in several false reports that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fcanada%2Falberta%2Farticle-apple-devices-new-collision-feature-triggering-false-alarms-for%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F2%2F13%2F23598030%2Fapple-iphone-watch-crash-detection-winter-sports-ios-16-3-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tie up first responders’ time...</a></p>

  <p id="lvJqnU">One of the world’s biggest wind turbine manufacturers says it has a potentially groundbreaking solution for the industry’s enormous plastic waste problem. Last week, Vestas <a href="https://www.vestas.com/en/media/company-news/2023/vestas-unveils-circularity-solution-to-end-landfill-for-c3710818">announced</a> that it found a novel way to break the plastic in turbine blades down into virgin-grade material. That way, instead of cluttering landfills, it can be recycled to make new turbines.</p>
<p id="saNMqM">Here’s why that’s a tall order — like, literally colossal. Modern turbines with blades longer than the height of the Statue of Liberty are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590874/renewable-energy-coal-forecast-2025">quickly taking over</a> land and sea. They’re super sturdy, built to withstand the elements for decades. But once they’re decommissioned, they typically become waste. Globally by 2050, turbine blades are expected to become <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092134492100046X">43.4 million tons</a> of...</p>

<p id="Gw7ObN">Ford will develop the LFP batteries alongside China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.

  <p id="UOszN9">New York regulators have ordered the cryptocurrency firm Paxos to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD) — the <a href="https://coincodex.com/cryptocurrencies/sector/stablecoins/">third largest stablecoin</a> by market cap and pegged to the US dollar — over concerns that it can’t “safely” issue the token, as reported earlier by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-crypto-binance-stablecoin/new-york-regulator-says-paxos-unable-to-safely-issue-binances-stablecoin-idUSL8N34T42O"><em>Reuters</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-firm-paxos-to-stop-issuing-dollar-pegged-binance-token-94f65e52?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.</p>
<p id="8Q32tv">This comes as Paxos faces a potential lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the BUSD token. Sources close to the situation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-firm-paxos-faces-sec-lawsuit-over-binance-usd-token-8031e7a7">tell <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em> </em>that the agency is planning to sue the company “for violating investor protection laws.” The SEC reportedly sent a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wellsnotice.asp">Wells Notice</a> to Paxos — or a letter that the regulator uses to inform a company or individual of potential violations and enforcement actions.</p>

  <p id="ISRRld">Security camera company Arlo is reversing course on its controversial decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/2/23536194/arlo-eol-security-cameras-pro-baby-q-gen-3-lights-doorbell">to apply a retroactive end-of-life policy to many of its popular home security cameras</a>. On Friday, Arlo CEO Matthew McRae posted <a href="https://twitter.com/mbmcrae/status/1624122173144305667">a thread on Twitter</a>, announcing that the company will not remove free storage of videos for existing customers and that it is extending the EOL dates for older cameras a further year to 2025.

  <p id="qtABwG">The design of Sony’s next smartphone, rumored to be the Xperia 1 V, appears to have leaked in unofficial renders published over the weekend by <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1624323062492540930">OnLeaks</a> and <a href="https://greensmartphones.com/blog/sony-xperia-1-v-first-look/"><em>Green Smartphones</em></a>. And true to form, the company is doing… nothing too exciting, sticking with the same design as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23065641/sony-xperia-1-iv-announcement-hands-on-price-specs-zoom-screen">previous Xperia 1 IV</a>. Squint, and it’s hard to tell the two phones apart, with their vertical camera bumps, squared off edges, and tall aspect-ratio displays. </p>
<p id="4MfqFM">That doesn’t mean we’re expecting the Xperia 1 V to be identical to last year’s phone. <em>Green Smartphones</em> reports that its ultra-wide camera could be upgraded to use a 48-megapixel sensor (up from 12-megapixels), and there’s also a chance it could ship with 16GB of RAM rather than 12GB. Although the screen is...</p>
