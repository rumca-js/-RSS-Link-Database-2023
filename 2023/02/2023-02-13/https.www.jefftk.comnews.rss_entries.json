For\nexample, imagine someone's making a device that will run Linux.  They\nneed to tweak Linux so it will work on this particular device, and\nthey do that and sell you a copy.  Because Linux is under the GPL,\nhowever, they also need to publish the source code for their tweaks.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anti-agpl-proxy-1-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anti-agpl-proxy-1.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nThen along comes the web, and people no longer send out copies of their\nprograms.  Instead, the programs live on their server, and you talk to\nthem with your browser:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anti-agpl-proxy-2-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anti-agpl-proxy-2.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis means that even if a program is under the GPL, the people\ninteracting with it have no right to the source code.  This was called\nthe \"application service provider loophole\", and the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html\">AGPL</a> was\ncreated to fix it.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)\">Mastodon</a>\nis an example of AGPL software, and if you visit an instance you'll\nsee a little \"view source code\" link.  This isn't just something your\ninstance is doing to be nice&#8212;it's required by the AGPL.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOr is it?  A few months ago I read an <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30495647\">interesting\nargument</a> that you can easily bypass the AGPL: stick a \"proxy\"\nbetween the AGPL code and the user, which removes the source code\noffer:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anti-agpl-proxy-3-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anti-agpl-proxy-3.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHow is this compliant with the license?  The AGPL tells you that when\nyou modify the program you must preserve its \"offer the source to\nanyone who asks\" behavior:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nif you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently\noffer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer\nnetwork (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to\nreceive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access\nto the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge,\nthrough some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of\nsoftware.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe modified software still offers everyone the option to download the\nsource, but then a different piece of software that isn't covered by\nthe license runs a <code>sub_filter 'source_url' ''</code> and the\nuser doesn't actually receive the offer.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nCourts do care about intent and this is, of course, not what the AGPL\nauthors intended, but it's not clear to me that what they intended is\ncoherent?  They mechanism they chose, a license that controls what\nyou're allowed to do when making changes to the AGPL-covered software,\ndoesn't seem like it would be able to prevent someone from making\nuser-hostile changes to other systems between this software and the\nuser.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(Not a lawyer, just an engineer interested in this sort of thing. Over\ntime I've <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/moving-away-from-the-gpl\">moved to non-copyleft\nlicenses</a>, including for server-side software.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02K8nvsTFhPo2eMEvisRQMUo23ah2TG9EJdxugiaZfdJX4Ct25ZAVuYFeFtaZZd995l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109857845325510802\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/does-the-agpl-work", "date_published": "2023-02-13 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
