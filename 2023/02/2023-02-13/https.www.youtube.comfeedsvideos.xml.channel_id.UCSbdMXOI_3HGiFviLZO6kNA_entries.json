The CRAZY TINY VR Headset I've Been WAITING FOR!", "description": "I HAVE BEEN WAITING TWO YEARS FOR THIS. THIS IS THE BIG SCREEN BEYOND. Almost certainly the headset that will be replacing my Valve index.. but it's not entirely certain yet. Kind of crazy that BigScreen a primarily software company is getting into the hardware business. \n\nFair warning though; this is NOT for everyone. This isn't some mainstream VR headset that is meant for all consumers; it's very niche and pretty much built to JUST BE the best PCVR headset possible. So.. I can respect that. \n\nIf you have an Oculus Quest or Quest 2.. this probably just isn't for you. If you're a current index or Vive owner though.. well.. it just might be worth it.\n\n\nBigScreen Byond link:\nhttps://www.bigscreenvr.com/\n\nMy links:\nSupport Content Like this on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nDiscord: \nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Thrilluwu\nOutro Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Jwg...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mieWJ9vupqw", "date_published": "2023-02-13 21:13:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
