Their 3-0 victory against Ajaccio on Friday night makes Nice the form team in Ligue 1, with five wins and a draw from their last six matches. Few would have seen this coming when they sacked Lucien Favre a month ago. Favre had been successful in his first spell on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur and had guided them to the last 16 of the Europa Conference League this season but, after their shocking exit to amateur opposition in the Coupe de France and the threat of relegation increased due to Ligue 1 being reduced to 18 teams next season, the club\u2019s hierarchy decided they had to act.</p><p>French clubs are not known for taking risks when it comes to managerial appointments. The hiring of \u201cexperienced heads\u201d in Ligue 1 has been a consistent theme, recently illustrated by the well-traveled trio of Michel Der Zakarian, Eric Roy and Laurent Blanc being appointed mid-season. But some clubs have taken bigger risks of late. In the autumn, Troyes appointed the young Australian manager Patrick Kisnorbo and Reims installed the 30-year-old coach Will Still, who remains unbeaten in the league.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/13/nice-revitalised-bright-young-manager-didier-digard-ligue-1-will-still-reims\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/13/nice-revitalised-bright-young-manager-didier-digard-ligue-1-will-still-reims", "date_published": "2023-02-13 12:47:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Chinese foreign ministry says US also flies balloons over China", "description": "<p>Spokesperson says US overreacting and claims it has made at least 10 airspace incursions since start of 2022</p><p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has accused the US of flying high-altitude balloons over its airspace more than 10 times since the beginning of last year, as the dispute over surveillance between the two countries continues.</p><p>A spokesperson told foreign reporters at a regular press briefing in Beijing that it was \u201cnot uncommon\u201d for the US to go into other countries\u2019 airspace, claiming they were aware of at least 10 incursions over China, but gave few other details.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/13/chinese-foreign-ministry-says-us-also-flies-balloons-over-china\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/13/chinese-foreign-ministry-says-us-also-flies-balloons-over-china", "date_published": "2023-02-13 12:30:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Is Florida running out of orange juice?
