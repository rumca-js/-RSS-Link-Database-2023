<p>The league may want to pretend it has changed but TV coverage in the US reminded us that it remains in love with its own importance</p><p>With Tom Brady <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/01/tom-brady-retires-video-nfl-football-tampa-bay-buccaneers">finally, probably off the scene</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/13/patrick-mahomes-super-bowl-mvp-injury">the age of Patrick Mahomes upon us</a>, this year’s Super Bowl promised a new beginning for football in America, a kind of cultural reset after the Kaepernick-Trump years. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/rihannas-super-bowl-halftime-show-a-welcome-return-for-pops-relaxed-queen">Rihanna back on stage</a> for the first time in four years! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/10/patrick-mahomes-jalen-hurts-super-bowl-lvii-black-quarterbacks-nfl-football">Two Black quarterbacks facing off</a> for the first time in Super Bowl history! <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/fox/greg-olsen-analyst-reactions-tom-brady-super-bowl.html">Greg Olsen’s emergence</a> as America’s favorite play-by-play guy and the enduring gap-toothed charm of Michael Strahan! At each turn of the half-day behemoth that was Fox’s pre-game coverage, viewers were handed some fresh invitation to believe that we have entered a new era. But as kickoff grew closer and the jingoism thickened, a darker truth became clear: the NFL has not changed. It’s just found a new and bigger cast of characters to buy into its bullshit.</p><p>No country has America’s gift for blending sport, militarism, celebrity, and consumerism into a single package, and there’s no better demonstration of that gift than the Super Bowl. Fox, a network completely at ease with the death cult of modern America, is maybe the perfect home for an assignment like this, its on-air talents blending football pedigree and thoughtless patriotism in perfect, Super Bowl-ready proportion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/13/foxs-super-bowl-expertly-blended-nfl-pedigree-with-thoughtless-patriotism">Continue reading...</a>

## Nice look revitalised under bright young manager Didier Digard

<p>Digard is the latest youthful manager to take Ligue 1 by storm, following in the footsteps of Will Still at Reims</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Another weekend, another win for Nice. Their 3-0 victory against Ajaccio on Friday night makes Nice the form team in Ligue 1, with five wins and a draw from their last six matches. Few would have seen this coming when they sacked Lucien Favre a month ago. Favre had been successful in his first spell on the Côte d’Azur and had guided them to the last 16 of the Europa Conference League this season but, after their shocking exit to amateur opposition in the Coupe de France and the threat of relegation increased due to Ligue 1 being reduced to 18 teams next season, the club’s hierarchy decided they had to act.</p><p>French clubs are not known for taking risks when it comes to managerial appointments. The hiring of “experienced heads” in Ligue 1 has been a consistent theme, recently illustrated by the well-traveled trio of Michel Der Zakarian, Eric Roy and Laurent Blanc being appointed mid-season. But some clubs have taken bigger risks of late. In the autumn, Troyes appointed the young Australian manager Patrick Kisnorbo and Reims installed the 30-year-old coach Will Still, who remains unbeaten in the league.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/13/nice-revitalised-bright-young-manager-didier-digard-ligue-1-will-still-reims">Continue reading...</a>
