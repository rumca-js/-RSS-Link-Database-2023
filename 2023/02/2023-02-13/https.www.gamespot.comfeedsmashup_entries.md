<p>Developers on the original Metroid Prime have expressed frustration and anger at not being included in the credits of the recently released remaster.</p><p>Via a report from <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-e6e43a9d-510c-4746-ba2c-a855bf908692.html">Axios</a>, Zoid Kirsch, who was a senior engineer on the original game, posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoidCTF/status/1624487320132136960">Twitter</a> that he was "disappointed" that the original development team's name were not included in the remaster's credits. Technical lead engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_mathews/status/1624863182371135491">Jack Matthews quotetweeted Kirsch's statement</a> and said that the exclusion was a "travesty." Matthews also made a statement to Axios, "When my son plays Metroid Prime on the Switch for the first time, the fact that he won't see [my] and my colleagues' names in the credits as the original creators is a punch in the gut."</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">While many studios did amazing work on the remaster, I'm let down Metroid Prime's Remaster does not include the full original game credits. I worked with so many amazing people on the game and everyone's name should be included in the remaster, not just a single card like this. <a href="https://t.co/Yvojf9f9Mq">pic.twitter.com/Yvojf9f9Mq</a></p>  &mdash; Zoid Kirsch (@ZoidCTF) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoidCTF/status/1624487320132136960?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">February 11, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Currently, the game shows a title screen which reads, "Based on the work of Metroid Prime (Original Nintendo Gamecube and Wii Versions) Development Staff." The rest of the credits concern the remaster itself, listing the employees at various studios who contributed to the project. Other remasters Nintendo has published have included the original development team in the credits, such as Skyward Sword HD.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-metroid-prime-developers-express-frustration-at-being-excluded-from-remasters-credits/1100-6511491/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/">Apex Legends Season 16</a> is changing how character classes work. Starting with Season 16, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-new-character-classes-explained/1100-6511265/">the playable legends will be divided into five different classes</a>, each with its own perks. If you're a new player, however, you'll only have access to four of the five classes from the start. You'll have to buy into Controller.</p><p dir="ltr">The five new classes are Assault, Recon, Skirmisher, Support, and Controller. There are 23 playable legends in Apex Legends, but new accounts only start with six: Wraith, Pathfinder, Bloodhound, Gibraltar, Bangalore, and Lifeline. Wraith and Pathfinder are both Skirmishers, Bloodhound is Recon, Bangalore is Assault, and Gibraltar and Lifeline are Support. That means if you want to play as a Controller, you'll have to buy one.</p><p dir="ltr">Controllers specialize in area set-up and denial, possessing abilities that allow them to lock down and fortify a position so their squad can bunker down to heal, prepare an ambush, or plan their next move. These legends are also the only ones who can access the brand-new Ring Consoles, granting them information on the size and location of the next ring. There are four Controllers as of Season 16: Caustic, Wattson, Rampart, and Catalyst.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/only-four-of-apex-legends-season-16-five-classes-are-free-for-new-players/1100-6511487/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Overwatch 2's Surprisingly Good Dating Sim Is Packed With In-Jokes, Teases For The Future, And An Exciting Genji Reveal

<p>As part of Overwatch 2's Valentine's Day festivities, Blizzard has released a <a href="https://loverwatch.gg/en-us">limited-time dating sim</a> that gives players a shot at love with the winged-medic Mercy and everyone's favorite cyborg ninja, Genji. Though the short browser game-- cleverly-titled Loverwatch--is intended to be a brief, humorous, and explicitly non-canon experience, the dating sim is surprisingly delightful, packed with plenty of in-jokes and teases for Overwatch 2's future.</p><p>In Loverwatch, you are given the choice to pursue either Genji or Mercy as a romantic partner. Your journey begins in a comedy club, where you are tasked with delivering the right kind of joke to make your date laugh, and is followed by a romantic dinner in Morocco. Both characters then have a special third date, with its location dependent upon who you are attempting to woo. If you manage to make them fall in love with you by the end of the third date, you are then treated to a special scene offering a more intimate look at these heroes.</p><figure style="width: 1267px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4098647-asdasdasdf.png"><img alt="Genji removes his mask in Loverwatch." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4098647-asdasdasdf.png" /></a><figcaption>Genji removes his mask in Loverwatch.</figcaption></figure><p>While the concept and allure is simple, the fan service Loverwatch provides runs much deeper than merely seeing Mercy, Genji, and the game's Cupid, Hanzo, repeatedly blush. The game features countless in-jokes, such as Genji having a reputation for needing healing and Zenyatta never getting enough content or screen time. It also contains several fourth-wall breaks, as you the player are well-aware of Overwatch's lore while the cast of Loverwatch feigns ignorance.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-surprisingly-good-dating-sim-is-packed-with-in-jokes-teases-for-the-future-and-an-exciting-genji-reveal/1100-6511484/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Walter White's iconic underwear from Breaking Bad is now up for auction, but there are some important things to consider if you're thinking about plopping down major cash.</p><p>First and foremost, this is not the <em>exact </em>underwear worn by actor Bryan Cranston. This is a "decoration" pair of the tighty-whities. That's probably for the best, because, uhh, yeah.</p><div>          </div><p>The underwear is made of cotton and polyester, and has a waist measurement of 40 inches.

<p>Fan-voted mob The Sniffer is coming to Minecraft as part of the 1.20 update. You'll be able to check out the mob in Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock preview snapshot on February 15.</p><p>The Sniffer is an ancient creature that can be brought back from extinction with your help. It has a dog-like appearance, with a large snout and floppy ears, but has six legs and a back covered in moss. You can find Sniffer eggs at archeology sites near desert temples. Hatching the egg will reveal a baby Snifflet, which will grow up into the much larger Sniffer. Out in the world, the mob can sniff out ancient seeds, that you can use to grow bizarre, decorative plants.</p><p>The Sniffer was the winner of 2022's Minecraft live mob vote. During the yearly livestream, players can vote on one of three mobs that then will be included in an upcoming update. Previous winners were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-upcoming-allay-mob-will-help-you-collect-items-following-fan-vote/1100-6497172/">Allays</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-update-adds-glow-squid/1100-6486523/">Glow Squids</a>.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4098551-warioware.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Nintendo Switch exclusives are often resistant to price cuts, and it's not uncommon to see games launched years ago still listed for $60. But if you’re looking to add a few more titles to your Switch roster, consider checking out the current sales at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/search?q=Nintendo Switch Digital Download&amp;facet=special_offers:Reduced Price">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ci7RZacSLi7?u1=subid_value">Best Buy</a>. Both retailers have a variety of Switch games discounted to great prices.</p><p>The best part about these promotions is that most of the titles are great games that flew under the radar a bit. For example, <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Captain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker-Nintendo-Switch-Digital-Download/920946026?athbdg=L1700">Captain Toad Treasure Tracker</a> </span> is currently listed for just $29, down from $40, and is an incredibly clever puzzle game that almost all Switch owners will enjoy. In fact, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-switch-revi/1900-6416940/">Captain Toad review</a> said it’s “among the best Mario spin-offs” ever made and offers a “delightful iteration on old ideas.” So if you’re looking for something to keep you busy in the months leading up to Tears of the Kingdom, consider giving it a look.</p><p><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Super-Mario-Party-Switch-Nintendo-Switch-Digital-Download-56047/404887647?athbdg=L1600">Super Mario Party</a> </span> is one of the most popular games on sale, and it's down to just $39 from its usual $60. The party game gives you and your friends 80 mini-games to master--ranging from racing on tricycles and fishing to throwing pies at each other and solving memory puzzles.</p><p><span>Walmart and Best Buy are offering very similar deals, but Walmart's games are a buck cheaper in most cases, which is why we linked there for each game below.

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> you will constantly find yourself collecting new pieces of gear, which provide both offensive and defensive benefits when in combat. While swapping to a higher level piece of gear will provide you a step up in stats, you can improve your gear to provide extra benefits as well. Hogwarts Legacy starts displaying messages about improving your gear early in the game, but you will need to progress a little bit before you have access to the system. Here's how to upgrade your gear in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">You need material from beasts</h2><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4098638-beasts.png"><img alt="Caring for the beasts you capture produces the materials necessary to upgrade your gear." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4098638-beasts.png" /></a><figcaption>Caring for the beasts you capture produces the materials necessary to upgrade your gear.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Shortly after attending Beasts class for the first time in Fall and completing all available story quests at that time, Professor Weasley will send you an owl letter saying she has something new available in the Room of Requirement, starting the story quest <strong>"The Elf, The Nab-Sack, and The Loom." </strong>This quest is given by Deek, the house-elf that resides in the Room of Requirement. During this quest you will be given a tutorial on how to collect beasts in the wild and how to care for them when they are kept in the Room of Requirement.</p><p dir="ltr">You will collect a Puffskien, Jobberknoll, and a Mooncalf, which will provide the necessary materials for upgrading the first tier of your gear.

<p dir="ltr">Activision has released the official launch trailer for Season 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Modern Warfare 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone 2</a>. The second season adds a Japanese theme with the new Ashika Island map for battle royale and DMZ.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 2 launch trailer shows brief moments of action on Warzone 2's new Ashika Island map. The Japanese-themed island is a smaller, secondary map designed for Warzone 2's Resurgence respawn modes and DMZ, and the map will have seven main points of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Ashika Island, the Al Mazrah map is also getting a change to an existing point of interest. The trailer shows just a glimpse of the added crash site to the Caves location, which longtime fans might recognize as the crashed plane from the Afghan map in 2009's Modern Warfare 2. Al Mazrah's Caves already mimicked much of the design from the Afghan map, but the iconic crash site was previously missing from the area.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-and-modern-warfare-2-season-2-launch-trailer-highlights-ashika-island-map-and-more/1100-6511481/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> puts you in the shoes of a fifth-year student at the school, learning magic for the first time. While there are plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-best-spells-all-spells-guide/1100-6511417/">other spells</a> available, you have the option to learn and use the <strong>three Unforgivable Curses; Crucio, Imperio, and Avada Kedavra</strong>. Crucio causes someone immense pain, Imperio controls them, and Avada Kedavra kills. These spells are illegal to use in the world of Hogwarts Legacy, but that doesn't mean you can't have them at your disposal if you want to. Here's how to learn the Unforgivable Curses and any potential consequences to using them. <strong>Some story spoilers below.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Consequences of Dark Magic</h2><p dir="ltr">As for the consequences of using Dark Magic, there really aren't any. There is no morality system in Hogwarts Legacy, nor are there choices that lead down different paths. Any NPCs that are with you when you use them might have a shocked reaction and might verbally berate you for using them, but there won't be any gamified punishments.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-how-to-use-unforgivable-curses-and-the-consequences-of-using-them/1100-6511476/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## After Lightfall Launches, Destiny 2 Is Shaking Up Its Seasonal Model

<p>A new expansion for Destiny 2 also means multiple seasons of activity, but 2023 and beyond will see the seasonal model overhauled. The Witch Queen era of Destiny 2 delivered four seasons of content, with each one of these three-month events having a consistent sense of design. Post-Lightfall, Bungie plans to experiment with "substantial iterations" to its seasonal model, beginning with Season 20, Season of Defiance.</p><p>According to game director Joe Blackburn, numerous seasonal quality-of-life changes will be introduced, with an eye on reducing complexity through the game's progression systems. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-will-see-umbral-engrams-retired/1100-6510876/">Umbral engrams and Umbral energies are being retired</a>, and all you'll need to focus an engram into a particular seasonal weapon or armor will be a seasonal engram and some Glimmer. Seasonal engrams will also be stored and tracked on seasonal vendors, freeing up inventory space for Guardians.</p><p>The other big change here is that you'll no longer need a seasonal currency to unlock a chest at the end of an activity. Instead, singular keys throughout your playtime will be dropped and can be used to gain extra rewards from a chest at the end of a seasonal activity. Keys won't drop every time an activity is completed, but the base rewards for each seasonal activity completion will be better and will thus create more meaningful bonuses.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-lightfall-launches-destiny-2-is-shaking-up-its-seasonal-model/1100-6511458/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Expect Destiny 2 To Feel More Challenging During The Year Of Lightfall

<p>With the introduction of Stasis in Beyond Light and the gradual rollout of 3.0 subclasses across The Witch Queen era of Destiny 2, players were able to build their Guardians into powerful defenders of humanity. Once Lightfall launches though, expect a stiffer challenge as Bungie begins fine-tuning the baseline difficulty of the game.</p><p>While multiple difficulty levels in content such as campaigns, Nightfalls, secret missions, dungeons, and raids will still be offered, the studio is looking to bring more challenging content back to the game via a two-pronged approach. According to game director Joe Blackburn, the first part involves tuning abilities across the board for both PvE and PvP.</p><p>"Destiny is a game about guns and powers; we want both to shine," Blackburn said in a Bungie blog post. "So, starting with Lightfall, we are moderately increasing ability recharge time across a wide selection of our abilities as mentioned in the ability tuning preview last week. With the buildcrafting updates in Lightfall, we believe great builds will be much more accessible to the community, and while we still want your gear and your mods to be critical, some of the buffs to Guardians’ damage and survivability were just a bit too strong in the old system, and so we’ve taken this opportunity for a balancing patch to gear-driven buffs."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expect-destiny-2-to-feel-more-challenging-during-the-year-of-lightfall/1100-6511461/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Weapon Crafting In Destiny 2 Will Evolve Throughout The Year Of Lightfall

<p>Beyond a new subclass of space magic that'll allow Guardians to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-strand-before-lightfall-launches/1100-6511205/">manipulate the threads of life</a>, Destiny 2's other driving gameplay core is its gunplay. For the Lightfall expansion and the year ahead, Bungie is looking to find the right balance between obtaining weapons and crafting them. One of these major changes will be a smaller pool of craftable weapons, while other weapons can be "enhanced" so that they can stand on equal footing with their customized brethren.</p><p>Game director Joe Blackburn explained in a new Bungie blog post that the studio's goal is to "create independent chases for both crafted and non-crafted weapons starting with Lightfall. Fewer total weapons will be craftable and more of the weapons with long-term sources will get value from random perk rolls. This will in turn allow non-crafted weapons to "stand toe-to-toe" with crafted weapons in Lightfall, and more non-crafted weapons--starting with new Raid Adepts this year--will have the ability to be enhanced.</p><p>Enhancing a weapon allows for these tools to be leveled up while gaining access to both enhanced perks and enhanced intrinsic properties. The catch here is that only the enhanced versions of the perks and Masterwork that are already on the version of the weapon you are enhancing will be available. With enough time and resources, a weapon with a random roll of perks can be enhanced to rival the full power of a crafted weapon.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weapon-crafting-in-destiny-2-will-evolve-throughout-the-year-of-lightfall/1100-6511466/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Like previous games in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k23/">WWE 2K23</a> will have a sizable roster of superstars and legends to play as. The full list of available superstars include roster regulars such as Gunther, Drew McIntyre, and Sami Zayn, while dozens of other WWE superstars who haven't received much screentime lately have also made the cut. For nostalgic fans of sports entertainment, you'll be able to once again step into the ring as heavyweight icons like Booker T, Triple H, and Stone Cold Steve Austin.</p><p>Where things get interesting is with the selection of wrestlers that are traditionally locked away behind a DLC paywall. For WWE 2K23, the first DLC pack is focused purely on one of the most star-studded rosters of rookies to ever graduate from Ohio Valley Wrestling and includes Brock Lesnar, John "The Prototype" Cena, Randy Orton, and Dave Bautista when he was known as Leviathan. All four men became huge stars in WWE when they joined the RAW and Smackdown rosters in 2002, holding multiple title reigns and headlining Wrestlemania as main event attractions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bad Bunny will be available as a preorder bonus, bringing his high-flying style to the ring. The performer has appeared several times in a WWE ring in the year, and has earned rave reviews for his ability to work with WWE performers and put on a great match. WWE games usually have several of these DLC packs available throughout the year, with last year's WWE 2K22 offering superstars from the past such as Rikishi, Doink the Clown, and Rob Van Dam alongside more current faces.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k23-growing-roster-has-almost-200-superstars-so-far/1100-6511472/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Last week, Apex developer Respawn Entertainment revealed that Season 16 would go live at the same time as the new Anniversary Collection Event. Today, the developer gave players a preview of what to expect from the new event via a trailer released on YouTube and Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">Keeping in line with Revelry's party theme, the Anniversary Collection Event is all about celebrating Apex's fourth birthday (which was February 4). These events have been especially prevalent this season, with three back-to-back Collection Events taking place in Season 15 alone. But unlike the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-announces-new-celestial-sunrise-collection-event-featuring-new-hardcore-ltm/1100-6510692/">Celestial Sunrise Collection Event</a>'s somewhat underwhelming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-unveils-170-peacekeeper-skin-and-players-are-furious/1100-6510854/">$170 Peacekeeper skin</a>, the new Anniversary Collection Event features the ultimate prize for collecting all 24 premium cosmetics: a free set of Heirloom Shards.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-heirlooms-guide/1100-6495067/">Heirloom Shards</a> are a coveted item among Apex players, as they allow any item in the Mythic Store--that is, Heirloom Weapons and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-prestige-bloodhound-skin-everything-you-need-to-know/1100-6500308/">Prestige Skins</a>--to be unlocked. Players are guaranteed one set of Heirloom Shards for every 500 Apex Packs opened. The only way to guarantee that you obtain a specific Heirloom Weapon is to either open 500 Apex Packs (for a total of $500 USD) and use the Heirloom Shards you receive to purchase an item from the Mythic Store, or purchase every single items in the Collection Event that features the weapon you desire as a reward. The latter option is the cheapest way to get ahold of a Mythic-tier item, as completing a Collection Event only costs about $170 USD.

<p>In The Last of Us Part 1, brothers Henry and Sam are survivors making their way into the world and looking out for one another.

## PlayStation's Super Bowl Commercial Wasn't What Fans Were Hoping For

<p>PlayStation's new "Live From PS5" ad campaign continued on Sunday night with a special commercial for the Super Bowl. It didn't air on TV with the rest of the trailers and commercials--at least not in the US--but people who followed PlayStation Canada's Instagram account got to see the new video. Unfortunately, for some, it wasn't the kind of video they were hoping to see.</p><p>PlayStation Canada <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-teases-super-bowl-ad-with-god-of-war-hammer/1100-6511408/">promoted the Super Bowl spot earlier last week</a>, telling fans to tune in to the big game for some kind of video involving the God of War series and Fimbulwinter descending onto Arizona, the site of Super Bowl 57, to mark the beginning of the end of days. Given the association with God of War, some fans were expecting to see an announcement for God of War Ragnarok or something else for the wider PlayStation brand.</p><p>That didn't happen, though, as the video was instead another entry in PlayStation's Live From PS5 series, which is a take on news broadcasts. In the video, Kratos and Atreus race onto the field to try to stop the end of days, Ragnarok, from happening. The video also hypes up other PlayStation-related franchises like Gran Turismo and Final Fantasy, going on to say that strange events happening in the world may be explained by an "increase in activity on PS5."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-super-bowl-commercial-wasnt-what-fans-were-hoping-for/1100-6511463/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>During Super Bowl 57 on Sunday night, Lucasfilm debuted a new 30-second TV spot for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The new clip is made up of footage from past trailers and some brand-new sequences, including the dramatic conclusion featuring the main characters jumping out of a plane.</p><p>"A legend will face his destiny," reads the text from the trailer, in reference to Harrison Ford's character, Indiana Jones. He's joined by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Indy's goddaughter, Helena. John Rhys-Davies, who starred in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, returns in the new film. The movie's cast also includes Boyd Holbrook, Antonio Banderas, Shaunette Renee Wilson, Thomas Kretschmann, Oliver Richters, Ethann Isidore, and Mads Mikkelsen as the villain.</p><div>          </div><p>James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) directs The Dial of Destiny, which releases on June 30. Steven Spielberg, who directed the four previous Indiana Jones movies, is an executive producer alongside series creator George Lucas. John Williams is once again composing the score. He's composed the music for every Indiana Jones film dating back to the first one in 1981.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-indiana-jones-jump-out-of-a-plane-in-new-dial-of-destiny-super-bowl-commercial/1100-6511459/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tomb Raider Reloaded Review - Plenty Of Firepower

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Tomb Raider Reloaded, on paper, sounds like every mobile gaming detractor's worst nightmare. A successful IP coming to mobile via a simple gameplay loop, coupled with a currency-laden enhancement system, should be the formula for another example of the worst of what mobile offers. Why then, after hours of fighting through dungeons and avoiding traps with Lara and her crew, am I so interested in coming back for more? Tomb Raider Reloaded sounds like it should be the next mobile disappointment, but instead it offers plenty of dungeon-delving fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Tomb Raider Reloaded follows longtime series lead Lara Croft as she plunders for hidden treasure all across South America. Each location on the world map offers multiple stages--from 10 to upwards of 50--where players must help Lara dodge traps and/or fight enemies in order to get from the bottom of the stage to the door at the top. Swiping on the screen will have Lara move through the stage in the direction of the swipe, and whenever she stops moving, she'll open fire on the nearest enemies to her. After every stage is complete, multiple rewards are given to the player, who can use them to upgrade Lara and purchase supplies before moving onto the next location.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tomb-raider-reloaded-review-plenty-of-firepower/1900-6418026/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The last couple of months at the US box office has seen Avatar: The Way of Water break new records, with the film eventually rising up to become the third-highest grossing movie of all time, globally. The bad news for director James Cameron is that Avatar 2 has slipped back to fourth place in the rankings, and he has no one to blame but himself.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanic-is-back-in-theaters-for-valentines-day/1100-6510463/">A recent re-release of Titanic</a> saw fans flock back to theaters for a new Valentine's weekend viewing of the 1997 classic, with the film earning over $6.4 million in ticket sales domestically and $15.9 million internationally. Still clocking in at a butt-numbing three and 15 minutes in length, this version of the film is being screened in 3D 4K HDR with a high-frame rate. With a combined total of $22.3 million from that weekend release, that was enough for Titanic to reclaim its spot on the charts and send <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-2-now-no-4-all-time-holds-no-1-for-7th-straight-weekend/1100-6510960/">Avatar 2 back to fourth place</a>.</p><p>Cameron still has plenty of reasons to smile though, as out of the top five highest-grossing movies of all time, three of them are movies that he directed.

<p>In the post-apocalyptic world of The Last of Us, there are different kinds of Infected ranging from the fast and hungry Runners to the blind and even nastier Clickers that hunt their prey using a variation of echolocation. The top-tier of evolution for the Infected are called Bloaters. We saw a teaser of them in a marquette statue in a behind-the-scenes feature a few episodes back, but with the recent episode, we got our full glimpse of those fungal behemoths.</p><p>Created by four-time Emmy-winner prosthetics designer Barrie Gower, who did the prosthetics for HBO's Chernobyl mini-series as well as the monsters from Stranger Things and HBO's Game of Thrones. The specialized Bloater suit weighed about 88 pounds and was donned by the 6'6" British stuntperson, Adam Basil. Basil has provided stuntwork for some of the biggest names including Tom Hardy in Venom 2 and the Beast for Disney's Beauty and the Beast remake in 2017.</p><p>"The suit would be very soft, but very slimy and wet," Gower explained to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/artisans/features/the-last-of-us-bloater-makeup-1235518138/">Variety</a>. "We covered him in this gel-like solution, which gave him a gloss to all the fungus. We had lots of little spines and spiky hairs punched into his body, like little growths burrowing out...it was like a texture that we were building up, so we were constantly going in and slathering them in this gloss, just so the shapes would pick up in the silhouettes. We were repeatedly going in and gelling him up more, covering him in this lube, so he was nice and shiny."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-they-filmed-the-bloater-scene-in-the-last-of-us-episode-5-spoilers/1100-6511465/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Joel and Ellie appear to cover a lot of ground between the fifth and sixth episodes of The Last of Us. The newest trailer for the HBO series shows the pair rolling into a snow-covered Jackson, Wyoming, settlement, which sits over 1,000 miles west of Kansas City. Warning: Spoilers ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">The teaser begins with Ellie revealing to Joel that she tried to save Sam's life by using her blood on his infection spot. But as is obvious now, he replies that the cure is going to be more complicated than a simple transfusion. This exchange also highlights the grief Ellie feels after losing another person close to them.</p><p dir="ltr">Afterward, the video cuts to the duo on horseback, riding into the Wyoming settlement, where Joel seemingly finds his brother quickly.

## Hogwarts Legacy - How To Catch Shiny Beasts

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beasts-vivarium-capture-tame-guide/1100-6511394/">Vivarium</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> functions as a sanctuary for your animals. While you can tame a lot of creatures, most of them will be of the regular variant, with perhaps a slight change in color. However, there are rarer varieties that you can discover. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you catch <strong>rare Shiny Beasts</strong> for your Vivarium.</p><h2>How to make Shiny Beasts spawn</h2><p>The trick to getting a Shiny Beast in Hogwarts Legacy is making them spawn in the first place. This is completely random, and it can be quite a hassle. As such, your best bet is to do the following:</p><ul><li>Find a type of Beast that you want to capture and go to its den. Normally, you won't see a Shiny at all.</li><li>Even if a Shiny isn't there, go ahead and catch a few of them. For instance, Puffskein and Mooncalf dens tend to have four or more animals lounging around.</li><li>After getting a few or even all of them, open your map and press the button prompt to change the day-night cycle (i.e., "F" key for PC players).</li><li>Then, save your game manually.</li><li>Click on Restart From Last Save.</li></ul><p>The day-night cycle, plus save-reload trick is a way to force the game to repopulate an area with creatures if any are missing. As such, the animals that you caught earlier have a chance to respawn as Shiny Beasts.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-shiny-beasts-animals-guide/1100-6511447/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A high-ranking US military official has said the government cannot rule out aliens amid the unprecedented shootdown of mysterious aircraft in recent days over US and Canadian airspace.</p><p>United States General Glen VanHerck, who heads up NORAD and US Northern Command, was asked by reporters if he could rule out the possibility of extraterrestrials. He replied, "I haven't ruled out anything at this point," according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-charles-schumer-jake-sullivan-china-acc1a333326c50ee9649760c569c300f">Associated Press</a>.</p><p>US jets have shot down four objects in the past eight days.

<p>There's a lot of treasure to discover in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Some are cosmetic in nature, while others provide gear of different types. And, of course, there are those which are guaranteed to have high-end legendary gear. Here's our Hogwarts Legacy guide to help you find all the legendary chests in Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade.</p><h2>The basics when it comes to legendary chests</h2><p>As mentioned above, all Hogwarts Legacy legendary chests will give you legendary gear pieces. However, these scale <strong>based on your character's level</strong>. As such, it's better to hold off until much later in the campaign to make sure that your loot doesn't become useless as you're leveling up. Moreover, as with most other containers, the rewards are randomized: you're never sure of the item or equipment type you'd get. As such, you can do the save-reload trick, where you'll make a manual save before opening a chest to ensure that you obtain something you need.</p><p>Lastly, some of the Hogwarts Legacy legendary chests are in locations that need to be unlocked. For these, you'll have to acquire the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-how-to-unlock-doors-and-chests/1100-6511253/">Alohomora spell</a>. Not only that, Alohomora also needs to be upgraded by collecting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-demiguise-statue-moons-alohomora-upgrades-guide/1100-6511362/">Demiguise Statues/Demiguise Moons</a> in the game world.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-legendary-chest-locations-castle-hogsmeade-guide/1100-6511444/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is teasing "one last ride" in its Super Bbowl trailer, as the team prepares for one final mission together in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

But it isn't long before their lives are upended by the echoes of Rocket's turbulent past," The official film synopsis reads. "Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him on a dangerous mission to save Rocket's life--a mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them."</p><p>With Gunn moving over to the Distinguished Competition, teasers for the final Guardians film have been heavily hinting at one of the misfits meeting their end.

## The Flash Big Game Trailer Brings A Familiar Batman, Supergirl, And General Zod To The DC Universe

<p>The Superbowl trailer for The Flash has arrived, delivering the best look yet at Michael Keaton's returning dark knight, Kara Zor-El, and the surprising return of Man of Steel's General Zod. Caught between broken timelines is not one but <em>two </em>Barry Allens, as the original scarlet speedster's time travel shenanigans has managed to create a world without metahumans around to protect the Earth from Kryptonian invaders.</p><div>          </div><p>"Worlds collide in 'The Flash' when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past," the official synopsis reads. "But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no superheroes to turn to. That is unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian... albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe?"</p><p>One of the big elements that The Flash borrows from the Flashpoint mini-series is the idea that Superman did make it to Earth, but was quickly scooped up by the US government and imprisoned inside of a cell that was designed to dampen his powers entirely. Instead of Superman though--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-was-not-fired-from-new-superman-movie-because-he-was-never-cast/1100-6511027/">or Henry Cavill</a>--it's Supergirl AKA Kara Zor-El who has been imprisoned inside of a sunless cell. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flashs-first-poster-teases-batman-trailer-coming-to-the-super-bowl/1100-6511424/">Michael Keaton's Batman</a> is also sporting a newer--and nicer-- outfit in this film alongside a more acrobatic fighting ability, but he's still cursed with a costume that has his neck locked firmly in place.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-flash-big-game-trailer-brings-a-familiar-batman-supergirl-and-general-zod-to-the-dc-universe/1100-6511450/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
