The Richie Riches, and actual football fans who mortgage their homes to watch their favorite team win the "big game." Two notable elites were seen hanging out with each other. They also happened to be the two men most notable for breaking liberal brains: Rubert Murdoch and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-whiskey-marshmallows-cash" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>.</p><p>The site of the two men together scared the sh*t out of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-florida-law-banning" target="_blank">Don Lemon</a>.

Aliens. With all the "UFOs" being shot down over the weekend, Rupert assumes Elon knows something. I'm sure Elon does know something. If anyone has made contact with aliens, it would be Elon.

## While a train derailment causes an Ohio town to burn, Pete Buttigieg is upset too many whites are in construction

The rub is that this Administration doesn't care as much for the American people as they do their radical social agenda. That means hiring people based on who they are as opposed to their qualifications to handle important jobs. And if that's the way Biden wants to hire people, it's his administration.

<p>Ladies, I know all of your stomachs just dropped as you realized this <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/period-woman-explains" target="_blank">beautiful and brave individual</a> could easily steal your straight husbands.

<p>In the final shot of the video, Mulvaney appeared backstage and explained to viewers, <em>"You know I have a flair for the dramatics, but it's so good, right?

It could be the dress. Is it the makeup? Or is it the hair, because I think it's the extensions, and when I have extensions in, I don't know my name. I don't know where I live.

## WATCH: Rihanna grabs crotch, butt and sniffs hand before revealing she's pregnant in bizarre halftime show

And if you missed it, count yourself lucky. </p><p>For starters, her backup dancers looked like dystopian doctors in hazmat suits coming to arrest you for playing catch with your daughter in 2020.

<p>I remember when I was a kid, the halftime show used to be the most exciting part of the game. Now it consists of pop singers of varying degrees of mediocrity with increasingly bizarre acts. </p><p>On a slightly different note, Rihanna's appearance sparked rumors she was pregnant , and has since been confirmed by one of her representatives. Which makes these, er, "interesting" dance moves even more..." interesting", </p><p>The father is her boyfriend, A$AP Rocky. In an interview before the Super Bowl, Rihanna teased, "I'm thinking of bringing someone." It appears that "someone" was in fact her four-month-old baby. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Rihanna had her first baby back in May and actually credited her newfound motherhood with her decision to say yes to the Super Bowl performance: "<em>When you become a mom, there’s something that just happens where you feel like you could take on the world — you can do anything. And the Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages in the world."</em> She also said that, even though it was scary, she found it "exhilarating". </p><p>This is quite a nice turn of events from Hollywood actresses chalking up their career successes to the abortions they've had along the way. And perhaps Rihanna's motherhood will lead to a decrease in crotch-sniffing. We can only hope. </p>

## New "Flash" trailer gives GenXers our long-awaited first look at Michael Keaton reprising Batman

And while the movie is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ezra-miller-parents-legal" target="_blank">not without its controversy</a>, it gave oldheads something to enjoy. The long-awaited return of Michael Keaton as BATMAN. Keaton played the Caped Crusader in 1989 and 1992. Then mistakes were made and it was a decade before they attempted Batman in the movies again.</p><p>But Michael Keaton is back BAY-BEE! Kinda.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">On June 16, worlds collide.

One where different characters from different movies all meet in the same universe. Think <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> where all the Spider-Mans teamed up. The key here is The Flash invented the genre with the "Flashpoint" comics where Barry Allen (the Flash) went back in time to save his mother from being killed and winds up causing a war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a2a44" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33017936&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>In <em>The Flash</em> movie, we see Ben Affleck (modern-day Bruce Wayne) and Michael Keaton (oldhead Batman). We also see two Barry Allen's, both played by Ezra Miller. That's unfortunate because while WB is using Flash to reboot the entire DCU (including yeeting Henry Cavill out of his role as Superman), this would have provided an opportunity for actor Grant Gustin. Real ones know that Grant is the one, true Flash.</p><p>There was talk that the movie was going to be shelved, or at least Ezra Miller would be recast. The actor ran into a lot of legal trouble after filming the role, including <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ezra-miller-returning-flash" target="_blank">grooming a twelve-year-old</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ezra-miller-variety-victim" target="_blank">choking a woman out for using his wrong pronouns</a>. But producers believe he is sorry about doing those things. Plus recasting would be expensive.</p><p>World collide on June 16th. That's when <em>The Flash</em> speeds into theaters.</p><p><p>

Also, the woman would bite your head off. What with the uncontrollable mood swings and everything. That was a bygone era of 2021. It is now 2023 and we have evidence that PMS is so not a big deal, anyone can get it even if they lack a uterine lining to shed. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/menstruate-doctor-tiktok" target="_blank">Nuts to biology and The Science</a>!</p><p>As Mama Rose explains in this tutorial, she/her/they/them suffer every month.

<p>Like many in the conservative media, we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website strive for inclusion and tolerance no matter what the cost. We would NEVER challenge someone as beautiful and brave as Mama Rose when they speak their truth. HOWEVER, there are critics who will watch the preceding video and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-guy-stewie-period" target="_blank">not notice much difference than from the following video</a>:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>If I could offer one critique of Mama Rose? I would never question she/her truth that her/she suffers from cramps, bloating, fatigue, and nausea. But maybe her/she just has to poop? A piece of chocolate and a cup of coffee would clear that right up.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Chris Stapleton crushes the National Anthem at the Super Bowl so hard, it drove grown men to tears

A few people got boo-boo-faced over a song the media calls "a" national anthem being played during an award presentation (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hodge-twins-black-national-anthem" target="_blank">that the NFL as been doing for years</a>). However, in the "to honor America" part where they played THE National Anthem, that was Chris Stapleton. And he crushed it.</p><p>It feels weird saying "hell yeah, brother" after a performance of the National Anthem. But <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jaguars-elctric-guitar-anthem" target="_blank">it isn't the first time this year</a>, and it fits.

Most notably, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. Sirianni said in the pre-game his tradition at the start of every season is to listen to the classic Whitney Houston version of THE National Anthem. And that hearing it before the Super Bowl would be when it finally kicked in that...holy schnikies, I'm in the Super Bowl.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Of course, tears of patriotic pride turned into tears of "how did we blow a two-score lead?" The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35.
