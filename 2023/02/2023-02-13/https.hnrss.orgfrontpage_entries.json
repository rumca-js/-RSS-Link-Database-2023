usage-based billing", "description": "<p>Hi HN, we\u2019re the cofounders of Lago: an open-source alternative to Stripe Billing, Chargebee, and Recurly. That is, we make software that helps businesses calculate how much their own customers should pay them\u2014based on their subscription, consumption, discounts, taxes, credit notes, or negotiated terms\u2014and then invoice them.<p>Our website is at <a href=\"https://www.getlago.com\">https://www.getlago.com</a> and our Github is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/getlago/lago\">https://github.com/getlago/lago</a>.<p>We\u2019re focused on composability (use only the parts you need), metering (measuring how much of a software service end users use, so that the service can charge them based on that), code transparency (we\u2019re open source, so no black box - you can have a full understanding of how we built our API)  auditable code, no lock-in into anyone\u2019s ecosystem, and fair pricing (we don\u2019t take a cut of your revenue).<p>We\u2019ve been in Fintech for more than 7 years, and were the earliest employees at Qonto.com (SMB Neobank in EU), where we built and scaled the billing system and led the revenue team that took the company from pre-launch to $100M+ of ARR.<p>Back in the early days at Qonto, our pricing was very simple, a single \u201call-included\u201d subscription. We budgeted 3 months of a single back-end to \u201cget it done, once and for all\u201d.  As we shipped new features (add-ons, new tiers, usage-based etc), improved the packaging, changed our reporting structure as we matured (or instance, we changed the billing cycles from anniversary dates to calendar dates which looked trivial until we had to migrate 100K+ companies), launched new countries (new prices, new taxes implications new reporting!), we iterated on pricing dozens of times.<p>We consistently underestimated the engineering nightmare billing would create, and learned the hard way about side effects: delayed launches at best, billing errors at worst, resulting in churning users. We wrote an article about this that had a large HN thread last year (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31424450\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31424450</a>).<p>We tried to get rid of our home-grown system many times but never found an alternative that was flexible enough. As a result, there were only two options: either stop iterating on pricing and leave revenue on the table, or grow a billing engineering team. We chose the second, but it was expensive. Finding pricing or monetization experts living in spreadsheets is easy, but finding technical professionals to build and maintain a billing system is a real bottleneck. Few engineers or product managers have experience in billing, and it\u2019s rarely a career path they look forward to.<p>At some point, we realized we\u2019d stopped being able to do pricing strategy based on what was best for the company and found ourselves driven by what was easiest to implement\u2014not because we wanted to, but because it was all too complicated. We asked around and realized a lot of companies were in a similar situation. There are a lot of clunky internal billing systems out there! We spent a lot of time analyzing why no one had solved this problem, as we thought companies like Stripe or Chargebee had partially addressed it.  We came to the conclusion that a proper solution needed to be open source.<p>A lot of teams continue to build their billing system themselves because they have unique edge cases that closed-source solutions can\u2019t address. They are part of the \u201clong tail\u201d, which a closed-source SaaS has no incentive to invest in solving. That\u2019s how we arrived at the idea of open sourcing \u201ccore billing\u201d foundations that other people could use and build on. We don\u2019t solve 100% of use cases either, but what we don\u2019t solve, others can build, without having to reinvent an entire system. We think of Lago\u2019s features like \u201cLegos\u201d you can pick to build your own system, rather than a \u201cone size fits all\u201d billing platform.<p>Unlike closed source solutions, we aim at giving full transparency on how Lago works (auditable code), and enable our users to pick only the parts of our product that are relevant to their needs (e.g., if they are already handling subscription management but want to manage prepaid credits with Lago, they can). You can make your own design decisions, build anything custom that you need, and collaborate with other engineers in the community.<p>For instance, one of our users built a Javascript SDK that is now available to everyone. Others are developing additional \u201ccharge models\u201d: for instance we don\u2019t offer the ability to \u201ccap a charge\u201d yet: if you\u2019re a fintech processing transactions, you\u2019d like to bill for instance \u201c2% of the transaction amount capped at $50\u201d, to make your pricing attractive. We\u2019re working with a team who are contributing this to Lago. Other contributions involve adding native integrations with local payment processors (in India, Northern Europe, Africa, Middle East), because they usually cater better to the needs of local players in these regions: better payment success rates, better conversions at checkout pages, and usually better prices.<p>We\u2019re making Lago as open as possible to adjacent tools (e.g., payment processors, quoting software, CRMs, etc.)\u2014both market leaders and niche solutions in smaller markets. We\u2019ve built native integrations with GoCardless and Stripe Payments, but our API is usable with any payment processor from any region, and some community members are already doing so.<p>We\u2019re also partnering with Osohq.com, open-source as well, that manages authorization and entitlements (granting access to a specific feature if a user had subscribed to a specific plan): <a href=\"https://doc.getlago.com/docs/integrations/entitlements/oso\">https://doc.getlago.com/docs/integrations/entitlements/oso</a>\nYou can also use Lago with automation tools like n8n.io to create workflows, for instance if you notice your end users have an unusually high consumption of your product, and you want to avoid \u201cbill shock\u201d, you might want to alert them or your customer success team to take proactive actions: <a href=\"https://doc.getlago.com/docs/integrations/alerting/n8n#overconsumption-alerting-example-with-n8n\">https://doc.getlago.com/docs/integrations/alerting/n8n#overc...</a><p>We\u2019re actively working to build an ecosystem around Lago and address the long tail of edge cases that makes billing and monetization complex, with the help of the community.<p>How it works: Lago collects HTTP events sent by a backend application. These events are automatically aggregated to create \u201cunits to be charged\u201d. Each unit can be priced using different pricing models (tiers, packages, percentages). At the end of each billing period (month, quarter, year), a worker gathers all the fees into an invoice (PDF or JSON webhook message). The issued invoice can be connected to various services (payment providers, accounting tools, CRMs) and edited with discounts or credit notes to adjust it.<p>Once the back-end events are sent to Lago, non-technical users can use our user interface and manage pricing without help from engineers. This is what our UI looks like: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dXnoMRetsr4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/dXnoMRetsr4</a><p>Lago is self-hostable and you can download a Docker image here: <a href=\"https://github.com/getlago/lago\">https://github.com/getlago/lago</a>. We also have a cloud product that is being used in production. For now we\u2019re still granting access manually, but we\u2019ll make it generally available in the near future. In terms of pricing: the self-hosted product, which contains the core billing features, is free. We\u2019ve tried to make it featureful enough for a business to just use the free product and build what they need on top of it. Premium (i.e paid) features currently include billing on different time zones, credit notes, and will include Salesforce integration in the future. Beyond that, we\u2019re still working out our approach to pricing and have written some of our thoughts about it here: <a href=\"https://www.getlago.com/blog/how-we-think-about-our-own-pricing\">https://www.getlago.com/blog/how-we-think-about-our-own-pric...</a>.<p>The billing / monetization is space is huge and we\u2019re continuing to learn every day, so we would greatly appreciate and are (nervously) eager for your feedback!
