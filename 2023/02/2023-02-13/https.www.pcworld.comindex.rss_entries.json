After a brief media preview last week, the company <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507026/how-to-try-the-new-ai-powered-bing-search.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opened a sign-up system</a>, but access to the full-power search was restricted in favor of a few canned responses. According to emails sent out early this week, a few Microsoft users now have access to the whole kit and kaboodle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ChatGPT system allows Bing to return complex textual responses to natural language questions in English. For the moment, the interface is desktop-only (though it should be accessible on phones and tablets with a little tweaking). The Bing version of the ChatGPT system has a few limitations on both content and work-related queries, as explained last week&mdash;though it seems like there are ways around them, some of which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507512/microsofts-new-ai-bing-taught-my-son-ethnic-slurs-and-im-horrified.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">may be worth the attention of teachers and parents</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is betting big on the ChatGPT integration to revitalize Bing versus its competitors. It&rsquo;s also using the buzz around the new version of the search engine to boost engagement with its other brands like the Edge browser and Windows 11 by <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1509548/want-fast-access-to-bing-ai-give-microsoft-your-browser-defaults.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; users to reset some default programs</a>. At the moment, there&rsquo;s no way to try it without signing up with a Microsoft account and waiting for a bit, but the new version of Bing should be available to the web at large sometime later this year. </p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1510936/bing-ai-with-chatgpt-now-available-to-some-users.html", "date_published": "2023-02-13 14:57:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Your home address is leaked on the internet.

No matter how careful you are, it&rsquo;s likely that at one point or another your personal data has been harvested by data aggregator sites or online data brokers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://incogni.com/deal/?transaction_id=1029a2d3d38b8e4faa5d28c826d2c4&amp;offer_id=959&amp;affiliate_id=1351&amp;source=&amp;aff_sub=&amp;utm_source=Affiliates&amp;utm_medium=1351&amp;utm_campaign=affiliate&amp;recurring_goal_id=952&amp;xcust=2-1-1508598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Incogni</a>, one of the leading personal data removal services, &ldquo;every time someone accepts cookies, downloads an app, or even just visits a website, data brokers may harvest their personal information.&rdquo; Once they have your information, these sites can freely sell or share your personal data with anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&rsquo;s how your data leaked. The question then becomes, how do you remove it from these types of websites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, most &ldquo;people search&rdquo; sites allow you to opt out of sharing your information. To do this you can go about it two ways: personally request opt-outs or use a removal service to opt out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide to go it alone, you&rsquo;ll need to track down every databroker with your information and request opt-outs from each of them. This process is time consuming and even when you&rsquo;re finished, you&rsquo;ll need to periodically check back in the future to make sure your data hasn&rsquo;t resurfaced. It&rsquo;s possible to do all of this on your own, but the time and effort it takes can make it feel like a full-time job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option is to use a personal data removal service and let them do the tedious work of opting out for you. These services automate the process by regularly sending requests to data brokers on your behalf. Your data is not only then removed, but continues to stay off these data broker sites in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s advisable to go with a data removal service. There are a few such services, but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://incogni.com/deal/?transaction_id=1029a2d3d38b8e4faa5d28c826d2c4&amp;offer_id=959&amp;affiliate_id=1351&amp;source=&amp;aff_sub=&amp;utm_source=Affiliates&amp;utm_medium=1351&amp;utm_campaign=affiliate&amp;recurring_goal_id=952&amp;xcust=2-1-1508598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Incogni </a>stands apart from the rest. Their trusted team of cybersecurity experts fully automate the data removal process for you and ensure continued privacy. They also offer wider market coverage than competitors by sweeping your data from all types of data brokers, not just &ldquo;people search&rdquo; sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, if your home address or other personal data leaks on the internet, there are two solutions. But doing it on your own can take hundreds of hours and for most of us, in our already busy lives, that&rsquo;s not an option. So save yourself the trouble and subscribe to a data removal service like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://incogni.com/deal/?transaction_id=1029a2d3d38b8e4faa5d28c826d2c4&amp;offer_id=959&amp;affiliate_id=1351&amp;source=&amp;aff_sub=&amp;utm_source=Affiliates&amp;utm_medium=1351&amp;utm_campaign=affiliate&amp;recurring_goal_id=952&amp;xcust=2-1-1508598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Incogni</a>, then kick back and let them do the work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=1351&amp;xcust=2-1-1508598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">This way for 50% off the purchase price, and further reading.</a></p>\n\nHome Security, Internet, Smart Home, Technology Industry</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1508598/your-home-address-is-leaked-on-the-internet-how-to-delete-it.html", "date_published": "2023-02-13 12:32:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "10 obscure Windows features that will blow your mind", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve been using Windows for decades, it&rsquo;s so sprawling and complex that there might be truly helpful, yet more obscure features that can still surprise you.

Technically it&rsquo;s part of the accessibility tools, but many users might find it useful no matter what their level of mobility. This setting allows you to activate a window simply by moving your mouse cursor over it, instead of requiring an extra click before interacting with the program. It&rsquo;s a tiny change, but one that makes a huge difference, especially on a laptop trackpad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To change this setting, go to Control Panel, then click the Ease of Access Center. Click &ldquo;Make the mouse easier to use.&rdquo; Under &ldquo;Make it easier to manage windows,&rdquo; select &ldquo;Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse.&rdquo; Click Okay to enable the setting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"promo_wrap\"><div class=\"top_head\"><p class=\"pro_tag\">PROMOTION</p><p><strong>Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for $69.99, then Upgrade to 11 Pro for Free</strong></p></div><div class=\"promo_row\"><div class=\"pro_right promotion-item__image-outer-wrapper--small\"><img class=\"promotion-item__image\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" /></div><p class=\"promo_text\">\n</p><p>Right now in our PCWorld Software store you can buy a Windows 10 Pro license for just $69.99, 65% off its typical price of $199.99.

Hold down the Windows key on your keyboard, then press the arrow keys. Pressing left or right will instantly move the window to the corresponding half of the screen. Pressing up or down will alternate between halving the window in the upper or lower portion of the screen, maximizing it, or minimizing it to the toolbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These shortcuts even work across multiple monitors. It&rsquo;s a great way to quickly arrange your windows across screens and monitors with minimal effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"quick-taskbar-launching\">Quick taskbar launching&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows taskbar number bar\" class=\"wp-image-702043\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/windows-taskbar-number.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"802\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to quickly manage windows, you probably pin your most-used programs and tools to the taskbar. If you want to get at them even faster, simply hold down the Windows button and press the number on your keyboard that corresponds to their spot on the taskbar. On mine, opening Chrome is Win + 1, opening Photoshop is Win + 5, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"rearrange-your-system-tray\">Rearrange your system tray&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"windows notification area\" class=\"wp-image-702044\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/taskbar-notification-area.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"700\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the taskbar, the system tray (the little mini-icons on the right side) can often get crowded if you&rsquo;re using a lot of software. That&rsquo;s doubly true if you run a lot of programs at startup. But if it&rsquo;s cluttered, you don&rsquo;t have to keep it that way. Click and drag any of the icons around to re-arrange them. You can put them in the drop-down menu to hide them (just click the arrow to show them again), or set them to the right to make them permanently visible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"night-light\">Night light&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows night light\" class=\"wp-image-702045\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/windows-night-light.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"976\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those of us who have less-than-healthy computing habits tend to use our PCs late into the evening. You should probably cut it out, but if not, using the built-in night light feature couldn&rsquo;t hurt. Simply search the Start menu for &ldquo;Night light&rdquo; to find the setting that will dim your computer&rsquo;s screen and lower its blue light output. Once it&rsquo;s set up, you can toggle this anytime in the quick settings menu (Win + A) or have it turn on and off automatically at specific times of the evening and morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"instantly-bring-up-the-task-manager\">Instantly bring up the Task Manager</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 task manager\" class=\"wp-image-702046\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/task-manager.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"737\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an old trick, but with the expanded functions of the Task Manager in Windows 10 and 11, it&rsquo;s become more useful. From any screen in any program, press Ctrl+Shift+Escape to open the Task Manager. From here you can manually close programs, quickly access the Run command, or click the Startup tab to track down programs that are sneakily starting with Windows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"screenshot-tricks\">Screenshot tricks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"windows screenshot tool\" class=\"wp-image-702047\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/windows-screenshot-tool.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"800\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so yet, you really need to start using the official (but obscure) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b&amp;xcust=2-1-702039-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Snipping Tool</a>, which expands the operating system&rsquo;s rather basic screenshot tool (tied to the Print Screen button) with all sorts of new goodies. Press Win + Shift + S simultaneously to see options to instantly screenshot your entire workspace, just one window, or a&nbsp;freeform selection drawn with your mouse. Your screenshot is then copied and ready to be pasted into a web form or image editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a hurry? You can still access the old screenshot functionality (which saves a full image file in your Pictures&gt;Screenshots folder) by pressing Win + Print Screen. Alternately, you can copy the full screenshot instead with Ctrl + Print Screen, or copy a selection of just your currently active program with Alt + Print Screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"search-by-most-recently-installed-programs\">Search by most recently installed programs</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"windows apps and features\" class=\"wp-image-702048\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/windows-program-sort-by-install-date.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"844\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the smallest changes in Windows that I&rsquo;ve gotten the most use out of is this tweak to the way you search through programs for uninstallation. It makes it easy to find the most recent program you installed, and get rid of it if you want to. Press the Windows key, search for &ldquo;Add or remove programs,&rdquo; and click it to open the Settings menu. You&rsquo;ll be presented with a list of every program installed on your computer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous versions of Windows, you&rsquo;d have to hunt through this long list alphabetically. Now you can search for it, but what if it&rsquo;s not listed under the same name? Just click &ldquo;Name,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Install date.&rdquo; The list is now in reverse chronological order, showing your most recently-installed programs. Click the three-dot menu on the right to get rid of any entry. Super easy!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"quickly-connect-to-new-screens\">Quickly connect to new screens&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows projector settings\" class=\"wp-image-702050\" height=\"803\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/win-p.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"800\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time Windows will automatically enable a new monitor or screen when you plug it in. But if it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a quick way to adjust your display setup. Just press Win + P to open the &ldquo;Project&rdquo; menu. From this pop-out you can select Duplicate (mirror your primary screen to your secondary), Extend (use more than one screen at once), or Second screen only (handy for using just a monitor and not your laptop screen).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This menu is great if you&rsquo;re using a multi-monitor setup and you want to quickly disable secondary screens, such as for watching a movie or playing a game, then enable them again when you&rsquo;re done without diving into menus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"adjust-text-and-element-sizes\">Adjust text and element sizes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows custom scaling\" class=\"wp-image-702051\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/windows-custom-scaling.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"844\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably know that you can adjust the size of what you see in Windows by changing your resolution. But unlike the days of CRTs, your laptop screen or monitor has a very specific resolution it&rsquo;s meant to run at. Changing that value isn&rsquo;t a great idea; it can result in a stretched or pixelated image, and video won&rsquo;t look its best.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of changing the resolution, go to Display Settings, scroll down a bit, and change the Scale setting. This can make text and images look bigger or smaller on your screen without changing the resolution of the image itself. Pre-set values come in 25 percent increments, but you can set a custom value if you prefer (with a system reset). There&rsquo;s also an option that will adjust just the text size.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many programs come with their own scaling and text settings, especially text-heavy apps like browsers and text editors. Tweak them to your liking to find the most comfortable combination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"quickly-adjust-icon-sizes-in-explorer\">Quickly adjust icon sizes in Explorer&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows explorer icon size\" class=\"wp-image-702052\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/windows-explorer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to see icons better in an Explorer window specifically, try this quick trick. Hold down the Ctrl button and scroll your mouse wheel up and down. Thumbnail images will get bigger or smaller in response. Scroll far enough and the view will actually change from thumbnails to lists with mini-icons. This works even on the Windows desktop, with no Explorer window in use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explorer isn&rsquo;t the only program to use the Ctrl+mouse wheel shortcut to change the view.

However, most portable monitors suffer with a simple kickstand that offers limited adjustment. Viewsonic&rsquo;s VP16-OLED improves on this with a more versatile stand that can sit on a desk or rise above it. The monitor&rsquo;s top-notch OLED panel is icing on this ergonomic cake.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html\">best monitors</a> for information on competing products, what to look for in a monitor, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-the-specs\">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED: The specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED may seem expensive at a glance. Priced at $399.99 MSRP, and currently retailing for that online, this monitor is much more expensive than the $150 portable monitors popular on Amazon.com. It&rsquo;s also priced above budget OLED monitors, such as the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/INNOCN-Portable-Monitor-DCI-P3-100000/dp/B09L12DGW5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=MJ9H13AFDC0C&amp;keywords=INNOCN+15.6-inch+OLED+portable+monitor&amp;qid=1675206794&amp;sprefix=innocn+15.6-inch+oled+portable+monitor%2Caps%2C137&amp;sr=8-3&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&amp;xcust=2-1-1500398-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">INNOCN 15.6-inch OLED portable monitor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Display size: 15.6-inch</li><li>Native resolution: 1,920 x 1,080</li><li>Panel type: OLED</li><li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li><li>Adaptive-sync: None</li><li>HDR: None</li><li>Ports: Micro-HDMI 1.4, 2x USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 3.5mm audio out</li><li>Stand adjustment: Height, tent, flat</li><li>VESA mount: None (tripod mount available)</li><li>Speakers: Yes</li><li>Price: $399.99 MSRP</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Viewsonic is competitive with the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenScreen-Portable-Monitor-MQ16AH/dp/B09XJP815V/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3INSEL14FO1RF&amp;keywords=Asus+Zenscreen+MQ16AH&amp;qid=1675206814&amp;sprefix=asus+zenscreen+mq16ah%2Caps%2C145&amp;sr=8-2&amp;xcust=2-1-1500398-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asus Zenscreen MQ16AH</a>, a very similar monitor also priced at $399.99. The Viewsonic and Asus monitors go toe-to-toe in most metrics, including resolution and refresh rate, but Viewsonic offers practical features that will appeal to professional users.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>What really sets the VP16-OLED apart are the extras: a versatile stand, a hood to reduce screen glare, and a tripod mount add tremendous value to an already fine display.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-design\">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED: Design</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501639\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16-oled-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED folds flat making it extremely portable.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic opts for a simple, professional look for the ColorPro VP16-OLED. It has a notable lip around the display, which can help provide some protection, and rigid bezels that don&rsquo;t opt for an edge-to-edge glass look. That said, Viewsonic includes a note that the OLED panel is fragile. It should be handled with care and protected by a sturdy case when traveling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VP16-OLED has a built-in stand that folds behind the display. It can function as a kickstand or expand into a base that holds the monitor four inches above your desk. This is a major advantage over portable monitors with a basic kickstand. The VP16-OLED is more ergonomic and takes up less desk space, as the base of the stand is much smaller than the width of the monitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The versatile stand does come with a trade-off in heft. The monitor&rsquo;s combined weight of 4.8 pounds is on the heavy side for a portable monitor: most weigh less than three pounds, and some are less than two pounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won&rsquo;t find a VESA mount for using third-party VESA stands (the same is true of most portable monitors), but the VP16-OLED does offer a tripod mount tucked away on the stand&rsquo;s rear. The monitor also ships with a hood that can be used to reduce glare from the display&rsquo;s glossy panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-features-and-menus\">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED: Features and menus</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501641\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16-oled-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>All of the ports you could want are included with the Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED monitor.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The VP16-OLED&rsquo;s stand also houses its ports, providing another advantage over the more typical kickstand approach. Ports are easier to find and connect to, as they can be reached without moving the entire display.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connectivity includes two <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/395115/the-best-usb-c-cables-for-charging-and-transferring-data.html\">USB-C</a> ports, each of which support DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 40 watts of power delivery. The monitor has a maximum power consumption of 15 watts, so most USB-C power sources will be adequate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor also offers a Micro-HDMI 1.4 port and a 3.5mm audio-out jack. Remember that the Micro-HDMI 1.4 port doesn&rsquo;t deliver power, so an additional USB-C power source is required when using that video input.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic ships the monitor with a USB-C power brick and three cables: USB-C to USB-C, USB-A to USB-C, and HDMI to Micro-HDMI 1.4. Everything needed to use the monitor is in the box.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501640\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16-oled-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED&rsquo;s menu allows for a decent amount of customization.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On-screen menu controls are included on the stand. They work well enough, though I found the menu a bit awkward to navigate due to how the arrow buttons are arranged. The monitor includes DCI-P3, sRGB, REC709, DICOM-SIM presets. Deeper in the menus lurks additional controls for gamma and color temperature adjustments. These are handled per-preset, so it&rsquo;s easy to customize different presets to meet your preferences or needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor has speakers. They&rsquo;re weak in volume but clear enough to be useful for a quick check of audio levels when editing video or audio content. Podcasts and YouTube videos sound fine, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-sdr-image-quality\">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED: SDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most portable monitors can get away with image quality good enough for Word documents and web browsing, but the price and target audience of the ColorPro VP16-OLED holds it to a higher standard&mdash;one it&rsquo;s able to meet and exceed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, a quick note about the results: PC World hasn&rsquo;t conducted a complete review for a portable monitor recently. The monitors used for comparison below are not direct competitors to the VP16-OLED, but do represent a range of panel technology which may be found in competing monitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501642\" height=\"824\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16oled-brightness-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"asus-proart-oled-pa32dc\">Asus ProArt OLED PA32DC</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ProArt OLED PA32DC\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/asus-proart-pa32dc-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://shop.asus.com/us/90lm06n0-b01ib0-proart-display-oled-pa32dc.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1500398-5-1072579-11291&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$3499 at  Asus</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic VP16-OLED gets off to a strong start in brightness, delivering up to 375 nits. That&rsquo;s great for a standalone OLED monitor, easily beating the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\">Alienware AW3423DWF&rsquo;s QD-OLED</a> panel and ranking alongside conventional IPS displays such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/700448/gigabyte-m27q-x-review-lush-color-in-a-240hz-monitor.html\">Gigabyte M27Q X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html\">NZXT Canvas 27Q</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html\">Asus ProArt PG32DC</a>, a high-end OLED monitor that retails for $3,499, takes the win with 540 nits.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501643\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16oled-contrast-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the VP16-OLED has an excellent contrast ratio that exceeds the sensitivity of the colorimeter we use for testing. While there are technical differences in contrast among OLED monitors, they are exceptionally difficult to notice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice the VP16-OLED&rsquo;s huge advantage over an IPS display such as the Gigabyte and NZXT monitors. OLED appears darker and richer in dim scenes, yet has more depth in bright content. It&rsquo;s a recipe for excellent results in games, movies, and professional apps.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501644\" height=\"828\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16oled-color-gamut-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The VP16-OLED goes above and beyond in its color gamut, which spans the entire sRGB and DCI-P3 color spaces, and 97 percent of AdobeRGB. This defeats both the Alienware AW3423DWF, which has a QD-OLED panel from Samsung, and the Gigabyte M27Q X, which has an IPS display with Quantum Dots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A color gamut this wide is suitable for just about anything you&rsquo;d throw at it including photo and video editing, digital art, and animation. And, as mentioned, the monitor includes several preset modes that more precisely restrain the color gamut to meet particular standards. These are handy if you want to work within a smaller color space, such as sRGB, and ensure that colors appear accurate.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501645\" height=\"884\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16oled-color-accuracy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of accuracy, the VP16-OLED does well enough, though this is one area where it falls short of the competitive set at its default settings. Other portable monitors may deliver better results out of the box. To be fair, though, this level of color accuracy is enough to provide a realistic, lifelike image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VP16-OLED&rsquo;s default settings offer a color temperature of 6200K, a bit warmer than the target of 6500K. This means the image looks rather red and rosy. The default gamma came in at 2.3, a bit above the target of 2.2, which means content may seem a bit darker than it should.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the monitor&rsquo;s menus offer an impressive range of gamma and color temperature modes that, in my testing, were accurate to their targets. That means you can adjust the image to any color temperature or gamma settings you work requires, or that your eyes prefer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharpness is excellent. The monitor&rsquo;s 1080p resolution may not seem high on paper, but it works out to a pixel density of 141 pixels per inch. That falls between the pixel density of a 27-inch 1440p monitor and a 27-inch 4K monitor. Content looks crisp and small fonts appear smooth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED&rsquo;s overall image quality is superb. It scores extremely well by most metrics. Color gamut is its strongest trait, delivering results that are difficult to find in any monitor. The VP16-OLED&rsquo;s vivid, punchy presentation will please prosumers, and its color performance and numerous image quality options will meet the standards of content creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-hdr-image-quality\">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED: HDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic doesn&rsquo;t offer HDR support with the ColorPro VP16-OLED. This may come as a shock given that many less expensive portable monitors claim HDR support. However, the HDR performance of most monitors in this category is lackluster, so its absence is less surprising than it may seem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, some professional users will be disappointed by this omission. Those who want HDR should look towards the Asus Zenscreen MQ16AH, another portable OLED monitor sold at the same $399.99 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-motion-performance\">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED: Motion performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED doesn&rsquo;t offer features that enhance its motion performance. It has a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks Adaptive Sync.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OLED does offer some advantage in motion clarity though, thanks to the excellent pixel response times. The ColorPro VP16-OLED quotes a gray-to-gray response time of one millisecond, which is similar to many monitors marketed to gamers. This helps reduce motion blur. Motion clarity is worse than a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor, but it&rsquo;s superior to most (if not all) 60Hz IPS monitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-a-viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled\">Should you buy a Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED?</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED\" class=\"wp-image-1501648\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-vp16-oled-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED provides excellent image quality for such a compact design.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewsonic&rsquo;s ColorPro VP16-OLED is a great portable monitor. It delivers stunning image quality with solid brightness, superb contrast, and an extremely wide color gamut. What really sets the VP16-OLED apart, though, are the extras. The monitor has a versatile stand, a hood that can be used to reduce screen glare, and a tripod mount for use on-the-go. It also ships with all the cables and power adapters needed to use the display with any USB-C, USB-A, or HDMI output.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ColorPro VP16-OLED is a bit pricey at $399.99, but no more so than other portable OLED monitors, and its many perks make it easy to recommend.</p>\n\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1500398/viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-review.html", "date_published": "2023-02-13 11:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
