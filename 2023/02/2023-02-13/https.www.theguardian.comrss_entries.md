<p>Valencia are winless since the World Cup, with defeat at home to Athletic Club leaving them rudderless and facing the drop</p><p>Most of Valencia’s fans didn’t see the goal that momentarily pulled them clear of the relegation zone but they did see the goals that pushed them back in again. They were <em>at</em> Mestalla on Saturday night but not <em>in</em> Mestalla when Samu Castillejo’s 16th-minute shot put them one up against Athletic Club. Instead, they were still outside, desperate to escape the abyss. Beyond the wall, Castillejo’s first goal since September came to a backdrop of empty seats and packed streets, yellow everywhere, but at least offered brief hope of a first win in three months; when those fans finally headed in, it was taken away again, a 2-1 defeat deepening their desperation.</p><p>With Valencia winless since the World Cup, their 15th coach in nine years on the verge of replacement two games into his eighth stint in charge and relations between supporters and owners broken, the crisis deeper than just defeats, a protest had been called. Valencia faced Athletic on Saturday and more than 50 supporters’ groups and thousands of fans had agreed not to go into the ground until minute 19, the year of the club’s foundation. One local paper claimed survival was on the line, on and off the pitch, and so they gathered on Avenida Suecia with banners and balloons, the street jammed all the way along the main facade of the stadium, a sea of people demanding the departure of Peter Lim.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/13/valencia-hurtle-towards-relegation-la-liga-another-protest-engulfs-the-mestalla">Continue reading...</a>

Last year, an average of 2.7 million people watched, a drop of 200,000 from the 2021 broadcast. This year’s viewership is roughly in line with the most recent pre-pandemic broadcast – 2020’s ceremony, which pulled in 3.8 million viewers – but is still a far cry from the ceremony’s late-90s and early-2000s peak.</p><p>This year’s ceremony was held on a weekend for the first time in the show’s 45-year history; broadcast live from London’s O2 Arena, the show was hosted by comedian Mo Gilligan and featured performances from Harry Styles, Sam Smith and Kim Petras, Stormzy, Wet Leg and Lizzo, among others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/13/brit-awards-viewing-figures-up-after-saturday-night-tv-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Expanding childcare hours without reforming the system won’t close the attainment gap between wealthy and disadvantaged children</p><p>Childcare is not a domestic problem, or a women’s problem: it’s an economic problem. This was the subtext of a recent announcement from the Confederation of British Industry, which has called on the government to extend free childcare to relieve labour shortages. The Treasury is now considering a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/10/treasury-considering-huge-expansion-free-childcare-england">huge expansion</a> in free childcare hours as part of its attempt to get more people into work. <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/senior-tories-pressure-rishi-sunak-jeremy-hunt-cut-cost-childcare-budget-2140350">Senior Tories</a> have pressured Jeremy Hunt<strong> </strong>ahead of the chancellor’s spring statement to cut the costs of childcare, which are among the highest in Europe. Reducing these costs and providing more childcare hours is essential, but focusing only on its benefits to employment would be a missed opportunity.</p><p>The current system is based on a byzantine set of policies. Two-year-olds from low-income families are entitled to 15 weekly hours of free childcare. Most children aged three to four with two working parents get 30 free hours. Parents can also access up to £2,000 a year, per child, by paying money into an account topped up by the government. Almost <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/07/nursery-under-twos-costs-parents-england-65-percent-wage">two-thirds</a> of take-home pay can be spent on putting a two-year-old in nursery. Even parents on higher salaries are justifiably angry, but the situation is worse for poorer families. Working parents on universal credit can get up to 85% of childcare costs reimbursed, but this is paid in arrears, forcing some into a <a href="https://www.ippr.org/files/2022-12/delivering-a-childcare-guarantee-dec-22.pdf">cycle of debt</a>. Nurseries also charge extra fees that can be prohibitively expensive. It’s no wonder that many low-income families don’t use formal childcare at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/13/the-guardian-view-on-childcare-quality-matters-as-much-as-quantity">Continue reading...</a>

Is swearing still taboo?, 9 February</a>). I remember reading, many years ago, an article about how the increased usage and acceptability of swearing had contributed to a more violent society. The main idea was that swearing, historically, had been used between adversaries to warn of increasing tensions in a conflict or argument. Each party would be aware of the significance of the use of swearwords, enabling either side to back down or withdraw.</p><p>The theory was that with the widespread use of these words and the acceptability of them, their value in this context had decreased; their significance was no longer understood. A stage in the development of a conflict had been removed – thus resulting in the increased likelihood of arguments escalating to a violent conclusion.

## ‘A new style of speak’: the lyrical genius of Trugoy the Dove

<p>While De La Soul will always be defined by 3 Feet High and Rising, Trugoy and his fellow bandmates were constantly pushing the boundaries of rap throughout their stellar career</p><p>Thirty five years after its release, De La Soul’s debut album is firmly ensconced in the pantheon of unimpeachable classics, and Me Myself And I is a fixture on mainstream classic radio. So it’s easy to forget what a shock 3 Feet High and Rising represented on release. It was, gasped one US critic’s review, “unlike any rap you or anyone else has ever heard”. If that wasn’t entirely true – 3 Feet High and Rising certainly had antecedents, both in the easygoing humour of Biz Markie’s style and in the beat-digging, fast-cutting, eclectic sound of old-school DJs, as wont to play Dizzy Gillespie or the Monkees’ Mary Mary as James Brown and Funkadelic – it wasn’t far off the mark. The album certainly didn’t sound like anything else that was around at the time – even those by their friends in the Native Tongues rap collective.</p><p>That album sounded like it existed in its own world, De La Soul presenting as rap’s weird kids running amok in the back of the classroom. It was uninterested in the genre’s standard brash posturing. As if to underline that fact, Dave Jolicoeur rapped under the name Trugoy the Dove: “trugoy” is “yogurt” backwards (“I eat it a lot,” he explained). Rather than using the same slang as everyone else, Trugoy and fellow MCs Kelvin “Posdnuos” Mercer and Vincent Lamont “Maseo” Mason Jr<strong> </strong>invented their own: their rhymes were “a phrase called talk”, a rapper they admired was a “public speaker”, if something was “Dan Stuckee”, that meant it was great; rather than using the epithet “ho” to besmirch a girl’s reputation on Jenifa Taught Me, Trugoy opted for the more decorous suggestion that “she became known as a garden tool”. Their lyrics frequently sounded like riddles: “Vocal in doubt is an uplift and real is the answer that I answer with,” offered Trugoy on the trio’s debut single Plug Tunin’.

<p>Nothing delights my children more than airing ‘anti-woke’ views and waiting for me to rise to the bait</p><p>The kids were in the back of the car discussing rail strikes. The 15-year-old thinks strikes would be more effective if they were a surprise: when they are announced in advance, people just plan around them and it deadens the impact. It would be much more chaotic if they were decided on the spur of the moment, and left us all stranded on trains. The 13-year-old thinks, conversely, that strikes should be banned because they are annoying.</p><p>What’s my move, here, I wonder. Do I introduce them to the concept of the wildcat strike, followed by a whistle-stop tour of the coolest wildcat strikes in UK history? Do I threaten to disinherit my little Tory? Maybe just a casual introduction to the proud history of the trade union movement, and the importance of power equipoise between capital and labour?</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/13/the-kids-think-they-know-an-infallible-way-to-wind-me-up-unfortunately-theyre-right">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m not saying that giving any advice is morally wrong. But we do have the right to make the big choices without undue interference</p><ul><li>Farbod Akhlaghi is a philosopher at Christ’s College, University of Cambridge</li></ul><p>Imagine that, at a ripe old age, you look back on the big decisions you’ve made – to get married, become a parent, live in a certain country, choose a career. You might think: “Regardless of how everything has played out, at least I made these choices myself.” When faced with these transformative decisions, you ensured that it was you who chose, rather than anyone else. As a result, you can see the self you’ve become as <em>your</em>self, someone you’ve become through the transformative choices you made.</p><p>Now imagine instead that you look back and think: “You know what, I don’t really think I made those choices” – perhaps you realise you were unduly influenced by others. Even worse, for that reason, you feel alienated from who you’ve become. Because who you have become is not the product of transformative choices you made, in situations where it could have been.</p><p>Farbod Akhlaghi is a junior research fellow in philosophy at Christ’s College, University of Cambridge</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/13/friend-marry-moral-advice-ethical-right">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Firstsite, Colchester</strong> <br />The former YBA has curated a show of 25 female artists – but the effect is superficial and cliquey</p><p>The first big woman to greet you on arrival at Colchester’s <a href="https://firstsite.uk/">Firstsite gallery</a> is Fat Doris. She’s wearing black tights and brown wedge shoes and is instantly recognisable as a <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lucas-pauline-bunny-t07437">Sarah Lucas bunny</a>, except this woman is no longer provocatively slutty with legs akimbo, but is slouched in an armchair, with rolls of stomach that erupt into four tied-off sausage ends, representing both boobs and brains. As an evocation of the status of older women, she packs an undeniable punch, but she also embodies the curatorial weakness of this show: it’s not about making radical new connections, but about being part of a cool gang with origins in <a href="https://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2020/april/06/phaidons-15-minute-art-lesson-how-freeze-introduced-the-ybas-to-the-world-by-bruce-altshuler/">Freeze</a>, the 1988 show that created the YBA brand and made Lucas’s name.</p><p>This is frustrating, because there are some wonderful artists among the 25 exhibitors, all of whom are here at Lucas’s invitation, but there’s also a wearying impulse to be shocking for its own sake, as in the repetitive expletives of Erica Åkerlund’s Fuck ’Em embroidery, which hangs around the cafe area like a mouthy teenager. Taboo-busting text has a place in feminist discourse, of course, but it’s more thoughtfully employed in Fiona Banner’s 2006 work Nude Standing.

<p>As the BlacKkKlansman film-maker picks up the British Film Institute’s top honour, he talks about being accused of provoking race riots, why his Malcolm X biopic will endure – and the problem with awards</p><p>‘When I was little,” says Spike Lee, “my father hated Hollywood films, but my mother was a cinephile. And since I was the eldest sibling, I was her movie date. She loved James Bond and took me to see Goldfinger. The theatre was packed. Those Bond films have explosions and shootings, but there was a lull in the action and everything was quiet. I said: ‘Mommy, why is that lady named Pussy Galore?’ And the whole audience heard me. My mother grabbed me by the neck and said: ‘Don’t say another word!’” Lee cackles, clearly tickled. “She was so embarrassed.” He pauses. “Pussy Galore,” he repeats, laughing.</p><p>Although the film-maker’s grasp of cinema has come a long way since then, there is still something in him reminiscent of that six-year-old boy: curious, unafraid to speak his mind, keen to ask awkward questions. After a career spanning more than 30 years, the 65-year-old has developed a reputation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/lets-do-the-right-thing-how-spike-lee-became-hollywoods-political-conscience">as Hollywood’s conscience</a>.

## Magnificent Jalen Hurts goes down swinging in Eagles’ Super Bowl loss

<p>The 24-year-old quarterback made a single, costly error against the Kansas City Chiefs but was otherwise superb in defeat for Philadelphia</p><p>Jalen Hurts made one mistake in Super Bowl LVII, as Kansas City and Philadelphia were trading blows early in the second quarter in Glendale, Arizona. Facing third and five from his 49-yard line, the Eagles star fielded a shotgun snap and lunged forward in an obvious quarterback draw play, only to immediately find himself under pressure from the Chiefs’ pass rush. As Hurts staggered to his right to avoid incoming Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton, the ball slipped out and tumbled backward on to the turf. Without breaking stride, <a href="https://twitter.com/MyBookie/status/1624931717583609858">Bolton scooped it up at the 36-yard line</a> and, with a three-man Chiefs convoy, sprinted into the endzone to tie the game at 14-14.</p><p>It was the kind of play that could have dented Hurts’s confidence, given that the last time he stumbled on a stage this big was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/09/alabama-georgia-comeback-national-championship">when he was leading Alabama</a> in the 2018 college national championship game. This time, however, a back-up wasn’t trotting on to the field to replace Hurts, because his error didn’t permanently halt the Eagles momentum. But it didn’t spare them from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/12/kansas-city-chiefs-philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-lvii-nfl">a 38-35 defeat</a> either. In the end Kansas City were simply the more resilient team thanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/13/patrick-mahomes-super-bowl-mvp-injury">their Michael Jordan in cleats</a>, Patrick Mahomes. The official record should reflect that, but for a play here or there, it could have easily been Hurts basking in MVP glory after leading his team to victory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/13/jalen-hurts-philadelphia-eagles-quarterback-super-bowl-lvii">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London<br /></strong>The pianist and baritone were perfectly balanced combining emotional scope and intense ferocity in a repertoire that explored the turmoil of mental illness<br /></p><p>You could argue that madness is never far away in the 19th-century song repertoire, in which baritone <a href="https://www.gerhaher.de/index.php/en/menu/biography">Christian Gerhaher</a> and pianist <a href="https://www.oxfordlieder.co.uk/artist/237">Gerold Huber</a> have established such a formidable reputation. However, this programme, spanning the 19th to the 21st centuries, placed the idea of insanity firmly centre stage.</p><p>Almost all the words Gerhaher sang were by Nikolaus Lenau, the Austrian poet, who died in an asylum in 1850. But we first heard brief words by Georg Trakl, spoken by Gerhaher to introduce Elis, three short piano pieces by Heinz Holliger inspired by that war-damaged poet. These fleeting works broke us gently into Holliger’s uncompromising yet delicate and often pictorial soundworld, Huber’s hands darting from one end of the keyboard to another and occasionally reaching in to the body of the piano to set the strings vibrating directly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/13/christian-gerhahergerold-huber-review-songs-of-existential-crisis-delivered-with-subtlety-and-snarl">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spuds you’ll definitely like: potato cakes with a tempting lime pickle yoghurt, and smashed spuds stuffed with mustardy leeks</p><p>I could write a love letter to potatoes - baked, fried, roasted, mashed or dauphinoise’d, they’re almost certainly my favourite vegetable. (Please don’t tell me they aren’t actually a vegetable; I will cover my ears, and refuse to listen.) One of the best things about them is their versatility; I love pairing them with big flavours, be it lime pickle in today’s moreish little potato cakes, or punchy leeks and dijon mustard in my new favourite lunch, crisp loaded potato skins. My top tip for both recipes? Use the strongest cheddar you can find for maximum flavour.</p><p>Rukmini Iyer is the author of the Roasting Tin series.

<p>This touching documentary revisits the grimy Manhattan of the 70s and 80s in search of long-lost painter Edward Brezinski</p><p>If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/25/all-the-beauty-and-the-bloodshed-review-nan-goldin-takes-on-big-pharma">All the Beauty and the Bloodshed</a>, the recent documentary featuring photographer Nan Goldin, has whetted your appetite for the scuzzy glory days of Manhattan’s Lower East Side in the 1970s and 80s, then this documentary about Edward Brezinski, another artist kicking around the Bowery at the time, will quench that thirst. Interestingly, Goldin is never mentioned in this film, but a few art-world figures such as actor-critic <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-word-future-wasnt-part-of-my-vocabulary-on-cookie-muellers-walking-through-clear-water-in-a-pool-painted-black-collected-stories/">Cookie Mueller</a> and artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/david-wojnarowicz-close-to-the-knives-a-memoir-of-disintegration-artist-aids-activist">David Wojnarowicz</a> overlap both films. No doubt there must have gallery openings or parties where Brezinski and Goldin were in the same room or even met one another, and this work clearly demonstrates that the NYC art scene was a small, almost incestuous circle where nearly everyone slept with everyone, especially before Aids arrived, and they all bitched about each other constantly.</p><p>There is indeed a lot of bitching in the early part of Make Me Famous from those who remember Brezinski, a talented, ambitious painter from Michigan who rocked up to the East Village in the late 70s, yet never achieved the fame of contemporaries such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/keith-haring">Keith Haring</a>. Not for lack of trying, it seems. One interviewee here cattily recalls how Brezinski, who ran a tiny gallery out of his own apartment on the sixth floor of a dilapidated building on East 3rd Street opposite a homeless shelter for men, would hand out cards advertising his shows at other people’s openings – a grave violation of the codes of cool.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/13/make-me-famous-review-dirt-dishing-study-of-the-glory-days-of-the-lower-east-side">Continue reading...</a>

She attempted to tackle Eveliina Summanen and the Spurs midfielder tangled Toone’s legs in hers, resulting in the United player falling to the ground. The England international did not take kindly to the challenge and retaliated by pushing Summanen into the turf. The incident brought Toone a red card. Toone wrote on Twitter: “Pride myself on the passion and love I have when playing for this club. Hold my hands up for my reaction and I’ll learn from it.” Although it did not cost United the win, which put them top, it could cost them in the future with Toone facing a three-match suspension. This will include a game at Chelsea, title rivals and defending champions, on 12 March. In a title race this close, United will be frustrated they will have to grind out results without one of their biggest stars. United’s manager, Marc Skinner, says they will review the incident and may appeal. <strong>SR</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/13/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Corey Deshon’s debut feature has echoes of horrific cases of basement imprisonment, but doesn’t quite coalesce into a clear vision</p><p>There are echoes of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/turpin-family-child-abuse-torture-charges-california">Turpin case</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/19/josef-fritzl-jailed-for-life">Josef Fritzl</a>’s basement in this tense arthouse horror shot in grainy 16mm with auteurish confidence by first-time film-maker Corey Deshon. It opens with a claim to be “more based on fact than fiction”, but actually tells an entirely fictional story about the kidnapping of a young woman (Vivien Ngô) who wakes up shackled to the floor in a garage. In front of her stands a man known only as Father (Casper Van Dien). You can tell instantly from his plaid checked shirt, beige slacks and straight-backed posture that he’s the type of Christian you don’t mess with in a horror movie: wholesome looking, but unhinged.</p><p>“We’re not violent people,” Father tells the chained-up woman, sounding almost reasonable. It’s not true. In a disturbing, disorientating scene over the opening credits we’ve just watched him in a gas mask chase down another young woman and bludgeon her to death. This new woman is her replacement, kidnapped by Father to be a big sister to his son, Brother (Ian Alexander), a frail boy of about 11. Brother has been raised in isolation, taught that air in the outside world is toxic. Rounding off the creepy family is Mother played with brilliant slyness by Elyse Dinh: is she a quietly submissive wife, or just giving a good performance?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/13/daughter-review-kidnap-horror-keeps-it-in-the-creepy-family">Continue reading...</a>

They married two years later</p><p>When Peter was asked to host an overnight Brazilian radio show in the Californian city of<strong> </strong>Santa Cruz, he jumped at the opportunity. It was the summer of 1984, and he loved volunteering at his local community radio station alongside his seasonal job as a park ranger. “I’d recently found a new Brazilian record, so I was thrilled to be asked to do the show so I could feature it,” he says.</p><p>While Peter was DJing, Chelsea who was driving to Santa Cruz from Mountain View, California, tuned in. “I’d just been dumped by my boyfriend and was moving to Santa Cruz with all my stuff in the back of my parents’ car,” she says. Still raw from the breakup, she felt moved by the song. “I started looking for a payphone at a gas station so I could contact the radio station and find out what it was. I remember digging through the car seats to find a dime to make the call,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/13/how-we-met-i-heard-heels-coming-down-the-sidewalk-i-turned-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for gnocchi with pancetta and pecorino | A kitchen in Rome

<p>In this moreish dish, a pecorino paste gently melts in the residual heat of the pan, and then clings invitingly to plump gnocchi topped with fried lardons</p><p>I once caught a cockroach with a box grater. Exposed when I moved a bottle of vinegar, it ran across the work surface, brushing a pile of grated carrot as it went. It was a badly lit corner in a dark kitchen, and I was horrified, which made my accurate slam all the more miraculous. Alerted by screams, my flatmate arrived in the kitchen and threw a tea towel over the grater while we shouted options at each other. In the end, she held a copy of National Geographic level with the counter, so I could slide the grater across and onto it, the creature clinking against the moving metal. She then opened the window. But as I went to flick, it crossed my mind that the cockroach might cling to the magazine, metal or tea towel, so, after a glance, I threw the whole lot into the courtyard below.</p><p>Two flights down, and relieved we hadn’t hit anyone, we found that the magazine and tea towel had landed among some neglected pot plants, while the grater had met the concrete near the bike racks. The resulting dent wasn’t bad enough to make it unusable, just unstable, and the deformed corner was the one between the slicing mouths and the vicious side I never used anyway. Back in the flat, we threw away the carrot, wiped everything with bleach and went out for a sandwich.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/13/rachel-roddy-recipe-gnocchi-pancetta-pecorino-romano">Continue reading...</a>

How wrong I was. It’s a gem, with great performances from Meryl Streep as the terrifying magazine editor; Stanley Tucci as her long-suffering art director; Emily Blunt as the icy couture fanatic; and Anne Hathaway as Andy, the guileless PA. But more than this, it is a great movie for singledom, perhaps the movie for singledom. Because the point is, despite dalliances with super-hot guys, Hathaway’s character winds up single and perfectly happy. Her relationship is with her career as a journalist, which is probably where the romantic energy has been all along. She has outgrown her boyfriend, the toxic schemer Nate, and she is happy with herself.

<p>Latest updates: Labour deputy leader says her expenses were necessary for work and accuses government of wasting taxpayer’s money</p><p><strong>Transport minister Richard Holden said a Labour investigation into government procurement cards (GPCs) had “wasted” civil servant time as the information was “already publicly available”.</strong></p><p>It comes after Labour compiled a dossier on the use of the cards – with the party using parliamentary questions to secure some of the data – showing that across 2021 for 14 major Whitehall departments, a total of at least £145.5m was spent using GPCs.</p><p>In the big picture, what we’ve seen since 2010, is an 85% reduction in this. All of this data is publicly available online, it has been since 2012 – something which didn’t happen under the last Labour government.</p><p>We publish it on a monthly basis. The Labour party has spent half-a-million pounds asking parliamentary questions, 2,500 of them, wasting my civil servants time for information that is already publicly available and that they hid when they were last in office.</p><p>I don’t think any government minister would have been involved in that decision.</p><p>I could be wrong but that’s not my [understanding]. What wouldn’t normally happen is a spending of around £3,000 going over a minister’s desk because, if you did, that’s all ministers would do on a daily basis.</p><p>Today’s shocking revelations lift the lid on a scandalous catalogue of waste, with taxpayers’ money frittered away across every part of government, while in the rest of the country, families are sick with worry about whether their pay cheque will cover their next weekly shop or the next tranche of bills.</p><p>I don’t think the £1,600 on that is the same as millions of pounds that is being used on these credit cards in an inappropriate way. You know, we need to make sure there’s transparency and that the public are getting value for money.</p><p>I can absolutely justify my use of using electronic equipment to do my job, especially when I’m not – during the pandemic – when I wasn’t in the office in Westminster. And as I say, now I’m speaking to you on that very iPad that was purchased.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/feb/13/conservatives-tories-rishi-sunak-expenses-spending-angela-rayner-labour-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

Riffing on the idea, Mali Elfman’s debut feature follows two strangers trapped in a car, alive but with death not far off on the horizon.</p><p>Elfman’s film kicks off with an intriguing premise: science has conclusively proven the existence of an afterlife; death is not the end. The brilliant scientist-entrepreneur behind the discovery is Dr Stevenson, played by Karen Gillan channelling Elizabeth Holmes energy, with a surprisingly deep voice and a slash of bright red lipstick. Disappointingly we only see her in a handful of clips: a few slick media appearances and recorded messages for her institute, Life Beyond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/13/next-exit-review-road-trip-romcom-with-death-as-the-final-destination">Continue reading...</a>

## Was It For This by Hannah Sullivan review – a poem for Grenfell

<p>Sullivan ponders tragedy and the homes she has known in a collection full of insightful observation and anguished comedy</p><p>In Hannah Sullivan’s rare, sympathetic, exceptionally readable <em>Was It For This</em>, the sequel to her debut, the TS Eliot prize-winning <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/20/three-poems-by-hannah-sullivan-review">Three Poems</a></em>, much of her material seems not to have been expecting to find itself on the page. That is one of its strengths: the sense of details trying to mind their own business being not, after all, skipped – but unexpectedly <em>seen</em>. Holding her son on one hip and noting an outfit outgrown: “His dragon trouser legs,/ green tessellating scales,/ were halfway to the knee, so/ soon they’d be bagged up or binned.” Snot running down her face during her reading at her father’s funeral: “What the piece of loo roll couldn’t contend with – it was like trying to stem a flooding washing machine with a tea towel – ”. Full disclosure about a bathroom cupboard in a rented Paddington flat (no need for any snooping journalist in her case): “Expired sleeping pills, weed-laced lip balm smuggled back from California. A salt pipe.”</p><p>Her poems frequently shift into prose. Sullivan moves instinctively between forms as if stepping from one room into another, which is fitting because her subject is, in part, places she has called home. Wanderer and wonderer, she considers past addresses in Northolt, New York, San Francisco, London. She confesses, in London 2010s, to an “inability to make a home for myself”. She offers what could serve as an SOS to Marie Kondo, confessing to her dazed hoarder’s soul: “Sometimes I imagined that I might aestheticise what was really only paralysis – a stuckness in time, a clinging on – by putting these, individually microscopic, things into laminated plastic folders. But, despite buying the plastic folders, I couldn’t work out how to organise them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/13/was-it-for-this-by-hannah-sullivan-review-a-poem-for-grenfell">Continue reading...</a>

Cemeteries, after all, are this artist’s stomping ground. Covert makes work out of tombstones.</p><p>When he shows up, we talk about the last graveyard he visited: Edgwarebury in Edgware, London. Its most famous resident is the singer Amy Winehouse, who died in 2011 aged 27. Her gravestone, like many Covert goes to see, was festooned with flowers left by well-wishers. Covert did what he always does: he took out a piece of canvas and an oil stick, then made a rubbing of the words on the stone. The previous day, he had visited Bunhill Fields in Islington, making a rubbing of William Blake’s tombstone on the same canvas. “They’re both poets,” he says. “I’m going to put them side by side.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/13/scott-covert-celebrity-gravestones-rubbings-amy-winehouse-james-dean-khrushchev">Continue reading...</a>

Villa had been overrun, Bernardo Silva was the new João Cancelo and City were second again. By Wednesday night, if they play like the first half again at the Emirates, they will surely be top.

<p>The International Olympic Committee wants to find a pathway for Russians to compete in Paris despite the war in Ukraine</p><p>Picture the mise-en-scène in Paris next year, on the opening day of the Olympics. At the final of the 10m air rifle shooting mixed team event, the Russian Sergey Kamenskiy presses his eye to his gun, squeezes the trigger, and – a millisecond later – is triumphantly celebrating gold. Meanwhile 1,500 miles away in Kyiv, rubble from homes and hospitals continues to pile up, along with the bodies of the dead.</p><p>Far fetched? Hardly. The International Olympic Committee is determined to establish a pathway for Russians to compete in Paris. And it won’t be deterred by widespread condemnation from Ukrainian athletes, or the expectation that 35 countries – including the UK and United States – will call for a ban this week. Instead on Sunday the IOC president, Thomas Bach, doubled down by denying his organisation was on the wrong side of history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/feb/13/so-mr-bach-will-nothing-ever-be-enough-to-ban-russia-from-the-olympics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We need to start thinking in Britain of paid childcare as a life-enriching right, not a slightly uncomfortable necessity</p><p>In the end, it was Mariah who did it. I had been trying so hard not to cry, and in fact was feeling quite cheerful about the baby starting nursery and me reclaiming some precious time, which I am mostly planning to use by lying on the floor. Besides, the bairn is a socialite, so is thrilled to be hanging out with so many other babies. The first day of settling in went well. I was feeling buoyed. Until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfRNRymrv9k">Always Be My Baby</a> came on, that is.</p><p>I wept. People said I would, but the force of the emotion surprised me. “It can be hard for the mums,” the kindly staff had said. You’re telling me. I thought I had got used to the mixed emotions that come with parenthood. I hadn’t foreseen bawling at 90s pop hits. But I know that some songs will always be different for me now. They’ll come on in shops when I am 50 or 60 or 70 and hit me with the full force of how it feels to love him and miss him at all the ages he has ever been.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-year-of-the-cat-9781472290717">The Year of the Cat</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/13/guilty-baby-nursery-suits-government-britain-paid-childcare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I need a bigger home but after selling my current one I’m unsure whether I’ll be offered a bigger loan</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I am 46 and live in a small two-bedroom house with my two children but I need something bigger. I owe about £96,000 on the mortgage but also have another secured loan of £38,000 (which is what it would cost to repay it so includes early redemption fees and so on). The house is valued at about £165,000, so I do have some equity in it. However, my real problem is that I’m also on a debt management plan of about £13,000, which has been going for less than a year. If I sold my house and paid off everything, I would have £18,000 to put towards a bigger house. But my question is: would I be able to get the bigger mortgage that I would need?</p><p>Is there any hope? I was also wondering whether I should sell up and rent for a while before trying to get another mortgage. Or has my credit history scuppered any chances of buying a bigger place? <br /><strong>AM</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/13/bigger-mortgage-debt-management-plan-home-loan">Continue reading...</a>

## Slippery slope? Alpine tourism in the face of climate crisis – photo essay

<p>Photojournalist Milan Schellingerhout spent 2022 working on a photographic series about the pressure of tourism on the Alps and the extent to which the industry is sustainable, focusing on the large Paradiski area in the French Alps (Les Arcs/Peisey-Vallandry and La Plagne)</p><p>The Alps, with their picturesque landscapes and diverse range of outdoor activities, are a major destination for tourists from all over the world. Each year, about 120 million people visit the region to experience its natural beauty and participate in activities such as skiing, snowboarding, hiking and cycling. However, this level of tourism has a significant impact on the environment and climate of the region.</p><p>Residents of the Alps are heavily dependent on tourists for their livelihoods, making it a delicate balancing act between addressing environmental concerns and preserving the interests of the tourism industry. Ski areas in particular have invested millions of euros in efforts to maintain their operations and combat the effects of climate breakdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/13/alpine-tourism-climate-crisis-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

## Anaximander and the Nature of Science by Carlo Rovelli review – the ancient master of the universe

<p>In Rovelli’s formative book, now published in English for the first time, he argues that a little-known Greek philosopher invented the idea of the cosmos</p><p>Something very startling happened in Miletus, the ancient Greek city on the modern Turkish coast, in about 600BC. That something, physicist Carlo Rovelli argues in this enjoyable and provocative little book, occurred in the interaction between two of the place’s greatest minds. The first, Thales, one of the seven sages of ancient Greece, is often credited as the pioneer in applying deductive reasoning to geometry and astronomy; he used his mathematics, for example, to predict solar eclipses. Wondrous as this was, it was the reaction of the second man, Thales’s fellow citizen, Anaximander, 11 years his junior that, Rovelli argues, changed the world. Anaximander assimilated Thales’s ideas, treated them with due respect, but then rejected and improved on them and came up with more exact theories of his own.</p><p>That process, the idea that knowledge was something not handed down by gods or elders, but evolving, something to be quickly interrogated and built upon, set in motion, Rovelli argues, what we understand as the scientific method. If Newton characterised himself as “standing on the shoulders of giants”, then the two men near the very base of that human pyramid were Anaximander and Thales of Miletus. In evolving the thinking of Thales, we’re told, Anaximander was not only the first human to argue that rain was caused by the observable movements of air and the heat of the sun rather than the intervention of gods – the kind of “natural wisdom” that was heretical enough to lead to the trial and death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/17/socrates-philosopher-man-for-our-times">Socrates</a> 200 years later – he was, crucially, also the first thinker to make the case that the Earth was a body suspended in a void of space, within which the sun and stars did not form a canopy or ceiling but revolved. This literal groundbreaking idea – inventing at a stroke the idea of the cosmos – was, as the historian of science Karl Popper suggested, “one of the boldest, most revolutionary and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/13/anaximander-and-the-nature-of-science-by-carlo-rovelli-review-the-ancient-master-of-the-universe">Continue reading...</a>

## Is commuting good for you? I miss the break between work and home | Emma Beddington

<p>How do you switch off at the end of the day if there’s no journey involved? Gardening? Sex? Crisps?</p><p>If you’re reading this standing in a stationary train’s vestibule, squeezed between a furtive flosser and someone eating a keto breakfast of hard-boiled eggs and sardines, while everyone listens to Jolyon on speakerphone review the new draft pitch deck, take heart: commuting is good for you.</p><p>It’s the second outing I have spotted for this argument. In 2021, the Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/that-dreaded-commute-is-actually-good-for-your-health">asserted the value of commuting in setting and maintaining boundaries</a> between work and home selves, thus avoiding burnout.

There are psychological as well as physical and temporal dimensions to the commute, they argue, and “the experience of rolelessness” during it may create a mental space for “psychological role transition and recovery”.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/13/is-commuting-good-for-you-i-miss-the-break-between-work-and-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A wilderness break in the Highlands offers eco-friendly accommodation and travel, and visits to projects promoting regenerative farming and reforestation</p><p>The sky’s a hazy grey as the sun starts to rise, just visible behind the dense low-hanging cloud. We slide slowly – though not silently – into mirror-smooth Loch Ossian. Reflections of bare-branched trees ripple, a bird of prey hovers on the horizon. It doesn’t get much wilder than this; a full immersion into the elemental Highlands.</p><p>We’re staying at the Loch Ossian youth hostel at the water’s edge, one of the most remote in the UK. Off-grid, with no vehicle access and sleeping 20 in two bunkrooms, it’s a place to truly escape from the world. Old black-and-white photos of early female mountaineers hang on the walls; our damp hiking gear dries on racks by the fire; at night the pitch-black sky twinkles with countless stars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/13/sustainable-scotland-the-low-carbon-road-to-the-highlands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After overcoming her addiction to drinks and drugs, Suzy Morrison realised she also had an unhealthy relationship with money. Two years later she was solvent – for the first time in her life</p><p>As a child, Suzy Morrison eyed her father’s pay packets. He worked in the woollen mill in Milton, New Zealand, and each week he handed Morrison’s mother a plump manila packet. “I was very interested in that envelope,” Morrison says.</p><p>Nothing was said about the money, but sometimes while she tried to sleep Morrison heard arguments drift through the ceiling to her bedroom: her mother had spent too much. On those nights, while she lay anxiously listening, Morrison began to fear money, its secrecy and scarcity; and from those first kernels of fear grew decades of debt.

<p>Annabel Verbeke’s amiable film peregrinates around the question of cultural identity on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland</p><p>‘Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. 24/7,” bemoans one young Northern Irish man to his mates. “If it comes on [TV], I just go on my phone.” Annabel Verbeke’s piece of amiable, breeze-shooting psychogeography whiles away a few afternoons on and around the Carlingford Lough ferry, which crosses the invisible Ireland-Northern Ireland border. Anxieties about the possibility of a hard border raise the spectre of old enmities, but the general excitement over spotting one frontier-oblivious local – Finn the dolphin – shows there is no sectarian divide a few aquatic somersaults can’t cross.</p><p>Amid the various day-trippers, kite-flyers, golfers, BMX bandits, farmers, hearse drivers and other punters eavesdropped on by Verbeke, you get the impression that she herself may think borders are arbitrary and meaningless. As a group of Asian tourists comment, borders obscure the similarities, or sameness, of the people on either side. The two northern gents chatting outside a Protestant church – one of whom comments pointedly on how Dublin is becoming “cosmopolitan” – presumably don’t agree. Ethnocentrism is evidently a hardy plant. One southerner, who approves of multiculturalism and refuses to recognise the border, still says: “The British will never be able to take my Irishness away from me.”</p><p>Four Seasons in a Day is available on 17 February on True Story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/13/four-seasons-in-a-day-review-playful-amble-along-irelands-post-brexit-borderland">Continue reading...</a>

The headline crowed: “I beat my demons to be world champ … now I want an Oscar.” It was hard to know whether Paterson was rash, brash or simply delusional. The athlete had no track record in film. By then, she had spent five years trying and failing to remake the first world war epic All Quiet on the Western Front. It felt like a grand folly. Even her loved ones thought it was a pipe dream.</p><p>This week, Paterson is up for the best adapted screenplay Bafta for All Quiet, alongside her co-writer Ian Stokell and director Edward Berger. On 13 March, she will attend the Academy Awards, where she hopes to win her Oscar for best adapted screenplay. In total, the film has been nominated for nine Oscars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/13/the-screenwriter-who-would-not-quit-how-lesley-paterson-funded-her-16-year-oscar-dream-by-winning-triathlons">Continue reading...</a>

So, perhaps it’s not surprising that the buyer ended up backing out, and tens of thousands of pounds weren’t spent on a bulbous belly, wobbly eyes and that trademark polka dot bow tie.</p><p>Then again, perhaps it is. Little known to most of us, there is a ferocious, often highly secretive trade in British TV props. In 2019, for example, a painting from the 80s sitcom ’Allo ’Allo! sold for £18,000 – The Fallen Madonna With the Big Boobies is officially worth just a grand less than a molar pulled from Lennon’s head. It’s not quite the £2m that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/29/r2-d2-droid-used-in-star-wars-films-sells-for-276m">an original R2-D2 can go for at auction</a> – or the £3.5m someone once paid for a Batmobile – but it’s still big money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/13/please-dont-email-me-the-secretive-collectors-of-obscure-tv-memorabilia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Romeo, an out-of-work single dad, falls for Julie, a top student who dreams of being an astrophysicist. We go behind the scenes at a Shakespeare update that swaps fair Verona for Splott in Cardiff</p><p>Gary Owen has always loved romcoms. When Harry Met Sally? “It’s the best.” The Worst Person in the World? “Incredible!” This might surprise anyone who has seen Owen’s political plays and been hit by their searing interrogations of social injustice, demotic poetry and unsentimental power.</p><p>But the Welsh playwright has been trying to write a romcom for years, he explains, over lunch at the National Theatre with Irish director Rachel O’Riordan. The two are longtime collaborators: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/oct/02/iphigenia-in-splott-review-gary-owen-sophie-melville-lyric-hammersmith-london">last year, O’Riordan revived her production</a> of his 2015 play Iphigenia in Splott, an incendiary take on ancient Greek tragedy that was an indictment of modern-day Britain. Now, they are teaming up for Romeo and Julie, which puts a romcom-ish spin on Romeo and Juliet. The “ish” is key: Shakespeare’s tragedy would need quite a spin considering its double-suicide ending.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/13/babygrows-such-sweet-sorrow-romeo-juliet-romcom-nt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The star zipped through her many hits with ease at her first show in four years, but there was a much-needed electricity missing</p><p>Four years since her last live performance, seven since her last studio album, Rihanna wasted no time to make a statement during her return to the stage at the Super Bowl halftime show. There was no entrance montage to her set, no musical build-up; we opened close up on Rihanna’s face, chin down as if readying for battle, her presence after years of pop music absentia an exclamation point unto itself. Dressed in a fittingly bold red suit, the Barbadian singer commanded a floating stage perched scarily high above the field, launched into a hard kickoff of her discography with Bitch Better Have My Money, and with one sweep of her hand over her belly, seemingly announced her second pregnancy just nine months after the birth of her son.</p><p>Such is the power of Rihanna, a mega-celebrity whose charisma and famously relaxed charm (and successful fashion and beauty businesses) have carried her through a long musical hiatus and at times overshadowed her extensive catalog of hits. Her halftime show capitalized on her reputation as being unbothered and effortlessly cool – no musical guest, barely any choreography, no stress or strenuousness, a possible huge pop culture news drop as a casual aside. (Her publicist has since <a href="">confirmed</a> the pregnancy.) At times she seemed a half beat behind her army of white-clad, hard-elbowed backup dancers. She floated, at certain points literally (and seemingly without fear of heights) above the expectations of an all-gas, no-brakes halftime show, with a detachment that could read as admirable self-possession or as frustrating boredom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/12/rihannas-super-bowl-halftime-show-a-welcome-return-for-pops-relaxed-queen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian forces suffer highest rate of casualties over the past two weeks, UK MoD says; founder of Russia’s Wagner group says force has taken village of Krasna Hora, north of Bakhmut</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner group, said the mercenary force has taken the village of Krasna Hora</strong>, on the northern edge of the embattled city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.
