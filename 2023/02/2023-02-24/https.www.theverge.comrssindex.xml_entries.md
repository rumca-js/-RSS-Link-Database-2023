It’s an escalation of the company’s questionable climate change-fighting tactics, which got it banned from launching balloons in Mexico in January.

Between frequent server outages and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23603101/fitbit-google-challenges-adventures-community">a recent decision to shutter popular social features</a>, frustrated Fitbit customers say they’re weighing their options.</p>
<p id="wEU51a">Earlier this month, Google-owned Fitbit suffered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23587745/fitbit-outage-offline-wearables-backup-sync-settings">a massive server outage</a> that left users unable to sync trackers or view their data within the app or on Fitbit’s website. If it had been a one-off server outage, it’s likely users would’ve written it off as a fluke. But it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23589145/fitbit-outage-sync-wearables-settings">extended into a second day</a> and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591404/get-it-together-fitbit">a third</a>. Then, around 1PM ET yesterday, over 1,600 users reported yet another outage, according to <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/fitbit/">Downdetector</a>. Others <a href="https://twitter.com/st_jimmys_angel/status/1628817867939500032?s=20">reported the outage</a> to the <a href="https://twitter.com/FitbitSupport">@...</a></p>
