At Bisham Abbey, then the headquarters of the England national squad, my team of jobbing journalists played a charity match against the show ponies that were the television commentators, including Alan Parry, Martin Tyler and the man himself. Motty was hilarious, charging around without his spectacles, head down and throwing himself into tackles. Unlike the broadcast version, this Motty cussed and swore, not at the opposition but at what he saw as his own ineptitude. The commentators won comfortably, with the lanky goal-hanger Tyler scoring a hat-trick. Afterwards, Motty was the first to the bar, wallet in hand, buying all us lesser mortals a drink.

My son Harry was a postman in Bournemouth a few years ago and one of the homes in his round was that of then-manager Eddie Howe. He regularly delivered what he took to be coaching videos and when the team first won promotion to the Premier League, he popped a card congratulating Eddie on the achievement through his letterbox. Gentleman Eddie very kindly responded with a handwritten note\u201d \u2013 Andy Sherwood.</p><p>I only lasted a week as a postman, but I did deliver milk to John Aldridge on many occasions during his Oxford United days. I never met him, but I guess 6am is a bit early for a casual chat with most people (including me)\u201d \u2013 Richard O\u2019Hagan.</p><p>I didn\u2019t deliver post, but I did deliver loads of papers, and clean a lot of cars. Growing up in classic Birds-of-a-Feather Chigwell, our garden backed on to Geoff Hurst\u2019s post-hat-trick gaff. Not only did this make it prime \u2018please mister, can we have our ball back\u2019 territory (we always could), it also put him in the centre of my Cub Scout bob-a-job empire. A public-spirited Mrs Hurst had me cleaning the Escort Mexico in the drive (reg plate GWC 10, apparently for \u2018Grand World Cup\u2019) and an abundant selection of boots in the garage, donating at least a shilling and sixpence to the cause. I delivered their morning paper on my regular round and, as an occasional extra, often to the Moores too (GWC 6). Bobby\u2019s order was the classic \u2018broadsheet outside, tabloid within\u2019 affair, but seeing as both the M*il and Expr*ss came in huge spyhole-friendly format back then, it was an unusually ineffective defensive tactic\u201d \u2013 Tim Lawler.</p><p>When I was a kid, in the early-1970s, I had an evening paper round for the evening Liverpool Echo. I was lucky that I had about half of the Liverpool team on my round, including Emlyn Hughes and John Toshack. They were nearly all waiting anxiously to read their \u2018school report\u2019 from 48 hours previous: no internet in them days. Confidentiality forbids me from revealing who the worst Christmas tippers were. On a similar note, my mum\u2019s car broke down outside the newsagents in Formby.

The streaming platform which has been facing stiff competition from Disney+ and other players, has acted nimbly to tackle the macroeconomic challenges from a softening consumer and slowing growth. In response to its drop in subscriber numbers last year, Netflix has been cutting jobs, cutting prices, and adapting its business model to remain relevant during the cost-of-living crisis. Given that streaming is an easy to cut, non-essential spend, Netflix\u2019s strategy has paid off, helping the TV and movie platform to remain relevant at a time when consumer budgets are feeling the pinch.</p><p>After a torrid first half of 2022, shares in Netflix have been regaining ground, rallying more than 40% over the last six months.
