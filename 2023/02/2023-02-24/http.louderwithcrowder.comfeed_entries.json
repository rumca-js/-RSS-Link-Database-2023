Yesterday, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates shared a video of Karine Jean-Pierre. The video was originally posted by Greg Price, <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Senior Digital Strategist of </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">X Strategies LLC. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Before Bates shared the clip, Price had temporarily changed his Twitter name to read, \"Joe Biden Showered With His Daughter\u201d. So this is what showed up below Bates's tweet. The deputy press secretary. For Joe Biden. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Bates might wanna polish his resume. </span></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c@AndrewJBates46 Lmaoooo\\u201d</div> \u2014 Andrew Bates (@Andrew Bates)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnPaulThee3rd/status/1628840195050151939\">1677180144</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the clip, Jean-Pierre was lamenting the \"bad faith attacks\" launched against Pete Buttigieg for his failure to do anything about the train derailment in <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pete-buttigieg-photographs-reporter-confronts\" target=\"_self\">East Palestine</a>. Like, he did nothing at all. He didn't even visit until yesterday. But KJP was very upset over these \"attacks\" on her fellow diversity hire.</p><p>The name Price chose was, of course, a reference to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-project-veritas-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley Biden's diary</a> and the passage about Ashley showering with her father, Joe. It does not appear that Bates ever responded to or acknowledged his slip-up. <br /></p><p>To make matters even worse, this isn't the first time Bates was humiliated on the internet because of a tweet. Last year, Bates tweeted out a meme of \"Dark Brandon\". <br /></p><p>Bates tweeted out this meme, and Twitter users quickly noticed something a tad disturbing. The eagle in the background bears a striking resemblance to Nazi symbolism. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c@SteveGuest\\u201d</div> \u2014 Steve Guest (@Steve Guest)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewJBates46/status/1556451566957346816\">1659919417</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c@NotThatGuyTX @redsteeze @AndrewJBates46 @SteveGuest Pretty sure they're wrong about the direction the eagle faces.\\n\\nParteiadler faces to its left and was replaced by the Reichsadler after the Nazi party gained power.\\n\\nThe Reichsadler faces to its right and was the version used by the Third Reich - also the one Andrew Bates invoked\\u201d</div> \u2014 Steve Guest (@Steve Guest)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The4ourthBranch/status/1556727476151128066\">1659919417</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Dark Brandon\" is the alter-ego pushed by Biden's team to distract from Biden's general lack of awareness of anything around him at any given moment in time. \"Dark Brandon\" is a sassy, sharp old man who drives a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/corvette-biden-doocy\" target=\"_blank\">Corvette</a> and totally OWNS Republicans on the daily. But in reality, Biden just has dementia. Really. </p><p>Now, I don't think the Biden administration <em>purposely</em> tweeted out Nazi imagery.

Where he used anti-Semitic slurs, harassed two Girl Scouts employees, and did time in prison attempting to extort millions from the organization.</p><p>Deemed to be too much of a scumbag for New York City, he naturally made his way to California.

And, if you'll excuse me, I just discovered arthritis in a new joint. It's one of two movies, the other being <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, that is regularly the target of CANCELATION on the internet because the comedy doesn't match with 2023's soy-based sensitivities. There are two main reasons. One is Robert Downey Jr. playing a British dude playing a black dude in blackface (he's a method actor). The other is Ben Stiller playing a word that will get us dinged on Facebook, we have a clip of it a little later.</p><p>Rest assured, though. Ben Stiller (when he's not making <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-sandler-gotham-awards\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Sandler's daughter's favorite movies</a>) REFUSES to apologize for making the movie.
