<p>The ACT side notched its 10th straight win over NSW, as a teenage son of a gun announced himself as a new star</p><p>The Brumbies have gatecrashed the NSW Waratahs’ homecoming to Allianz Stadium, edging their Super Rugby Pacific rivals in a 31-25 win. In their first game at the venue in five years, the Waratahs were caught napping at key moments and Stephen Larkham’s Brumbies will head back down the highway with a hard-earned victory.</p><p>There was some solace for the 25,076 fans present on Friday night, who got to witness the debut of highly-touted teenager Max Jorgensen. The 18-year-old, who became the youngest Waratahs debutant since Kurtley Beale, grabbed two tries in a promising maiden outing at the top level.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/25/crafty-brumbies-edge-waratahs-in-super-rugby-opener-despite-max-jorgensen-double">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Allyson Ryan captures the sharp dialogue and sardonic wit in this tale of a newly divorced doctor whose ex-wife disappears </p><p>Toby Fleishman is a newly divorced doctor and father of two alone and adrift in New York after 14 years of marriage. A bundle of anxiety and neuroses, he wakes up every morning in a place that isn’t the family home and thinks: “Something is wrong. There is trouble. I am in trouble.” He is overwhelmed by the possibilities of online dating, where, for the first time in his life, women can’t get enough of him and deluge him with semi-naked selfies: “All this new opportunity! There weren’t enough hours in the day!” But his problems really begin when his ex-wife, Rachel, drops their children off in the dead of night to go on a yoga retreat and then disappears seemingly without trace.<br /><br />The New York Times Magazine writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s funny, acerbic and precisely plotted debut novel – a TV adaptation of which arrives this month starring Jesse Eisenberg and Claire Danes – is read here by the voice actor Allyson Ryan, who makes the most of the author’s sharp dialogue and sardonic wit. Fleishman’s story is told through the eyes of his old college friend Libby, formerly a magazine profile writer and now a stay-at-home mother, who recalls him saying that his wife, a successful talent agent, “was just angry all the time”. But if the early chapters present Fleishman as put-upon and overshadowed by the icily ambitious, social-climbing, money-obsessed Rachel, a more complex picture of the former couple emerges later on, building to a climax that requires the listener to re-evaluate all they think they knew.<br /><br />• Fleishman Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner is available from Wildfire, 14hr 34min.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/24/fleishman-is-in-trouble-by-taffy-brodesser-akner-audiobook-review-sex-selfies-and-marital-meltdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The city will host the Games in 2028 and the costs – as they always do – are already mounting. The city’s mayor needs to grab back some control</p><p>When the International Olympic Committee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/31/los-angeles-2028-olympic-games-host-deal">handed</a> the 2028 Olympics to Los Angeles back in 2017, the Games floated fuzzily in a futuristic fairyland.

Today, five years before the Games, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/16/karen-bass-los-angeles-mayor-victory-us-midterms">freshly elected</a> mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, is sliding into the same well-worn grooves of Olympic myth-making.

It’s not too late.</p><p>Bass arrives with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/07/karen-bass-joe-biden-vp-california-congresswoman">progressive bona fides</a>. Her election is meant to herald a more just city government that is less hostile to workers and the poor, particularly the legions of those who are unhoused. Yet when it comes to the 2028 Olympics, Bass has been more of the same, essentially cloning the missteps of her predecessor. She made this clear when she <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-29/mayor-elect-bass-names-christopher-thompson-as-chief-of-staff">selected</a> Christopher Thompson to be her chief of staff.

<p>Uncrewed combat aerial vehicles, or attack drones, have become a common feature of the modern battlefield. Russia has deployed them to terrorise civilians in Ukraine and disable essential infrastructure, and Ukraine has also relied heavily on drones for attack, reconnaissance and surveillance. But these aren't the only 'killer robots' that armies are utilising. Josh Toussaint-Strauss explores how the weaponisation of general-purpose robots and the developments of a wider array of advanced mobile robotics and AI powered machine are changing the dynamics of modern warfare in ways that have prompted leading robotics companies and the UN to raise the alarm and call for greater restrictions</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/20/part-of-the-kill-chain-how-can-we-control-weaponised-robots">Part of the kill chain’: how can we control weaponised robots?</a></p><p><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2023/feb/24/how-killer-robots-are-changing-modern-warfare-video">Continue reading...</a>

## Your Mother Should Know: Brad Mehldau Plays the Beatles review | John Fordham's jazz album of the month

<p><strong>(Nonesuch)<br /></strong>In a powerful live recording, the piano virtuoso brings out the boogie, blues and gospel in the Fab Four’s songs</p><p>Brad Mehldau, as inquisitive a philosopher as he is a tirelessly curious jazz-piano virtuoso, believes that an alluring strangeness is key to an artwork’s longevity. A longtime <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles">Beatles</a> fan, he hears that quality in the group’s mid-60s psychedelic metamorphosis – when their unfamiliar harmonies and quirky rhythms infiltrated pop through albums such as Rubber Soul and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/27/the-beatles-revolver-album-special-edition-super-deluxe-review">Revolver</a>.</p><p>A classical piano student with prog-rock leanings in his teens and an enthusiasm for the Beach Boys, the Zombies and Bowie, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/brad-mehldau">Mehldau</a> discovered the Beatles relatively late. He has periodically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57XN3yuhsE0">played their songs since the 1990s</a>, but this 2020 Paris concert is an all-Beatles set, save for the Lennon-influenced David Bowie track Life on Mars?. After opening with I Am the Walrus, taking a hypnotic hook through to a rousing finale, Mehldau plays the title track as an early-jazz stride-piano piece (a nod to McCartney’s vaudeville leanings), I Saw Her Standing There as a driving boogie, and the original slow-rocking lament of Baby’s in Black as something hauntingly close to a gospel hymn. The Abbey Road lullaby Golden Slumbers gets steadily bluesier until it evaporates in glinting top-end whispers, and Life on Mars? is a whirling contrapuntal improvisation that brings the Philharmonie de Paris crowd to roars. This will be too much of a standards-like set for some, maybe – but even if Mehldau the solo pianist has had to trade rock’s muscularity for a chamber-musical delicacy, his power isn’t far beneath the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/24/your-mother-should-know-brad-mehldau-plays-the-beatles-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United and Newcastle collide at Wembley, as Javi Gracia begins life at Leeds</p><p>No team has coughed up more points from winning positions than Leicester this season, who have squandered 19 from games in which they took the lead. While it required the early heroics of David de Gea to prevent them going ahead against Manchester United last Sunday, their players visibly wilted in the face of his resistance followed by Marcus Rashford’s opener, a goal James Maddison admitted “completely knocked the stuffing out of us”. With league leaders Arsenal travelling to the King Power Stadium, Brendan Rodgers will hope his players can show the kind of resilience that was apparent in recent come-from-behind wins against Aston Villa and Spurs, rather than the soft underbelly that has been exposed by so many. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong></p><p><em>Leicester v Arsenal, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Tottenham v Chelsea, Sunday 1.30pm</em></p><p><em>Crystal Palace v Liverpool, Saturday 7.45pm</em></p><p><em>Leeds v Southampton, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/24/premier-league-and-carabao-cup-final-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
