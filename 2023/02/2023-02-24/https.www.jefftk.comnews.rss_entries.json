At which point people others naturally\nbristle: what happens between consenting adults is no one else's\nbusiness, and it's wrong to try and influence others here.  For \n\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y9ELNXmLDSDi8Z6RX/in-mild-defence-of-the-social-professional-overlap-in-ea\">example</a>:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nI don't see any way you could meaningfully \"address\" the work/social\noverlap without trying to get people not to date, live with or\nbefriend people they otherwise would have dated, lived with, or\nbefriended.

Still, I think it's worth\ngetting some of that nuance out there.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSpecifically, consent isn't always enough.  Even consent plus a mature\nawareness of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fovDwkBQgTqRMoHZM/power-dynamics-between-people-in-ea\">power\ndynamics</a> isn't always enough.  Consider a case of someone whose\njob it is to direct funding for a foundation sleeping with one of the\npeople who runs an organization they might recommend\nfunding.  And let's further imagine that the grantmaker and grantee\nboth have a sophisticated understanding of power dynamics, great\ncommunication, solid introspection, strong self-confidence, and the\nbest of intentions.  Even then, this has corrosive effects on the\ncommunity, including:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Other grantees would then feel pressure to sleep with grantmakers,\nleading to bad interactions, including ones where all the signals that\nthe grantmaker receives are that the grantee wants this.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The funders behind the grantmaker may reasonably worry that the\ngrantmaker's judgement is clouded by their otherwise positive views\ntowards this grantee or that there was quid pro quo.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>People with unsavory intentions may choose to become\ngrantmakers because a norm of \"it's ok to sleep with grantees\" is very\nvulnerable to abuse.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThese are harmful enough that we can't leave it to the couple to\ndetermine whether their roles as grantmaker/grantee and lovers are\ncompatible.  That sometimes someone's role conflicts with a\nrelationship they would like to have is unfortunate, but not always\navoidable and not unique to this case: other examples of romantic\nrelationships with similar issues include ones between managers and\ntheir reports or professors and their students.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOrganizations handle these conflicts in a range of ways, often\ndepending on how they think about the effects of these relationships\non others and whether they can satisfactorily mitigate the\nprofessional consequences of a particular relationship.  For example:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>A university might consider the initiation of any relationships\nbetween students and professors to have a harmful effect on their\nculture, and that students should be able to trust that professors are\ninterested in them only academically.  If they prohibit them, a\nprofessor would need to choose between avoiding such relationships and\nresigning their post.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>A large funder might require disclosure and recusal: when a\nrelationship relevant to a grantmaker's work comes up they work with\ntheir manager to transfer responsibilities so that the grantmaker is\nno longer influencing outcomes for the grantee.  This is also how\nlarger organizations usually handle employee relationships that\ninteract with formal power.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>A small funder might not be able to do this, perhaps\nbecause they only have one grantmaker in an area.  Options for\nhandling this could include committing not to fund the relevant\norganization, the grantmaker leaving, or the grantmaker passing up the\nrelationship.  All of these have significant downsides.  Smaller\norganizations, or specialized departments within larger organizations,\ncan have similar issues that would keep them from being able to\nmitigate the effects of an employee relationship.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThere are also other areas where we accept people have a valid\ninterest in discouraging some kinds of consensual interpersonal\nbehavior, where power dynamics and conflicts of interest are not the\nconcerns.  For example, norms against cheating in relationships, \nsleeping with your bandmates, or hookups within a military unit.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAs I wrote above, I don't think this is especially controversial.  But\nit shows that the question is what norms we should have and not\nwhether it is legitimate to have norms beyond consent.  This is the approach\nwe need when considering the actually controversial cases.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the more specific question of what norms to have, I don't know.\nThis requires weighing harms like the departure of people frustrated\nby excessive romantic attention, abuse of ambiguous power, loving\nrelationships that don't happen, exclusion of unconventional thinkers,\nand delay in ejecting jerks.  I think the discussion has shown both\nthat we didn't have much agreement on what norms we'd been\noperating under and that we have a wide range of opinion on what's\nreasonable behavior. I'm hoping we can get closer to figuring out what\nsort of norms would best make a thriving community that supports all\nof us in making the world better.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n<i>Disclosure: my <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/\">wife</a> is on the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/community-health\">Community\nHealth Team</a> at the Centre for Effective Altruism.
