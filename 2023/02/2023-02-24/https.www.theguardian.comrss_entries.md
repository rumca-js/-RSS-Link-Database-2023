## Beyond Paradise review – Kris Marshall’s detective spinoff swaps sunshine for awful fart gags

<p>The best thing about Death in Paradise was always its tropical setting. Now it moves to Devon for a Doctor Martin-aping, unfunny sister show featuring one of its ex stars</p><p>Sometimes all you need in TV is a simple idea, and the one behind Death in Paradise is very straightforward. Having first aired on BBC One in 2011, it’s a regular cosy crime drama filmed in Guadeloupe and set on the gorgeous fictional Caribbean island of Saint Marie – but with a detective who is a British (or Irish) man abroad. A standard whodunnit in escapist packaging, it is still running, having easily survived the problem of regularly having to replace the main character with a new inspector because the main actor has tired of working away from home. One of those former leads, Kris Marshall, now heads up a new series that shows how big Death in Paradise is: it has a spinoff, Beyond Paradise, a case-of-the-week sleuther set back here in Blighty.</p><p>In other words, it’s Death in Paradise without the number-one thing people like about Death in Paradise – although historically Marshall must be somewhere close to second place. Ralf Little may have just equalled his record as the show’s longest-serving detective, and Ben Miller originated the role, but if you close your eyes, centre your breathing and try to imagine Death in Paradise – feel the sand beneath your feet, hear the faint creaking of the storylines – it’s probably Marshall’s stringy, strawberry-topped misfit DI Humphrey Goodman who appears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/24/beyond-paradise-review-death-in-paradise-kris-marshall-spinoff">Continue reading...</a>

## We Have a Ghost review – supernatural Netflix caper needs more spirit

<p>A so-so attempt to recall kids films of the 80s struggles to find its own personality amidst its many influences</p><p>One of the hardest big screen losses during the quick shuttering and slow re-opening of cinemas during the pandemic was the lack of a major audience for body swap comedy horror <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/11/freaky-review-wildly-entertaining-body-swap-comedy-horror">Freaky</a>, a snappy crowd-pleaser that never really had the chance to truly please a substantial crowd. Writer-director Christopher Landon’s niftily effective and surprisingly sensitive mash-up of Friday the 13th and Freaky Friday was bundled into multiplexes when audiences were still staying away, and as such, remains cruelly under-seen.</p><p>Like Landon’s previous work – writing scripts for Disturbia and Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and directing Happy Death Days 1 and 2 – it showcased a buoyancy of tone that ensured fun was being had even when frightening things were happening. It makes sense that he would then parlay that into the world of family films and so his Netflix caper We Have a Ghost might be aimed at a younger demographic but it retains a similar speed and spirit. But as perfect as this match-up might seem on paper, the move has also come at a cost, a loss of something more distinctive perhaps. Landon has always been transparent about his influences – Happy Death Day recalling Groundhog Day, Disturbia recalling Rear Window (to the extent that Hitchcock’s estate tried to sue) – but here, he’s too busy trying to conjure the vibe of a certain type of film to focus on crafting something of his own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/24/we-have-a-ghost-review-supernatural-netflix-caper-needs-more-spirit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a week of brinkmanship, a mental challenge awaits the two teams in Cardiff as much as a physical one</p><p>There is a doctoral thesis to be written on the psychology of Wales v England rugby fixtures in Cardiff. Hope, anxiety, fear, claustrophobia … and that’s just the cross-border trek to the Principality Stadium on big match days. Contractual small print and player power <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/22/wales-v-england-six-nations-clash-to-go-ahead-as-players-call-off-strike" title="">may have grabbed this week’s headlines</a> but Wales’s fattest bonus should probably go to anybody who can finally sort out the Brynglas tunnels.</p><p>Then again, at least there is still a live game to attend. Imagine, for a moment, if the threatened Welsh players’ strike had gone ahead? Tumbleweed blowing down Westgate Street, sad empty pubs, Valley Girl T-shirts back in the wardrobe … it would have been an utter financial and PR catastrophe. The Six Nations has weathered various storms over the years but nothing to compare with the bleak symbolism of Wales declining to lace up their boots to play the English.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/24/rugby-union-six-nations-wales-england-cardiff">Continue reading...</a>

## Katherina Radeva: 40/40 review – joyful dance in defiance of convention

<p><strong>The Place, London<br /></strong>Radeva delivers a gloriously uncomplicated and deeply felt performance that is a delight to watch</p><p>There is a breed of performance, usually a solo show, that is not about presenting a choreography or a text. It’s more like: “I want to give you something, I’m not sure what form it’s going to take, I just want to be with you and I want you to see me.” If that sounds a little solipsistic, it really isn’t. At least not in Katherina Radeva’s <a href="https://www.twodestinationlanguage.com/on-stage/4040">40/40</a>, an exercise in generosity of spirit.</p><p>Radeva is a set and costume designer, an artist and printmaker, a theatre-maker. She’s not a trained dancer but when she hit 40 and set out to make this piece, it was to ask why we shouldn’t see a body like hers on stage. She tells a story of doing rhythmic gymnastics as a child – she was good at it, too – but her teacher said she couldn’t take part in competitions because she wasn’t thin enough. So it’s a political act just to be here, a middle-aged woman, an immigrant, to present herself and “her Balkan body” to the public without shame, to defy “this permission business” about what’s worthy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/24/katherina-radeva-4040-review-the-place-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government’s white paper on football governance is a significant step in the right direction</p><p>When a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-securing-the-games-future/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-securing-the-games-future" title="">fan-led review,</a> chaired by the former sports minister Tracey Crouch, explored ways to redistribute football income to non-Premier League clubs, the indignant chief executive of Leeds United, Angus Kinnear, denounced the project as akin to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/01/leeds-chief-executive-likens-call-for-transfer-levy-and-regulator-to-maoism" title="">“Maoist collective agriculturalism”</a>. <em>Pace</em> Mr Kinnear, as the upper reaches of the national game risk becoming a private playground for American hedge funds and sportswashing states, a more collectivist mindset in football is exactly what is required.</p><p>The publication of this week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/23/english-footballs-regulator-what-will-it-do-and-is-it-a-blow-for-premier-league" title="">football white paper</a> – which draws heavily on the Crouch review’s proposals – is a landmark moment, and a step in that direction. The most eye-catching part of the plan is the creation of the first independent regulator of men’s football in England, charged with protecting the integrity and sustainability of the game at all levels.

<p>If Israel’s counter-terrorism apparatus did not exist, I dread to think how many more zeros would have be added to the total, says <strong>Orly Goldschmidt</strong></p><p>Jalal Abukhater’s article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/07/jerusalem-israel-demolitions-palestinians">There’s no cycle of violence in Jerusalem – only Israel’s lethal oppression of my people, 7 February</a>), published days after a Palestinian terrorist murdered seven innocent people at a synagogue in Jerusalem on Holocaust Memorial Day, subordinates the value of Israeli lives.</p><p>Palestinians and Israelis are both suffering, and this pains me. This is precisely why the article illustrates a problem in the wider discourse – the denial of, and refusal to accept, Israeli suffering. In 2022, Israelis suffered from over 5,000 Palestinian terror attacks, including car-rammings, shootings, stabbings and bombings targeting innocent men, women and children on the streets of Israel. This is the reality on the ground. On 10 February, for example, a Palestinian drove his car into a crowded bus stop, <a href="https://www.jta.org/2023/02/11/israel/8-year-old-injured-in-eastern-jerusalem-car-ramming-attack-dies">killing three people</a>, including two brothers aged six and eight. Just imagine you or your loved ones falling victim to such abhorrent terror on your way to work. This is precisely why Israel’s counter-terrorism apparatus exists, because without it I dread to think how many more zeros would be added to that 5,000 total.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/israel-was-hit-by-5000-palestinian-terror-attacks-in-2022-it-has-to-defend-itself">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Home Office questionnaire is unlikely to provide an answer to the problems that are causing delays</p><p>Since Rishi Sunak announced his plan to reduce the number of unprocessed asylum claims, the backlog has swelled. Some 166,000 people are now waiting for a decision on their case. Political pressure is mounting on the government. The doubling of <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/migrant-hunts-double-in-one-year-9rjf8p82c" title="">“migrant hunts”</a> targeting hotels housing asylum seekers – such as the recent protests organised by far-right groups in Knowsley – only adds to the urgency of this situation.</p><p>The Home Office will now allow 12,000 asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/22/home-office-plans-to-use-questionnaires-to-clear-asylum-backlog" title="">complete a questionnaire</a> in place of an interview. In principle, this makes sense: the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/609123ed4/unhcrs-guide-to-asylum-reform-in-the-united-kingdom" title="">UN refugee agency</a> has called for a “triaged” approach, and those who will probably be granted refugee status should be fast-tracked. But the form is wickedly complex, with more than 50 questions that must be answered in English. Asylum seekers will have only 20 days to complete it – hardly enough time to access scarce legal advice. If they fail to do so, their application may be withdrawn, meaning at best that they have to reapply and at worst that they are at risk of return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-asylum-backlog-sticking-plasters-are-no-solution">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff<br /></strong>Hymns, jazz, doo-wop and 19th-century French choral numbers form an unlikely patchwork in Caroline Clegg’s dynamic theatrical staging</p><p>W<a href="https://wno.org.uk/">elsh National Opera</a>’s new production can’t really be said to be an opera, running as it does a gamut of styles, with Welsh hymns as cornerstones in a structure featuring jazz, popular music and doo-wop, as well as 19th-century French choral numbers. If <a href="http://dhackj.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html">David Hackbridge Johnson</a>’s score sounds like an unlikely patchwork, it is; yet the whole thing manages to work well as a show, bowling along with a warm, often suitably blazing, energy.</p><p>Set in a 1950s Welsh valleys mining community where the shadow of a recent colliery disaster darkens life, the story hinges on Dafydd Pugh, a pit foreman and former choirmaster, scarred by the loss of men on his watch, many of whom were his singers. Re-forming a choir under his baton is key to rebuilding morale – “to put the male back in the male voice choir” – and their bid for new glory. Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts is a big presence in this central role, and, if he sometimes seems simply to be playing a larger-than-life version of himself – accent, big heart and voice, that’s all to the good. His co-star, soprano <a href="https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/rebecca-evans/">Rebecca Evans</a>, barely reaches his shoulder but, in Nerys Price, creates a complete character as the choir accompanist marshalling her men. The echo of Under Milk Wood is a nice conceit: Evans’s Miss Price is a bolder version of Dylan Thomas’s love-stricken Myfanwy Price, while this Mr Pugh harbours none of the poisonous intentions of his namesake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/24/wno-blaze-of-glory-review-wales-millennium-centre-cardiff">Continue reading...</a>

Rumbustious Downing Street chief press secretary who was central to the style and success of the Thatcher revolution<p>As Margaret <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies" title="">Thatcher</a>’s devoted and indispensable (her words) chief press secretary for 11 years, the rumbustious Sir Bernard Ingham, who has died aged 90, was central to both the style and success of the Thatcher revolution. Acknowledged as the strongest figure to have done the job since the 1930s, Ingham moved to centralise the direction of government information, often to the discomfort of departmental ministers. This change, inevitable with the growth in electronic communications, was built on by the Blair government, although Ingham would claim that he was never involved in policymaking like Tony Blair’s director of communications and strategy, Alastair Campbell.</p><p>The clue to Ingham’s bond with Thatcher was that both saw themselves as outsiders against the establishment and, as she put it, “neither of us are smooth people”. He was well known for his choleric temperament, which could turn an already ruddy face bright red, for his almost blind loyalty to those he worked for (and to some degree those he picked to work under him) plus a capacity to undertake – and create – huge amounts of work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/24/sir-bernard-ingham-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

And something about it hadn’t quite looked right. After a conversation with a doctor, he picked up the phone to Klopp. “Your goalkeeper had a concussion,” Beckenbauer told Klopp.</p><p>An armchair diagnosis, for sure, but one that intrigued Klopp enough to make further inquiries. The next day Karius was flown to Boston where he had rigorous tests at the Spaulding Rehabilitation hospital. The concussion assessment consists of a checklist of 30 symptoms, including headache, light sensitivity, loss of memory and nausea. Five days after the biggest game of his life, Karius still had 26 of the 30 clinical signs of concussion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/24/loris-karius-newcastle-carabao-cup-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Local businesses feared the worst but the match day rush will be back for Saturday’s Six Nations showdown in the capital city</p><p>There is nowhere in the UK like Cardiff on a match day, and nothing in the UK quite like the atmosphere at the Principality Stadium when Wales are playing well. On Friday they were laying out the railings outside Cardiff Central station, ready for the rush, and rolling the last kegs off the lorries into the pub cellars along Westgate and St Mary’s. “If I’m honest, I never really believed the strike was going to go ahead,” says Gary Corp, the landlord at the City Arms, just over the road from the stadium. “It’s money that makes the world go around, isn’t it?” he shouts as he pops back to the cellar, “And there’s too much at stake.”</p><p>They say the game’s worth around £10m to the Welsh Rugby Union, and more than double that to the local economy. Back in 2017, it was estimated that a Wales home games generate £26m.

<p>Our sponsors in England could not have been kinder. But when the app on my phone buzzes, I know the Russians are attacking back home</p><p>My family and I didn’t expect to end up in the UK. We spent the first several months of the war in Ukraine in our home town of Boyarka, a small town near Kyiv.

Our two girls, Kseniia and Polina, are 12 and nine, and they’ve never known anywhere else either.

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Once the trendy London hangout for what seemed like every pigeon on the planet until some spoilsport introduced a breadcrumb ban, Trafalgar Square is bracing itself for an influx of Magpies. Travelling to that there London for their first cup final since 1999, tens of thousands of Newcastle United fans are expected to congregate around and – depending on how much Newkie Broon they’ve necked and the police presence – possibly <em>in</em> the famous fountain, before their big day out in Wembley on Sunday. It is at this point the previous incarnation of this daily email would make a predictable joke about fans of their opponents Manchester United sitting indoors in the surrounding London suburbs watching Casualty or Ant &amp; Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, but we’re all grown up these days and much better than that.</p><p>Re: the late John Motson (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/23/football-daily-email-john-motson">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>). At Bisham Abbey, then the headquarters of the England national squad, my team of jobbing journalists played a charity match against the show ponies that were the television commentators, including Alan Parry, Martin Tyler and the man himself. Motty was hilarious, charging around without his spectacles, head down and throwing himself into tackles. Unlike the broadcast version, this Motty cussed and swore, not at the opposition but at what he saw as his own ineptitude. The commentators won comfortably, with the lanky goal-hanger Tyler scoring a hat-trick. Afterwards, Motty was the first to the bar, wallet in hand, buying all us lesser mortals a drink. Top gentleman” – Jon Buss.</p><p>Re: delivering the post to footballers (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/23/football-daily-email-john-motson">yesterday’s Football Daily letters</a>). My son Harry was a postman in Bournemouth a few years ago and one of the homes in his round was that of then-manager Eddie Howe. He regularly delivered what he took to be coaching videos and when the team first won promotion to the Premier League, he popped a card congratulating Eddie on the achievement through his letterbox. Gentleman Eddie very kindly responded with a handwritten note” – Andy Sherwood.</p><p>I only lasted a week as a postman, but I did deliver milk to John Aldridge on many occasions during his Oxford United days. I never met him, but I guess 6am is a bit early for a casual chat with most people (including me)” – Richard O’Hagan.</p><p>I didn’t deliver post, but I did deliver loads of papers, and clean a lot of cars. Growing up in classic Birds-of-a-Feather Chigwell, our garden backed on to Geoff Hurst’s post-hat-trick gaff. Not only did this make it prime ‘please mister, can we have our ball back’ territory (we always could), it also put him in the centre of my Cub Scout bob-a-job empire. A public-spirited Mrs Hurst had me cleaning the Escort Mexico in the drive (reg plate GWC 10, apparently for ‘Grand World Cup’) and an abundant selection of boots in the garage, donating at least a shilling and sixpence to the cause. I delivered their morning paper on my regular round and, as an occasional extra, often to the Moores too (GWC 6). Bobby’s order was the classic ‘broadsheet outside, tabloid within’ affair, but seeing as both the M*il and Expr*ss came in huge spyhole-friendly format back then, it was an unusually ineffective defensive tactic” – Tim Lawler.</p><p>When I was a kid, in the early-1970s, I had an evening paper round for the evening Liverpool Echo. I was lucky that I had about half of the Liverpool team on my round, including Emlyn Hughes and John Toshack. They were nearly all waiting anxiously to read their ‘school report’ from 48 hours previous: no internet in them days. Confidentiality forbids me from revealing who the worst Christmas tippers were. On a similar note, my mum’s car broke down outside the newsagents in Formby. Howard Kendall lifted the bonnet and had it all sorted in a minute” – Mark Gillett.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily.

<p>Even now, female artists end up having their experience devalued or effaced. So I decided to start recording them</p><p>In the past few years, a wave of documentary films have revisited the lives of famous (or infamous) women of the 90s, examining how their careers exploded under the weight of misogyny and undue media scrutiny: beginning, perhaps, with the 2017 Lorena Bobbitt docuseries, and spanning Anita Hill in Speaking Truth to Power, the righteous exposé of Finding Britney, Monica Lewinsky in 15 Minutes of Shame, and Netflix’s new Pamela Anderson doc. The podcaster Yasi Salek has termed this cottage industry/genre “We’re Sorry” docs. Conveniently, “We’re Sorry” docs serve both the millennial need for accountability over the toxic culture they were raised in, and allow for some Gen X cultural sin-eating for not caring earlier, having come up in a time where any beautiful blonde on TV was deemed a “bimbo” and any woman aspiring to fame deserved whatever she got.</p><p>Yet, as moving and necessary as all these documentaries are, there is little in the way of recourse. The sanctity of these women’s careers and lives is already spent, with empathy and hand-wringing mea culpas coming only in retrospect. How do we rectify this? How do we set about properly appreciating and seeing women’s ambitions <em>now</em>?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/24/men-often-ignore-women-musicians-stories-im-determined-to-let-them-finally-be-heard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Costume designer Quita Alfred’s ‘cottagecore’ look is an integral element of Sarah Polley’s film, set in a Mennonite community</p><p>Women Talking, Sarah Polley’s film about women’s responses to a serial rapist within a Mennonite community, isn’t what you’d call a “fashion film”. But if the clothes aren’t the principal takeaway, the long, dark floral dresses worn by the cast – including Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley and Frances McDormand who are all nominated for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture at this weekend’s Screen Actors Guild awards – seem to chime, incongruously, with fashion. Specifically, the “cottagecore” trend that has made long floral dresses and pastoral living a feature on Instagram feeds in recent years.</p><p>Traditional Mennonite communities often live outside mainstream society. The film’s costume designer, Quita Alfred, thinks we’re fascinated by these communities because of “a misplaced nostalgia”. She adds: “There’s a judgment, for sure. That ‘Oh, we get to do whatever we want. Aren’t we modern? And aren’t we clever?’ I’m certainly not excluding myself from this judgment. I think maybe the good side of the nostalgia is a longing for a simpler time.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/24/check-out-the-chintz-the-long-floral-dresses-at-the-heart-of-women-talking">Continue reading...</a>

He discusses why he wants to quit music at 50 and why he’s no longer ‘ashamed’ of being single</p><p>Just days before this engagement at his south London home, Will Young was blissed-out, sunning himself on a beach in southern Mexico. Through his earlier years in the entertainment industry, the musician turned actor, author and activist is not sure he made looking after himself a priority. Now the 44-year-old has self-care rituals that he firmly sticks to. Taking work-free holidays helps, as does regular therapy. “And I quite religiously only look at my diary the night before,” Young says. “Living day to day, so I don’t worry about what’s coming up and panic.”</p><p>Having only just finished a tour celebrating the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/29/life-after-will-young-how-talent-shows-shaped-britain">two decades since he won Pop Idol</a>, there is now a book on anxiety in the works and his mental health fundraising initiative Wellstock; and after cuffing himself to a beagle breeding facility in Cambridgeshire last year, he is plotting to get the site shut down permanently. So breaking his own rule on the Oaxaca coast, Young briefly checked the timeline for his upcoming acting gig: a new production of Song from Far Away, a one-man play by the Olivier and Tony award-winning playwright Simon Stephens. “I thought it was opening on 22 March, so felt very relaxed. I was ahead of the game. And then I saw in my calendar: oh fuck, it opens February.” Suffice to say, line-learning kicked off immediately.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/24/will-young-interview-song-far-away-cabaret-vortex-pop-idol">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One necklace looks pretty – but I’m now tripling up most days and haven’t looked back</p><p>I bring excellent news of an easy new-season style hack. It fits anyone, flatters everyone, won’t have you shivering or give you blisters, and will lift your look and your spirits whether you are going to work, going out for dinner or going nowhere at all. You probably don’t even need to buy anything. Do you own more than one necklace? Sorted. Because that’s what this is. That’s the style update of the moment, right there: wearing two or three necklaces at once.</p><p>It’s that simple. Last year was all about curating your earlobes. Perhaps you now have more piercings on one ear than the other. A mix of studs, mini-hoops and statement pieces, right? Well done you. But even if you are still wearing just the two earrings, that’s fine too. Just whack in a pair of hoop earrings – ideally ones that are a bit wonky as if you dented them in your workshop while doing something vaguely artisanal – and be done with it, because the style spotlight has moved on from the curated ear to our next assignment, which is the double (or triple) necklace. One necklace looks pretty. Two or three necklaces looks even prettier, and cooler to boot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/24/style-hack-of-the-moment-add-another-necklace">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘In the know’: the most overlooked white wines

<p>Where skins and stems play no part in the process, winemakers have less room to hide, but if you are looking to wow your guests, these bottles will do just the trick</p><p>Is it harder to make great white wine than it is to make great red wine? Well, it’s certainly easier to pluck a cheap bottle of red off the shelf and for it to be, at the very least, drinkable. When scouring the options for whites, however, we’re in much shakier territory: there’s less room to hide for the winemaker, where skins and stems play no part in the process (unless we’re in so-called orange wine territory, where maceration with skins is involved in the same way as with red vinification), and the quality of the grapes becomes even more important. There’s less gubbins to hide poor grape juice.</p><p>That’s why, when I’m trawling the shelves of independents and supermarkets alike, I’m drawn hypnotically to one region I know is likely to outperform most on the price/quality quotient: Germany. (It’s also one of the reasons we’ve crammed the shelves at our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johndorywine/?hl=en-gb">John Dory wine shop in Kent</a> with lots of riesling.)</p><p>Zeren Wilson is a wine consultant and <a href="https://www.bittenandwritten.com/">writer</a>, and co-owner of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johndorywine/?hl=en-gb">John Dory wine shop</a> in Sandgate, Kent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/24/the-most-overlooked-white-wines-zeren-wilson">Continue reading...</a>

To top it all, she is currently recovering from a nasty bout of food poisoning, but she showed up anyway. That’s the kind of person Brunson is: a comedy giant who still keeps her appointments.</p><p>Brunson’s show, Abbott Elementary, debuted on ABC in December 2021, and by its second episode had earned a perfect “100 per cent fresh” score on Rotten Tomatoes and given the US network its highest ratings for a comedy since the finale of Modern Family. The first season was nominated for seven Emmys – it won three – making Brunson the youngest Black woman ever to be nominated in a comedy acting category, and the first to earn three comedy nominations in one year.

<p>A delicious paean to modern British classics and comfort foods</p><p>It was the second official day of service at <a href="https://www.beckfordcanteen.com/">Beckford Canteen</a> in Bath when we dropped by to eat – a time when no chef wants to see a restaurant critic. Much like the Ottomans spying Vlad the Impaler on yonder knoll, no kitchen brigade hopes to be invaded and skewered on their opening week. The etiquette of when is too early to judge a new spot is much debated. Some restaurants run a trial period called a soft opening, which isn’t as rude as it sounds. Visiting when they are “on soft” means you may get duck ragu pappardelle down your back and a crying server, but a smaller bill to cover the chaos.</p><p>Beckford Canteen, on the other hand, had served a friends-and-family function for one evening only when I happened to be in Bath and needed to be fed. My dilemma was that the menu was a delicious paean to modern British classics and comfort foods: chestnut soup, Welsh rarebit, monkfish with curried butter and sides such as confit potato. There was an apple, sourdough and clotted cream riff on bread pudding that attracted me like an ant towards a blob of jam on a worktop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/24/beckford-canteen-bath-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plus, Liz Truss returns, uproar over Roald Dahl rewrites and why everything is too much trouble for Thérèse Coffey</p><p>Perth has a special place in my heart: it was the venue of my first one-day international wicket. Perhaps I should explain. It was 1992 and I was writing a book about Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, part of which was to tag along with the Pakistan team for the cricket World Cup. At first Imran Khan and co were understandably distant, but by the time we reached Western Australia I was allowed to bowl in the nets – where I inexplicably had Zahid Fazal caught behind. Whether I ever got another wicket is a matter of dispute. I claim I had Wasim caught at mid on. He said he would never have hit it there if I had had a fielder in place. No matter. That week in Perth was the highlight of what passes for my cricket career. Not that I’ve ever been tempted to go back. It just felt so far away. Remote even from the rest of Australia. A five-hour flight from Sydney. But if you like beaches, 300 days of sunshine a year, not having to cope with a cost of living crisis and aren’t put off by the distance, then it could be the place for you. At least that’s the sell Western Australia is trying to make as it seeks to recruit 31,000 doctors, nurses, teachers and plumbers from the UK to come and make their homes near to the Indian Ocean. Predictably some MPs and the British Medical Association have been quick to cry foul. How dare the Australians try to fill the vacancies in their job market with professionals trained in the UK! What about our own staff shortage in the NHS? Er … perhaps we should have thought of that when we recruited thousands of doctors and nurses from eastern Europe and elsewhere around the world.

In each of the 12 points, the plan reiterated Chinese talking points about the conflict without offering a solution.</p><p>The Chinese peace plan is the culmination of a flurry of diplomatic meetings that kicked off at the Munich security conference on 17 February. There Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, presented a bullish front to western officials, denying claims made by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, that China was on the verge of sending weapons to Russia. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said such a move would be a “red line” for the bloc. Wang insisted that China wanted peace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/ukraine-war-china-russia-no-limits-relationship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s time to think about what veg you’ll grow, and how – especially those that need a long season</p><p>I’m often asked what fuels my passion for growing food. Some people assume that it’s cheaper to feed myself this way (alas, it’s not) or that I’m striving towards “self-sufficiency”. I bristle at this unhelpful term because – as most food growers and gardeners know well – we rely on all manner of creatures and elements to ensure that our seeds germinate and our plants flourish, from the earthworms in the soil to the rain that falls from the sky.</p><p>Learning how to grow food has much more to offer than a hyper-individualist fantasy. It enables me to develop a deeper connection to my family and the living world. It nudges me to consider how what I eat got to my plate, insists I express gratitude to all the living things that cooperate to produce that food, and is one of the few acts that can give more than it takes from the natural world – something we all need to consider in these times of environmental crisis. It is a beautiful and fascinating adventure and, often enough, it is delicious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/24/spring-is-coming-time-to-plan-growing-crops-for-the-season-ahead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Henry Naylor travelled to Afghanistan in 2003 to research his fringe farce Finding Bin Laden. His sobering new show takes stock of the country’s fate since</p><p>Was Henry Naylor’s agent right when he warned the writer and comic, at the height of the “war on terror”, that “Afghanistan is not funny”? To a certain brand of comedian, that kind of remark is always going to sound like a challenge. The darker the reality, after all, the greater the potential for gut-wrenching gallows humour. That’s part of what Naylor was after back in 2003, when he wrote the Edinburgh fringe play <a href="https://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2003/01/01/34193/finding_bin_laden">Finding Bin Laden</a> – whose creation he now revisits, in a solo show about his own relationship with Afghanistan, two decades on.</p><p>As both an autobiographical chronicle of Naylor’s career in satire and a reflection on our responsibilities to Afghanistan, the show – which ran at last year’s fringe and now arrives at the Arcola theatre in east London – raises interesting questions. Not the least of them concerns the BBC’s supposed policy of “taste and decency” (words Naylor practically spits out here) when it comes to reporting on – and joking about – war. Naylor, who wrote for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/26/spitting-image-stages-revival-and-this-time-the-puppets-are-on-a-mission">Spitting Image</a>, is on the verge of his big break as a satirist back in 2001, his newsy comedy show about to run on the radio when two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York. Standards guidelines kick in immediately.

## It’s OK to be Angry About Capitalism by Bernie Sanders review – straight talking from the socialist senator

<p>Sanders tackles the grim facts about the economic order that the political establishment wilfully ignores</p><p>“When we talk about uber-capitalism in its rawest form – about greed that knows no limit, about corporations that viciously oppose the right of workers to organize, about the abuses of wealth and power that tear apart our society – we’re talking about Amazon,” writes Bernie Sanders in his new book. “And when we’re talking about Amazon, we’re talking about Jeff Bezos.”</p><p>These are typical lines in what comprises an attack on the status quo from every conceivable direction. Sanders addresses his own two ultimately thwarted campaigns to lead the Democratic party; the crisis in American healthcare and the chasms of health inequality shown up by Covid; the declining union movement and stagnation of wages; the burgeoning billionaire class and its impact on democracy; and the looming environmental crisis. Nothing he says will come as any surprise to his supporters, who are legion. Everything he says is quite unfashionable, from the macro – greed is bad, actually – to the micro, still using “uber” to mean “ultra”, as if Uber itself didn’t exist. He has no compunction about his reference points, which go from the obvious (F Scott Fitzgerald observing that thing about the rich) to the niche (a union organiser and folk singer named Florence Reece, who wrote a song in the 1930s called Which Side Are You On?). If his ideas were a band, they’d be the Ink Spots, with songs written a long, long time ago, and all the intros the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/24/its-ok-to-be-angry-about-capitalism-by-bernie-sanders-review-straight-talking-from-the-socialist-senator">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is it a thriller? A satire? A comedy? Whatever this dark workplace-set series is, its lead actor is certainly unsettling in his impeccable suit and tie</p><p>Prime Video’s latest offering, The Consultant, is perfectly fine. No more, no less. It is a dark workplace comedy-thriller satire on capitalism with supernatural undertones, or possibly overtones. It’s a bit like watching a small mammal press levers for rewards in a lab experiment. Will the viewer like this? Or this? What about this? It’s just having a go and hoping something good happens.</p><p>The first thing we see in The Consultant is a group of middle-schoolers visiting cool gaming company CompWare, only for one of their pre-pubescent number to draw a gun on the founder/CEO Sang (Brian Yoon) and shoot him dead. Blimey! Perhaps it’s a biting critique of gun laws, too.

The streaming platform which has been facing stiff competition from Disney+ and other players, has acted nimbly to tackle the macroeconomic challenges from a softening consumer and slowing growth. In response to its drop in subscriber numbers last year, Netflix has been cutting jobs, cutting prices, and adapting its business model to remain relevant during the cost-of-living crisis. Given that streaming is an easy to cut, non-essential spend, Netflix’s strategy has paid off, helping the TV and movie platform to remain relevant at a time when consumer budgets are feeling the pinch.</p><p>After a torrid first half of 2022, shares in Netflix have been regaining ground, rallying more than 40% over the last six months. But the stock has been under pressure since the January peak shedding over 10% in the last 30 days as January’s risk-on sentiment across equities fades.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/feb/24/supermarket-value-range-shoppers-food-price-inflation-shortages-turnips-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Universal)<br /></strong>Colombia’s best tunesmith mixes reggaeton with pasillo and other beats on a sensual, melancholy album</p><p>After last month’s savage and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/13/shakira-gerard-pique-song-breaks-youtube-record">gossipy Bzrp freestyle</a>, whose lyrical references sent Renault and Casio into crisis management, Shakira is Colombia’s biggest singer again – but with her fourth album, Karol G remains the best tunesmith in the country’s fertile pop scene. The pair team up here on the ethereal reggaeton track TQG, though frankly it’s a bit phoned-in and Karol serves that rhythm much better elsewhere, as on the mournful breakup-sex hit X Si Volvemos or the propulsive Dañamos la Amistad. Best of all is Gatúbela, an entry into reggaeton’s horndog subgenre <em>perreo</em>, where Karol swaps her usual beseeching tone for confident come-ons.</p><p>While nearly always charged with Latin or Caribbean syncopation, the beats (mostly by her longtime producer Ovy on the Drums) branch out from the tilting gait of reggaeton: Karol honours the traditional <em>pasillo</em> waltz style on Gucci os Paños to the backing of a honking great tuba. The sensual sway of Pero Tú is particularly good, her high register sweetly paired with the commanding baritone of Spanish singer Quevedo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/24/karol-g-manana-sera-bonito-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government white paper can bring fans to the fore in running their clubs to shore them up for future generations</p><p>In his 2021 book More Than a Game, the economist Mark Gregory lucidly sets out the argument for why reform of our national sport is vital and possible. “Football reflects choices” he states, and the same is true of politics. The free market, low-regulation ideology of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek that was brought vividly to life in the Thatcher years was a choice. A choice that has led to globalisation and the brilliance of the Premier League but has also left us with unforeseen externalities that are less positive, particularly for the communities that clubs are rooted in.</p><p>You only need to have recently asked the people of Bury, Wigan, Derby and Macclesfield to see where the stresses of the system are felt when things go wrong. It is in streets and towns up and down the UK where the sustained damage occurs rather than the temporary bruising that wealthy financiers feel in their balance sheet. Gregory summarises that “reform is required to make sure the balance between the pursuit of money and the interests of the game is restored”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/24/premier-league-wealth-was-built-on-back-of-pyramid-clubs-who-need-to-be-protected">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young man’s troubled existence mirrors wider social and political turmoil, in this epic yet intimate debut</p><p>Three quarters of a century have passed since India’s independence. Now, midnight’s great-grandchildren face a country fractured mentally as much as socially: half democracy, half westernised, half madhouse, half global superpower, where gurus, imams and gyrating TikTok stars vie for the hearts, souls and wallets of hundreds of millions. “You know, the problem with this country is that we believe money will solve everything. It doesn’t,” says a Muslim character in Santanu Bhattacharya’s debut novel, his family victims of religious riots. It may seem trite, but this was indeed the hope that India lived on until the mid-2010s. Yet a rising tide means floating boats no longer. The common people have become cross-tickers at elections, another character says. They are “little specks of dust … They will never be anything more, and there is nothing lesser left for them to be.”</p><p>Shubhankar “Shabby” Trivedi is the witness rather than hero of One Small Voice. As a child at a wedding, he watches a mob immolate a young Muslim tailor – “a column of fire with the face of a man on it, flames licking the body” – and is profoundly affected. The novel<em> </em>follows his attempts to outrun the mental and societal forces haunting him, as he moves from the socially conservative northern city of Lucknow to find life and freedom in the cosmopolitan, hard-drinking, dope-smoking, anything-goes fantasyland of mid-2000s Mumbai.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/24/one-small-voice-by-santanu-bhattacharya-review-meltdown-in-mumbai">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This multilingual drama is a weird jumble in which post-Brexit Britain gets cyber-attacked. Its plot is convoluted, its dialogue baffling and its romantic segments hammy</p><p>In the streaming age, there is an obvious appetite for globe-trotting, multilingual thrillers such as Liaison. Starting in Syria, before crossing to France and Britain, via an encounter with Russian mercenaries and a heart-stopping moment at the Turkish border, it follows Vincent Cassel and Eva Green as they track hackers who have stolen information that is very, very important. But it is hard to work out who is in search of what in this convoluted mess of official government bodies, unofficial contractors – and Peter Mullan as a UK minister who spends too much time in what looks like the losers’ cafe from The Apprentice.</p><p>It opens in Damascus, with Gabriel (Cassel) careering around a drunken house party, before a flashy drone shot diverts our attention across town to a hacker working in an abandoned building. Naturally, the hacking goes down to the wire, but the hacker and his collaborator eventually escape and attempt to make their way to France, to let Europe know what terrible things they have uncovered when they were sneaking a look at Bashar al-Assad’s iCloud.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/24/liaison-review-eva-greens-spy-thriller-is-a-total-mess-of-a-tv-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Feature incarnation of the Idris Elba cop drama sees a ropey but savage snuff-porn plot get too much explicit attention</p><p>Neil Cross’s smash-hit BBC TV crime drama now gets its own standalone feature film, with Idris Elba returning as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/04/farewell-luther-fitfully-brilliant-occasionally-terrible-and-as-tense-as-tv-can-get">troubled London police officer John Luther</a>, effectively continuing the story from the end of the fifth season. This may well play very effectively to the show’s fanbase and there’s certainly an alpha supporting cast including Cynthia Erivo, Andy Serkis and Hattie Morahan.</p><p>But I have to say – and those squeamish about spoilers and cliches had better look away now – that without the extended context of longform TV, the greater emphasis on explicit, violent horror is a bit exhausting. The serial-killer accessories feel hand-me-down; the Scandi noir touch is spurious and storylines in the movies about evil criminal plans to livestream snuff-porn are frankly always lame and implausible. At the dawn of the internet age, the snuff-internet-porn-themed film actually became its own yucky and naive subgenre, with movies such as Marc Evans’s My Little Eye and Olivier Assayas’s Demonlover, and it doesn’t deserve a comeback now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/24/luther-fallen-sun-film-review-neil-cross-idris-elba-andy-serkis">Continue reading...</a>

He had tried to gig with his other band, Soulsavers, at the end of 2020, between the first and second lockdowns (“Wonderful shows, but the whole thing was a constant state of anxiety – are you fit to fly? What’s happening tomorrow?”), but spent most of the time at home in the US. It was the longest he had ever spent off the road.</p><p>“Not making a record; spending time with my family, friends, my fucking cat,” he says. “I thought: I want to stay here. I was quite happy listening to records, watching the Knicks lose at basketball, plugging in my guitar and playing along to someone else’s music, not really interested in making new music.” He smiles. “I was 18 when Depeche Mode started. I thought: it’s enough. I’ve had a good run. So when our manager called and said ‘It’s time’, I honestly said: ‘Jonathan, I don’t know if I want to do this any more.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/24/depeche-mode-dave-gahan-martin-gore-interview-memento-mori">Continue reading...</a>
