<p>One of the most impressive products to come out of CES 2023 was AirJet,  new solid-state cooling system that can replace fans with cooling components using a fraction of the power and space. Seshu Madhavapeddy, founder and CEO of Frore Systems, was kind enough to give us a tour of the company&rsquo;s offices and development labs in San Jose. </p>



<p>A quick refresher on AirJet: It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476932/is-airjets-solid-state-cooling-the-future-of-pc-thermals.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a new cooling solution that uses a tiny, solid-state block</a> with no separate moving parts to remove heat from components like CPUs and GPUs. The AirJet uses tiny vibrating membranes above a copper head spreader to draw in and expel air at up to 120 miles per hour, creating incredibly efficient air cooling in a space just 2.8mm thick. On a watt-per-watt basis, Frore claims that AirJet could more than double the cooling power in conventional fan-based systems, while working in an even smaller space. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The vibrating material is waterproof and dustproof, and AirJet already has functioning dust filters for the individual cooling units, down to one micron. Testing in windy, dusty chambers has shown that even in the most extreme conditions the AirJet&rsquo;s performance isn&rsquo;t adversely affected. Similar testing for heat, cold, humidity, and longevity shows the product is ready for the long haul. </p>



<p>Madhavapeddy freely admits that the AirJet is more costly than comparable fan-based solutions for laptops. &ldquo;Is it priced [in a way] that would be reasonable and acceptable by manufacturers? The answer is an emphatic &lsquo;yes.'&rdquo; </p>



<p>The AirJet isn&rsquo;t currently installed in any consumer products, but Frore has modified several current models to replace their internal cooling systems with the AirJet, just to demonstrate its efficacy. In a base model with no special engineering for AirJet, three of the solid-state coolers were able to replace the primary CPU heatsink and fan setup, boosting its core wattage from 12.5w to 15w with no ill effects, and an overall reduction in noise. Madhavapeddy claims that under more ideal design circumstances, it&rsquo;s possible to use four AirJet Mini units and boost it up to 21 watts. </p>



<p>Frore is working with &ldquo;several device manufacturers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;several commercial projects&rdquo; are slated to hit shelves before the end of the year. At the moment the company is focusing on conventional notebook designs. Handheld gaming devices, mini PCs, M.2 storage drives, and digital cameras are also potential vectors for expansion. for more information on upcoming PC technology, be sure to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@pcworld&amp;xcust=2-1-1523642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube!</a> </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing spookier or more haunting than the soaring sounds of a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6KbEnGnymk&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">theremin</a>, an instrument that uses electromagnetic fields to produce various pitches when you move your hands around it. You&rsquo;ve probably heard one in your favorite science fiction flick. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite instruments of all time. I tend to gravitate towards the weirder things in life and the theremin is definitely one of the most bizarre instruments out there. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to put together a theremin on a breadboard. Not only did the high-pitched sounds annoy both my dog and husband (much to my wicked delight), but it also helped me better understand circuitry. If you&rsquo;ve got little ones, this is a fantastic project to do with them. It&rsquo;s easy to assemble and the price is surprisingly affordable. Read on to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="where-the-heck-do-you-even-get-a-breadboard-theremin">Where the heck do you even get a breadboard theremin?</h2>



<p>I purchased the $39.95 Theremin Kit from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://microkits.net/products/microkits-theremin-kit&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MicroKits</a> on a whim one evening. The price is reasonable, as it comes with all the bits and bobs you need. MicroKits is run by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://microkits.net/pages/about&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">David Levi</a>, an electrical engineer and toy designer who wants to inspire the next generation of engineers. I love finding affordable, accessible products and the small businesses that make it happen. </p>



<p>The company also sells a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://microkits.net/products/synth-a-sette&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">tiny synthesizer</a> that serves as a great introduction to analog sound synthesis. You can even hook the touchpad up to a couple of bananas (they&rsquo;re considered conductive objects!) and make a working keyboard out of them. Cool, right? Maybe the synthesizer will be my next project&hellip; </p>



<h2 id="its-wonderfully-easy-to-assemble">It&rsquo;s wonderfully easy to assemble</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MicroKit Theremin" class="wp-image-1521948" height="456" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-23-102242.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">MicroKit</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;m no electrician, but I have small fingers and I&rsquo;m naturally dexterous. The whole process involves putting the wires, resistors, speakers, and antennas in the right spots. The instructions are broken down into stages, which I found helpful. The rows and columns on the breadboard are labeled and the wires are color coordinated. </p>



<p>I was able to assemble the parts in about twenty five minutes. That said, the holes on the breadboard are rather microscopic. The kit doesn&rsquo;t come with any tools, so you may want to pick up a magnifying glass and a pair of tweezers. I managed OK with no tools, but I had to lean in close to see what I was doing. </p>



<h2 id="its-ridiculously-fun-to-play-with">It&rsquo;s ridiculously fun to play with</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So&hellip; I assembled a theremin on a breadboard. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/AyIZYDmliI&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/AyIZYDmliI</a></p>&mdash; Ash &#128302; (@awitchdidit) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/awitchdidit/status/1627820091852173312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">February 20, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see in the video above, I was having a grand old time playing with the breadboard theremin. The square-shaped antenna deafens the sound while the triangle-shaped one controls the pitch. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a real theremin, but the concept is definitely there. I haven&rsquo;t quite mastered the <em>Doctor Who</em> theme song yet, but give me time and I&rsquo;ll be the life of the party soon enough. </p>



<h2 id="i-have-a-better-understanding-of-circuitry">I have a better understanding of circuitry</h2>



<p>The instructional booklet does a fine job of explaining what each and every part does. The resistors, for example, resist the flow of electricity whereas transistors amplify the power. The transistor is the thing that makes the speaker louder on this particular device. The whole thing is super cool and I feel like I gained something from it&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not just talking about my rad new instrument. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to learn something new, you should really consider picking up the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://microkits.net/products/microkits-theremin-kit&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Theremin Kit from MicroKits</a>.

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the utilitarian brilliance of classic IBM ThinkPad laptops, inspired by Japanese bento boxes and beloved for their toughness. And none is so beloved as the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ThinkPad_701&amp;xcust=2-1-1523412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ThinkPad 701 series</a> from 1995. With its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_8MQPdgC-o&amp;xcust=2-1-1523412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two-part fold-out keyboard</a> that squeezes a full-sized typing surface into a design under 10 inches wide, it&rsquo;s an unmistakable classic. But it is almost 30 years old, so good luck using it for anything except <em>Space Cadet Pinball</em>. </p>

<p>Enter modder <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://community.frame.work/t/thinkpad-701c-with-a-framework-brain-transplant-work-in-progress/27409&amp;xcust=2-1-1523412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Karl Buchka</a>. This fan of the original design took a broken ThinkPad 701C and replaced its motherboard with the one from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394906/framework-laptop-review-take-it-apart-and-repair-it.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Framework Laptop</a>, a modular design that&rsquo;s become all the rage in maker and right-to-repair circles. In a modding project that&rsquo;s taken six months to complete, Buchka has made the 701C&rsquo;s housing and keyboard/Trackpoint mouse work with the Framework&rsquo;s modern Intel guts, including USB-C, USB-A, and gigabit Ethernet ports, plus Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. His project was spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-thinkpad-701c-receives-21st-century-brain-transplant&amp;xcust=2-1-1523412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>. </p>

<p>Because the 701C&rsquo;s 640&times;480 LCD screen leaves something to be desired by modern standards, Buchka took his mod one step further and replaced it with the screen panel from an iPad 7, connected to the motherboard via an internal eDisplayPort adaper. The fold-out &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; keyboard and its Trackpoint mouse are plugged into a Teensy microcontroller running QMK. It looks like the build uses a Framework laptop battery, too. </p>



<p>So far the modder has had to create a new lower case and hinge bracket via 3D printing in order to make it all fit in the ThinkPad&rsquo;s original dimensions. When the mod is in its final iteration, he says he&rsquo;ll post the design files on Github for others to emulate. </p>

## Desktop PC cases are getting a Cottagecore revolution

<p>Did you know that a desktop computer, even one with high-end gaming or creative pro components, doesn&rsquo;t have to look like a rainbow-powered hookah that fell off an alien spaceship? I know, it was a shocker to me, too. But someone at Corsair decided that such was the case, and launched a series of stylish wood panels for its PC cases. </p>



<p>The add-on mesh panels can be applied to the top and bottom of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/PC-Components/Cases/4000-Series-Wooden-PC-Case-Panel/p/CC-8900677&amp;xcust=2-1-1523318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Corsair 4000</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/PC-Components/Cases/5000-Series-Wooden-PC-Case-Panel/p/CC-8900681&amp;xcust=2-1-1523318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5000-series ATX cases</a>, adding a bit of laser-cut sophistication to your build. As noted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kitguru.net/components/cases/matthew-wilson/corsair-quietly-launches-wood-case-panels/&amp;xcust=2-1-1523318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru</a>, the custom panels replace the standard airflow dust covers, and since they&rsquo;re easily removable, should work about the same in terms of cleaning and protection. You get a choice of bamboo (light), teak (dark), and sapele (somewhere in the middle) finishes to suit your taste and decor. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair 4000 with wooden panel" class="wp-image-1523385" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/corsaid-40000-wood-panel.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=827" width="827" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s too bad Corsair isn&rsquo;t offering these wood panels on a case from the factory &mdash; they&rsquo;re a rather pricey $55-75 add-on for the existing designs. (Though that&rsquo;s handy if you&rsquo;ve already built a PC in one of those expensive cases already, I suppose.) But for a more ground-up solution, check out Fractal Design&rsquo;s recently released North case. This more understated design comes with vertical wooden slats on the front air intake. It&rsquo;s sort of an Adirondack look for Fractal&rsquo;s typically chill PC enclosure style. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fractal Design North pc case" class="wp-image-1523388" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fractal-design-north.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Fractal Design</p></div>



<p>The North case comes in just one ATX size, but it&rsquo;s available in &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16811352205?Description=fractal%20design%20north%20pc%20case&amp;cm_re=fractal_design%20north%20pc%20case-_-11-352-205-_-Product&amp;quicklink=true&amp;xcust=2-1-1523318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chalk white</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16811352204?Description=fractal%20design%20north%20pc%20case&amp;cm_re=fractal_design%20north%20pc%20case-_-11-352-204-_-Product&amp;quicklink=true&amp;xcust=2-1-1523318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">charcoal black</a>&rdquo; finishes, with lighter and darker woods to match. You can choose a tempered glass side panel or more understated mesh, each going for $129 retail price. While these appear to be the only PC cases on the market with wooden accents (not counting <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/carbon-fractal-design-era-itx-mini-itx-tower/p/N82E16811352121?Description=fractal%20design%20era&amp;cm_re=fractal_design%20era-_-9SIAUNCHN64202-_-Product&amp;quicklink=true&amp;xcust=2-1-1523318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fractal&rsquo;s Era mini-ITX</a>, now apparently out of production), I&rsquo;m hoping they lead to a renaissance in PC designs that are actually meant to blend into home decor, instead of sticking out like a mini-fridge that&rsquo;s hosting a tiny rave inside. </p>



<p>Of course if you tire of waiting for more laid-back designs from accessory manufacturers, you can always <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1432787/this-slick-custom-pc-looks-like-a-vintage-tube-amp.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">make your own PC inspired by classic amplifiers</a>. Assuming you have decades of artisan woodworking experience, naturally. </p>

<p>Not sci-fi, but real life: Samsung introduced a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/22/23609915/samsung-ai-voice-clone-bixby-text-call-service-korean&amp;xcust=2-1-1523118-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">voice-cloning feature</a> for their new Galaxy S phones this week. Train the Bixby mobile assistant on your S23, S23+, or S23 Ultra phone, and it&rsquo;ll successfully mimic you during calls. This duplication is sold as a way to answer calls whenever you&rsquo;re unable to talk&mdash;you instead type answers and the phone reads them to the other party in your voice.</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s a flip side to this stuff of sci-fi dreams. AI-trained voice imitation can be also used for nefarious purposes, as Motherboard demonstrated the very same day as Samsung&rsquo;s news. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7axa/how-i-broke-into-a-bank-account-with-an-ai-generated-voice&amp;xcust=2-1-1523118-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Using AI-generated imitations of his voice</a>, writer Joseph Cox breezed through his bank&rsquo;s automated voice verification system.</p>



<p>Experts have warned for years of voice authentication&rsquo;s weaknesses; long before AI-based tools, they could be bypassed with recordings. But such scams often involved cold-calling a mark and getting them to say pertinent phrases&mdash;e.g., manipulating them to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in response to a basic question. AI changes the game, since interaction isn&rsquo;t necessary for the mimicry. Nor is much of your voice necessary to train these services. Just a few minutes is enough.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In the short term, the danger isn&rsquo;t widespread yet. For this sort of trick to happen without your knowledge, your voice has to be publicly available. It also still requires some work. Motherboard initially failed to fool Lloyds Bank with output from ElevenLabs, the tool it used. Multiple tries and tweaks had to happen before the output passed as legitimate. And it would likely need to be combined with number spoofing or something like Samsung&rsquo;s Bixby call feature if a financial or other sensitive service is monitoring for other signals that you&rsquo;re you.</p>



<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should rest easy. Motherboard&rsquo;s experiment is a pointed example that biometric authentication should be treated with the same consideration as other forms of account or device protection. In this context, biometric data is a set of physical passwords&mdash;and like any password, if the information is accessible or otherwise insecure, your security is weakened.</p>



<p>Your voice can be recorded. Your face can be photographed. Your fingerprint can be used while you&rsquo;re incapacitated. You don&rsquo;t need to stop using these methods of safeguarding your privacy, but their very convenience means they&rsquo;re weaker forms of defense. Think of them as the equivalent of short passwords. While they&rsquo;ll deter some people, someone can bypass them more easily.</p>

<p>The smart use of biometric authentication is to use it for lower-stake situations&mdash;a PC where you never stay logged into sensitive sites, a phone with important apps protected by a passcode or password, and the like. And if you can&rsquo;t pair your voice or face with stronger measures? Disable it, if you can.</p>



<p>At the very least, if your bank uses voice verification, a second factor for authentication would be advisable. Because while the AI tools aren&rsquo;t nailing impersonations off the bat just yet, they&rsquo;ll continue to improve, increasing the potential threat. An ounce of prevention could be worth a pound of cure, especially if you like to stream or post videos.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for an affordable gaming keyboard, listen up. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b07wjjc45t/&amp;xcust=2-1-1523102-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MSI Vigor GK30 gaming keyboard for $29.99</a>, which is 40 percent off of the original $49.99 price tag. It&rsquo;s not a traditional mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches. However, it does have mechanical-like plunger switches (aka mecha-membrane switches), which mimic the feel of a mechanical keyboard for a lower price. It&rsquo;s also water repellent and splash resistant thanks to the drain hole design. This is good news if you regularly pound energy drinks at your desk.</p>



<p>The MSI Vigor has RGB lighting and convenient hotkeys for controlling media and volume. According to Amazon reviews, the keys produce a nice clicking sound and the keycaps are surprisingly durable for the price. MSI even claims that it has a keystroke lifespan of up to 12 million clicks. If that number proves accurate, then this keyboard should last you a while. </p>



<p>Overall, this is a killer deal. You just can&rsquo;t beat the price. </p>

<p>Why did I suddenly want to play the original <em>Duke Nukem</em> on my Steam Deck?</p>



<p>I can&rsquo;t recall the exact reason, but I do know that after a hefty dose of Googling and a thorough amount of trial and error, Valve&rsquo;s gaming handheld came alive with the sounds and sights of the classic PC platformer. And just like that, I was hooked on turning the Steam Deck into a DOS gaming haven.</p>



<p>While there are numerous ways to run classic DOS games on the Steam Deck, this guide will focus on the most straightforward option, which involves installing DOSBox in the Steam Deck&rsquo;s Desktop mode, then creating basic scripts to launch the original DOS files in game mode.</p>

<p>Easy to use and rich with features, Dashlane meets all our requirements for a top-tier password manager. But Dashlane goes beyond just managing your login credentials, providing insights for how to think smarter about security.</p>



<p>Dashlane&rsquo;s strength has long been its elegant web portal interface. A vertical toolbar on the left makes it easy to access your logins, secure notes, payment data, and other information. When you select one of these options, all the associated entries are displayed in the main workspace as tiles or a list. Each tile has its own fly-out menu from which you can view, edit, delete, or securely share that entry.</p>



<p>Dashlane also offers browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Safari that offer most of the same capabilities as the portal. I used the Firefox extension, which has four tabs labeled Vault, Autofill, Generator, and More. The <em>Vault</em> tab is where you manage all your saved information, which it organizes into tabs that mirror the toolbar options in the web portal: Logins, Payments, Secure Notes, Personal Info, and IDs. You can manage entries and launch sites directly from the extension. The <em>Autofill</em> tab allows you to turn on or off the ability to automatically fill in the current websites login credentials (at the time of review, this tab included a note that Dashlane will be adding more autofill options soon). The <em>Generator</em> tab allows you to set length and character parameters for auto-generated passwords. These can have between 4 and 40 characters&mdash;the default is 16&mdash;and include letters, numbers, and symbols. The <em>More</em> tab features options for launching the Dashlane web portal, accessing support articles, and referring a friend to Dashlane in order to get six months free.</p>

<p>One of Dashlane&rsquo;s most attractive features in previous versions was its security dashboard, which rated the security of each password with a safety percentage as well as one of a half-dozen color-coded descriptions ranging from &ldquo;Super safe&rdquo; to &ldquo;Very unsafe.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s been replaced by a <em>Password Health</em> report that provides an aggregate security percentage and shows you only weak, compromised, and reused passwords. For each of these, you can click on a <em>Replace Now </em>button to change them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>At this point Dashlane&rsquo;s capabilities have caught up with LastPass&mdash;while being more secure.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Premium users get a couple of extra features. The first is <em>Dark Web Monitoring</em>, which scans and alerts you to stolen personal data found on the dark web whether the credentials have been used or not. You can associate up to five emails for scanning. Premium users also get a simple VPN for secure Wi-Fi hotspot connections. After an intital setup, you just click VPN from the menu, choose a server location from more than 20 countries, and select <em>Connect</em>. Though any VPN can impact the speed of your internet connection, I didn&rsquo;t notice any slowdown in my usage. </p>

<p>Some other password managers let you directly designate an an emergency contact who can access all your information in the even you can&rsquo;t do it yourself. Dashlane takes a different approach. You can give trusted people access to your Dashlane data by exporting it to a secure DASH file and ideally storing it on a USB drive stored in a safe location like a safety deposit box. You would then share the location of the DASH file and password that protects it with your trusted contact, preferably through a Dashlane secure note, along with instructions on when and how to access it. </p>



<p>Dashlane recently restructured its pricing and now includes four plans. The Free plan offers basic password management&mdash;without password limits or sharing restrictions&mdash;on a single device. The Advanced plan, which costs $33 annually or $2.75 per month, adds dark web monitoring and enables syncing across all your devices. The Premium account subscription costs $59.88 per year or $4.99 per month and includes all the features of the previous tiers and adds a VPN. The Friends and Family plan extends Premium plans to up to 10 accounts for $89.88 per year or $7.49 per month.</p>

<p>At this point Dashlane&rsquo;s capabilities have caught up with LastPass. Given <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445758/how-to-export-your-passwords-and-ditch-lastpass.html">LastPass&rsquo;s recent severe security breach</a>&mdash;not its first&mdash;it&rsquo;s easy to recommend Dashlane as the go-to password manager.</p>
