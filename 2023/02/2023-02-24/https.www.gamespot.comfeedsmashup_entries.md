is a fantastic controller with some truly innovative features that made it feel "next-gen" at launch. For many, the DualSense will be the only PS5 controller they'll ever need. But in 2023, PS5 users finally have a few more officially licensed options, including the long-awaited <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-ps5controllers-20">DualSense Edge</a></strong>, PlayStation's first pro-style controller. The DualSense Edge isn't the only competitive controller worthy of being deemed one of the best PS5 controllers. PDP's <strong><a href="https://howl.me/cjczPwjy9ae">Victrix Pro BFG</a></strong>, an officially licensed controller with a similar focus, is a strong competitor that offers different features that may appeal to you. We've rounded up the best PS5 controllers in 2023, and we'll continue to add to this list as more PS5 controllers hit the market.</p><p>Whether you're looking for the best PS5 controller for general use (spoiler: It's the DualSense) or options for fighting games, racing games, and streaming Netflix, there are a handful of great controllers we recommend using with the PS5 from reliable brands like Logitech, Razer, and Thrustmaster. And of course, we're taking a look at the growing lineup of competitive controllers that give PS5 users more customization features.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controllers-in-2023/1100-6494188/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The 3DS And Wii U Games You Should Buy Before Their eShops Shut Down

<p dir="ltr">We're now just weeks away from the shutdown of the eShop for two Nintendo platforms: the 3DS and Wii U. Both systems are home to a variety of great games, a number of which are only available through the eShop (or can otherwise only be purchased physically at high prices). That wasn't necessarily a huge issue before now, but with these two eShops being closed, that means the simplest route for buying such games is going away.</p><p dir="ltr">Digital storefronts shutting down is nothing new; we previously saw it happen with Nintendo's Wii Shop, which still allows you to download and play your purchased games, but does not allow you to buy any new ones. That will also be true for the 3DS and Wii U eShops as of <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/57847">March 27, 2023</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For an industry that already struggles with preservation, that's disappointing to see. The closure of both eShops will mean losing the ability to buy digital-only games released for the two platforms, as well as a means for buying games at a reasonable price that have seen their physical versions dramatically increase in value. The latter scenario may only get worse once the shutdown happens, as fans scramble to collect games they were never able to get their hands on previously--just the sort of situation that profiteers look to take advantage of.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-3ds-and-wii-u-games-you-should-buy-before-their-eshops-shut-down/1100-6500804/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The primary weapon you decide to equip for Ranked Play will be determined by the role you prefer to play.

Now we have the answer. As it turns out, you can't buy it for yourself because it was custom made. </p><p>Contrary to a previous report, this jacket is not for sale to the public.

## Tales Of Symphonia Remastered Review - A Classic Regenerated

<p dir="ltr">Tales of Symphonia was a formative experience for me. For my young 11-year-old brain, it redefined my understanding of the JRPG genre. The vibrant presentation, action-focused combat, and mature story took me by surprise. Weekend after weekend, a friend and I would explore the world of Sylvarant together, making incremental progress in each play session. While I had played a few JRPGs before, none had hooked me the way Tales of Symphonia had.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite my deep reverence for Tales of Symphonia, I haven't touched it since 2004. I don't really know why. I bought it on PC a few years back, but it just felt wrong to play that game sitting at my desk one random evening after work--almost as if it would tarnish the magic of that experience and the memories tied to it. However, with the release of Tales of Symphonia Remastered, I decided it was finally time to return to this world to see if it was as good as I remember. The result was a bit mixed.</p><p dir="ltr">Tales of Symphonia follows a kid named Lloyd Irving as he accompanies the Chosen One on a globetrotting adventure. The Chosen One, Colette, instructed by divine prophecy, must "regenerate" the world in order to end war, famine, and hatred. It seems like standard JRPG fare, but the story is darker and far more complex than it initially lets on. Despite trying to do the right thing, Lloyd and his companions are confronted with moral quandaries that often leave a trail of destruction behind them. What makes the story so effective is how it rarely shies away from the consequences of our heroes' actions. Conflicts are rarely resolved neatly, and the story is better for it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-symphonia-remastered-review-a-classic-regenerated/1900-6418037/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nintendo has confirmed that it will not at E3 2023. This comes after recent rumors that neither <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023">Sony nor Nintendo would be part of the event</a>.</p><p>In a statement to GameSpot, Nintendo explained, "We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."</p><p>E3 2023 has been brought back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-returns-to-los-angeles-in-2023-with-new-company-running-it/1100-6505191/">with a new company in charge</a>, ReedPop, which is the same company that runs PAX. The event has been in a precarious position during the past few years. E3 2020 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2020-is-officially-canceled-due-to-coronavirus-/1100-6474647/">canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.

## Warner Bros. Discovery CEO Says Direct-To-Streaming Movies Provide "No Value" To HBO Max

<p dir="ltr">Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has signaled a strategic shift away from direct-to-streaming releases, and back toward movie theaters. In an earnings call reported on by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-max-movies-no-value-low-viewership-david-zaslav-warner-bros/">The Wrap</a>, Zaslav cited an analysis of HBO Max streaming metrics that demonstrated exclusive releases on the platform did not provide any return on investment.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were able to see which content people are spending time watching, what content is really powerful to us in terms of reducing churn, and then there was a lot of content that just wasn't being viewed," Zaslav said. "And so we were able in many ways to Monday morning quarterback, and that's what led us to the conclusion that direct-to-streaming movies were providing really no value to us."</p><p dir="ltr">For example, Magic Mike's Last Dance--which was produced by Steven Soderbergh as an HBO Max-exclusive film--was released in approximately 1,500 theaters two weeks ago, with an expansion to just over 3,000 theaters this past weekend. While it has grossed less than past Magic Mike films with $19.4 million so far, unnamed inside sources told The Wrap that WBD has been pleased with the film's performance--and believe as a result it will have a higher profile on HBO Max than it would have as a streaming-exclusive debut.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-discovery-ceo-says-direct-to-streaming-movies-provide-no-value-to-hbo-max/1100-6511814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's the final weekend before Destiny 2's Lightfall era begins, and if you're planning to grab a few Exotics before some major changes are made to the sci-fi sandbox, then Xur has your back. The Agent of the Nine has landed in the Solar system, and as always, he has a rotating selection of arms and armor to offer. Remember, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-preloading-details-install-size-confirmed-server-downtime-planned/1100-6511142/">Destiny 2 servers will be offline on Monday for Lightfall pre-loading</a>, so you have a little less time to visit him.

For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>Lord of Wolves</strong>. Hunters can pick up <strong>Lucky Pants </strong>leg armor; Titans can grab <strong>Antaeus Wards </strong>leg armor; and for Warlocks, Xur has the <strong>Nezarec's Sin </strong>helmet.</p><h3>Xur Location</h3><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4104274-xurnessus.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4104274-xurnessus.jpg" /></a></figure><p>Head to Nessus and use the Watcher's Grave transmat zone to find Xur this week. When you arrive, hop on your sparrow and head north toward the exit of the area. Look for a big tree with pink moss on the right side of the area.

<p dir="ltr">Half-Life 1 is one of the most beloved PC shooters ever, but its chunky polygons and low-resolution textures might not appeal to those playing it for the first time today. Luckily, modder Sultim_T has crafted a mod that adds <a href="https://github.com/sultim-t/xash-rt/releases">ray tracing</a> to the game, and it's definitely worth a look.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">If you aren't familiar with ray tracing in retro games, the feature essentially replaces the game's baked-in lighting with dynamic rays, which transform the game's visuals tremendously. You can see the difference yourself in the above release trailer, which also shows off the newly reflective weapon models and the improved water effects. The particle-heavy weapons like the Gluon Gun and Tau Cannon get a visual upgrade, too.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that most players who missed Half-Life 1 the first time around should probably check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">Black Mesa</a>, a fan-made remake that totally reconstructs the game from the ground up. However, if you have an RTX card and you're interested in a more traditional experience--given that Black Mesa makes significant changes to quite a lot of the game, especially the final Xen levels--check out this mod. If you need more GoldSrc action, check out modern Half-Life mods like <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-echoes">Half-Life: Echoes</a>, or the in-progress project that's trying to bring the Gearbox-developed mission pack <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-blue-shift-remake">Blue Shift</a> to the Black Mesa engine.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impressive-ray-traced-half-life-1-mod-gets-release-trailer/1100-6511809/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As one HBO series, The Last of Us, heats up, another one of the network's popular shows is coming to a close. Succession, a TV drama about very rich people and their very first-world problems, will end after its upcoming fourth season, which premieres in March.</p><p>Series creator Jesse Armstrong revealed the news to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-end-of-succession-is-near">The New Yorker</a>, saying he wanted to tell fans ahead of time the show was ending so it could be a satisfying conclusion.</p><p>"I feel a responsibility to the viewership, and I personally wouldn't like the feeling of, 'Oh, that's it, guys. That was the end.' I wouldn't like that in a show. I think I would like to <em>know </em>it is coming to an end," Armstrong said (<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/hbos-succession-to-end-with-season-4-1235269622/">via Deadline</a>). "You know, there's a promise in the title of Succession. I've never thought this could go on forever. The end has always been kind of present in my mind. From Season 2, I've been trying to think: Is it the next one, or the one after that, or is it the one after that?"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-succession-is-ending-after-season-4-spin-offs-unlikely/1100-6511801/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A gaming chair is good, but it can be better if you know exactly which extras to get for it. While Secretlab's line of premium gaming chairs feature a number of plush materials, needs and requirements for personal comfort change from person to person, and fortunately, you can enhance your seating with a new line of footrests.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4104204-footrest.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4104204-footrest.jpg" /></a></figure><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://secretlab.co/products/secretlab-premium-footrest-plushcell-memory-foam&amp;xcust=subid_value">See at Secretlab</a> </div></div><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://secretlab.co/collections/accessories?collection=chair-addons&amp;xcust=subid_value">See all accessories</a> </div></div><p>Secretlab has a new line of footrests available, which are split up into two parts. The $89 Premium Footrest features a static dual-density foam setup with an ergonomic super-ellipse design and a quilted fabric cover made of soft velour that your feet can rest on, and will start shipping out from March 6. The curved edge also allows a more natural resting position for your feet, and the materials are easy to wash.</p><p>Alternatively, the full-metal chassis Professional Footrest has a tilt-adjustable dynamic design that you can position your feet on, which supports free range movement and active blood circulation. This means that it allows for a rocking motion, so if your legs are restless, you can keep them busy.

## Exotic Armor-Swapping In Destiny 2's PvP Is Getting Nerfed In Lightfall

<p>Like most activities in Destiny 2, the PvP Crucible mode will be receiving a massive overhaul once the Lightfall expansion goes live. In an update, Bungie detailed plans to adjust PvP by tweaking its progression, rewards, and how matchmaking will work in the future.</p><p>These changes begin with the Competitive Division freelance node going away, as Bungie believes that fireteam matchmaking is solving the problem it was originally intended to solve in a way that is healthier for the game overall. "This will merge the player populations into one larger, healthier pool while still protecting smaller fireteams from getting stomped by larger more coordinated groups," <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab-02-23-2023">Bungie explained</a>.</p><p>Season 20's quality-of-life changes include a number of tweaks to which modes and maps cycle into the competitive playlist, with Javelin-4, Endless Vale, and Altar of Flame having a higher chance of being cycled into rotation. Disjunction and Cathedral of Dusk have been removed entirely, while Rift and Showdown modes will be seen less frequently. Bungie expects Survival to show up two-thirds of the time when launching into Competitive, while Rift and Showdown will be split between the remaining third of this system.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exotic-armor-swapping-in-destiny-2-pvp-is-getting-nerfed-in-lightfall/1100-6511797/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Seasonal Artifact has been a core part of Destiny 2's design for several seasons now, and once Lightfall begins, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-evolving-once-more-with-lightfall-iron-banter/1100-6511654/">it'll be improved</a> to offer more functionality on a passive level. While seasonal armor mods from the artifact required dedicated space on your Guardian armor, Lightfall will instead introduce artifact perks that are unlocked and automatically applied to your build.</p><p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab-02-23-2023">As Bungie detailed</a>, there'll be twelve perks to unlock per character and these can be reset at no cost any number of times. Anti-Champion weapons featured on the artifact can also be Overcharged in higher-difficulty activities, and Artifice Armor will have a unique mod slot that grants three additional points to a character stat of your choice. For players preparing to take on Champions with a prepared loadout, you'll be able to equip sidearms and pulse rifles to take out Barrier Champions, bows and auto rifles to deal with Overload Champions, and scout rifles to take out Unstoppable Champions.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-lightfall-vidoc-reveals-the-beginning-of-the-end/1100-6511580/">For Season 20</a>, you'll be able to unlock these abilities on the Ascendant Scepter, and if you're looking to start planning your loadout ahead of Lightfall's launch, then you can see what each column has to offer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-strand-before-lightfall-launches/1100-6511205/">With Strand</a>, the latest Darkness subclass, being a big focus in Lightfall, there are multiple perks available that take advantage of these new powers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-seasonal-artifact-makes-strand-abilities-even-deadlier/1100-6511798/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
