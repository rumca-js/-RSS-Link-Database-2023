It has realistic physics, tuned to match historical performance. The UI is based around commands given in period naval language. Rather than use the current weather, it has a full year's weather data (for 1980 - taken from <a href=\"https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html</a>). This allows the weather to change realistically under time acceleration.<p>To learn the basics of handling a square-rigged ship, start the \"Harbour\" scenario, click on the instructions button at the bottom left, and follow the instructions to try to get out of Portsmouth harbour.<p>To go for a long sail, start the \"The World\" scenario. Open the map, control+click anywhere on it to move there; control+click on the compass at the bottom left to turn the ship to that heading; then activate travel acceleration at the bottom right.<p>It's a simulator more than a game - think MS flight simulator. There's no sinking, but you can lose sails or spars in high winds. It's windows only.<p>This was released a couple of years ago, but this is an updated version from the end of January. See the devlog (<a href=\"https://thapen.itch.io/painted-ocean/devlog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thapen.itch.io/painted-ocean/devlog</a>) for the changes. You can also find some discussions there on historical sailing performance numbers.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

It has no meaning in English. I'm from a poor country and I spent like a year or so to save up for it, which cost roughly 6 months of average net salaries in my country about 7 years ago.<p>I was in my early 20s and one could argue, that it was not the wisest decion of a young adult, but I don't regret it honestly. It always felt like I have a small piece of the web realestate which has my name labeled on it and I absolutely love my fname@lname.com email address. I created an address for my wife, father, mother, brother and his wife in the same way which they are using daily and are proud of.<p>I was very stressed for any domain or registrar errors that might cause that I lose the domain name and I still am very afraid of it. I have however read quite a few \"horror stories\" in the past years, regarding bigger companies which were able to obtain people's personal or business domain names, just because they are huge companies with extensive finances and good lawyers. I already know of two companies in different countries which have the very same name as I occasionally receive emails written to them on my catch-all email address.<p>For now the domain is used to host our personal sites, but I recently started working as a web developer and may do freelance work or even create a startup or company in the future. I don't know what this domain will be used for, but I can't say that it will always be for personal use. Maybe it will be the same industry as other companies with the same name. Maybe not. I know a domain name can't be patented. Trademarking is possible, but there are a lot of requirements. What do experts propose?<p>TLDR: What can I do to secure my domain name, no matter what happens?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34922979\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34922979</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34922979", "date_published": "2023-02-24 10:13:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Creactivities \u2013 a chatbot that trains your creative muscles", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.creactiviti.es\">https://www.creactiviti.es</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34922509\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34922509</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://www.creactiviti.es", "date_published": "2023-02-24 09:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: While painting this, I had nothing in mind", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://krickelkrackel.com/en\">https://krickelkrackel.com/en</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34921883\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34921883</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://krickelkrackel.com/en", "date_published": "2023-02-24 07:23:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "North Korean hackers stole a record $1.7B of crypto last year", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/22/north-korean-hackers-stole-a-record-17bn-of-crypto-last-year\">https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/22/north-korean-hackers-stole-a-record-17bn-of-crypto-last-year</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34921779\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34921779</a></p>\n<p>Points: 55</p>\n<p># Comments: 25</p>", "link": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/22/north-korean-hackers-stole-a-record-17bn-of-crypto-last-year", "date_published": "2023-02-24 07:08:21+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["crypto", "hackers"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring #3 Engineer in London to Eliminate Testing", "description": "<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"http://meticulous.ai/\">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects.
