around the extent to which EA culture did or didn't contribute. This
has included proposals that EA try to be

within the community. At which point people others naturally
bristle: what happens between consenting adults is no one else's
business, and it's wrong to try and influence others here.  For

<blockquote>
I don't see any way you could meaningfully "address" the work/social
overlap without trying to get people not to date, live with or
befriend people they otherwise would have dated, lived with, or
befriended. And if you put it in those terms, it seems messed up,
right?

<p>

Now, the people who wrote these have more nuanced views than these
quotes suggest, and I think we don't actually disagree much when it
comes to views on detailed situations.  Still, I think it's worth
getting some of that nuance out there.

</p>

<p>

Specifically, consent isn't always enough.  Even consent plus a mature
awareness of <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fovDwkBQgTqRMoHZM/power-dynamics-between-people-in-ea">power
dynamics</a> isn't always enough.  Consider a case of someone whose
job it is to direct funding for a foundation sleeping with one of the
people who runs an organization they might recommend
funding.  And let's further imagine that the grantmaker and grantee
both have a sophisticated understanding of power dynamics, great
communication, solid introspection, strong self-confidence, and the
best of intentions.  Even then, this has corrosive effects on the
community, including:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Other grantees would then feel pressure to sleep with grantmakers,
leading to bad interactions, including ones where all the signals that
the grantmaker receives are that the grantee wants this.

</p></li>
<li><p>The funders behind the grantmaker may reasonably worry that the
grantmaker's judgement is clouded by their otherwise positive views
towards this grantee or that there was quid pro quo.

</p></li>
<li><p>People with unsavory intentions may choose to become
grantmakers because a norm of "it's ok to sleep with grantees" is very
vulnerable to abuse.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

These are harmful enough that we can't leave it to the couple to
determine whether their roles as grantmaker/grantee and lovers are
compatible.  That sometimes someone's role conflicts with a
relationship they would like to have is unfortunate, but not always
avoidable and not unique to this case: other examples of romantic
relationships with similar issues include ones between managers and
their reports or professors and their students.

</p>

<p>

Organizations handle these conflicts in a range of ways, often
depending on how they think about the effects of these relationships
on others and whether they can satisfactorily mitigate the
professional consequences of a particular relationship.  For example:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>A university might consider the initiation of any relationships
between students and professors to have a harmful effect on their
culture, and that students should be able to trust that professors are
interested in them only academically.  If they prohibit them, a
professor would need to choose between avoiding such relationships and
resigning their post.

</p></li>
<li><p>A large funder might require disclosure and recusal: when a
relationship relevant to a grantmaker's work comes up they work with
their manager to transfer responsibilities so that the grantmaker is
no longer influencing outcomes for the grantee.  This is also how
larger organizations usually handle employee relationships that
interact with formal power.

</p></li>
<li><p>A small funder might not be able to do this, perhaps
because they only have one grantmaker in an area.  Options for
handling this could include committing not to fund the relevant
organization, the grantmaker leaving, or the grantmaker passing up the
relationship.  All of these have significant downsides.  Smaller
organizations, or specialized departments within larger organizations,
can have similar issues that would keep them from being able to
mitigate the effects of an employee relationship.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

There are also other areas where we accept people have a valid
interest in discouraging some kinds of consensual interpersonal
behavior, where power dynamics and conflicts of interest are not the
concerns.  For example, norms against cheating in relationships, 
sleeping with your bandmates, or hookups within a military unit.

</p>

<p>

As I wrote above, I don't think this is especially controversial.  But
it shows that the question is what norms we should have and not
whether it is legitimate to have norms beyond consent.  This is the approach
we need when considering the actually controversial cases.

</p>

<p>

On the more specific question of what norms to have, I don't know.
This requires weighing harms like the departure of people frustrated
by excessive romantic attention, abuse of ambiguous power, loving
relationships that don't happen, exclusion of unconventional thinkers,
and delay in ejecting jerks.  I think the discussion has shown both
that we didn't have much agreement on what norms we'd been
operating under and that we have a wide range of opinion on what's
reasonable behavior. I'm hoping we can get closer to figuring out what
sort of norms would best make a thriving community that supports all
of us in making the world better.
