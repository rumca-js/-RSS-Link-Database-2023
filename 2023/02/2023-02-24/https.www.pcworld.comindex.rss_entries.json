Go inside AirJet\u2019s futuristic solid-state laptop cooling tech", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most impressive products to come out of CES 2023 was AirJet,  new solid-state cooling system that can replace fans with cooling components using a fraction of the power and space. Seshu Madhavapeddy, founder and CEO of Frore Systems, was kind enough to give us a tour of the company&rsquo;s offices and development labs in San Jose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick refresher on AirJet: It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476932/is-airjets-solid-state-cooling-the-future-of-pc-thermals.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new cooling solution that uses a tiny, solid-state block</a> with no separate moving parts to remove heat from components like CPUs and GPUs. The AirJet uses tiny vibrating membranes above a copper head spreader to draw in and expel air at up to 120 miles per hour, creating incredibly efficient air cooling in a space just 2.8mm thick. On a watt-per-watt basis, Frore claims that AirJet could more than double the cooling power in conventional fan-based systems, while working in an even smaller space. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The vibrating material is waterproof and dustproof, and AirJet already has functioning dust filters for the individual cooling units, down to one micron. Testing in windy, dusty chambers has shown that even in the most extreme conditions the AirJet&rsquo;s performance isn&rsquo;t adversely affected. Similar testing for heat, cold, humidity, and longevity shows the product is ready for the long haul. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Madhavapeddy freely admits that the AirJet is more costly than comparable fan-based solutions for laptops. &ldquo;Is it priced [in a way] that would be reasonable and acceptable by manufacturers? The answer is an emphatic &lsquo;yes.'&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirJet isn&rsquo;t currently installed in any consumer products, but Frore has modified several current models to replace their internal cooling systems with the AirJet, just to demonstrate its efficacy. In a base model with no special engineering for AirJet, three of the solid-state coolers were able to replace the primary CPU heatsink and fan setup, boosting its core wattage from 12.5w to 15w with no ill effects, and an overall reduction in noise. Madhavapeddy claims that under more ideal design circumstances, it&rsquo;s possible to use four AirJet Mini units and boost it up to 21 watts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frore is working with &ldquo;several device manufacturers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;several commercial projects&rdquo; are slated to hit shelves before the end of the year. At the moment the company is focusing on conventional notebook designs. Handheld gaming devices, mini PCs, M.2 storage drives, and digital cameras are also potential vectors for expansion. for more information on upcoming PC technology, be sure to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@pcworld&amp;xcust=2-1-1523642-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube!</a> </p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1523642/tour-the-labs-making-airjet-solid-state-coolers-that-will-replace-your-pc-fans.html", "date_published": "2023-02-24 19:52:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "I built a $40 theremin to annoy friends and learn circuitry fundamentals", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing spookier or more haunting than the soaring sounds of a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6KbEnGnymk&amp;xcust=2-1-1520688-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">theremin</a>, an instrument that uses electromagnetic fields to produce various pitches when you move your hands around it. You&rsquo;ve probably heard one in your favorite science fiction flick. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite instruments of all time. I tend to gravitate towards the weirder things in life and the theremin is definitely one of the most bizarre instruments out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to put together a theremin on a breadboard. Not only did the high-pitched sounds annoy both my dog and husband (much to my wicked delight), but it also helped me better understand circuitry. If you&rsquo;ve got little ones, this is a fantastic project to do with them. It&rsquo;s easy to assemble and the price is surprisingly affordable.

The rows and columns on the breadboard are labeled and the wires are color coordinated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to assemble the parts in about twenty five minutes. That said, the holes on the breadboard are rather microscopic. The kit doesn&rsquo;t come with any tools, so you may want to pick up a magnifying glass and a pair of tweezers.

In a modding project that&rsquo;s taken six months to complete, Buchka has made the 701C&rsquo;s housing and keyboard/Trackpoint mouse work with the Framework&rsquo;s modern Intel guts, including USB-C, USB-A, and gigabit Ethernet ports, plus Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Train the Bixby mobile assistant on your S23, S23+, or S23 Ultra phone, and it&rsquo;ll successfully mimic you during calls. This duplication is sold as a way to answer calls whenever you&rsquo;re unable to talk&mdash;you instead type answers and the phone reads them to the other party in your voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a flip side to this stuff of sci-fi dreams. AI-trained voice imitation can be also used for nefarious purposes, as Motherboard demonstrated the very same day as Samsung&rsquo;s news. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7axa/how-i-broke-into-a-bank-account-with-an-ai-generated-voice&amp;xcust=2-1-1523118-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using AI-generated imitations of his voice</a>, writer Joseph Cox breezed through his bank&rsquo;s automated voice verification system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts have warned for years of voice authentication&rsquo;s weaknesses; long before AI-based tools, they could be bypassed with recordings. But such scams often involved cold-calling a mark and getting them to say pertinent phrases&mdash;e.g., manipulating them to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in response to a basic question. AI changes the game, since interaction isn&rsquo;t necessary for the mimicry. Nor is much of your voice necessary to train these services. Just a few minutes is enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, the danger isn&rsquo;t widespread yet. For this sort of trick to happen without your knowledge, your voice has to be publicly available. It also still requires some work. Motherboard initially failed to fool Lloyds Bank with output from ElevenLabs, the tool it used. Multiple tries and tweaks had to happen before the output passed as legitimate. And it would likely need to be combined with number spoofing or something like Samsung&rsquo;s Bixby call feature if a financial or other sensitive service is monitoring for other signals that you&rsquo;re you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should rest easy. Motherboard&rsquo;s experiment is a pointed example that biometric authentication should be treated with the same consideration as other forms of account or device protection. In this context, biometric data is a set of physical passwords&mdash;and like any password, if the information is accessible or otherwise insecure, your security is weakened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your voice can be recorded. Your face can be photographed. Your fingerprint can be used while you&rsquo;re incapacitated. You don&rsquo;t need to stop using these methods of safeguarding your privacy, but their very convenience means they&rsquo;re weaker forms of defense. Think of them as the equivalent of short passwords. While they&rsquo;ll deter some people, someone can bypass them more easily.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A fingerprint shown on a device\" class=\"wp-image-1523279\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/george-prentzas-SRFG7iwktDk-unsplash.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Other forms of biometric authentication can also be bypassed more easily than passcodes or passwords.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">George Prentzas / Unsplash</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The smart use of biometric authentication is to use it for lower-stake situations&mdash;a PC where you never stay logged into sensitive sites, a phone with important apps protected by a passcode or password, and the like. And if you can&rsquo;t pair your voice or face with stronger measures? Disable it, if you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, if your bank uses voice verification, a second factor for authentication would be advisable. Because while the AI tools aren&rsquo;t nailing impersonations off the bat just yet, they&rsquo;ll continue to improve, increasing the potential threat. An ounce of prevention could be worth a pound of cure, especially if you like to stream or post videos.</p>\n\nInternet, Security</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1523118/your-voice-can-be-a-password-are-you-protecting-it-like-one.html", "date_published": "2023-02-24 15:05:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Treat your hands to this spacious MSI gaming keyboard for just $30", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for an affordable gaming keyboard, listen up.

It&rsquo;s not a traditional mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches. However, it does have mechanical-like plunger switches (aka mecha-membrane switches), which mimic the feel of a mechanical keyboard for a lower price. It&rsquo;s also water repellent and splash resistant thanks to the drain hole design. This is good news if you regularly pound energy drinks at your desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Vigor has RGB lighting and convenient hotkeys for controlling media and volume. According to Amazon reviews, the keys produce a nice clicking sound and the keycaps are surprisingly durable for the price. MSI even claims that it has a keystroke lifespan of up to 12 million clicks. If that number proves accurate, then this keyboard should last you a while. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this is a killer deal.

But Dashlane goes beyond just managing your login credentials, providing insights for how to think smarter about security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashlane&rsquo;s strength has long been its elegant web portal interface. A vertical toolbar on the left makes it easy to access your logins, secure notes, payment data, and other information. When you select one of these options, all the associated entries are displayed in the main workspace as tiles or a list. Each tile has its own fly-out menu from which you can view, edit, delete, or securely share that entry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashlane also offers browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Safari that offer most of the same capabilities as the portal. I used the Firefox extension, which has four tabs labeled Vault, Autofill, Generator, and More. The <em>Vault</em> tab is where you manage all your saved information, which it organizes into tabs that mirror the toolbar options in the web portal: Logins, Payments, Secure Notes, Personal Info, and IDs. You can manage entries and launch sites directly from the extension. The <em>Autofill</em> tab allows you to turn on or off the ability to automatically fill in the current websites login credentials (at the time of review, this tab included a note that Dashlane will be adding more autofill options soon). The <em>Generator</em> tab allows you to set length and character parameters for auto-generated passwords. These can have between 4 and 40 characters&mdash;the default is 16&mdash;and include letters, numbers, and symbols. The <em>More</em> tab features options for launching the Dashlane web portal, accessing support articles, and referring a friend to Dashlane in order to get six months free.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em><span class=\"TextRun SCXW139123568\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW139123568\">Note: See our roundup of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">best password managers</a>&nbsp;to learn about competing products, what to look for in a password manager, and product recommendations.</span></span></em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large large\"><img alt=\"Dashlane\" class=\"wp-image-1507251\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-08-at-11.38.06-AM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Dashlane&rsquo;s password generator supports up to 40 characters including letters, numbers, and symbols.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Dashlane&rsquo;s most attractive features in previous versions was its security dashboard, which rated the security of each password with a safety percentage as well as one of a half-dozen color-coded descriptions ranging from &ldquo;Super safe&rdquo; to &ldquo;Very unsafe.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s been replaced by a <em>Password Health</em> report that provides an aggregate security percentage and shows you only weak, compromised, and reused passwords. For each of these, you can click on a <em>Replace Now </em>button to change them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>At this point Dashlane&rsquo;s capabilities have caught up with LastPass&mdash;while being more secure.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Premium users get a couple of extra features. The first is <em>Dark Web Monitoring</em>, which scans and alerts you to stolen personal data found on the dark web whether the credentials have been used or not. You can associate up to five emails for scanning. Premium users also get a simple VPN for secure Wi-Fi hotspot connections. After an intital setup, you just click VPN from the menu, choose a server location from more than 20 countries, and select <em>Connect</em>. Though any VPN can impact the speed of your internet connection, I didn&rsquo;t notice any slowdown in my usage. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large large\"><img alt=\"Dashlane\" class=\"wp-image-1507250\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-08-at-11.38.25-AM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Dashlane provides a password health score and highlights your most at-risk passwords.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other password managers let you directly designate an an emergency contact who can access all your information in the even you can&rsquo;t do it yourself. Dashlane takes a different approach. You can give trusted people access to your Dashlane data by exporting it to a secure DASH file and ideally storing it on a USB drive stored in a safe location like a safety deposit box. You would then share the location of the DASH file and password that protects it with your trusted contact, preferably through a Dashlane secure note, along with instructions on when and how to access it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashlane recently restructured its pricing and now includes four plans. The Free plan offers basic password management&mdash;without password limits or sharing restrictions&mdash;on a single device. The Advanced plan, which costs $33 annually or $2.75 per month, adds dark web monitoring and enables syncing across all your devices. The Premium account subscription costs $59.88 per year or $4.99 per month and includes all the features of the previous tiers and adds a VPN. The Friends and Family plan extends Premium plans to up to 10 accounts for $89.88 per year or $7.49 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point Dashlane&rsquo;s capabilities have caught up with LastPass.
