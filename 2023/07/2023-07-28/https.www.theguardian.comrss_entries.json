From laws in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia that are denying trans-related healthcare to minors (and in some cases, adults), to federal laws restricting trans inclusion in sports, to a law in Tennessee that\u2019s expected to be replicated in other states, which would charge publishers with a class 3 felony for publishing books for children that they deem \u201cobscene\u201d (which probably means having queer- and trans-related content, in their eyes), one doesn\u2019t have to look far to see the actions of those who would bar trans people from public life, or any kind of life.</p><p>At the center of a lot of the LGBTQIA+ debates have been books that introduce young people to the ideas of queerness and transness. These books have been banned in some states, taken off library shelves in others, decried by rightwing pundits who think teaching children about natural variations in life such as transness is \u201ccorrupting\u201d them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/childrens-books-lgbt-transgender-acceptance\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/childrens-books-lgbt-transgender-acceptance", "date_published": "2023-07-28T10:08:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "China v Haiti: Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 \u2013 live", "description": "<ul><li>Updates on the Group D clash kicking off 12pm BST; 9pm AEST</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/25/haiti-jamaica-womens-world-cup\">Anita Asante: Haiti show gap is closing at this World Cup</a></li><li>Email David with any thoughts | Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveTindallgolf\">@DaveTindallgolf</a></li></ul><p><strong>If you\u2019ve landed here and want to check in on the England v Denmark game</strong>, Sarah Rendell is live blogging as we speak.

But before you reach for yet another white T-shirt, hear me out.<br /><br />Clothes are an opportunity to let people know who you are. Why waste that opportunity? Most of modern life seems to be everyone shouting over each other and no one listening to what anyone else has to say, but every time you get dressed, you get to introduce yourself to the world, on your own terms, without having to interrupt anyone. Your outfit says hello even before you say a word.</p><p>I get it, the appeal of understated clothes. Of course I do. Timeless classics, in neutral colours, are a useful fallback when you are just looking to fit in and be accepted. A little black dress at a party, simple tailoring at the office, a pastel dress at a wedding: these are all safe, effective strategies when all you are aiming for is not to look like a fish out of water.<br /><br />But there are lots of times where we can aim a tad higher, on the first-impression stakes, than to reassure people that we are allowed in the room/won\u2019t frighten the horses/are a safe pair of hands. What I mean is that \u201cshe looks as if she\u2019s probably fine\u201d sets an unnecessarily low bar for social interaction. What would you like people to think, when they see you? Take the initiative. Maybe you\u2019d like them to think you look interesting. Maybe you\u2019d like them to think you look sophisticated, or fun, or powerful, or sexy. What you wear can do all of those things.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/28/understated-dressing-is-overrated-heres-how-to-dial-up-your-look\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/28/understated-dressing-is-overrated-heres-how-to-dial-up-your-look", "date_published": "2023-07-28T09:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "DBC Pierre: \u2018A memoir by American televangelists changed my mind on taste\u2019", "description": "<p>The Australian author on escaping with Papillon, avoiding The Trial, and rolling with The Dice Man</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><strong><br /></strong>The Magic Faraway Tree by Enid Blyton was my first book without pictures; I was seven, at school in England.

The centrepiece is an 18-minute triptych entitled Cull, where the same rising chord sequence is repeated across three tracks in very different ways \u2013 as a glistening babble of synths, as a Bill Evans-style piano improvisation, a Wayne Shorter-ish saxophone freakout, a densely written pastoral string arrangement and eventually a morass of squelchy synth and electric piano textures.
