I know exactly what you're thinking, but let's take the trip together anyway.</p><p>Paula Scanlan, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate\" target=\"_blank\">a former teammate of Lia Thomas</a> who was featured in the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What Is A Woman?</em> documentary</a>, testified about the eighteen times a week she and the other female teammates were forced to undress in front Lia, a 6-foot-4 biological male fully intact with male genitalia. And how the girls were told by their school if they had a problem with it, THEY were the ones with psychological problems who needed to be re-educated.</p><p>Then came Scanlan's bombshell. She was sexually assaulted when she was sixteen. The sexual trauma suffered by her and countless others is made worse by having biological males (more commonly known as \"males\") in their locker room.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Riley_Gaines_/status/1684579155638362118\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Democrat Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN) couldn't be bothered to be there to hear from Scanlan. But he read the transcript and proposed what could have been a compromise... while still siding with penis'd individuals who want to join girls' sports teams because they're at best mid competing against boys.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1684590458528317441\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I think Penn didn\u2019t deal with your situation like they could have and should have, in putting up some type of different barriers in the, in the women\u2019s area of the locker room. But that\u2019s another issue. Things should be dealt with in a different way.</blockquote><p>It's not the worst compromise we've heard. When Lia Thomas's competitor Riley Gaines spoke out about their being naked dudes in the girls' locker room, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing\" target=\"_blank\">she was told the compose was to make the locker room co-ed</a>. So it wasn't a girls' locker room anymore.</p><p>Cohen is at least in the ballpark. But his compromise is to have a barrier between people who have (what up until recently was exclusively considered) male genitalia and people who do not. A barrier like say, I don't know, a wall? Or four walls? Penn could have designated different rooms where those born with boy parts and those who were not can feel the same.</p><p>Democrat Congressman Steve Cohen just invented boys' and girls' locker rooms.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"80e5f\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34694221&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Cohen is right. Penn SHOULD have made Lia Thomas change with the other athletes who have ding dongs. And not treat the girl athletes as if they're the ones with mental problems. But then, Lia Thomas would still be WIll Thomas, and instead of being an NCAA champion would be ranked #462 as a swimmer.<br /></p><p>Cohen, without realizing it, admitted that the ideology about gender that causes all these problems - claiming that boys and girls aren't different and that boys can be girls if they want to -  IS the problem. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Allen, one of the African-American scholars who developed the Florida curriculum, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-teaching-slavery-kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\">said of the misinformation being spread from the White House</a>: \"[The vice-president's comments] are categorically false.

Unfortunately, with the GOP primary, that's not the case.</p><p>Donald Trump surrogate (and a Florida Congressman who should know the truth) Rep.
