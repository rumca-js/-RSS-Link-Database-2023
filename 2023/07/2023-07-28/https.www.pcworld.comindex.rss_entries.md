<p>The best USB-C hubs and dongles are inexpensive, flexible, and answer the question: how do I connect printers, mice and keyboards to my laptop if it doesn&rsquo;t have a rectangular USB-A port?</p>



<p>After testing numerous products, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of the best USB-C hubs and dongles, below. We discuss not only the port options available with each hub, but also lesser-known details you won&rsquo;t find from the manufacturer&rsquo;s description, such as whether there is adequate space between the ports or if the hub runs hot during use.</p>



<p>How much should you spend for a USB-C hub? A typical USB-C hub or dongle costs about $30 to $40, sometimes less. It dangles (dongles?) from your USB-C port via s short cable. Expect to pay $150 or so for more expensive USB-C docking station, which can sit on your desk and supply power, even more ports, and offer more bandwidth via tricks like software compression.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve organized our USB-C recommendations this way: traditional USB-C hubs on top, followed by our pick for the best USB-C docking station. You&rsquo;ll also find our pick for the best <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">USB-C DisplayLink dock</a>, which we&rsquo;ve also rounded up on a separate page. Finally, we&rsquo;d like to point you to our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a> for more robust options. We&rsquo;re always testing new products. Some, like the recent <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782699/corsair-usb100-7-port-usb-c-hub-review.html">Corsair USB100</a>, aren&rsquo;t good enough to make our list.</p>



<p>We know all of the options are confusing. You&rsquo;ll find a FAQ with buying advice at the bottom of this story, with further clarification. Here&rsquo;s the short answer: If you want to connect your laptop to a printer, an SD card or microSD card, mouse, keyboard, or legacy 1080p monitor, stick with a USB-C hub. If you want to add a pair of additional displays (especially 4K), or high-speed SSD drives, we&rsquo;d recommend you look at our list of USB-C DisplayLink or Thunderbolt docking stations.</p>

In this example, the left port is used for charging, so you&rsquo;d need to buy a USB-C hub with a charging input to use with this slot. (Of course, you could also buy a hub&nbsp;<em>without</em> charging capabilities and use it in the other USB-C port, to the right of the charging port.)</p> </figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Can a USB-C hub feel elegant? This one does. Anker&rsquo;s 7-in-1 USB-C hub feels surprisingly weighty (3.5 ounces), with a premium metallic (aluminum and polycarbonate) sheen. It&rsquo;s also a bit more expensive than its rivals. Anker&rsquo;s hub was among the coolest we&rsquo;ve tested under load, at about 87 degrees.</p>

<p>Overall, Anker&rsquo;s hub is well designed, with adequate spacing between the two 5Gbps USB-A ports. There&rsquo;s also a 5Gbps USB-C connection for data, plus a second USB-C port for power input at up to 85W rated. (The charger allows up to 100W in, but supplies 85W.) An HDMI port allows for 4K/30Hz video or 1080p/60Hz video to a single external display, standard for the category. Ethernet is excluded, however, so you&rsquo;ll need to use Wi-Fi instead. Cord length is about 8.5 inches, above the standard 6-inch length.</p>

<p>Anker&rsquo;s hub was among the fastest we tested to deliver data under load, including simultaneous data transfer between USB-A ports while the SD ports were active. The hub offers an 18-month warranty, and it even ships with a carrying pouch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recommend <em>not</em> buying the more expensive $79.99 <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B0874M3KW4/?ascsubtag=2-3-402858-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Anker 8-in-1 Hub</a> on Amazon unless you&rsquo;re happy connecting to two 1080p (and not 4K) displays&hellip;which is perfectly fine. Otherwise, the two HDMI ports will only support two 4K displays at an eye-wearying 30Hz, not 60Hz.</p>

<p>Yeolibo may not be a name you recognize, but this USB-C hub is impressively detailed, with a small but extremely informative manual, clearly labeled ports, and well-rounded functionality. </p>

<p>This hub offers three USB 3.0 (5Gb/s) Type A ports, one USB 2.0 Type A port, a USB-C (5Gb/s) port, a USB-C PD charging port rated at 100W of input power, and an HDMI port. There are also microSD and SD slots capable of SDXC cards up to 2TB and SDR25 (25MB/s) data rates. There&rsquo;s no ethernet connection. The USB-C cable measures a comfortable six inches, though the connector at the end was a little stiff and took some fiddling to insert.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a 100W USB-C charger on hand to test, but the hub accepted 62.5W from our 65W USB-C charger.  It stayed cool throughout. The hub played back protected content via its HDMI port, as expected, but dropped more frames than we hoped for when playing back 4K content over YouTube. (Only 4K30 resolutions are supported, but that&rsquo;s not unusual.) </p>

<p>Lention&rsquo;s CB-C35sH feels a little cheap out of the box, with a bit of a rattle that indicates a corner or two were cut in the construction. It worked flawlessly, however. This USB-C hub is slightly wider than most, with a power input rated at 60W next to a HDMI 1.2 output (allowing 4K resolution on an external display, at 60Hz) that allows protected content to be played back with no problems. (Power input only reached 55W in our tests.) The entire hub remained cool, even with a charger attached.</p>

<p>In addition to the USB-C input port and HDMI output, there are four 5Gb/s USB Type A ports, and that&rsquo;s it&mdash;no microSD slots, ethernet, or audio connections. We would have liked to see the latter as an option for those who need it. But connecting a mouse and keyboard, as well as transferring data over the ports, worked well within the constraints of the USB-C connection. </p>

<p>Both our current overall top pick, the Anker A83460A2, and the Yeolibo 9-in-1 a are better overall options, with one exception: their HDMI output is only at 30Hz, which can fatigue the eyes over long periods. Lention delivers a more comfortable 60Hz at the same resolution. And if you have issues, Lention offers a 12-month warranty with a 24-hour support turnaround.</p>

<p>Lasuney&rsquo;s 10-in-1 hub (two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, two HDMI 1.2 ports (4K@30Hz), DisplayPort gigabit ethernet, microSD/SD, USB-C power input) offers a lot for your money, including an unusual mix of not one, but two HDMI ports, and even a DisplayPort. Thanks to ethernet support, the hub can replace many of your wired connections. Power input is rated at 100W in, with about 87W available to the laptop.</p>

<p>But the USB-C bus the hub runs on top of simply won&rsquo;t support <em>all</em> of the ports being used at once, which is a bit of a gotcha. While we really like the pair of HDMI ports for dual-display configurations, the fact is, you&rsquo;ll probably need to limit yourself to a pair of 1080p displays to avoid saturating the bus and slowing down the connection.&nbsp;Customers on Amazon have reported that they only got one to work, probably because the bus itself was saturated. The other problem we found is that the SD card slot is way too slow. It took twice as long to transfer data compared to other hubs we tested. In all fairness, our other disk-to-disk tests took about the same amount of time.</p>

<p>Lasuney&rsquo;s hub is well made, with good port spacing. It doesn&rsquo;t get uncomfortably warm, either.&nbsp;Just be realistic: We really like the flexibility that the Lasuney hub offers, but don&rsquo;t buy it thinking you&rsquo;ll be able to use everything at once. If you need that capability, look at one of the more expensive USB-C docking stations, below.</p>

<p>At&nbsp;2.8 x 0.31 x 1.22 inches, IOgear&rsquo;s Travel Pro Mini Dock is an odd duck: an inexpensive, relatively tiny USB-C dock that plugs directly into your laptop, without a connecting cord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way this will work,&rdquo; you might think&mdash;but it does, with just enough room for your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C charger to sneak in one side of the dock, next to an HDMI cord, then a USB key or cord, and a 3.5mm jack. (The Mini Dock supports up to 60W of power in from an external charger.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s fine, of course, if your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C port is all by its lonesome. Otherwise, the Travel Pro Mini Dock will block ports as it tries to offer expansion capabilities&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a problem for laptops like the Asus ZenBook, which forego a 3.5mm headphone jack but cram their USB-C ports too close together to make IOgear&rsquo;s dock feasible.</p>

<p>We like the idea, but there are cheaper, better docks out there with more flexibility.</p>

<p id="block-9165f3bc-6543-4c98-8a94-fa3b6f2cf805">This Rshtech RS-516 USB-C port splitter uses an unusually long 2-foot cable to split a 5Gbps USB 3.0 input (over USB-C) and divide it among four USB 3.0 Type A ports. It&rsquo;s also uncommon to see those ports controlled by LED-lit button switches, and an optional&nbsp;5V/2A adapter powering the whole affair.</p>

<p id="block-7c0b3ca1-f0b7-43a2-b7d1-f360f2e91ae4">The port splitter takes the 5Gbps input and splits it among the ports, which are only active if the corresponding LED-lit button is depressed. This applies to both power (the hub will charge, though not fast-charge phones) and data. Port spacing isn&rsquo;t an issue, and the ABS/aluminum construct handles heat well.</p>

<p id="block-8b03991e-9aa7-4576-9ed7-27b7d6ab0e6c">The Rshtech hub wouldn&rsquo;t always identify and connect to a bus-powered SSD, but it found every other device we connected to it. The performance of a powered external hard drive plunged to about 20 percent when all ports were occupied, but surged to about 67 percent when the optional power cable was plugged in&mdash;which Rshtech recommends when connected to external storage.</p>

<p id="block-9747d7c5-02d6-48c4-ad65-0c3fcbeb3624">That cable (with a proprietary plug) is a pain, and the issues finding our SSD gave us pause. But we really liked how the hub allowed us access to and control of external hard drives, which spin up and down loudly and randomly.</p>

<p>Recent laptops have begun offering a USB-C technology called HBR3 with DSC, which we&rsquo;ll explain more fully in the sections following our recommendations. The bottom line is that the technology offers something similar to the DisplayLink technology below, but as an industry standard. In our experience, although the technology is somewhat supported in laptops with 11th-gen Core processors, it works best in 12th- or 13th-gen laptops.</p>

<p>This slim plastic dock measures a hair over 6 inches wide and about 3 inches deep. It lacks a stand, and warms rather sharply under load. But it packs a pair of HDMI ports on the rear, four 5Gbps USB-A ports on the back, as well as gigabit ethernet. The USB-C cable, measuring about 2.5 feet, snakes out from the side of the dock. (CA&rsquo;s manual and documentation is lousy, by the way, so we&rsquo;re not quite clear what&nbsp;HDMI port&nbsp;technology it uses.) On the front is another USB Type A port and a USB-C port, too.</p>

<p>The latter USB-C port can be used to charge your smartphone, as it puts out 6.7W of charging power, or enough to fast-charge a smartphone. Otherwise, this is a powered dock, and it will supply 90W of charging power to your laptop, too.</p>

<p>This is our entry for an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">upgraded DisplayLink dock</a>, which has its own pros and cons&mdash;slightly more expensive than a USB-C docking station, but more features, too.</p>

<p>Plugable&rsquo;s UD-6950PDH doesn&rsquo;t allow the bandwidth for the latest HDMI or DisplayPort interfaces, but it preserves what we like about Plugable&rsquo;s docks: two pairs of optional DisplayPort and HDMI connections to choose from, as well as 100W of charging power to your laptop. One omission, however, is a dedicated charging port for powering a smartphone, or any USB-C port at all. (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1061892/visiontek-vt7000-triple-4k-dock.html">VisionTek&rsquo;s VT7000</a> includes these, but for a substantial premium.)</p>

<p>At about $199 MSRP, however, the price is absolutely right for a DisplayLink docking station. Just don&rsquo;t forget your smartphone charger.</p>

<p>Weirdly, what you&rsquo;ll buy at Amazon (the Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station) doesn&rsquo;t match the name on the box (the USB-C Multifunction Docking Station PRO). The other hitch? This is a powered dock&hellip;but you&rsquo;ll need to supply the charger. </p>

<p>These are some odd quirks, set against what is quite a pricy product. Get past those, though, and this is really a solid device &mdash; it actually drives three displays! Just make sure to download the DisplayLink software as detailed in our review, below.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="how-to-choose-a-usb-c-hub">How to choose a USB-C hub</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="first-take-stock-of-your-peripherals">First, take stock of your peripherals</h3>



<p>Here&rsquo;s where to start: Take a look at the peripherals you own, or plan to buy. Do you have an old external hard drive that uses a traditional USB-A cable? Do you manually back up photos from an SLR via its SD card? Or is your Wi-Fi connection unreliable enough that you&rsquo;d prefer ethernet? Figure out what ports you&rsquo;ll need. This advice is also for Windows users; Macs have their own limitations on USB-C connections.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined">
<figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/usb-c-hub-power-shot-100781806-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="usb c hub power shot" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/usb-c-hub-power-shot-100781806-large.jpg" /></a><figcaption>
<p>This laptop has several USB-C ports, but if yours has just one, you&rsquo;ll want to daisy-chain the laptop&rsquo;s power cord by plugging it directly into the hub, like so.</p>
</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="next-check-out-what-ports-your-laptop-already-has">Next, check out what ports your laptop already has</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s also important to take stock of your laptop or tablet&rsquo;s ports: Does it have one USB-C port or two? If your device only has one port, is there a separate charging connection? If your laptop or tablet has a USB-C port and&nbsp;<em>uses it exclusively for charging</em>, you&rsquo;ll want to buy a USB-C hub with a dedicated charging input port. (In this case, it&rsquo;s also possible that <em>only</em> the charging port on the hub will work, though this isn&rsquo;t typical.) Note how much input power it allows, and confirm that will be sufficient for your laptop. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be forced to choose between charging your laptop and accessing other devices, which makes little sense.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="assess-your-laptop-and-peripheral-power-needs">Assess your laptop and peripheral power needs</h3>



<p>Keep in mind that the hub&rsquo;s power port is for taking power&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;to your laptop, and not&nbsp;<em>out</em>&nbsp;to a phone. But your hub may still be able to charge your phone, with some caveats. A &ldquo;bus-powered&rdquo; USB hub connects to your laptop&nbsp;<em>and</em> pulls power from it, which it has share with several devices&mdash;and it won&rsquo;t do it that well. </p>



<p>Some docks will include a USB-C port whose only purpose is to accept your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C charger. That port will power your laptop as well as any ports connected to it. These devices will make more power available for fast charging your phone. (Your hub probably won&rsquo;t enable specialized charging like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3530319/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review.html?page=2#toc-4">Samsung Galaxy S20</a>&rsquo;s Super Fast Charging, however, even if you use the supplied Samsung cable. You&rsquo;ll still need to connect your phone to its charger for that.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-sense-of-the-usb-c-technologies">Making sense of the USB-C technologies</h2>



<p>A USB-C port on your laptop can either run at 5Gbps or 10Gbps, with the latter being almost ubiquitous these days. That&rsquo;s plenty of bandwidth for a printer, a mouse, a keyboard, or a hard drive, even all at once. Products like displays, ethernet, and high-speed SSDs gobble up that bandwidth, however.</p>



<p>We find that the display technologies tend to have the most influence over what you should buy. If you simply want to connect to an external 1080p display&mdash;or two&mdash;a USB-C dongle should work fine, provided that the dongle has the available ports. It&rsquo;s certainly the cheapest option. Once you start trying to connect to one or two 1440p or 4K displays, however, you may find that you&rsquo;ll want to consider options like the USB-C docking stations. You can get around this, in part. Instead of plugging your ethernet cable into the USB-C dongle, you can use a separate Wi-Fi connection, for example.</p>



<p>Traditionally, the only other alternative was a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt dock</a>. Provided your laptop had a Thunderbolt port, Thunderbolt&rsquo;s 40Gbps bandwidth allows for two 4K displays, running at 60Hz, plus various peripherals. (You can use a USB-C dock even if you have a Thunderbolt port, by the way.) USB4, a similar technology, is basically the same as Thunderbolt for your purposes.</p>

<p>Now, there are also two intermediary technologies to choose from: a DisplayLink USB-C dock, and a USB-C dock that takes advantage of something called HBR3 and DSC.</p>



<p><strong>DisplayLink</strong>, owned by Synaptics, uses software compression between your laptop and the dock to approximate a Thunderbolt experience over a generic USB-C connection. It requires a software driver, but our experience is that it&rsquo;s an excellent choice for office work, but not gaming. However, until recently, prices of DisplayLink docks haven&rsquo;t been where we think that they should be: in the $150 range.</p>



<p>HBR3 with Display Compression (<strong>HBR3 with DSC</strong>) is essentially an industry standard version of DisplayLink. The problem? The technology hasn&rsquo;t been widely publicized, let alone supported. Our experience has been that docks that support HBR3 work well with laptops using 12th-gen Core processors on up. Laptops with a 10th-gen Core chip inside them aren&rsquo;t supported, and 11th-gen Core laptops are iffy. If you own a 12th-gen Core laptop, especially a member of Intel&rsquo;s premium Evo brand, you stand a good chance of success. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t bother. (We haven&rsquo;t tested with laptops that use an AMD Ryzen chip.)</p>

<p>Thunderbolt cables and ports include the little lightning-bolt icon, which differentiates them from the otherwise unmarked USB-C cables.</p>

</div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="finally-dont-worry-about-platform-branding">Finally, don&rsquo;t worry about platform branding</h3>



<p>Because USB-C is common among Macs, Windows PCs, and phones, some hubs align their branding with a particular platform. Go ahead and use that USB-C that&rsquo;s billed as being &ldquo;for MacBook Pro, Chromebook, and XPS&rdquo; with any Windows PC&mdash;we did, and it works just fine. You won&rsquo;t need any special software or drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="how-we-test-usb-c-hubs">How we test USB-C hubs</h2>



<p>We used bus-powered peripherals to test each hub: an SSD, a hard drive, and a rewriteable DVD drive, all to make sure enough power was being delivered. We also ran speed tests on those hubs with ethernet connections, just to detect any anomalous results. We performed spot checks with other peripherals.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/05/flexpow-hiearcool-usb-c-hub-100887145-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="flexpow hiearcool usb c hub" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/05/flexpow-hiearcool-usb-c-hub-100887145-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <p>Even though two USB-C hubs may have wildly different brand names, you may sometimes find that they&rsquo;re otherwise identical or just very similar.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>




<p>We conducted standardized tests to transfer a file from the SSD to the laptop; from the hard drive to the SSD; and then from an SD card to the PC, while simultaneously transferring files from the hard drive to the SSD. In some cases we used AJA&rsquo;s System Tool app to run read and write tests on connected drives. In almost all cases, the performance was identical, with a spread of about 3 percent&mdash;good news for you, as that&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We measured the surface temperature while these tests were run.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see some buyers on Amazon pages complaining about how hot a hub gets; some do get on the warmer side. Also, where we could, we measured the power input for each hub.</p>



<p>We looked at how SD cards were inserted&mdash;you&rsquo;d be surprised how many don&rsquo;t work unless they&rsquo;re inserted upside down!&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also noted the cord length, as shorter cables limit your options when positioning the hub around your laptop or tablet. Worst case, a short cable causes a hub to dangle from a tablet whose USB-C port is mounted toward the top. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why bother testing something as ridiculous as the spacing between the USB Type A ports? Because if you don&rsquo;t, you can run into this situation: Because the ports are spaced too closely together, only one of these USB keys can be inserted at a time.</p>
</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>After testing our USB-C hubs, we can confirm that some no-names perform just as well as their more well-known counterparts, and for less money, too. One thing to keep in mind: Because price is so critical to our recommendations, know that some of the prices may change as manufacturers offer sales. Therefore some hubs we&nbsp;<em>didn&rsquo;t</em> recommend primarily based on price could become more purchase-worthy.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Honestly, not much. Pay attention to our reviews and those from other shoppers, but buy according to what the hub or dongle offers. You can absolutely find solid USB-C hubs and dongles for an inexpensive price.</p>



<p>USB-C docking <em>stations</em>, though, can feel a bit overpriced. In part, that&rsquo;s because Thunderbolt docks were wildly expensive during the 2020-2021 pandemic years. USB-C docking stations are an alternative, but their prices were sucked upward, too.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A docking station and a USB-C hub serve similar purposes&mdash;extending the range of ports available for a laptop&mdash;but they aren&rsquo;t entirely the same.</p>



<p>USB-C hubs are generally more compact and portable port expanders. They come with a few ports which are mostly USB-C or USB-A ports, but higher end hubs come with SD Card slots and HDMI or DisplayPort inputs as well. USB-C hubs are designed to be small and easy to carry around with you but require power to be drawn from a laptop itself.</p>



<p>Docking stations on the other hand are larger and designed to be more stationary. They are meant to help turn your laptop into a desktop replacement. In terms of available ports, they come with everything a USB-C hub has and more. This includes connections for external monitors, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and Ethernet ports, among others. They are also typically powered via a power outlet allowing for all connected devices to be powered directly from the docking station.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-usb-c-and-thunderbolt">What is the difference between USB-C and Thunderbolt?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Both USB-C and Thunderbolt ports are universal in that the same input can be used for both, but they are not exactly the same. USB-C input ports allow for data transfer rates of up to 10Gbps and power charging. Thunderbolt ports allow for data transfer rates of up to 40Gbps, power charging, and video output up to 4K resolution.</p>



<p>There are a couple of caveats. DisplayLink USB-C docks use the DisplayLink compression technology to squeeze more data over the generic USB0-C connection. Provided you&rsquo;re not interested in high-end gaming, this technology works exceptionally well. </p>



<p>You may see high-end, modern laptops (which use 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core chips) squeeze out more than 10Gbps across the USB-C port because of a more generic technology called HBR3 with Display Compression. But which laptops officially support that is rarely called out by the manufacturer. Basically you may get lucky, or not.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-do-usb-c-hubs-get-so-hot">Why do USB-C hubs get so hot?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>USB-C hubs can get warm or even hot while using them to transfer data or charge devices. This is because the electronic components and circuitry within hubs build up heat during use. Depending upon the hub&rsquo;s material, heat can become trapped inside the hub leading it to become hot to the touch.</p>



<p>If you are concerned about your hub becoming too hot during use, you may consider purchasing a hub made from metallic parts, such as aluminum, so that heat can more easily dissipate as it builds up.</p>

<p>Peruse the &ldquo;Known issues&rdquo; section of the release notes for the latest release of Windows 11 22H2, and you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;Third-party UI customization apps might prevent the Start menu from opening&rdquo; right at the top. Those apps might be familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552936/startallback-fixes-what-i-hate-about-the-windows-11-ui.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">turned to aftermarket tools</a> to return some Windows 10 functionality to the smoother, cleaner, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html">markedly less functional</a> Windows 11 Start menu and taskbar. Microsoft isn&rsquo;t particularly interested in fixing the issue. The official recommendation for the 22621.30000 build is, &ldquo;uninstall them.&rdquo; </p>



<p>&ldquo;We recommend uninstalling any third-party UI customization app before installing &ldquo;KB5028254 to prevent this issue,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22H2?irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__lqxkyrmiwkkfbidiig9vts69pe2xeuntabgz2jb900)(7593)(1243925)(kXQk6.ivFEQ-nP.7yD59mmZFO7QGJg9Iiw)()&amp;irclickid=_lqxkyrmiwkkfbidiig9vts69pe2xeuntabgz2jb900#3134msgdesc&amp;xcust=2-1-2011983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says the documentation</a>, with further instructions to contact customer support for the app developer if your Start menu has already disappeared. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-bug/&amp;xcust=2-1-2011983-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to XDA</a>, several users of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1786965/bring-back-windows-11s-missing-features-for-free-with-explorer-patcher.html">awesome and popular ExplorerPatcher</a> program are experiencing the issue. The free, open-source program adds back features from the Windows 10 taskbar and alt-tab interface. </p>



<p>Of course, Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have a responsibility to support users of apps that deliberately alter the user interface it&rsquo;s designed. But usually the company at least tries to accommodate Windows users when its updates cause issues for popular software. In this case, the company seems uninterested, recommending that people simply stop using the tools or take their problems to the developers instead. Undoubtedly, the developers of such tools will attempt to fix the problems on their end, as has happened before. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that perhaps so many Windows 11 users wouldn&rsquo;t be seeking out these kinds of interface tweaking apps if Microsoft hadn&rsquo;t removed so much of the basic functionality of the Windows 10 Start menu and taskbar in favor of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a more streamlined appearance</a>. Such basic options as always showing text labels or placing the taskbar on the top of the display are still unavailable in vanilla Windows 11, nearly two years after the operating system&rsquo;s official release. </p>



<p>So far the KB5028254 is only in preview going out to Windows Insiders and other early users, but it will be hitting the general release in the next few weeks. If Microsoft&rsquo;s attitude to these issues in the support documentation is indicative of its new <em>laissez faire</em> approach to interface tweaks, you can expect to see similar problems in the future. </p>

<p>The Razer Cobra Pro is a compact, pro-grade gaming mouse that&rsquo;s perfectly suited for all the major grip types. It also boasts a top-line, exceptionally smooth Razer Focus Pro 30,000 DPI optical sensor that proves a force to be reckoned with in the right player&rsquo;s hand.</p>



<p>While the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s stablemate, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://b2c-contenthub.com/article/1663595/razer-deathadder-v3-pro-gaming-mouse-review.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2006590-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro</a>, is near 16 grams lighter than the Cobra Pro, the Cobra Pro is undoubtedly the more versatile of the two offerings, adding 11 dazzling RGB lighting zones and dual wireless connectivity to its feature set. What&rsquo;s more, with both dedicated DPI up and down buttons the Cobra Pro is the eminently better option for gamers who like to change their DPI settings on the fly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-much-does-the-razer-cobra-pro-cost">How much does the Razer Cobra Pro cost?</h3>



<p>The Cobra Pro is one of the more affordable pro grade gaming mice. Right now, the base model (our review unit) ships for $129.99 on Razer&rsquo;s website, which is $20 cheaper than the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro. It currently costs $40 more than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1987896/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-review.html">HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless</a>, a rival that also features 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity and RGB. However, comparing the two, you could argue the addition of a higher resolution sensor, DPI down and up buttons, and an extra 10 RGB lighting zones in the Cobra Pro makes it the better value for money option.</p>



<p>Razer also ships the Cobra Pro bundled with accessories. For example, you can buy the Cobra Pro with an upgraded 4000 Hz hyper polling dongle for $144.99 on Razer&rsquo;s website. You can also buy the Razer Cobra Pro bundled with a Razer Mouse Dock Pro (a wireless dock for charging) for $169.99, or alternatively with a wireless charging puck for $139.99.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="razer-cobra-pro-design-and-build">Razer Cobra Pro: Design and build</h3>



<p>Narrow, low profile gaming mice aren&rsquo;t trending right now, so the Razer Cobra Pro is really something different. Measuring just 4.71 x 2.46 x 1.50 inches, it&rsquo;s quite a lot thinner than the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro (5.0 x 2.7 x 1.7 inches), Logitech G Pro X Superlight (4.9 x 2.5 x 1.6 inches), and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless (4.9 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches).</p>



<p>That makes it a compact mouse that&rsquo;s best suited to medium or small hands. Its low height also means it doesn&rsquo;t stick up against your palm as some mice tend to do; you get a little extra room to breathe. Suffice to say, this is really a mouse you can switch your playstyle with on a whim &mdash; switching from claw grip, to fingertip, to palm, or any combination, feeling easy thanks to the extra space beneath your hand. That&rsquo;s the upside to the Razer Cobra&rsquo;s design.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip;this mouse is ideal for right-to-left sniping or spraying in FPS games. Indeed, if you know of a particular map where you&rsquo;ll have a lot of right-to-left action &ndash; a secret spot beneath the bushes on the far right of your field of play, or something &ndash; you may want to unleash the Cobra from its cage just for that.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The downside is large hands are going to feel a little cramped on the Razer Cobra Pro&rsquo;s modest body, especially at the main clicks where they&rsquo;re likely to experience some overhang. Of course, if you&rsquo;re a claw gripper, that&rsquo;s not really going to apply to you as much, so the Cobra is especially suited to you.</p>



<p>Comparing the mouse&rsquo;s weight to a vanguard of ultra-light gaming mice and at 77 grams, it&rsquo;s at least 16 grams heavier than two of our most recently reviewed mice, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight and the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s no drama, though &mdash; 16 grams difference certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel like much, nor did it affect the mouse&rsquo;s speed or performance in my playtesting. In fact, if you&rsquo;re not playing esports, it&rsquo;s unlikely you will notice. Still, the extra weight does make the Cobra Pro a little unconventional for a mid-2023 pro-grade release.</p>

<p>The button configuration is also a little unconventional, but in a good way. Instead of the six-button FPS configuration you commonly see, you get 7 buttons all up, if you count the DPI up and down switches behind the mouse wheel. I&rsquo;ll discuss how the benefits of that played out in the performance section, but needless to say the extra down switch button was most appreciated, and not something you always see.</p>



<p>An excellent dollop of RGB is another factor that really separates the Cobra Pro from the rest of the pack. While it seems like gaming mice manufacturers sould be clambering over each other to include more RGB, so far in 2023 we&rsquo;ve scarcely seen much at all. But the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s 19 programmable RGB lighting zones really make playing in the dark a whole lot more memorable.</p>



<p>The Cobra Pro is also exceptionally well made. It features tactile grips on both its left and right flanks and a firm matte black plastic in the centre front and back. The Cobra Pro&rsquo;s mouse wheel is small but secure without the slightest hint of any wobble.</p>



<p>Razer should also be complemented for the accessories you get. In the box you get a USB dongle adapter and a USB-A to USB-C Speedflex cable. The cable feels strong and flexible, and both the ends have caps to keep them safe. The tiny 2.4GHz wi-fi dongle is unobtrusive and unlikely to get in the way of your mouse strokes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="razer-cobra-pro-gaming-performance">Razer Cobra Pro gaming performance</h3>



<p>About half of Razer&rsquo;s gaming mice &mdash; the top-line ones &mdash; have sensors rated at 30, 000 DPI resolution, so the Cobra Pro sits up their with Razer&rsquo;s finest. Of course, a 30,000 DPI sensor does sound like overkill for most competitive gaming, and it absolutely is.</p>



<p>I mean, you can quite easily get by using a lowly 8,000 DPI sensor, even in the quickest FPS matches, and still top the scoreboard. What&rsquo;s the point, then, of having such an amazing sensor like the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s? Well, as any competitive gamer knows, DPI isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>

<p>For example, as well as its sublime resolution and insane tracking speed of 750 inches per second, the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s Razer Focus Pro 30K sensor lets you adjust your liftoff distance to one of 26 granular levels &mdash; that&rsquo;s 23 more than mice that have Razer&rsquo;s previously best sensor technology, the Focus+ Optical Sensor. The Razer Focus Pro 30K also bestows surface compatibility benefits too, like seamless operation on glass tabletops 4mm thick. These benefits really do make the Cobra Pro a more attractive proposition over 8K, 12K, or even 26K rival sensors, in my view.</p>



<p>Launching a game of Insurgency to trial it proved the sensor could track motion superbly. Although you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to see a difference in speed and movement between the Cobra Pro and say a 26K sensor from a rival mouse, to me the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s movement just seemed to be eminently smoother and more accurate &mdash; and that held true against the majority of mice in my collection.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Cobra Pro" class="wp-image-2006601" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hand-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Razer Cobra Pro best fits small to medium-sized hands.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The buttons also felt lightning fast and satisfyingly loud. Razer has loaded them with Razer Gen 3 Optical Switches, which are rated for 90 million clicks.</p>



<p>It seems odd to say too, but the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s added weight was also a boon to my performance. Certainly, it made swiping from left to right feel quicker than mice that weigh just 60 grams. And while it&rsquo;s true that the redraw wasn&rsquo;t quite as fast, I still felt the extra weight gave me a better sense of when to stop on targets.</p>



<p>That said, this mouse is ideal for right-to-left sniping or spraying in FPS games. Indeed, if you know of a particular map where you&rsquo;ll have a lot of right-to-left action &ndash;- a secret spot beneath the bushes on the far right of your field of play, or something &mdash; you may want to unleash the Cobra from its cage just for that.</p>

<p>But if I could choose my favorite thing about Razer&rsquo;s Cobra Pro it would be the DPI up and down buttons. I don&rsquo;t have a great deal of time to really investigate character classes in FPS games and calibrate the best settings for all of them, so I mostly tend to flip between two favorites. In Insurgency, for example, that&rsquo;s the Sniper and Rifleman. After all, the saying goes &ldquo;A jack of all trades is a master of none.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That said, being able to switch between my 800 DPI setting for sniping and 1600 DPI setting for the rifle in a split second with the DPI switcher really saved my bacon on more than one occasion. If you&rsquo;re a switcher like me, you&rsquo;ll undoubtedly dig this feature too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="razer-synapse-software">Razer Synapse software</h3>



<p>A mouse that offers features like 26 granular levels of asymmetrical lift off and resolution up to 30, 000 DPI really needs a well-supported software app, and thankfully Razer&rsquo;s Synapse app is just that.</p>



<p>As well as making programming in commands a straightforward affair, Synapse lets you do so much more. Some of the things that I got up to in Synapse included assigning extra functions to my mouse buttons to make a total of 10 with Razer Hyper Shift, as well as changing the polling rate and switching on Smart Dimming of the RGB to conserve battery power when the mouse is in Wireless Mode. By the way, the battery life is quite decent. It&rsquo;s rated for up to 100 hours in Wi-Fi Mode or 170 hours in Bluetooth Mode.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Cobra Pro" class="wp-image-2006607" height="685" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cobra-Pro-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>You can extend the Razer Cobra Pro&rsquo;s battery life with simple settings changes in Synapse.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>One big benefit with the Razer Cobra Pro is you get 5 onboard memory profiles. Once programmed in Synapse, changing profiles in your games is as simple as pressing the Cobra Pro&rsquo;s profile switch on its underside, so if you enjoy using macros, you&rsquo;re in luck.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-you-buy-the-razer-cobra-pro">Should you buy the Razer Cobra Pro?</h3>



<p>I only assigned functions to 3 of my Cobra Pro&rsquo;s 5 on-board profiles but it was nice to know I had 2 more to compile, when the next must-have game is too good for me to resist buying.</p>



<p>The Razer Cobra Pro is an excellent all-rounder gaming mouse with a top-line sensor that takes no prisoners in the fast competitive games. It also looks incredibly stylish, with an exceptional amount of dazzling RBG, so that you can enjoy endless light shows. Plus, since you get both DPI down as well as up clicks, this mouse lets you change DPI settings in an instant, allowing you get the drop on competitors when the action gets furious.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s latest high-end graphics cards have turned a lot of heads, with both the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Radeon RX 7900 XT and its big brother the RX 7900 XTX</a> punching above their weight. Today the company announced a new member of the line, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-7900-gre&amp;xcust=2-1-2011885-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Radeon RX 7900 GRE</a>. This new model sits somewhere between the top-of-the-line XT model and the last-gen RX 6800 XT, going for a reasonable $650 USD. Unfortunately the vast majority of our readers won&rsquo;t be able to buy it: GRE stands for &ldquo;Golden Rabbit Edition,&rdquo; and this card isn&rsquo;t getting a retail release outside of the Chinese market. </p>



<p>The Radeon RX 7900 GRE hits just below the RX 7900 XT in just about every hardware facet. Though it&rsquo;s using a modified Navi 31 processor design, it comes with 80 GPU clusters, a 2.2GHz maximum clock speed, 16GB of GDDR6 memory, and a 256-bit memory bus (compare to 84, 2.4GHz, 20GB, and 320-bit on the XT, respectively). </p>

<p>That still puts the $650 card well above the next step down in the series so far, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html">Radeon RX 7600</a>, which has just 32 compute units and 8GB of memory. The $270 &ldquo;budget&rdquo; card was released early this summer, and so far it&rsquo;s the only other GPU in the lineup, leaving a large gap in AMD&rsquo;s mid-range for the 7000 line. What&rsquo;s the holdup for the mid-range cards? No concrete details are available, though the rumor mill says AMD is working out some of the kinks of the new Navi chip design before it brings them to market. </p>



<p>In the meantime, you might just find the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in some hardware bound for shores beyond China later this year&hellip;if you&rsquo;re willing to buy a pre-built desktop. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-7900-gre-officially-launches-with-5120-cores-16gb-memory-and-260w-tbp-costs-649&amp;xcust=2-1-2011885-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to VideoCardz.com</a>, while reference cards will be sold alongside OEM models from Sapphire, XTX, and PowerColor, system integrators will be able to sell machines with the GRE pre-loaded to offer a slightly more affordable alternative to the XT and XTX. </p>

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said that its upcoming &ldquo;Meteor Lake&rdquo; 14th-gen Core processors will usher in the era of the &ldquo;AI PC,&rdquo; a development he said rivalled the launch of the Centrino integrated platform that helped bring Wi-Fi into the notebook market.</p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s Meteor Lake is on track for a launch during the current third quarter of 2023, and will feature a dedicated AI engine known as Intel AI Boost. Gelsinger provided an updated roadmap during the company&rsquo;s second quarter 2023 earnings call.</p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s Gelsinger has said previously that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html">Meteor Lake would be synonymous with AI</a>, though the company has shipped Movidius AI add-on cards alongside its 13th-gen Core chips. Those chips, which have appeared in laptops like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525530/samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra</a>, really haven&rsquo;t been able to tap any &ldquo;AI&rdquo; functions besides Microsoft-driven enhancements to video calls placed with Windows, known as Windows Studio Effects. (AMD has a rival effort, known as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html">Ryzen AI</a>.) That, for now, has left any concept of an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447856/ai-pcs-should-be-the-trend-that-begins-in-2023.html">AI PC without much meaning</a>, though Gelsinger clearly believes an AI renaissance is in the cards.</p>



<p>Thursday may have been the first time Gelsinger used the term &ldquo;AI PC,&rdquo; which he used to hearken back to the days of the Centrino processor. Intel bundled a mobile processor, chipset, and Wi-Fi component together within notebooks in the early 2000s, and branded the combination as &ldquo;Centrino.&rdquo; Gelsinger also ran Intel&rsquo;s Enterprise Group in 2005 when Intel reorganized the company to adopt a similar strategy. Gelsinger told analysts that Intel &ldquo;firmly believes in this idea of democratizing AI and opening the software stack,&rdquo; creating an AI industry ecosystem.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Importantly, we see the AI PC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino on Wi Fi in the early 2000s,&rdquo; Gelsinger said during the call. &ldquo;And we believe that Intel is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth opportunity.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-must-run-on-the-pc-intel-says">AI must run on the PC, Intel says</h2>



<p>So far, however, AI has primarily lived in the cloud. AI-enabled chatbots like Bing Chat, Google&rsquo;s Bard, and OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT all run on a server, and Qualcomm&rsquo;s partnership with Meta to run its Llama 2 large-language model on its Snapdragon processors is one of the first client-side AI announcements. Gelsinger, however, hopes to change that. And the first thing the industry needs to do is establish an ecosystem of AI-infused client applications.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The real question is what applications are going to become AI enabled,&rdquo; Gelsinger said. &ldquo;And today you&rsquo;re starting to see that people are going to the cloud and you know, goofing around with ChatGPT writing a research paper. That&rsquo;s like super cool, right?&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Store AI Hub" class="wp-image-2011045" height="717" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Microsoft-Store-AI-Hub.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Microsoft&rsquo;s AI Hub in the Microsoft Store.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>But Gelsinger added that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t [make a] round trip to the cloud&rdquo; for similar applications, such as generating additional content in games, productivity apps, and AI-infused creativity apps like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2009781/photoshop-adds-ai-outpainting-to-see-whats-beyond-the-mona-lisa.html">Adobe Photoshop and its Generative Fill and Expand</a> functions. </p>



<p>&ldquo;That must be done on the client for that to occur, right? &ldquo;Gelsinger added. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go to the cloud, you can&rsquo;t round trip to the cloud,&rdquo; because of the cost and latency those trips require.</p>



<p>Microsoft has quietly tried to create an AI Hub within the Microsoft Store app, featuring apps like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/luminar-neo-photo-editor/9P7JQGL6GC8P&amp;xcust=2-1-2011031-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Luminar Neo</a>&nbsp;and Lensa. But without dedicated processors to run them, the apps tend to run on a local CPU or GPU.</p>



<p>The answer, Gelsinger said, was to infuse local processors with AI instead. &ldquo;We expect that Intel&hellip; is the one that&rsquo;s going to truly democratize AI at the client and at the edge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we do believe that this will become a [market driver] because people will say oh, I want those new use cases. They make me more efficient and more capable, just like Centrino made me more efficient, because I didn&rsquo;t have to plug into the wire.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Otherwise, Gelsinger and Intel said that Intel remains on track with its existing process roadmap: Intel 7 is ramping now, Intel 4 will begin with Meteor Lake in the second half of 2023, and Intel 3, 20A, and the Intel 18A process are still on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/615644/intels-cpu-roadmap-now-extends-to-2024s-lunar-lake.html">Intel&rsquo;s previous schedule</a>.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards (and their predecessors, the RX 6000-series) offer impressive power out of the box, especially for gaming. But with a little extra tuning you can get even more firepower out of them.</p>



<p>This guide explains how to get even more performance, efficiency, and picture quality out of AMD&rsquo;s modern graphics cards, using software tricks to optimize and accelerate their RDNA graphics architectures even further. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="1-faster-through-overclocking">1: Faster through overclocking!</h2>



<p>If you want to overclock your PC&rsquo;s graphics card, you&rsquo;ll be confronted with many unanswered questions at the beginning. You need to pay attention to some basic things so the project turns out successful.</p>



<p>Before you start overclocking, you need to know exactly which graphics card you&rsquo;re tinkering with and which technical specifications (e.g. clock frequencies) it has. We&rsquo;ll be using the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">$900 Radeon RX 7900 XT</a> for our example below.</p>

<p>First, search for the GPU&rsquo;s product page (or dig out your manual) and determine all the specifications relevant for overclocking (which we&rsquo;ll detail for this example below). You&rsquo;ll also need to install TechPowerUp&rsquo;s outstanding <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/&amp;xcust=2-1-1989637-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GPU-Z software</a> to actually be able to actually monitor the relevant specifications &mdash; such as base, game, boost, and memory clocks &mdash; in real time. Fear not, it&rsquo;s free!</p>



<p>In the case of the reference AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, the tool spits out the following technical specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>1.900 MHz base clock</li>



<li>2.400 MHz boost clock (maximum)</li>



<li>2.300 MHz game clock (average)</li>



<li>16 GB GDDR6 with 20 Gbps memory speed (10 GHz)</li>
</ul>



<p>Our goal is to increase the maximum possible boost clock and thus the average game clock in games, and optionally maximize the memory bandwidth by achieving a higher memory clock. Radeon graphics card owners can use the integrated overclocking function in the company&rsquo;s AMD Software Adrenalin Edition rather than turning to a third-party tool like MSI Afterburner. AMD itself demonstrates how the overclocking feature works in detail in the video below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Overclocked accordingly, you can expect to see up to 10 to 15 percent more performance (or frames per second) compared to the factory settings for the RX 7900 XT graphics card.</p>



<p><strong>Important note:</strong> By overclocking or undervolting a GPU, you change important parameters such as the heat dissipation and power consumption of the graphics card. Please note that incorrectly set voltages can not only result in an unstable system, but also irreparable damage to the GPU. Overclocking isn&rsquo;t as dangerous as many people assume, but be sure to follow the guide AMD provided above!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="2-more-efficient-through-undervolting">2: More efficient through undervolting</h2>



<p>GPU manufacturers always build a safety buffer into the factory settings of their graphics cards, balancing the highest possible stability by applying a little more voltage than necessary for many chips. The voltage of many Radeon graphics cards can be lowered within a certain range without causing crashes or instabilities, though like overclocking, the exact degree of change will depend on your specific GPU&rsquo;s individual silicon quality..</p>



<p>While overclocking is all about putting the performance pedal to the metal, with undervolting, the goal is to operate the graphics card with similar performance while drawing significantly less power (and thus, spitting out significantly less heat), as explained in-depth in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/604722/how-to-undervolt-your-graphics-card.html">our undervolting guide</a>. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Software Adrenalin Edition" class="wp-image-1661786" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/770814-Radeon-Software-Rage-Mode-1260x709-1.webp?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Overclocking and Undervolting in AMD Adrenalin</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>In the case of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT reference design, the voltage is 1.150 volts and can usually be lowered to 0.975 to 1.025 volts before the graphics card starts to clock down massively. Here, too, the so-called &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; must be discovered manually in order to be able to increase the efficiency to the maximum.</p>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve explored (and combined) appropriate overclocking and undervolting for your Radeon graphics card, it will ideally not only run faster, but also more efficiently and cooler.</p>

<p>To ensure overclocked and/or undervolted graphics cards remain stable even under heavy loads, running the following benchmarks and stability tests are a good idea.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://unigine.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1989637-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unigine</a></li>

</ul>



<p>Since loads (and especially the load peaks) for the GPU and the VRAM behave differently in games than synthetic stress tests, you should also play some of your favorite games and check them for stability. Ideally, the result is a faster, more efficient graphics card that can be operated with absolute stability. Check out our comprehensive guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394845/how-to-benchmark-your-graphics-card.html">how to benchmark your graphics card</a> if you want to go even deeper.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="4-more-beautiful-thanks-to-upscaling">4: More beautiful thanks to upscaling</h2>



<p>Users who like to play games in higher resolutions and enjoy the significantly improved picture quality are often confronted by a lack of raw performance from their graphics card, especially at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html">4K</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html">ultrawide</a> resolutions. But AMD has a solution for this as well.</p>



<p>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is the name of the feature that first calculates images at a lower resolution internally and then &ldquo;upscales&rdquo; them to fit your monitor resolution using a software upscaling process. That technological combination means the frame rates and frame times in supported titles can be increased without having to upgrade to a new graphics card.</p>



<p>AMD demonstrates how this works with the popular open-world racing game Forza Horizon 5, which can be significantly accelerated with FSR 2.2, in the video below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 is designed to deliver the best possible picture quality, with a final image that looks similar to or better than native picture quality, while also boosting frame rates in supported games, AMD says.</p>



<p>In total, more than 200 games support FSR, including many well-known games, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Anno 1800</li>



<li>Resident Evil 2+3</li>



<li>Resident Evil Village</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>



<li>Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice</li>



<li>Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six Siege</li>



<li>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade &ndash; Bloodhunt</li>



<li>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</li>



<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator</li>



<li>World of Warships</li>



<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>



<li>Dying Light 2</li>



<li>Forspoken</li>



<li>Diablo 4</li>
</ul>



<p>The performance and efficiency gains from adding AMD FSR 2 are quite impressive, as AMD&rsquo;s benchmarks demonstrate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="5-cooler-thanks-to-radeon-chill">5: Cooler thanks to Radeon Chill</h2>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s Radeon Chill helps keep your graphics card (and thus your system, and room) cool and quiet. </p>



<p>This energy-saving feature conserves the battery of notebooks and reduces the power consumption of gaming PCs by controlling the frame rates based on your in-game movements. When there is intense movement, Radeon Chill runs the frames per second (FPS) up to a set upper limit (FPS limit). If there is no movement in happening in your game, the frame rate cap is automatically reduced, which saves energy and allows the graphics card and the rest of the system to run cooler and quieter.</p>



<p>AMD demonstrates how AMD Radeon Chill works in the video below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Radeon Chill works with most titles that use DirectX 9, DirectX 10, DirectX 11, and DirectX 12 from Microsoft as well as the free graphics API Vulkan, which is mostly used on Linux.</p>



<p>Just like overclocking and undervolting, Radeon Chill can be activated directly via the AMD graphics driver and the AMD Radeon Adrenalin software.</p>

<p>No distortion. No jumping visuals. Just gaming. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s how AMD describes its adaptive synchronization technology for monitors that support a variable refresh rate to avoid &ldquo;tearing&rdquo; and reduce stuttering. AMD FreeSync technology delivers smooth, judder-free gaming performance at virtually any frame rate, without distorted or clipped frames.</p>



<p>The latest higher-tier versions of FreeSync, AMD FreeSync Premium and FreeSync Premium Pro, also support refresh rates of 120Hz and above, Low Framerate Compensation (&ldquo;LFC&rdquo;), and HDR gaming.</p>

<p>To use AMD FreeSync, FreeSync Premium, and FreeSync Premium Pro, a compatible monitor is required. More than 900 monitors from various manufacturers have been certified accordingly and support the adaptive synchronization technology.</p>

<p>Some tech purchases are no-brainers when getting ready for a fresh school year, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/818199/back-to-school-deals.html">buying a new laptop or Chromebook</a>. But other back-to-school products aren&rsquo;t quite as obvious. They might seem purely optional&mdash;stuff you buy if you have money to throw around.</p>



<p>But don&rsquo;t be so quick to ignore tech accessories, especially if you&rsquo;re often zigzagging across a college campus. Add in part-time work and the demands of a social life, and the right gear can help you keep your sanity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="laptop-stand">Laptop stand</h2>

<p>A laptop stand will not only free up desk space, but improve the ergonomics of your setup. You want your laptop screen at a height that prevents hunching or bad posture, especially if you often have long study and homework sessions. It also makes a dual-screen setup with a separate monitor less awkward. The great thing is that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop+stand&amp;crid=3VBISLOEU3AGJ&amp;sprefix=laptop+sta%2Caps%2C287&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">laptop stands aren&rsquo;t expensive</a>, and you can even pick up <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Silicone-Foldable-Ventilated-Tablet-Black/dp/B08G84P8ZX/&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">an ultra compact one</a> that travels well. Take it from an old person&mdash;caring for yourself now is wise, because your body adds up your discomfort over time and hands you a fat bill later on.</p>

<p>Cable clutter can be a real downer&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re stuck in a tiny room shared with another person. A Bluetooth keyboard with multi-device support streamlines your desk space and also lets you hop quickly between a PC, tablet, and phone. A good lightweight option like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098JPSVKY&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Logitech MX Keys Mini</a> can also be taken on the go, too.

<p>A good pair of noise-canceling headphones can help you keep focused as you study, while also maintaining the peace inside a crowded home or dorm. (No need to argue if everyone&rsquo;s content.) Over-the-ear cans have longer battery life&mdash;the top models like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-45-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B098FKXT8L&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bose QuietComfort 45</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH/ref=sr_1_3?crid=M4Y5K51QXSL2&amp;keywords=wh-1000xm5&amp;qid=1690351274&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=wh-1000xm5%2Celectronics%2C133&amp;sr=1-3&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.c3015c4a-46bb-44b9-81a4-dc28e6d374b3&amp;th=1&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> get between 20 to 30 hours runtime&mdash;making them better for long playback sessions and situations where you can&rsquo;t charge as often. Even models that cost half as much, like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Cancelling-Headphones-Comfortable-Bluetooth/dp/B0B5VHRX7F/&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Anker&rsquo;s Soundcore Space Q45</a>, will run as long and still sound pretty good.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, ANC earbuds travel extremely well, making them easy to tote around for shorter but more frequent trips out of the house. And you have no end of choice, with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B0B4PSQHD5/&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://wf-1000xm5&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sony WF-1000XM5</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0BDHWDR12/&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Apple AirPods Pro</a> just a few excellent options at the top end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A dedicated tablet can be put to use in a number of different ways&mdash;a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526926/how-to-turn-tablet-into-a-second-pc-monitor.html">second screen for your PC</a>, a digital notepad for keeping up with class lectures, a comfortable way to read textbooks.

<p>One of the worst feelings in the world is losing your keys or other vital items while out and about. Not because someone took them, but because you got distracted while visiting many different locations in a day and you can&rsquo;t remember where your stuff went. For high-priority gear, attach a Bluetooth tracker like an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0933BVK6T/&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Apple AirTag</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2WLRWX/&amp;xcust=2-3-2008219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tile Pro</a>.

<p>Most everything gets saved to cloud storage these days, but as antiquated as it may seem, having a local backup can save your bacon. You can accidentally delete a file unknowingly&mdash;either off your PC or in the cloud (or both, if they sync with one another). You need a backup, and while you can use a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">cloud service specifically meant for that purpose</a>, an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">external hard drive</a> is cheaper over time <em>and</em> readily accessible, even when your internet&rsquo;s out.

<p>You&rsquo;ll sometimes end up away from an outlet longer than expected&mdash;plans can change rapidly during a day, either due to school and work obligations, or because social opportunities come up suddenly.

<p>Switching between a PC, streaming stick, gaming console(s), and other devices hooked up to your TV or PC monitor can become tiresome if you do it often enough. Plus, you usually have only a limited number of HDMI ports to start with, especially on budget displays. An HDMI switcher can eliminate these problems&mdash;everything routes through the switcher, which takes just one port on your display and usually auto-switches between active devices.

<p>If you live in cramped quarters, having a dedicated spot for everything helps avoid clutter and chaos. Getting things off the surface of your desk can do a lot to reduce visual noise, too.

<p>From one bookworm to another: You don&rsquo;t want to bring a collection of books with you to the dorms. I mean, you probably do. But the joy of being surrounded by old favorites and new acquisitions is going pale against the royal pain of taking them home at the end of the year. If you&rsquo;ve never had to move frequently, books are their own special torture. They&rsquo;re heavy and hard to carry when packed up, but you won&rsquo;t want to give any up.</p>



<p>The better option: Invest in an e-reader, like a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552166/amazon-kindle-vs-kindle-paperwhite.html">Kindle</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507317/kobo-libra-2-review.html">Kobo</a>. You&rsquo;ll still give your eyes a break from staring at LCD screens, but you won&rsquo;t have to worry about physical shelf space. Will it feel as good as having paper in your hands? No, but being able to store hundreds of books in a slim, pocketable device is a decent trade-off. Plus, if you sign up for your local library&rsquo;s Overdrive service, you can gorge on the written word for free.</p>

<p>From the convertible form factor and 1080p webcam to the spectacular battery life and lovely OLED display, the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 really has it all. The laptop itself weighs 3.66 pounds, which is light enough to take with you from class to class. The display swings back 360 degrees, which is really nice, especially when you want to share notes with a fellow classmate. The 1080p webcam will make you look good during remote sessions and the 13.5 hours of battery life means you&rsquo;ll be able to keep working well into the evening hours. Let&rsquo;s take a quick peek at the hardware inside.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1360P CPU, Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s more than enough power for writing papers, watching YouTube, working on collaborative class projects, and much more. The 16-inch AMOLED touch display features a resolution of 2880&times;1800 and a refresh rate of 120Hz. That means visuals should be both smooth and vibrant. Overall, this is one killer laptop. If you&rsquo;re looking for a laptop with powerful hardware and plentiful features, then the Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 is one to consider. </p>

<p>If you regularly use Google apps, you should consider picking up the Acer Chromebook Spin 514, as it&rsquo;s a phenomenal productivity machine based on ChromeOS. The design is chic and durable, and processor performance is quite zippy. It&rsquo;s designed to handle most day-to-day tasks like checking email, working on documents, or using web-based apps. The keyboard and touchpad are a joy to use as well. According to our reviewer, the Spin 514 has a &ldquo;wide keyboard layout with large, easily located keys.&rdquo; As for the hardware, it&rsquo;s got a decent amount of power for a Chromebook.</p>

<p>The Spin 514 is packing an AMD Ryzen 5 5625C CPU, AMD Radeon graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage. The display, which folds back 360 degrees, has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and is touch-enabled. It&rsquo;s plenty sharp for general use. Contrast and color performance are adequate, too. The $699.99 price tag is a little steep for a Chromebook, but if you&rsquo;ve got the money to spend, then you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. </p>

<p>With its affordable price point, solid build, decent performance, and excellent battery life, the Acer Aspire 3 is a good budget option for students. While the aesthetics are a bit bland, the build is surprisingly rugged. During our testing we were surprised by its solid and durable feel&mdash;this is not some cheap plastic kids toy, but rather a rugged machine built for work. The full-size keyboard is nice, too. It has a spacious layout, which is perfect for longer typing sessions. Performance is fast enough for general-use tasks like writing emails and browsing the web, but that&rsquo;s about it. If you&rsquo;re shopping around for a solid everyday laptop that won&rsquo;t break the bank, the Aspire 3 is definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>Want the attractive design, incredible efficiency, and great performance of a MacBook Pro but in a Windows device? Well, the HP Dragonfly Pro comes about as close as you can get to Apple&rsquo;s line of premium laptops. HP partnered with AMD to create this slim laptop that packs the latest generation Ryzen 7 processor with 8 high-performance cores and a surprisingly powerful Radeon 680M graphic card. The laptop&rsquo;s design is thin and attractive with a high quality feel made from aluminum and polycarbonate. However, just like the MacBook Pro models, this laptop takes a minimalist approach to ports, making those who rely on a bunch of plug-in accessories to feel a little hard done by. The display is nice enough, but it does have some catching up to do if it hopes to rival Apple&rsquo;s best. Still, for a laptop that is significantly cheaper than the current line of MacBook Pro models, this Dragonfly Pro laptop from HP is a more than worthy competitor.</p>

<p>When it comes to&nbsp;gaming laptops, many, if not most, of them are pretty bulky and heavy, often tipping the scales at five or six pounds. Well, that&rsquo;s not the case with the XPG Xenia 15 KC. It weighs a little over four pounds, which is fairly lightweight for a gaming laptop. Plus, it runs very quiet. According to our review, it &ldquo;rarely makes noise under normal use.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s impressive, as most gaming laptops tend to sound like a rocket blasting off. If you&rsquo;re looking for something that&rsquo;s both quiet and portable, the Xenia 15 KC is an excellent choice.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, it&rsquo;s up to task of all your productivity tasks as well. With the XPG Xenia 15 you can follow up a hard day&rsquo;s work with a fun and rewarding gaming session.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a college student working with a modest budget, and you like the idea of a big screen to spread out on, the Acer Swift 3 is a fantastic option. It features an attractive 16-inch 1080p display, a solid chassis, and an satisfying keyboard and touchpad. However, battery life isn&rsquo;t great, so you&rsquo;ll want to keep the charger on hand. This is rather unfortunate, as the Swift 3&rsquo;s slim profile makes it an agreeable laptop for travel. If you don&rsquo;t mind the lackluster battery life, this is a great laptop for watching movies and streaming video on, in addition to its more academic-oriented functions.</p>

<p>The Vero 514 is Acer&rsquo;s latest from their eco-friendly line of Chromebooks. The eco-conscious buyer can rest easier knowing the Vero 514 is built from recycled materials, meaning you&rsquo;re reducing your carbon footprint. It also sports some pretty good hardware for the price too. From strong Core i5 CPU performance to a surprisingly bright 1080p display, this Chromebook has more to offer than just being environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>All of these things and more make the Vero 514 a great everyday laptop. Its only real downside is that is has weak speakers, but that&rsquo;s not surprising as laptops aren&rsquo;t really known for their audio quality anyways. And while ChromeOS limits you to web-based apps and activities, that&rsquo;s true of any Chromebook. These minor nitpicks don&rsquo;t take away from a well-performing Chromebook that&rsquo;s both affordable and sustainable.</p>

<p>Chromebooks are a college student&rsquo;s best friend&mdash;reliable, lightweight, and affordable. But they might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you want a gaming computer. Thankfully, Lenovo has made gaming more accessible to Chromebook users with its IdeaPad 5 Gaming. It comes with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a bright 16-inch 2560&times;1600 display. Plus, in a rarity for any type of laptop, the speakers are surprisingly good.</p>

<p>If those specs seem good, but not enough to game with, don&rsquo;t worry. Gaming on a Chromebook is done mostly, if not entirely, through a cloud gaming service anyways. For only the monthly fee of one of these services, you&rsquo;re able to stream the very best modern games straight from the cloud to your Chromebook. When testing this Chromebook we even found that we could stream AAA games at good resolutions and up to 120Hz. That&rsquo;s pretty impressive for a laptop that costs less then a third of what you&rsquo;d pay for a more powerful Windows gaming rig. For more on which cloud gaming services are our favorites, check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html">best cloud gaming services</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li>



<li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li>



<li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li>



<li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li>



<li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life. </li>



<li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li>



<li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. </li>



<li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. </li>



<li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-laptop-for-college">What to look for in a laptop for college</h2>



<p>The first thing to consider is budget. How much are you willing to spend on a laptop? If you&rsquo;re working with an inflexible budget, Chromebooks are a good option. They&rsquo;re affordable and designed to handle everyday tasks like writing papers, working on spreadsheets, and so on. Chromebook prices can range anywhere from $200 up to $1,000. If you want to spend a bit more, laptops with convertible touchscreens (otherwise known as 2-in-1s) offer a great deal of functionality. You can flip the screen around and use it like a tablet or prop it up like an easel for watching movies.  </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a jam-packed schedule, you&rsquo;ll probably be running from class to class with very little downtime in between. That&rsquo;s why we recommend a laptop with a long-lasting battery. We recommend something that&rsquo;ll last 7 to 10-plus hours on a single charge, unless you want a notebook that can play games on the side&mdash;gaming laptops are notorious for their shorter endurance, even during everyday tasks. That 7 to 10 hours is a good figure if you plan on taking your laptop with you everywhere.</p>



<p>Things like navigating your e-mail or watching Netflix will require more RAM. We recommend springing for 8GB of RAM or more. 4GB of RAM is fine and good for web browsing and basic office work, but 8GB is better for having more tabs open and whatnot. Plus, applications like Google Chrome and Spotify tend to eat up a lot of RAM. Most people can get by with 4GB in a pinch if you&rsquo;re on a tight budget, but you won&rsquo;t be able to multitask as much.</p>



<p>The final thing is a decent keyboard. In college, you&rsquo;re going to be spending <em>a lot</em> of time typing. Depending on your personal preference, you may want either a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/557179/full-travel-keyboard-vs-low-travel-whats-the-difference.html">full or short travel keyboard</a>. Mechanical keyboards, for example, normally have longer travel. This helps prevent accidental keystrokes. The keys also give a lot of tactile feedback, as they bounce back after they&rsquo;re pressed down. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-you-use-your-chromebook-for-gaming">Can you use your Chromebook for gaming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Simply put, no&mdash;at least, not well. It comes down to what type of gaming you intend to do. Chromebooks can run web games and Android games perfectly well. But if you&rsquo;re looking to play the latest high-powered titles such as <em>Elden Ring</em>, a Chromebook just won&rsquo;t cut it. This is mainly due to the fact that most titles only run on Windows and Chromebooks typically don&rsquo;t come with sufficient graphics power.</p>



<p>All that said, Google is trying to bring cloud gaming to its Chromebooks. Cloud gaming services work by using a remote PC or console to play games streamed through the cloud down onto the Chromebook. However, until this service becomes more common, Chromebooks are not good options for gaming.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-you-game-with-integrated-graphics">Can you game with integrated graphics?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, recently the the latest integrated graphics processors from the likes of Intel and AMD can handle modern PC games at reasonable settings. For example, Intel&rsquo;s latest Iris Xe line of processors with integrated graphics have been shown to run some of the latest releases at 1080p and 30fps. Be careful, however, as not all integrated graphics are created equal.</p>



<p>Regarding gaming performance, Intel and AMD&rsquo;s integrated graphics have made huge leaps in recent years. So if you&rsquo;re on a budget or looking for an ultra-thin laptop and the only options include integrated graphics, fear not, you can still game on.

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This is mostly personal preference. Students who bring their laptops to class or intend to travel a lot should consider a smaller, more portable size. Anything in the neighborhood of 13 to 14 inches is recommended. However, if you want to use your laptop for gaming, then you should consider something in the 15- to 17-inch range. It&rsquo;s also important to keep in mind the weight of the laptop before buying it. Ultra thin laptops can weigh a featherlight 2 pounds while hefty gaming rigs top the scales at three or four times that&mdash;not exactly something you want to carry in a backpack everyday.</p>

## AMD’s Ryzen 9 7945HX3D brings speed-boosting V-Cache to gaming laptops
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/2007902/amd-ryzen-9-7945hx3d-3d-v-cache-to-gaming-laptops.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2007902/amd-ryzen-9-7945hx3d-3d-v-cache-to-gaming-laptops.html)

<p>What do you get when you combine AMD&rsquo;s fastest mobile processor, Dragon Ridge, with its killer performance-enhancing desktop technology, 3D V-Cache? The AMD Ryzen 7945HX3D, which AMD claims to be the world&rsquo;s fastest laptop gaming processor.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a claim that AMD can back up. The Ryzen 9 7945HX3D performs substantially faster than the existing 7945HX, the flagship <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">&ldquo;Dragon Ridge&rdquo; processor AMD announced</a> at CES 2023 in January. In general, the 7945HX3D&rsquo;s performance ranges from about equal to the 7945HX to a stunning 44 percent to 53 percent faster for games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> as well as <em>Riftbreaker</em>.</p>



<p>Essentially, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394646/how-amds-3d-v-cache-can-increase-ryzen-performance-by-up-to-25-percent.html">AMD&rsquo;s 3D V-Cache takes a giant chunk of cache RAM</a> and mounts it to the top of the CPU die, using a modular architecture called chiplets. The additional cache stores frequently accessed instructions close to the main CPU die. If a game needs to access those instructions, the larger at-hand cache means that it can do so quickly. Otherwise, it would have to search for them from the PC&rsquo;s main memory. Put <em>extremely</em> simply, it&rsquo;s the difference between keeping a serving bowl of food on the table at dinner, versus walking into the kitchen for additional helpings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 9 7945HX3D appears to run at the same frequencies as the 7945HX: 2.5GHz base, or up to 5.4GHz while boosted. Like the 7945HX, it&rsquo;s a Zen 4 chip. The 7945HX3D contains 16 cores and 32 threads, while operating at &ldquo;55W+&rdquo; thermal design power, according to AMD. (AMD specifies the 7945HX at between 55 and 75W of power.) The key difference, of course, is the cache: a total of 144MB of cache, 64MB more cache than the 7945HX.</p>



<p>Gamers or laptop makers don&rsquo;t have to run the 7945HX3D at full power. AMD shared a slide showing that the chip can improve performance by 22 percent at just 40W, and by 11 percent at 70W, compared to disabling the V-Cache entirely. (At the lower power, the V-Cache allows the 7945HX3D&rsquo;s CPU output to catch up to the discrete GPU, putting them more in sync and increasing overall performance compared to the 7945HX, an AMD spokesman said. At 70W, the additional power helps the 7945HX catch up, lowering the performance improvement that the V-Cache provides.)</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s the games, though, where the additional performance will matter. Here&rsquo;s how AMD sees the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D stacking up to the 7945HX. (You may need to open the image in a separate tab and zoom in to see the fine detail.)</p>
