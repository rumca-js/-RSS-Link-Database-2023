In today's Daily Fix:
Activision STILL hasn't announced what this year's new Call of Duty will be, but even more signs are pointing to Modern Warfare 3. The latest piece of intel: a new event coming to Warzone 2.0 that will introduce what CoD 2023 is, and it will feature Shadow Company, the PMC-turned-antagonists from Modern Warfare 2. And speaking of Warzone, three new operators are coming to the battle royale and Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer: Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage. In other news, don't bother with the Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart PC port if you're not running an SSD, and Masahiro Sakurai, the longtime director of the Smash Bros. series, can't see himself NOT working on the franchise.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem reviewed by Tom Jorgensen.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem oozes confidence, energy, and heart, and the animated adventure represents a new high for the Turtles on the big screen. Top-notch voice acting, anchored by Jackie Chan’s Splinter and four instantly lovable teen Turtles, plus a killer Reznor and Ross score ensure that Mutant Mayhem isn’t getting by on looks alone. Even if the superhero tropes the story plays with feel worn, the enthusiasm with which Mutant Mayhem tackles them always wins out.

Dracula has been feeding. Check out this creep clip from The Last Voyage of The Demeter, an upcoming movie starring Corey Hawkins (In the Heights, Straight Outta Compton) as Clemens, a doctor who joins the Demeter crew, Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones, The Nightingale) as an unwitting stowaway, Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans) as the ship’s captain and David Dastmalchian (Dune, the Ant-Man franchise) as the Demeter’s first mate. The film also stars Jon Jon Briones (Ratched, American Horror Story), Stefan Kapicic (Deadpool films, Better Call Saul), Nikolai Nikolaeff (Stranger Things, Bruised), and Javier Botet (It films, Mama).

Based on a single chapter from Bram Stoker’s classic novel Dracula, The Last Voyage of the Demeter tells the terrifying story of the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to carry private cargo—fifty unmarked wooden crates—from Carpathia to London. Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship. When the Demeter finally arrives off the shores of England, it is a charred, derelict wreck. There is no trace of the crew. 

From DreamWorks Pictures and the producers of Zodiac and Black Swan, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is directed by André Øvredal (Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark, Trollhunter), from a script by Bragi F. Schut (Escape Room), Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Zak Olkewicz (the upcoming Bullet Train), based on the chapter “The Captain’s Log” of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. 

The film is produced by Brad Fischer and by Oscar-nominated producer Mike Medavoy and Arnold Messer for Phoenix Pictures and is executive produced by Matthew Hirsch.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter opens in theaters on August 11, 2023.
