<p>Former US president faces four more charges in classified documents case amid speculation that a January 6 indictment could come today</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is squarely in the cross hairs of federal prosecutors, who yesterday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/27/trump-mar-a-lago-classified-documents-case-carlos-de-oliveira">added new charges</a> to the indictment brought against him in June for allegedly hiding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. It is also possible that today, special counsel <strong>Jack Smith</strong> will unveil a new indictment against the former president related to his actions on January 6. Last week, Trump said he had received a letter formally telling him he was a target in the investigation and yesterday, his lawyers attended a meeting at Smith’s offices – both signs that an indictment could be near.</p><p>No former president has faced the sort of legal problems Trump is in, but there are also no signs yet that they’ve dented his standing among Republicans. He continues to lead polls among the party’s presidential candidates, and plans to spend this weekend rallying supporters in Erie, Pennsylvania. We’ll see if Washington has anything to say about the ongoing investigations against him today.</p><p><strong>Congress</strong> has left town for its summer break, but only after the Senate passed a version of a crucial defense funding bill without the contentious provisions over abortion, transgender care and other culture ware issues that the House inserted in its version. This legislation must pass, and expect a big fight over it when lawmakers get back to work in September.</p><p><strong>All the main Republican candidates</strong>, including Trump, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, <strong>Tim Scott</strong> and <strong>Mike Pence</strong> will this evening speak at the Iowa GOP’s Lincoln Dinner.</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> is heading up to Maine to promote his economic record, before flying to Delaware for a weekend on the beach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jul/28/trump-classified-documents-charges-indictment-jan-6-politics-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

A controversial politician finds his bank account with a bank catering to the ultra-wealthy has been closed.

He thought it was his political views that were behind the decision. But a later BBC story claimed it was a lack of funds, not his beliefs, behind the closure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/28/why-does-nigel-farages-bank-account-matter-so-much">Continue reading...</a>
