If we're being honest, there have been a lot more low points for the MCU's TV shows than high points. But when the MCU has been good on TV, it's been <em>really</em> good.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The range of quality among TV series in the MCU spans the full spectrum from absolutely embarrassing to best-of-the-decade good--sometimes even over the course of a single show. And the passage of time has also changed our perspective on some of the older series in particular. Some of those shows on Netflix, for example, actually hold up very well next to the newer and more expensive series on Disney+, which have tended to be pretty messy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another flashy new MCU limited series, Secret Invasion, has now wrapped up. Let's take a look at our rankings of the MCU on TV and see how the Samuel L. Jackson series stacks up. Oh, and just so you know: every single one of these series is now on Disney+.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Inhumans</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171459-marvelinhumans.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While the cast was actually very decent, the show itself looked awful and hokey from the very start. And on top of that, it was a network show--Inhumans had almost no chance of being any good. The nail in its coffin, though, was the plan to also show the premiere episode on IMAX screens. When your show looks that cheap, making it much bigger isn't a good idea.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Iron Fist Season 1</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171461-ironfistseason1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The two seasons of Iron Fist are so dramatically different in quality that they need separate entries. The first season was the low point of Netflix's slate of Marvel shows--it played things very straight and lacked any self-awareness about how goofy of a character Danny Rand is. The result was a nearly unwatchable slog.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. The Defenders</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171462-theddefenders.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Netflix tried its hand at an Avengers-style crossover with its street-level Marvel heroes, complete with Sigourney Weaver as the baddie--and it ended up having so many humongous plot holes that it felt like they had forgotten to upload one of the episodes.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171463-falconandwinterzemo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>There's a new, crappier Captain America who publicly murders people with the shield, Sharon Carter is now an evil crime lord, Zemo is suddenly a silly, non-serious character, and we've got bad guys who have completely valid and important complaints that are never truly addressed. But at least Sam Wilson got to solve America's problems by giving a heartfelt speech over the corpse of the dead villain, who was actually a refugee teenager.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Moon Knight</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171465-moonknight.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We only know that Moon Knight is in the MCU because we were told it is--it has no crossovers, cameos, references, veiled allusions, or any sense at all that superheroes exist. And on top of that, it's got a lot of very unconvincing CGI, and a profoundly annoying performance from Oscar Isaac.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Secret Invasion</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171467-secretinvasiongravik.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This spy series gave us a fully self-contained story about an invasion of shapeshifting aliens that told a story that went nowhere and contained no major plot twists (is it actually a spy show if it has no real twists?), has no apparent connection with any other ongoing MCU storyline, and doesn't appear to have any relevance to The Marvels, the next MCU movie that will feature Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Is there actually any reason to watch this?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Agents of SHIELD</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171468-agentsofshield.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>There was always something kind of sad about the \"s--t rolls downhill\" nature of Agents of SHIELD tried as hard as it could to pretend like it was part of the cool kids' club even though the movies were <em>never</em> going to even look sideways at it. At least it had the decency to actually do spy movie stuff sometimes, unlike Secret Invasion--but it was still always very much a network TV show.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Luke Cage</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171469-lukecage.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Luke Cage worked much better as a floater character on the other shows than he fared on his own series, which went in a lot of different directions but never really found one that it could settle on. And then, just when it was getting interesting at the end of Season 2, the whole Marvel on Netflix situation was shut down.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Ms. Marvel</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171473-msmarvel.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Its heart is undeniable and Iman Vellani is a real find, but Ms. Marvel felt cheap, and the very standardized look of the show clashed with its attempt at giving the MCU some Bollywood flavor. Kamala deserved a better introduction than this.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. WandaVision</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171471-wandavision.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The evolving sitcom format of this series was a legitimately interesting aesthetic concept. But the plot ultimately couldn't sustain that format, and by the time it was all over, nothing really made sense anyway. Remember how this series brought in Evan Peters, who played an alternate version of Wanda's brother in the X-Men films, purely as a red herring joke for the audience, which has no in-universe meaning at all? Who knew that bit would foreshadow the utter lack of connectedness that has plagued the MCU ever since?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Loki</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171472-lokiandsylvie%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>Like the trickster himself, this series is more flash than substance. It promised a smart and heady sci-fi story, but never actually tried to be one. Fortunately, Season 1 of Loki has so far just been irrelevant lore to the rest of the franchise--it's a \"how the universe came to be\" story that has no direct tie to any current happenings, and it's a casting reveal for Kang the Conqueror--so there hasn't been any reason to watch it anyway.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Hawkeye</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171474-hawkeyeandkate.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld are fun and have a great rapport as the core duo in this story, which is a solid little crime story for the most part. But the ending with Kingpin felt like a late-stage reshoot that the rest of the series wasn't fully able to accommodate--and so the whole affair ends up feeling off.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Daredevil</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171475-daredevilandelektra.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>The original Marvel series on Netflix always had at least a little too much going on--it was burdened with being the origin of this small-scale version of the MCU. But the mysteries were compelling, and the action was </span><em>great. </em><span>If we're being totally honest: Most of the best fight scenes in the entire MCU happened on this series.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Jessica Jones</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171476-jessicajones.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>This noir thriller series was always fascinating, and Krysten Ritter crushed it as the curmudgeonly drunk detective. Season 3, which was the last Marvel season on Netflix, went well off the rails in search of Jessica's origin story and certainly didn't give us a satisfying conclusion, but on the whole, this series remains a unique experience in the MCU, and one of the most emotionally sincere ones.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Iron Fist Season 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171477-ironfistseason2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>After the obnoxious mess of that first season, Iron Fist pivoted hard in Season 2 by taking a lighter, B-movie tone that took Danny Rand less seriously, had much better fights, and took the story in an awesome new direction by stripping the power of the Iron Fist from Danny and giving it to Colleen Wing--and with Danny picking up some super cool chi-powered energy pistols. I bet Season 3 would have been a lot of fun.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. What If\u2026?</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171478-marvelwhatif.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>A frustrating amount of the MCU over the past five years or so has teased cool and fantastical concepts only to distill them down to some kind of cliched, mass-appeal theme that handwaves away any meaningful discussion of the cool sci-fi stuff--I'm looking at you, Quantumania. Without having to deal with the restraints of canonicity and overall franchise coherence, though, What If\u2026? gets to actually follow all the way through with some really cool and really weird ideas. And that makes most of it worth watching.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Agent Carter</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171480-agentcarter.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span>This spin-off series, about what happened with Peggy Carter after Stever Rogers went missing in 1945, isn't a particularly great series in a vacuum--it was very good for a network TV series, but it was still a network TV series. But in a franchise with </span><em>so much</em><span> stuff, you can get pretty far just on being something different. And a spy thriller TV show set in the 1950s is pretty different.</span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. She-Hulk</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171481-she-hulk.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Likewise, She-Hulk is a fourth-wall-breaking sitcom with an immensely likable lead in Tatiana Maslaney. I doubt I would have ever asked for a show like this one, and I don't even know that I would call it essential viewing. But it's clever, it's fun, and it tells a coherent story that wraps up in its own unique way--and that hasn't happened often in the MCU recently.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The Punisher</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4171482-thepunishersho.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's the most awesomely violent corner of the MCU, and it actually manages to deal with trauma with a level of care that other pieces of the MCU have never been able to. By Season 2, the series has the air of a group therapy session--our pals Frank, Dinah, Billy, Curtis, and more work out their issues while occasionally taking a break to have some kind of graphically violent action sequence. There's a sincerity to this show that doesn't exist anywhere else in the TV portion of the MCU aside from Jessica Jones.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mcu-tv-show-ranked-from-agents-of-shield-to-secret-invasion/2900-4822/", "date_published": "2023-07-28T21:22:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Chucky And New Exorcist Movie Join Halloween Horror Nights Lineup At Universal Studios", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Universal has unveiled new details for this year's Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood.

For Barbarian, Blizzard is looking to improve how it feels to play the class in the early game by increasing Fury generation for its basic skills and increasing the damage done by abilities like Rupture and Charge. In the late game, Blizzard is revamping some of the Barbarian's Unique items and Legendary Aspects to make them more effective and attractive. For the Unique changes, Blizzard is simply improving the base damage and stats of items like Hellhammer and Fields of Crimson, while also replacing less-desirable affixes with ones that are more in demand.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the Sorcerer side of things, Blizzard is looking to improve their late game survivability, where many in the community currently believe the class struggles. Many Sorcerer mechanics currently revolve around giving players a major buff, but with a negative side effect. Blizzard is looking to remove many of those negative effects and make it so Sorcerer players can revel in their power without too many repercussions.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-update-1-1-1-will-bring-big-buffs-to-barbarian-and-sorcerer/1100-6516392/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-update-1-1-1-will-bring-big-buffs-to-barbarian-and-sorcerer/1100-6516392/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-28T19:07:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Final Fantasy 14 Is Finally Coming To Xbox In Spring 2024", "description": "<p>At the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox consoles in Spring 2024.</p><p>Producer and director Naoki Yoshida made the reveal at the event, along with Microsoft's Phil Spencer joining him on stage.

It turns out, though, that the streaming service arms race to acquire new content fits in right at home as a plot point on the Starz series, with Jack Spade (Stephen Amell) and his group of wrestling misfits doing all they can to make it to a national stage on a fictional streaming service. This particular development means some significant growth for at least one character, Ace Spade (Alexander Ludwig).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to GameSpot in June, before the SAG-AFTRA strike, Ludwig teased, \"I think what I love about [Season 2] is it's setting up where I hope this show will go. 'What is this? What are these two people from the middle of nowhere, and this family in the middle of nowhere, what do they become when their promotion is on a national stage and Ace's character is on a national stage?

It's an action-packed ride that never ceases to throw as much at you as you can handle, so you'll need to head into battle well-equipped.</p><p>Of course, all of that shooting leads to plenty of looting, too. There are tons of weapons to find and upgrade that can complement whatever archetype combination you're working toward on your character, and while melee is a viable option for plenty of builds, it's really the guns that will keep you alive and kicking in many encounters.</p><p>Which guns serve you best may depend on precisely what you're trying to accomplish, since some will benefit from specific rings, amulets, or mods you have equipped, as Remnant 2 is a game that leans heavily into synergy. But even so, there are some guns that stand out among the rest due to their versatility or overwhelming power.</p><p>We've compiled our choices for the seven best guns in Remnant 2 below. In addition to telling you why we think they're great picks, we'll also give you info on how you can add them to your collection of armaments. Even if you don't intend to use them right away, building up a solid arsenal is never a bad thing, so make sure you track these down just in case.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cube Gun</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4171373-remnant2_20230728123301.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Cube Gun is an excellent sidearm to bring along if you don't want to worry much about ammo--and that's because you don't need to find any. This unique weapon fires its five shots and then returns them to you soon after, meaning all you need to think about is making sure it never overheats. Its weapon mod also grants you a very helpful shield that can absorb up to 500 damage, making it a wonderful tool to have in certain difficult encounters.</p><p>To get the Cube Gun, you'll first need to get your hands on the Conflux Prism by defeating the Labyrinth Sentinel boss during the campaign. This is unmissable, so you won't have any issues snagging it along your adventure. Take the Conflux Prism to McCabe to craft the Cube Gun.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alpha-Omega</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4171394-remnant2_20230728123335.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If you're good at landing shots consistently, Alpha-Omega may be a very strong option for you. Its most important feature is undoubtedly its Beta Ray weapon mod, which will brand targets it hits. When those enemies die, they leave behind a brand where they fell, and reloading or swapping guns will cause that brand to explode and deal damage to surrounding foes. AOE damage is rad.</p><p>Adding Alpha-Omega to your arsenal will require you to defeat Annihilation, Remnant 2's doozy of a final boss. It won't be an easy fight, but afterward, you'll obtain the Forgotten Memory, which you can take to McCabe to craft Alpha-Omega.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nightfall</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4171374-remnant2_20230728123517.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Nightfall is a deadly weapon on its own, but it requires you to make use of its Dreadwalker weapon mod to reach its full potential. This mod can be activated to make you shift into the Nightmare Realm for 10 seconds, during which time the gun becomes fully automatic and you gain infinite ammo, a 35% increased fire rate, and 10% lifesteal. Additionally, being in the Nightmare Realm will make you harder to hit.</p><p>To obtain Nightfall, you'll need to defeat The Nightweaver in Losomn, which will be the final boss of a playthrough of that biome when the storyline includes the Sanatorium. After defeating the boss, you'll receive the Cursed Dream Silks, which you can take to McCabe in Ward 13 to craft Nightfall.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MP6o-R</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4171368-remnant2_20230728123320.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The MP60-R is arguably the game's best secondary gun simply because of its ease of use and high damage potential. A blistering fast firing rate makes it excellent with any mod that applies status effects or additional damage per bullet. Other options may outclass the MP60-R in very specific scenarios, but few can be as consistently useful as this one.</p><p>The MP60-R is found in the room that you open with the key found in Ford's chest in Ward 13. You can follow our guides for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-how-to-unlock-fords-chest-in-ward-13/1100-6516130/\">how to unlock Ford's chest</a> to round it up.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deceit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4171367-remnant2_20230728123510.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Deceit is an amazing gun for those who prefer a marksman approach to combat. Though it sports a small magazine, each shot will be certain to deal some hefty damage to your foes. This makes it great for the Hunter class, but it can work fine with any archetype.</p><p>Obtaining Deceit requires you to kill one of the two bosses at the end of Losomn on a playthrough of that biome that includes the storyline regarding the imposter kings. When you're faced with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-should-you-pick-faelin-or-faerin/1100-6516346/\">whether to choose Faelin or Faerin</a>, just be sure you choose to kill Faelin.

Though it's best used in short- to medium-range encounters, its large ammo capacity allows you to keep the hurt coming, making it awesome against bosses whose limited windows for attacking can make reloading a liability.</p><p>The Chicago Typewriter is an extremely well-hidden weapon that you'll find in the same room as Leto's Stash. However, it's well-worth the effort to snag it and should be viable for nearly any build in the game, so follow our guide for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-how-to-find-letos-stash/1100-6516241/\">how to find Leto's Stash</a> and snag this gun along the way.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>XMG57 \"Bonesaw\"</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4171376-remnant2_20230728123750.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The XMG57 \"Bonesaw\" is an absolute powerhouse. It comes packing a massive clip that allows for continuous fire, and it becomes more accurate the longer you keep shooting it. Because it can be fired for so long without interruption, it's an amazing option to pair with the Hot Shot weapon mod--which is our pick for the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-best-weapon-mod-to-get-first/1100-6516057/\">best weapon mod to buy first</a>--so you can really rack up the damage.</p><p>This gun is the starting weapon for the Medic archetype, but it can also be purchased from Brabus in Ward 13 at any point in the story. The ability to buy it early in the game and begin upgrading it right away makes it an excellent choice for nearly any build looking to dish out substantial damage, especially when considering how well it pairs with Hot Shot.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/remnant-2-best-guns/2900-4821/", "date_published": "2023-07-28T16:26:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto Reveals Bane-Sized Twist In Journey To Directing DC's Blue Beetle", "description": "<p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">When filmmaker Angel Manuel Soto received a call from Warner Bros. about potentially directing a DC comic book film, he was prepared to present a completely different idea.
