One of a long series of laws written to limit police officer accountability has been not only rejected by a federal judge, but also the cops it was supposed to &#8220;protect&#8221; and Arizona&#8217;s top prosecutor.

It’s no secret that Elon Musk is desperate for advertisers to return to the platform.

Here’s Part Two of my two parter about the Satanic Panic-level moral panic that has befallen the disconnected-from-reality California legislature (in a bipartisan way) as they seek to destroy the internet “to protect the children). In my previous post, I covered the opening remarks by California Senator Nancy Skinner in support of her bill, SB [&#8230;]
