## Reframed: Marilyn Monroe review – a persuasive look at the icon’s ferocious intelligence

<p>She read James Joyce. She wrote about predatory men. She questioned pay disparity. Jessica Chastain narrates an all-female documentary about Monroe’s overlooked intellect</p><p>From the much-imitated Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend routine and the white dress billowing over a subway grate, to entertaining the US troops in Korea and JFK’s Happy Birthday, there are few people who could claim to be unaware of Marilyn Monroe’s legacy. But Reframed: Marilyn Monroe suggests that, actually, you might not know cinema’s greatest icon quite as well as you think. If you look closer, examine all the details and hold them up to a different light, these fragments might just tell another story.</p><p>That’s the premise of this thoughtful and analytical four-part documentary, which first appeared in the US last year, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Monroe’s death at 36. It puts forward alternative versions and interpretations of what we think we know about her life and career. Was she the blond bombshell, the tragic victim, the passive, exploited young starlet chewed up and spat out by the Hollywood machine? Or was she an intellectual, a woman ahead of her time, a pioneering power broker when female stars had little power to barter with?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/28/reframed-marilyn-monroe-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This series about a philandering electrical store owner is set in the 90s, and is full of lines that channel the Dinnerladies creator’s material. It’s a pale, if decent enough, imitation</p><p>The Power of Parker is a new comedy drama, set over a few days in 1990, about the implosion of businessman Martin Parker’s carefully built, nicely managed and altogether very pleasant life. He (played by Conleth Hill) is a respected member of the community who runs his late father’s successful electrical superstore. He has been married to Diane (Rosie Cavaliero) for 25 years, has a son and a daughter who are no trouble and they all live in a large, immaculate new-build with a pillared porch in a <em>nayce </em>part of town.</p><p>The only downside – apart from his decidedly un<em>nayce</em> father-in-law Dougie (George Costigan on fine, if unhygienic, form) – is that the business was more successful when his father was running it and Martin is in hock to local villains, the Slater brothers, for an amount that keeps getting further and further out of his reach. So it unfortunately becomes time to end things with Kath (Sian Gibson, also the series’ co-writer, with Paul Coleman), his mistress of 25 years, to avoid paying her rent on the flat above the abandoned butcher’s shop in which he had generously installed her when times were good.</p><p>The Power of Parker aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/28/bbc-the-power-of-parker-review-90s-set-comedy-drama-victoria-wood-vibes">Continue reading...</a>

Marnus Labuschagne edged the very next delivery, Joe Root took a wonderful catch at slip and a couple of hours later it was 185 for seven.

He said, ‘If you touch my bails I’m flipping them straight back.’ So he gave me an immediate warning.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/28/its-an-aussie-change-of-luck-thing-broad-explains-bail-flipping-incident-england-ashes-fifth-test">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new report has highlighted the shortcomings of an employment support system too focused on policing benefit claimants</p><p>Following the introduction of Britain’s first labour exchanges in the early 20th century, debates soon took place that might sound familiar to modern ears. Those tasked with helping unemployed people back to work would do a better job, wrote one Ministry of Labour official in 1929, “If they were told to cease bothering about ‘where you were last Tuesday’ and to devote themselves to finding out what they could do to help the claimant in his quest for work”.</p><p>This pithy observation is cited in a <a href="https://www.employment-studies.co.uk/commission" title="">report</a> published this week by the Institute for Employment Studies (IES) and the Financial Fairness Trust (FFT), which comes to a similar conclusion. After extensive consultation with business groups, work coaches, jobseekers and policy wonks, the reports’ authors found a consensus that if modern jobcentres are to be fit for purpose, an emphasis on “empowering people rather than monitoring them; enabling rather than threatening them” is required.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-britains-failing-labour-market-punishing-the-victims-doesnt-work">Continue reading...</a>

One graphic designer <a href="https://twitter.com/Anna_Dillon/status/1684093196647690241?s=20" title="">thought</a> the new logo “unwelcoming and threatening”.

Donald Trump is running for president in part because he sees a return to the White House as a literal get-out-of-jail-free card: reinstalled in the Oval Office, he would be able to pardon himself for the mounting pile of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/27/trump-mar-a-lago-classified-documents-case-carlos-de-oliveira">serious federal crimes</a> for which he is indicted. His legal strategy is his political strategy.</p><p>But the exemplar of the phenomenon is the man who was Trumpian before Trump: the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. It is Netanyahu – and the war he is currently waging against his own country – whom all those who care about the wider future of democracy should be watching. For Israel has become the test case in the global fight against ultranationalist populism.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## No for an Answer review – touching moments but Blitzstein’s ‘play with words’ offers at best curiosity value

<p><strong>Arcola theatre, London</strong> <br />Part of Grimeborn opera festival, Marc Blitzstein’s 1941 work has here an economical production and strong and committed cast, but it’s no forgotten masterpiece</p><p>Thirteen years ago, the Arcola theatre marked its 10th anniversary with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/28/the-cradle-will-rock-review">a staging of Marc Blitzstein’s agit-prop musical The Cradle Will Rock</a>. Now its director, Mehmet Ergen, has pursued his fascination with this elusive, intriguing US composer by presenting, for the first time in Europe, the stage work that <a href="https://marc-blitzstein.org/">Blitzstein</a> went on to compose after Cradle, the “play with music” No for an Answer, as part of this summer’s <a href="https://www.arcolatheatre.com/grimeborn/">Grimeborn</a> opera season.</p><p>No for an Answer received its premiere, semi-staged, in New York in 1941. Though some admired it – Aaron Copland thought it “one of the most original works in that form composed in this country” – the first run only lasted for three nights, and the work subsequently received only one further performance before Blitzstein’s violent death in 1964. But on the evidence of the Arcola performance, energetic though that is in Ergen’s economical production, this is not a neglected masterpiece. Too many of the 20-odd numbers in the score seem effortful, their word-setting awkward and the dramatic pacing uncertain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/28/no-for-an-answer-review-arcola-theatre-marc-blitzstein">Continue reading...</a>

She was wearing baggy torn jeans and a white vest, her beauty was captivating but in no way intimidating, she exuded warmth and kindness. We talked about Abba and what we listened to in our teens. She loved me telling her about all the early Smiths gigs in Manchester. I never made the gig that night.

## I’m secretly a Coutts customer but for people like me there’s little point

<p>You need to be rich to take advantage of the actually useful stuff – I hide my card and just use my Monzo </p><p>As someone with a Coutts account, maybe the least relatable aspect of the Nigel Farage story is: <em>why would you publicise your Coutts account</em>? I spent years developing the muscle memory to hold my thumb precisely over the brand name any time I take my card out; the telltale online banking icon is tucked safely away in the elephant’s graveyard of the fourth page of apps on my phone; I’ve never volunteered the information to a soul. But all it takes is one suspicious friend to wonder why you’re always putting your card the wrong way up when you split the bill and everyone you’ve ever met is mocking you for it within a week. That tiny stringed instrument you’re plucking at is making a horrible noise, incidentally.</p><p>Officially, Coutts requires that you have at least £1m in investments or borrowing, or £3m in savings, to bank with it. (You will remember that this was the version of the Farage story leaked to the BBC before he obtained the internal memo that revealed the reality.) This is, emphatically, not my situation, which does rather corroborate Farage’s suggestion that the bank picks and chooses when it applies those rules.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/28/im-secretly-a-coutts-customer-but-for-people-like-me-theres-little-point">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From package cruises to beach bars, the holiday gig circuit is a way of life for some performers. But does it satisfy them creatively?</p><p>Sloppy Joe’s Bar stands on the corner of Greene and Duval, Key West’s main drag, where much of the Florida island city’s commotion takes place. On an early Saturday evening in April, the mayhem was already well under way: barefoot bachelorette parties, zigzagging golf carts, all of the boisterousness, board shorts and muscular calves so particular to the American vacation spirit.</p><p>In the former fisher’s bar, once beloved by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/ernesthemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, the crowd was in holiday mode – sun-pinkened and half-dressed, ordering more pitchers of beer to buffer their fried pickle chips and conch fritters.

Do you even want to drink riesling – or, indeed, any wine – for 31 days?</p><p>Also, what’s the point? Well, the way these kinds of promotions work is this: generic bodies support independent merchants to promote their wines at certain times of year, which, given the current hard times (particularly with the duty rises due in August) is good for the indies. It tends usually to happen with wines that are more difficult to persuade people to buy, so you won’t get a champagne month, for instance, but riesling, and especially German riesling (pronounced <em>reece-ling</em> not <em>rice-ling,</em> in case you wondered), has always been a hard sell.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/28/its-time-for-a-riesling-rethink-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

## Forgotten fantasy: after 11 years, Dragon’s Dogma makes an unlikely return

<p>Director Hideaki Itsuno and producer  Yoshiaki Hirabayashi guide us through the rebirth of Capcom’s fantasy epic on PlayStation 5</p><p>Capcom has made some of the world’s most famous games, but you’d be forgiven for not knowing Dragon’s Dogma. While the house of Street Fighter shifts millions of games via the furious fists of Ryu and co, the shuffling undead of Resident Evil and beast-felling Monster Hunter, its Xbox 360 medieval RPG simply came and went in 2012. Yet much like the heroes that Dragon’s Dogma depicted, over the years, this once underloved adventure’s stature only grew in legend.</p><p>This peculiar game saw players cast in the role of a chosen hero, pursuing an apocalypse-heralding dragon – accompanied by a little AI buddy that you designed yourself, known rather harshly as a Pawn. Dragon’s Dogma is one of the last decade’s best-kept gaming secrets, because what at first appears to be rather generic fantasy quickly reveals itself to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-dragons-dogma-is-a-janky-weird-ageing-rpg-and-everyone-should-play-it">delightfully weird</a>. Those who gave it a chance 11 years ago came away enraptured by its quirky charm. An expanded version, Dark Arisen, arrived in 2013, but the announcement of a full sequel was a very pleasant surprise for fans. Its creators are just as delighted that it’s happening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/28/forgotten-fantasy-after-11-years-dragons-dogma-makes-an-unlikely-return">Continue reading...</a>

The news was <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/lelia-goldoni-shadows-alice-actress-dies-obit/">first reported by the Wrap</a>, who said that her manager JD Sobol announced that she died on Saturday at the Actors Fund Home in Englewood, New Jersey.</p><p>Goldoni had become involved with Shadows as a result of the acting workshop Cassavetes had started in 1956 – before which, according to Cassavetes, she had no professional acting experience. The film itself arose from an improvised audition sketch Cassavetes had performed for acting guru Lee Strasberg about two black siblings who “passed” for white. Having elaborated the idea into a full-length film, Cassavetes asked Goldoni to play the sister to brothers Hugh Hurd and Ben Carruthers; her character became the central figure of the film with her new boyfriend (played by Nicholas Ray’s son Tony) is startled to discover her family’s ethnicity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/28/lelia-goldoni-star-of-john-cassavetes-shadows-dies-aged-86">Continue reading...</a>

## A bleated ‘maaate’ is no answer to misogyny – and not just because it’s unstoppably cringe | Jason Okundaye

<p>In the mayor of London’s campaign, fighting sexism is reduced to a low-stakes nudge, devoid of discomfort or consequence </p><p>Research from the mayor of London’s office suggests that there is a latent desire among a majority of men <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/media-centre/mayors-press-release/mayor-launches-major-new-campaign-to-empower-men-and-boys-to-say-maaate-to-their-mates-and-challenge-sexism-and-misogyny">to intervene</a> when they witness misogynistic behaviour. Two in three men wish to step in but do not feel that they have the language or tools to take action, according to the study. That there are some men who would welcome an opportunity to develop best practice around intervention is worth taking in good faith – addressing a lack of accountability among male social groups should certainly figure within broader strategies to prevent violence against women and girls.</p><p>The repeated failure of men who genuinely abhor misogyny to speak up and intervene, whether when overhearing casual sexist comments or witnessing sexual harassment, can be attributed to many things: herd mentality, discomfort, fear of backlash or ostracisation, or simply not knowing what to say. It is not necessarily a complex issue – you’d be forgiven for having zero patience for men who are bystanders – but it is one that requires careful engagement and a strategy that poses serious cultural challenges to male socialisation. Does the mayor of London truly believe that “Maaate” is that challenge, or a sufficient solution?</p><p>Jason Okundaye is a London-based writer and researcher</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/maaate-misogyny-cringe-mayor-london">Continue reading...</a>

It dominates the skyline, eclipsing the Peloponnese hills behind. A monumental amphitheatre, with seats for almost 10,000 people, this is where the ancients gathered from the 4th century BC onwards and where the crowd is almost full to capacity on this summer night. While other parts of the nation broil in alarming heat, here there is an airy mountain breeze and pin-drop silence as a production of Medea, by the German director Frank Castorf, plays out.</p><p>It is not what the traditional crowd is accustomed to: combining Euripides’s text with excerpts from Heiner Müller and Arthur Rimbaud, it features not one murderous mother in Medea, who kills her children as revenge against her unfaithful husband, Jason, but five actors (Stefania Goulioti, Sofia Kokkali, Maria Nafpliotou, Angeliki Papoulia, Evdokia Roumelioti) who appear simultaneously on stage as different versions of her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/28/athens-epidaurus-festival-ancient-greek-naked-chorus-orgy-refugee">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Editors like me are accused of ‘brainwashing’ children. But I simply strive to bring books into the world that let trans children know they aren’t alone</p><p>Every day, there’s a new, terrible development from those attempting to restrict trans life. From laws in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia that are denying trans-related healthcare to minors (and in some cases, adults), to federal laws restricting trans inclusion in sports, to a law in Tennessee that’s expected to be replicated in other states, which would charge publishers with a class 3 felony for publishing books for children that they deem “obscene” (which probably means having queer- and trans-related content, in their eyes), one doesn’t have to look far to see the actions of those who would bar trans people from public life, or any kind of life.</p><p>At the center of a lot of the LGBTQIA+ debates have been books that introduce young people to the ideas of queerness and transness. These books have been banned in some states, taken off library shelves in others, decried by rightwing pundits who think teaching children about natural variations in life such as transness is “corrupting” them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/childrens-books-lgbt-transgender-acceptance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a particular style of desert boot to a lost blend of tea, our writers mourn the products they once treasured that have been cruelly discontinued</p><p>For some time I have been consumed by the thought that I no longer like bananas because I’m hankering for an extinct variety I tasted only as a small child. This didn’t occur to me until I read – maybe 10 years ago – that the universally grown Gros Michel variety disappeared due to blight, to be replaced by the now universal, and allegedly less good, Cavendish, sometime in the early 1960s. Recent research suggests there are a lot of people out there with a kind of obsession for this lost banana.

<p>This is a busy time for your garden, and it’s easy to become overwhelmed. Focus on a few essentials and the rest will take care of itself</p><p>At the height of summer the garden can be unwieldy. If all is going to plan, your plants will be growing enthusiastically and your veg patch will be offering up crops that need harvesting most days. It’s the apex of the growing season but it can feel overwhelming at times. So I find it helpful to focus my energy on a few key activities at this busy time.</p><p>I’m often asked for advice on watering, yet there’s no easy answer to this question because, as with so much in the garden, it depends. How much water is determined by the weather (principally the temperature), whether it’s rained and how breezy it is, because wind can be drying. If I’m not sure whether watering is necessary, I stick my finger into the soil to check if it’s moist – in its fourth season of no dig, my veg patch is fairly moisture retentive. A generous drink a couple of times a week is preferable to a little-and-often approach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/28/its-peak-growing-season-heres-how-you-can-help-your-plants-thrive">Continue reading...</a>

Hard for a film to lampoon profligacy while simultaneously wallowing in it.</p><p>It’s up to the hard-hitting Bengali TV journalist Rani (Alia Bhatt) to bring him down a peg or two when they join forces as impromptu matchmakers. Rocky’s grandfather (Dharmendra), who hasn’t been compos mentis since a nasty fall years earlier, has recently started calling out a woman’s name. This turns out to be Rani’s grandmother (Shabana Azmi), who spent a blissful week with grandpa at a poetry symposium (no, really) back in the 1970s. In the process of getting the old lovebirds back together, the young ’uns fall for one another despite the intellectual chasm between them. Or as Rani puts it: “A protein shake in one hand and your shirt wide open and my heart got in the way.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/28/rocky-aur-rani-kii-prem-kahaani-review-karan-johar-ranveer-singh-alia-bhatt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four people offered me shoes in a week during the last cold spell</p><p>It all started about three years ago, when I met up with my son in a park. He’s very outdoorsy and it was the first time I’d seen him barefoot – he likes the way it feels on grass, but doesn’t do it all the time. I found it funny, so I took my shoes off to give it a go. It was as though I’d discovered an extra sense. Afterwards, I wanted to keep it up, but not only in parks. I’m an all-or-nothing kind of guy.</p><p>The plan was to go without shoes for as long as I could, at least from spring until mid-October when it got too cold. But we had a very mild autumn last year and I love a challenge, so I thought: can I keep going?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/28/experience-ive-walked-around-london-barefoot-for-a-year">Continue reading...</a>

## Jaws wasn’t a documentary – why do shark sightings provoke such panic? | Hannah Rudd

<p>You’re more likely to die taking a selfie than in a shark attack: as oceans warm, we need to get used to close encounters</p><p>Silly season is upon us and sharks are dominating the headlines again. As a marine conservationist, if I see another headline along the lines of “Menacing man-eating shark lurking off the coast of Britain” accompanied by a photo of a basking shark – a species that exclusively consumes plankton – I think I might scream.</p><p>It seems all a shark needs to do these days is push its dorsal fin above the ocean waves and panic immediately ensues. Just this week, that’s exactly what happened off the <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/French-news/Watch-Commotion-as-shark-spotted-near-beach-in-southern-France">French coast</a>.

## Understated dressing is overrated – here’s how to dial up your look  | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion

<p>Your outfit is your hello to the world. Appearing interesting and fun means thinking a bit beyond the plain T-shirt </p><p>Understatement is overrated when it comes to getting dressed. This is a controversial opinion – an unfashionable one even – in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/02/how-to-get-the-quiet-luxury-look-without-the-vulgar-price-tag" title="">year of quiet luxury</a>. But before you reach for yet another white T-shirt, hear me out.<br /><br />Clothes are an opportunity to let people know who you are. Why waste that opportunity? Most of modern life seems to be everyone shouting over each other and no one listening to what anyone else has to say, but every time you get dressed, you get to introduce yourself to the world, on your own terms, without having to interrupt anyone. Your outfit says hello even before you say a word.</p><p>I get it, the appeal of understated clothes. Of course I do. Timeless classics, in neutral colours, are a useful fallback when you are just looking to fit in and be accepted. A little black dress at a party, simple tailoring at the office, a pastel dress at a wedding: these are all safe, effective strategies when all you are aiming for is not to look like a fish out of water.<br /><br />But there are lots of times where we can aim a tad higher, on the first-impression stakes, than to reassure people that we are allowed in the room/won’t frighten the horses/are a safe pair of hands. What I mean is that “she looks as if she’s probably fine” sets an unnecessarily low bar for social interaction. What would you like people to think, when they see you? Take the initiative. Maybe you’d like them to think you look interesting. Maybe you’d like them to think you look sophisticated, or fun, or powerful, or sexy. What you wear can do all of those things.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/28/understated-dressing-is-overrated-heres-how-to-dial-up-your-look">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Australian author on escaping with Papillon, avoiding The Trial, and rolling with The Dice Man</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><strong><br /></strong>The Magic Faraway Tree by Enid Blyton was my first book without pictures; I was seven, at school in England. What hooked me was a concept: a ladder poked through the clouds at the top of a tree. Above was a world where laws and norms were different, where you could cavort like an innocent – but after a time, an unsettled wind blew in and swept the land away. I still find this describes our passage through seasons of life.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><strong><br /></strong>One that strangely haunted me was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/miller">Arthur Miller</a>’s play Death of a Salesman. The mix of delusion and family dysfunction was compelling. By way of salute, the boy in my novel Vernon God Little namechecks the play’s Studebaker as his life spins out of control.</p><p>Meanwhile in Dopamine City is published by Faber.

## Lance Gurisik: Cull Portal review | John Lewis's contemporary album of the month

<p><strong>(33 Side/Pias)</strong><br />Gurisik’s startling album – think Aphex Twin meets Keith Jarrett – combines jazz, electronica and contemporary orchestral music to compelling, coherent effect</p><p>Cull Portal slowly mutates in various directions. Analogue synths burble; intense meditative improvisations develop on the piano; pastoral string sections fade in and grow more harmonically complex; wispy saxophones spray modal jazz riffs over coruscating digital drones; live drums and electronic breakbeats occasionally disrupt proceedings. Imagine Tangerine Dream, Keith Jarrett, Vaughan Williams and Aphex Twin all playing concurrently, but still managing to create a coherent and compelling composition.</p><p>Lance Gurisik is a conservatoire-trained Australian composer and occasional commercial jingle writer who has returned to Sydney after many years in London. Most of this LP was recorded in isolation, under lockdown, using a vintage Yamaha CS-80 analogue synth, an acoustic piano, and a remotely-recorded string ensemble. The centrepiece is an 18-minute triptych entitled Cull, where the same rising chord sequence is repeated across three tracks in very different ways – as a glistening babble of synths, as a Bill Evans-style piano improvisation, a Wayne Shorter-ish saxophone freakout, a densely written pastoral string arrangement and eventually a morass of squelchy synth and electric piano textures. The next three tracks – Portal, Limbo and Quanta – create a similar trilogy by repeating a hypnotic two-chord phrase, first as a clanking, discordant industrial electronic riot, then a series of shimmering ambient drones and eventually a funky broken-beat groove.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/28/lance-gurisik-cull-portal-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After her brother was caught up in the Bataclan siege, Winocour wanted to address the events that had scarred France. She explains why she focused on the aftermath, not the violence</p><p>Even from the safety of her home, the film-maker Alice Winocour’s experience of the Paris terror attacks in November 2015 was terrifying. Her younger brother, Jérémie, was hiding in a back room at the Bataclan concert hall, and forbade her from texting him in case it gave away his location. She had to wait to hear that he made it out alive. Later, he told her about a random thought he had while waiting to die: that he had left a half-eaten yoghurt open in the fridge.

## ‘It helps I wasn’t a big cycling fan’: Claire Steels’ unlikely climb to the top

<p>The British rider is still in her first year on the World Tour but has made a strong impression in the Tour de France Femmes</p><p>Claire Steels never really planned to ride in the Tour de France. The Lincolnshire-born rider didn’t even become a professional cyclist until 2020, yet now she is the leader of the Israel-Premier Tech Roland team, racing in this year’s Tour de France Femmes.</p><p>Steels is one of the peloton’s late bloomers. Her Spanish-based fitness company was doing well enough, but when she branched into duathlon, she fell for cycling. “I bought a bike to compete in duathlons in Mallorca,” she says. “But then I started training more on the bike and I realised how much I loved it. So I fell into cycling, really. Then last year I was at a point where I needed to make a decision on whether I was going to join a World Tour team, so I could afford to live off a cycling salary and stop work.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/28/cycling-tour-de-france-femmes-claire-steels">Continue reading...</a>

## Joni Mitchell: At Newport review – years melt away in surprise folk festival recording

<p><strong>(JMA/Rhino)</strong><br />Her poignant return to live performance in 2022 gets a full release, and it’s a hit-filled show displaying Mitchell’s enduring warmth and wisdom</p><p>Joni Mitchell’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/25/joni-mitchell-gives-first-full-live-performance-since-2002">surprise appearance</a> at last year’s Newport folk festival marked the singer-songwriter’s first time at the festival in 53 years, and her first live appearance since a near-fatal 2015 aneurysm that led to fears she’d never perform again. Thankfully recorded for posterity, the tapes capture her friend Brandi Carlile’s excited introduction to whoops of amazement from the crowd, many of whom were in tears, plus an 11-song setlist including many of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonimitchell">Mitchell</a>’s greatest hits. She’s ably supported by a cast of musicians, including Carlile’s band and Marcus Mumford, some of whom who occasionally share the vocal load.</p><p>Brooklyn indie foursome Lucius do the heavy lifting on Big Yellow Taxi. Carlile and Taylor Goldsmith take the lead on the likes of Carey and Amelia, but Mitchell plays the electric guitar instrumental Just Like This Train flawlessly and jokes about how 1976’s Hejira album was written on a road trip without a driving licence. She duets A Case of You with Carlile and audibly takes control as the show progresses. Her voice is slightly deeper than it was, with a rich timbre indefatigability earned through lived experience. George Gershwin’s Summertime offers a rueful backwards glance. The years melt away for The Circle Game. Both Sides Now has the poignancy of a 79-year-old singing words she wrote aged 23. It’s not sung regretfully, but warmly, in the knowledge that life’s sunshine and storms are what make us who we are.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/28/joni-mitchell-at-newport-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This wild and witty takedown of 21st-century America is narrated by a big cat stalking LA</p><p>The celebrity mountain lion known as P-22 was trapped and euthanised because of illness last year, after more than a decade stalking Los Angeles. P-22 was a metaphorical powerhouse: the American dream, human rapaciousness, immigration, fame, Hollywood masculinity – was there anything he couldn’t stand in for? His memorial service sold out in minutes; he kept many US journalists in gainful, precarious employment; and a version of him stars in Henry Hoke’s Open Throat<em>.</em></p><p>In Hollywood, cats have pronouns and this one’s are they/them, making Open Throat the best book narrated by a genderqueer feline you’ll read this year. This is a one-sitting novelette, an instant classic of xenofiction, with copious line breaks, sketchy punctuation and plenty of leonine misunderstandings – “scarcity” is rendered as “scare city”, “LA” as “ellay”, money is “green paper”. In a worse novel it would cloy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/28/open-throat-by-henry-hoke-review-inside-the-mind-of-a-queer-mountain-lion">Continue reading...</a>

Flash-flooding resulted, leading Novia Scotia to declare a two-week state of emergency last Saturday. At least three people died in the floods, up to 600 had to evacuate their homes, and power cuts affected a further 80,000.</p><p>Storms began on the Friday (21 July) and continued into Sunday, with some areas seeing three months’ worth of rain – about 250 mm – in the space of 24 hours. It had already been a particularly wet summer for Nova Scotia. The provincial capital, Halifax, had its third wettest June on record, receiving more than double the amount of rain that had fallen in the three months prior.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/28/weather-tracker-parts-of-canada-record-three-months-of-rain-in-a-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Scotland’s largest recorded mass stranding struck this summer, volunteers swung into action. Here they recall the hard work … and the heartbreak</p><p>At 8.13am on Sunday 16 July, Màiri Carrey was wondering how to celebrate her wedding anniversary when her phone buzzed.

<p>Builders’ waste is the perfect base for a low-maintenance, biodiverse front garden, filled with drought-tolerant flowers, grasses – and fewer weeds </p><p>Four years ago, I moved into a terrace house in Bristol. It hadn’t been touched in years: a 1960s time warp with woodchip wallpaper, brown carpet in the bathroom and polystyrene ceiling tiles. Under the shadow of a pebble-dash facade, the front garden was a small patch of grass with one sad hydrangea. The grass was on compacted clay, which became waterlogged in winter and dry like asphalt in summer, making it difficult to grow anything but the toughest shrubs.</p><p>After stripping out the property and adding a kitchen extension, I was left with builders’ waste strewn across my garden and piled up in sacks<em>. </em>Rather than order another skip, I decided to turn my front plot into a rubble garden.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/28/hardcore-landscaping-how-to-grow-a-garden-on-sand-gravel-and-concrete">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Automation is causing many casualties. Technology marches on, but there’s a yearning for moments of precious connection</p><p>Rejoice, rejoice: the railway ticket office may yet be saved for the nation. Or more likely, it’s at least earned a brief reprieve. After a public outcry against plans to shut booths staffed by real live humans, train operators have <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2023-07-26/ticket-office-closure-consultation-delayed-as-train-users-rejoice">relented and extended</a> what was a suspiciously short three-week consultation.</p><p>Passengers will now have until September to make their point, shifting the exercise from a seemingly done deal to something at least vaguely pretending to be an open question, and hopefully allowing the voices of anxious disabled passengers in particular to be heard. It’s a victory, too, for anyone still foxed by the mad complexities of British train ticketing or forced by the general chaos, cancellation and delay towards the battle-scarred veterans of the ticket office, invariably the only people in the station who seem to know what’s actually happening. But beyond that, it sheds some light on how we all might like to be treated in an age of rapid automation.</p><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/humans-train-ticket-self-service-app-automation">Continue reading...</a>
