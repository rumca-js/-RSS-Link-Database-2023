<p>'Twitters swift rebrand to X is generating yet another issue. As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twitters-rebranding-to-x-triggers-microsoft-edge-security-alert/">reported by <em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, the social media platform is causing Microsoft's Edge browser to throw up a warning, indicating some sort of security problem.</p><p>It seems to be related to how Edge and other Chromium-based web browsers deal with favicons (or 'Progressive Web App Icon Change', if you want to get super technical about it). With the Twitter rebrand being so sudden, Edge likely thinks X is a scam. The security alert prompts users to review the icon update and reads, &quot;If this web app is trying to trick you into thinking it's a different app, uninstall it.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But as <em>Bleeping Computer</em> points out, PWA is working as intended. It is supposed to alert you when a website suddenly changes its favicon as that could indicate a potential redirect to a scam website. Presumably, this is temporary and will be fixed quickly. We've reached out to Microsoft for comment and will update this story once we've heard back.&nbsp;</p><p></p><figure><img alt="An alert from Microsoft Edge suggesting that the Twitter rebrand to X may be a scam." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/52960770-2d7d-11ee-bcff-b48a19b7a6ae" style="height: 337px; width: 688px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Florian / X</div></figure><p>This is similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/indonesia-is-blocking-elon-musks-x-domain-for-its-gambling-and-porn-history-195551771.html">an incident</a>  earlier this week, where X was blocked in Indonesia as it has laws forbidding gambling or porn. The X.com domain's previous owners broke the country's content laws.</p><p>Still, this is yet another indicator of how sudden the Twitter-to-X transition was. Other companies such as Meta and Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-rebrand-to-x-could-worsen-its-legal-and-financial-problems-233914973.html">already own trademarks on variations of X</a>, which could land Musk's company some lawsuits. X even ran into trouble when attempting to change its signage at its San Francisco headquarters, as it didn't have the required <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/police-halt-removal-twitter-sign-company-hq-elon-musk-rebrands-x-rcna96166">permits</a>. The company had to abandon its would-be facelift and leave the old bird logo and the letters &quot;er&quot; intact for a day or so.</p><p>The sudden name change is part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-begins-its-transition-to-x-100901444.html">a larger plan to turn Twitter into a &quot;super app&quot;</a> that's similar to China's popular WeChat. The platform could theoretically be used for payments, messaging and calls in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitters-rebrand-to-x-is-causing-scam-alerts-on-microsoft-edge-203531493.html?src=rss

## Looks like the Zuck vs Musk fight isn't happening

<p>Sad news for fans of billionaires beating the paste out of one another. It looks like the Mark Zuckerberg vs Elon Musk cage match isn’t happening, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/meta-plans-retention-hooks-threads-more-than-half-users-leave-app-2023-07-28/"><ins>exclusive audio heard by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em><ins>.</ins></a> In an audio recording exclusively provided to the publication, the surprisingly buff Zuckerberg told Meta employees at a company town hall that he’s “not sure if it’s going to come together.”</p><p>Zuckerberg’s comments on the match occurred during a company-wide discussion regarding Meta’s recently-launched Twitter rival, Threads, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-users-are-already-spending-less-time-in-the-app-182738755.html"><ins>has been stuttering a bit</ins></a> in the weeks since blasting onto the scene.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuck didn’t actually say the match is off, just that it remains unlikely. So keep that glass half full, fight fans. Musk, who <a href="https://sg.style.yahoo.com/elon-musk-changed-son-name-204701832.html"><ins>loves the letter “X” more than most people love</ins></a> clean air, hasn’t issued a response, but given Zuckerberg’s recent penchant for jiu jitsu, he could be relieved.&nbsp;</p><p>The cage fight was supposed to be a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/get-ready-for-a-zuck-vs-musk-cage-fight-100611527.html"><ins>glitzy Las Vegas affair,</ins></a> with the pair of billionaires dancing around the topics of date and venue for the past month or so. Zuckerberg has seemed pretty serious about the fight from the get-go, and Musk eventually relented, tweeting (x-ing?) that he was “up for a cage match” if the Meta CEO was. Musk also said he has this “great move” called &quot;the walrus&quot; where he lays on top of opponents and does nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>Zuck certainly seemed ready to take on the challenge, according to trainer and <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/15/alex-volkanovski-says-zuckerberg-serious-fighting-elon-musk-mma-ufc/">MMA legend Alex Volkanovsky.</a> And though he generally treated the whole thing as a joke, Musk did sort of prepare for the fight by accepting a training offer from UFC champ Georges St-Pierre and <a href="https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1673836162937417728">sparring with podcaster Lex Fridman.</a> Of course, that's when he's taking a break from retweeting (re-xing?) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-shares-anti-trans-content-twitter-2023-6">hateful anti-trans content</a> and changing the site's rules to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-quietly-reversed-its-policies-to-allow-for-intentional-deadnaming-and-misgendering-181754382.html">allow for misgendering.</a> Dana White, president of the UFC, has also told reporters that the organization was ready to assist with the event.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/looks-like-the-zuck-vs-musk-fight-isnt-happening-195538503.html?src=rss

## 'Final Fantasy XIV' comes to Xbox next spring

<p>It took a decade, but Square Enix's premier massively multiplayer online role-playing game is finally coming to Xbox consoles. The developer has <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1684997073559502848?s=61&amp;t=vls0Gn0JLQy1UaChF3bvkA">revealed</a> that <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> will be available for Xbox Series X/S in spring 2024. Like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ff-xiv-ps5-open-beta-trailer-034523079.html">PS5 counterpart</a>, this version will support 4K visuals on Series X and faster loading times. It's not yet clear if there will be Xbox-only upgrades.</p><p>An open beta is expected for patch 6.5X. In other words, the Xbox port should be ready in time for the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion due in summer next year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ebb1ebcbf5084e1fabac0dbf10db0ad6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">FINAL FANTASY XIV is coming to Xbox. <a href="https://t.co/aDen8UtwRC">pic.twitter.com/aDen8UtwRC</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1684997073559502848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft has been eager to add Final Fantasy games to its catalog. In 2019, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-microsoft-final-fantasy-xbox-game-pass.html">added 10 titles to Game Pass</a> that included many of the releases from <em>VII</em> through to <em>XV</em>. The deluge didn't include <em>XIV</em>, however, leaving Xbox players without an active MMO. The game debuted on PS3 and PC in 2013, with ports for PS4 (2014), Mac (2015) and PS5 (2021) in subsequent years.</p><p>The incentives are clear. <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> helps court fans of the series, particularly those left out by the timed PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5-140058789.html">for <em>XVI</em></a>. It's also an attempt to reach out to both Japanese gamers and JRPG enthusiasts. The Xbox has <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91834/phil-spencer-explains-why-japanese-games-skip-xbox/index.html">struggled in Japan</a> due in no small part to local studios skipping the platform in favor of domestic consoles from Nintendo and Sony. This game won't suddenly improve Microsoft's fortunes, but it does eliminate a barrier to adoption for some players.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-comes-to-xbox-next-spring-192903645.html?src=rss

Though, to be fair, this isn't a toy. The internal tech is identical to a standard Kindle, with a 300 ppi screen, adjustable front light, 16GB of storage and weeks of battery life.

It usually goes for $120, which is $20 more than the standard Kindle, but the sale is knocking it down to just $80, making it a good buy for a kid or even a full-grown adult who enjoys saving money.</p><h2>Xbox Series X</h2><p></p><p>It's been tough to find the new Xbox console in stock, let alone at a discount, but right now the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9taWNyb3NvZnQteGJveC1zZXJpZXMteC1nYW1lLWNvbnNvbGUtNGstaGRyLTEtdGItc3NkLWZvcnphLWhvcml6b24tNS9hcGQvYWM2MjA2NTkvZ2FtaW5nLWdhbWluZy1hY2Nlc3NvcmllcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTNhMTdmNGItMjkzMS00NWE5LTk3ZTItZWE1MWViMjgzZmIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWy9aTJ92mQaoM8kvzVGKSJWd34T6CbiuQpNPOpEVNtx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-x-game-console-4k-hdr-1-tb-ssd-forza-horizon-5%2Fapd%2Fac620659%2Fgaming-gaming-accessories">Xbox Series X</a> is $50 off at Dell.

## Indie games have entered the era of bespoke publishing

<p>For anyone with an eye on video game news, it’s been hard to ignore the recent rise of names like Annapurna Interactive, Devolver Digital, Private Division, Humble, Epic Games and Netflix tied to independent projects. The distribution process for indie developers has shifted over the past few years from a self-publishing-first model, to one that prioritizes deal-making and acquisitions. For the moment, this shift is powering a small but highly visible boom in the world of indie games.</p><p>“I don't think I ever want to self-publish again.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ben Ruiz has been a game developer since 2005, and in that time, he’s pretty much done it all. He founded two studios, he did contract work on titles including <em>Super Meat Boy</em> and <em>Overland</em>, and he independently published a tentpole original project, the monochromatic brawler <em>Aztez</em>. Nowadays, Ruiz is running a five-person studio called Dinogod and he’s building <em>Bounty Star</em>, a game that blends mech combat with life-sim mechanics. <em>Bounty Star</em> is being published by Annapurna Interactive and it’s due out in early 2024.</p><figure><img alt="Bounty Star" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/345dee00-2d62-11ee-af79-59f02475f0a7" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>Bounty Star</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>“Everything favors a publisher relationship, seemingly, because self-publishing has become this extraordinarily difficult thing,” Ruiz said. “It’s possible, but without help, I just don't know how anyone's doing it … I got a lot of friends in the same boat.”</p><p>Ruiz’s career is a microcosm of the shifting landscape for indie developers over the past 10 years. He began working on <em>Aztez </em>in 2010, when Steam was a curated marketplace where Valve employees hand-selected individual games for the platform. This system had fully imploded by 2012: On the heels of breakout hits like <em>Braid</em>, <em>Super Meat Boy</em> and <em>Fez</em>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-14-the-floating-fragile-indie-bubble.html">indie market was overrun</a> by new games and developers, and Steam dropped its curation efforts. It shifted to a community-voting approach called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-09-not-getting-noticed-on-steam-greenlight-incredipedes-story.html">Greenlight</a>, before eventually landing on the everything-goes Early Access model we know today.</p><p>Ruiz and his business partner built <em>Aztez </em>in between contract projects, and by the time it was ready to debut on Steam in 2017, the indie market was saturated. There were 309 games <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/552623/number-games-released-steam/">added to Steam</a> in 2010; in 2017, there were 6,306. Even with a hefty amount of hype behind it, <em>Aztez </em>had trouble standing out, and that was the last time Ruiz tried self-publishing.</p><p>Ruiz did contract work for a while after <em>Aztez</em>, and in 2018 he pitched <em>Bounty Star</em> to people he knew at Annapurna. The game has a complex premise — it stars Clem, a desert bounty hunter with plenty of baggage, and it involves mech battles, emotional narrative scenes and home-management mechanics, including some light gardening. Annapurna bit, and Ruiz landed a publishing deal.</p><figure><img alt="Stray" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/641dcca0-2d67-11ee-9efe-9d606773e731" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>Stray</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>Annapurna Interactive is one of the most prominent publishers of indie games today, with titles like <em>Stray</em>, <em>Outer Wilds</em>,<em> Neon White</em>, <em>Donut County </em>and <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em> on its books. It was founded in 2016 as an offshoot of Annapurna Pictures and quickly established its brand as an arthouse publisher, focused on visually innovative and emotionally driven experiences. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-annapurna-interactives-showcase-here-at-3pm-et-180020145.html">Its showcases</a> are now a staple of the gaming calendar.</p><p>Annapurna is handling the marketing for <em>Bounty Star</em>, and it’s also financially supporting Ruiz’s studio, Dinogod. When Ruiz pitched the game, he was clear that he’d need a team of five or six people to bring his vision to life, and Annapurna gave him the funding to hire up.</p><p>“The fact that Dinogod has five full time people, that was a part of the partnership,” Ruiz said. “When everything was greenlit, that was the first step, to bring in these five or six people…. If [Annapurna is] into a thing that they think is a good move, and it needs more people, that seems to be fully okay. Like, they're not averse to scale.”</p><p>It’s not just Annapurna making these types of deals with indies nowadays. Devolver Digital is the granddaddy of indie publishers, and since 2009 it’s released hits including <em>Hotline Miami</em>, <em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>, <em>The Talos Principle</em>, <em>Gris</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Inscryption</em>, <em>Weird West </em>and<em> Cult of the Lamb</em>, all in collaboration with small development teams. There’s also Humble, Private Division, Raw Fury, Epic Games, Finji, Gearbox, EA and Netflix, all of which have stepped up their indie publishing efforts in recent years. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s strategy is to simply acquire the studios it likes, and today it has 23 developers under the Xbox Game Studios banner. Sony is taking a similar approach, though it owns fewer studios than Microsoft. Microsoft and Sony are also signing hundreds of one-off deals with indies as they attempt to fill their streaming libraries — Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Premium — with a steady stream of new experiences.</p><p>This is the new standard for indie developers: Identify the publisher that best matches your game’s tone, pitch it, and pray. Even established studios, such as <em>Device 6</em> creator Simogo, have swapped to a publisher-first model. Simogo’s latest projects, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> and <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, are the result of its partnership with Annapurna.</p><figure><img alt="Sayonara Wild Hearts" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/92d48430-2d62-11ee-ba53-bedd364b129f" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>Sayonara Wild Hearts</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>“I think for us as a studio, the biggest change is working with a publisher, something which we would see as completely uninteresting and impractical ten years ago,” Simogo co-founder Simor Flesser <a href="https://www.engadget.com/simogo-tries-to-explain-the-mysteries-of-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-161941692.html">told Engadget</a> earlier this month.</p><p>And then there’s Netflix. The streaming company officially entered the game-distribution business in 2021, and it’s on track to have 100 titles in its library by the end of 2023, all freely available to anyone with a Netflix subscription. It’s already brought a number of high-profile titles to mobile devices, including <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>, <em>Poinpy</em>, <em>Into the Breach</em>, <em>Spiritfarer</em>, <em>Lucky Luna</em> and <em>Oxenfree II</em>, and it’s purchased a few studios outright — notably, <em>Alphabear </em>developer Spry Fox and Oxenfree house Night School Studio. The first of these purchases was Night School, which Netflix acquired in 2021.</p><p>“Consolidation — I didn't really have my finger as much on the pulse of that, because when we joined Netflix, it didn't feel like that was happening so rapidly,” Night School co-founder Sean Krankel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-the-oxenfree-ii-team-became-netflixs-first-game-studio-130035607.html">told Engadget</a>. “And now in the last few years, literally, it's non-stop.”</p><p>The acquisition allowed Night School to move into the Netflix offices and it provided stability for the studio overall, Krankel said. With Netflix’s resources, the Night School team was able to add day-one support for 32 languages in <em>Oxenfree II</em>, and they were able to fly in remote collaborators as needed.</p><p>“All that's really exciting,” <em>Oxenfree II</em> lead developer Bryant Cannon said just ahead of the game’s July 12th release. “I think the game is going to be better because we have this battery in our back.”</p><figure><img alt="Oxenfree II" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3c5d6860-2d67-11ee-8def-11e4af4dcd52" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>Oxenfree II</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><p>Outside of acquisitions, Netflix is also signing individual deals with developers. Snowman is best known as the name behind <em>Alto’s Adventure</em> and <em>Alto’s Odyssey</em>, and its latest project is <em>Laya’s Horizon</em>, a serene wingsuit experience exclusive to Netflix. There are two big benefits of working with Netflix, according to Snowman creative director Jason Medeiros: The instant access to an audience of more than 230 million people, and the freedom to build a game without worrying about monetization.</p><p>“You'll notice real quick that the game that you've been playing can't be free-to-play,” Medeiros <a href="https://www.engadget.com/layas-horizon-a-sandbox-wingsuit-game-from-the-studio-behind-altos-odyssey-arrives-may-2nd-150033749.html">told Engadget</a> in April. “Like, where would the ads go? It’s this fantasy world with no currency, even, and all that’s intentional. As the creative director, I didn't want any of that stuff. Because I mean, I liked games before all that stuff happened. So having a platform like Netflix, it's just like, none of that matters. You don't have to do that stuff. It's a breath of fresh air; we jump on opportunities to make games that way.”</p><p>Of course, there are still developers self-publishing their projects — <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Phasmophobia</em>, <em>Celeste </em>and <em>Among Us</em> are all standout examples — but there’s a murkier path to success with this model, one based on timing, trends and a hefty amount of luck. There are more than 90,000 games on Steam today; Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus Premium libraries each have more than 400 titles (and counting). In this marketplace, it’s hard to stand out without a little help.</p><p>It’s taken 10 years to get here, but it’s now a solid, quantifiable fact: There’s a lot of money in indie games. So much money that outside companies are popping up and trying to get a piece of the pie — and for now, it’s created a shiny bubble of pretty PR packages and bespoke showcases dedicated to small teams and their games.</p><figure><img alt="Gris" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0ca7f490-2d63-11ee-bfff-19fdacb4b4bc" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>Gris</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devolver Digital</div></figure><p>It’s difficult to ignore the potential for exploitation down the line, especially with Netflix in the mix. Amid the ongoing writers’ and actors’ strike, the company is facing accusations that it instituted wildly unfair compensation deals for creatives, paying out one-time, minimal wages even as projects became massive hits on the streaming service. Annapurna, for its part, was accused of mishandling claims of abuse at three prominent studios on its publishing roster — Mountains, Funomena and Fullbright — in a March 2022 documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDPzZkx0cPs">People Make Games</a>. Meanwhile, the current consolidation craze is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-2023-and-the-stagnant-state-of-the-industry-163019962.html">shrinking the video game industry</a> overall, even as the market caps of the biggest companies continue to rise.</p><p>For now, bespoke publishing is the name of the indie game. This system has already distributed innovative and important games to huge audiences — <em>Tchia</em>, <em>Tunic</em>, <em>Sea of Solitude</em>, <em>Gris </em>— and it’s offered stability to a lot of independent artists. Like, for instance, Ben Ruiz.</p><p>“I hope Annapurna’s success means more Annapurnas in the future,” Ruiz said. “It doesn’t feel like they’re just trying to grab a thing that will make money or collaborate with people that are just going to make them money. They clearly have a brand and an aesthetic directive … if I can keep making games for them for a long time, I will.”</p><p>The new normal works for Ruiz — and Flesser, Krankel, Medeiros and plenty of others. For now, it’s a functional system, even if it ultimately leaves publishers, rather than independent developers, with most of the power.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/indie-games-have-entered-the-era-of-bespoke-publishing-170639414.html?src=rss

<p>The Primetime Emmys won’t take place on September 18th, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/emmys-airdate-actors-writers-strike-1235681067/">according to</a><em>Variety</em>. The publication reported on Thursday that vendors scheduled to work the event have been told the ceremony is delayed because of the writers’ and actors’ strikes that have shut down all Hollywood productions and promotions. The TV Academy hasn’t yet announced a replacement date, but <em>Variety</em> previously <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/emmys-strike-delay-fox-tv-academy-january-november-1235667092/">reported</a> that broadcast partner Fox tentatively wants to shoot for January 2024. HBO’s <em>Succession</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation-scoops-up-24-emmy-nominations-171117148.html">leads this year’s field</a> with 27 nominations, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-season-one-hbo-review-080135969.html"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> made history with an impressive 24 nods for the video game adaptation.</p><p>Hollywood writers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hollywood-writers-are-officially-on-strike-084059607.html">began striking</a> in early May, while actors joined them earlier this month. Artificial intelligence figures prominently in both cases: Scribes and performers fear producers will increasingly use AI-generated content to diminish humans’ ability to make a living in the already-brutal show business industry. Perhaps the most startling revelation was the report that studios offered a “groundbreaking AI proposal” to pay performers for one day of work to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/striking-actors-say-rejected-ai-proposal-would-let-studios-use-their-likeness-without-fair-pay-000025878.html">use their digital likeness for eternity</a>.

Broadly speaking, the Series X is designed to play games in 4K at 60 fps (though <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/list-xbox-series-x-and-s-games-120-fps-support">some games</a> can go further), while the Series S is aimed more at 1440p or 1080p displays. The Series X also has a disc drive, unlike the all-digital Series S, and it comes with twice as much storage by default at 1TB. You still have to use a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/western-digitals-first-xbox-series-xs-storage-cards-start-at-80-171723507.html">proprietary card</a> to fully expand that storage, however, and the console itself is much larger than its lower-cost counterpart. We gave the Series X a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">review score of 87</a> when it arrived in late 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft itself has had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/343-industries-halo-unreal-engine-202439779.html">its share of struggles</a> producing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redfall-review-good-enough-for-game-pass-000641521.html">blockbuster exclusives</a>, particularly when compared to Sony's first-party output on the PlayStation 5.

## WhatsApp adds Telegram-style video messages

<p>It's now easy to show your WhatsApp friends what you're doing without putting in the effort to create a Story or a similar clip. The service is <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-instant-video-messages">rolling out</a> Telegram-like instant video messages that let you respond in chat with videos up to a minute long. You just have to tap and hold a button to capture footage, and you can swipe up to keep the recording going while hands-off.&nbsp;</p><p>Videos will automatically play on mute, so you shouldn't startle anyone until you're ready to turn on sound with a tap. Like most anything else in WhatApp, the instant messages are end-to-end encrypted to add a layer of privacy. The feature should be available to all users in the &quot;coming weeks,&quot; the company says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This likely won't replace Telegram Snapchat for many people. WhatsApp is still dominant in the messaging space, and driven largely by calls and texts. Even so, the feature might be appreciated if you'd rather not switch apps just to send rapid-fire videos. You can quickly share news when text or an audio message won't cut it, or simply react to a friend with something more personal than a sticker.</p><p>There's an incentive for parent company Meta to act. While WhatsApp has over 2 billion active users as of last year, Telegram is expanding quickly with an <a href="https://www.thinkimpact.com/telegram-statistics/#:~:text=Telegram%20has%20an%20estimated%20700,and%20sits%20right%20behind%20Snapchat.">estimated</a> 700 million active users each month.  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-already-has-3-million-subscribers-172021014.html">Snapchat is still growing</a> despite fierce competition from other social platforms.

While instant video messages might not persuade users to sign up, it might keep WhatsApp fans from drifting toward the competition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-adds-telegram-style-video-messages-141005605.html?src=rss

<p>Ten months after the PlayStation 5 hit store shelves, Sony<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-ssd-storage-expansion-firmware-update-ps4-remote-play-135032853.html"> released a software update</a> that unlocked the console’s storage expansion slot. Originally, the PS5 offered only 667GB of space for storing your games, with no way to increase that. While that was fine for some gamers  (like me), others (like my son) were forced to perform a near-daily juggling act that involved frequently deleting and redownloading games due to the console's low SSD storage space  and the apparent need to have constant access to every Call of Duty game.</p><p>Now, you can increase your PS5’s available storage by installing a standard PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD. If that mess of acronyms has you recoiling, don’t worry, you’ll see that it’s not all that complicated, and if you want to know which are the best SSDs for your PS5, you can skip to the end ​​for our top picks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>How much storage do I need?</h2><figure><img alt="Sony PlayStation 5 gaming console." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/341eb080-1ec1-11eb-bffb-88f330aaaf35" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris / Engadget</div></figure><p>The PS5 will accept drives between 250GB and 4TB in capacity. If you already own a PlayStation 5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience.</p><p>PS5 games are a little smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwii-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-no-russian-170044023.html"><em>Modern Warfare II</em> and <em>Warzone</em><em>2.0</em></a> will require more than 200GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up almost one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on your PS5 internally before running into problems.</p><p>One additional thing to consider is your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work out. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.</p><p>Off the bat, there's basically no point in going for a 250GB drive. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones, and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives, coming in at around $80 to $140, are a decent bet, but the sweet spot for most is to opt for a 1TB drive, which should run you between $160 and $250. That will more than double the space you have available for games without breaking the bank. (Seagate’s official 1TB Xbox Series expansion card, for comparison, sells for <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZWFnYXRlLVN0b3JhZ2UtRXhwYW5zaW9uLVNvbGlkLVN0YXRlL2RwL0IwOEszUzZXSk0_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taWstMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU3NTEzM2RjLThjMTYtNDU5Yi05YmY4LTZmMzg5MmNkN2M3NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWYqA3XdwtIAt__AJTdDj3gF3vqXWgBTdsRt5Of1gaGN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSeagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State%2Fdp%2FB08K3S6WJM">$220</a>.)</p><p>If you have the money, 2TB drives sometimes offer marginal savings per gigabyte, and can often be found when other models are out of stock. Unless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p><p>One final note: While the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB SSD, you'll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games.</p><h2>Can you play PS5 games on external SSD?</h2><figure><img alt="Samsung T5 SSD" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f9a78850-01b4-11ec-bdf1-6047ddc9fc71" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>These come  at a much lower price point  than the high-end internal SSDs, but there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PS4 games, or storing PS5 titles. This is useful if you have anything but the best internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or just want a large number of PS4 games to hand.</p><p>Due to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X6 and Samsung T5 being options we’ve tried and can recommend.</p><h2>PS5 compatible SSD cards</h2><h2></h2><p>The official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are still more things to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.</p><p>For speed, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0f845666-5cc0-42c7-863d-d873ae1b6087&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=PlayStation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZjg0NTY2Ni01Y2MwLTQyYzctODYzZC1kODczYWUxYjYwODciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGxheXN0YXRpb24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3N1cHBvcnQvaGFyZHdhcmUvcHM1LWluc3RhbGwtbTItc3NkLyNtaW4iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU3NTEzM2RjLThjMTYtNDU5Yi05YmY4LTZmMzg5MmNkN2M3NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAc8uKbsYWnTQxryFbJ-m42NXSvrXAQQXVa430BYLCdUs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsupport%2Fhardware%2Fps5-install-m2-ssd%2F%23min">Sony says</a> drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn't match the Gen4 x4 spec.</p><p>In our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet, that doesn’t mean there won’t be games that will be problematic down the line. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec is not huge, and you may as well cover all your bases.</p><p>Slightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most bare SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 42mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.</p><p>It should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive. This previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LPX and Sabrent’s Rocket 4 Plus, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that take care of those considerations.</p><p>That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often much cheaper, and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.</p><p>The only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat. So, head to your PC component seller of choice, and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.”</p><p>One recommendation is this <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IZWF0c2luay1Db3BwZXItQ29wcGVyJUVGJUJDJThDLVNpbGljb25lLVRoZXJtYWwvZHAvQjA3UU5SUDlISz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1pay0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTc1MTMzZGMtOGMxNi00NTliLTliZjgtNmYzODkyY2Q3Yzc3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXHHVFCgcP2am_p2O047u4wyz1ldvhuDHiQrDg4n61Nr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHeatsink-Copper-Copper%25EF%25BC%258C-Silicone-Thermal%2Fdp%2FB07QNRP9HK%3F">$7 copper heatsink</a>, which attaches to the SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and really, performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall including the thermal interface material and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches.</p><p>Now, if all of that was very boring, here are some ready-to-go recommendations:</p><h2>Best PS5 SSD: Corsair MP600 Pro LPX</h2><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlRMk1XMjFGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzUxMzNkYy04YzE2LTQ1OWItOWJmOC02ZjM4OTJjZDdjNzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcyTGBC9fwwm7DX2Oq2ZLPIcMU6xWzj9ECB35LQMD6_r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09Q2MW21F">Corsair MP600</a> Pro LPX makes it to the top of our list for checking all the boxes.

In recent months, the 1TB variant has sold for less than $100 (although it typically comes in at $185), while the 2TB model will set you back about $210.</p><h2>Best affordable PS5 SSD: Crucial P5 Plus</h2><p></p><p>If you want to save a bit of money by installing your own heatsink, a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk4V0w0NlJTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzUxMzNkYy04YzE2LTQ1OWItOWJmOC02ZjM4OTJjZDdjNzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVHvCkzH7Gm5C66C1tyv1WkvUDGPY49hMzy5Bi1HgBfn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB098WL46RS%3F">Crucial P5 Plus NVMe</a> is a great affordable option. With read speeds of up to 6,600MB/s, the P5 Plus is only marginally slower than our top pick, and you can frequently find the 1TB model for as little as $80 when it’s on sale. Expect the 2TB variant to set you back about $180 when on discount.</p><h2>Other great options</h2><h2>Samsung 980 Pro</h2><p></p><p>If you’re not familiar with companies like Crucial or Corsair and want to go with a more recognizable brand, there’s no bigger player in the NVMe space than Samsung. The company recently began selling a heatsinked version of its highly-regarded <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlKSEwzM1g3P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzUxMzNkYy04YzE2LTQ1OWItOWJmOC02ZjM4OTJjZDdjNzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWn9t4ys6TOvV1Pgp-bGOE7PNmPDYrCWehid7Bu7LYCz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JHL33X7">980 Pro SSD</a>. It’s more expensive than some of the other NVMe drives on this list, but not dramatically so. You can expect to pay about $230 for the 1TB model (or around $110 when it's on sale) and $200 for the 2TB version.</p><h2>Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus</h2><p></p><p>Of all the SSDs on this list, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlHMk1aNFZSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzUxMzNkYy04YzE2LTQ1OWItOWJmOC02ZjM4OTJjZDdjNzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc7zgp3E8aAP8Pi8F53B0GQNxpyiEZ9KHPvd5TP2ttUM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G2MZ4VR%3F">Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus</a> is the most interesting. It comes with a unique heatsink that you install in place of the storage expansion slot’s metal cover. Sabrent claims this design improves cooling performance. Pricing falls in line with Samsung’s offering, with the 1TB variant coming in at around $160 and the 2TB model costing $300.</p><h2>PNY XLR8</h2><p></p><p>If Sabrent’s design is appealing to you but you can’t find the Rocket 4 Plus for a decent price when you go looking for one, PNY offers a similar cooling solution with the PS5 version of its <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlZTjZRQzY1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzUxMzNkYy04YzE2LTQ1OWItOWJmOC02ZjM4OTJjZDdjNzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV6HF2Gyua93qBbhOdacfak3yA-XOIH6FQdtAx5z3-Eu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09YN6QC65">XLR8 NVMe</a>.

Western Digital sells a Sony-licensed model of the SN850 that comes in 1TB and 2TB variants. The former should set you back about $180, while the latter costs about $300.</p><h2>How to install an SSD in a PS5</h2><p>Before attempting to add more storage to your PS5, ensure that you have Sony’s latest software installed. Once you're up-to-date, installation of a PS5 SSD is fairly straightforward. Sony recommends a #1 Phillips or crosshead screwdriver, but this isn't rocket science. Any crossed screwdriver of a similar size will do fine.</p><p>Begin by powering down your PS5, unplugging everything, removing the stand and flipping it over to its underside. If you have the regular PS5, that’s the side with the disc drive; if you have the Digital Edition, it’s the side without the PlayStation logo cutout.</p><p>Sony has a video guide to popping off the outside cover <a href="https://youtu.be/CaAY-jAjm0w?t=133">here</a>, but the gist is you gently lift up the opposing corners and slide the panel toward the flat end of the console. There’s a knack to this, and it requires very little effort or strength. If you’re not getting it, rather than force it just readjust your grip and try again. A member of our video team managed to break one of the tabs on our review unit doing this in the past so… yeah, don’t force it.</p><figure><img alt="Sony PlayStation 5 SSD slot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ebf0c2f0-01b7-11ec-afbf-853a752af0d1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you’ve got everything open, you’ll see a rectangular piece of metal with a screw holding it in place. Remove that screw, and you’ll be able to access the drive bay.</p><p>You’ll see five holes inside, each numbered corresponding to the standard SSD drive lengths I mentioned earlier. The one numbered 110 will have a metal insert and screw inside. You need to unscrew the screw with a screwdriver, and then unscrew the insert with your fingers and move it to the relevant hole. Your eyes should tell you which is the right one for your drive, but it’s most likely going to be 80.</p><figure><img alt="PlayStation 5 SSD slot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e67cea90-01b4-11ec-bbfb-4b7c19b43bb9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris/Engadget</div></figure><p>Then take your SSD — mine is a 980 Pro I bought on Prime Day with a $2 piece of aluminum attached to the top — and slot it in. The slot is at the edge closest to the number “30,” and SSDs are keyed to only fit in one way, so again, no force is required. If it’s not sliding in, don’t force it. You’ll notice the SSD doesn’t sit flat — that’s fine, and is as intended.</p><figure><img alt="Sony PlayStation 5 SSD upgrade" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cbfb0a40-01b8-11ec-affd-fd9517dd0c1c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once the SSD is seated, take the screw you removed from the insert, line it up with the little notch at the end of your SSD, and push down so it meets the insert. Give the screw a few turns — it doesn’t need to be very tight — and you’re done.</p><figure><img alt="Sony PlayStation 5 SSD upgrade" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4dcf1fc0-01b9-11ec-a75f-13723fe12887" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Replace the metal cover and screw it down, and then slide the plastic outer shell back on. When you first turn on the PS5, it’ll prompt you to format the drive. Do that! You have now successfully expanded your console’s storage, and can set about downloading and moving games to it. Personally, I moved all of the PS4 games I had to the new drive, along with all of my clips and screenshots. The PS5’s built-in SSD is always going to be the most compliant, so I’m keeping my important stuff there.</p><p>We'll be updating this guide as more SSDs come to market and onto our test bench, so feel free to bookmark it for when you need it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html?src=rss

## Tor’s shadowy reputation will only end if we all use it

<p>“Tor” evokes an image of the dark web; a place to hire hitmen or buy drugs that, at this point, is overrun by feds trying to catch you in the act. The reality, however, is a lot more boring than that — but it’s also more secure.</p><p>The Onion Router, now called Tor, is a privacy-focused web browser run by a nonprofit group. You can <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">download it for free</a> and use it to shop online or browse social media, just like you would on Chrome or Firefox or Safari, but with additional access to unlisted websites ending in .onion. This is what people think of as the “dark web,” because the sites aren’t indexed by search engines. But those sites aren’t an inherently criminal endeavor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This is not a hacker tool,” said Pavel Zoneff, director of strategic communications at The Tor Project. “It is a browser just as easy to use as any other browser that people are used to.”</p><p>That’s right, despite common misconceptions, Tor can be used for any internet browsing you usually do. The key difference with Tor is that the network hides your IP address and other system information for full anonymity. This may sound familiar, because it’s how a lot of people approach <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html">VPNs</a>, but the difference is in the details.</p><p>VPNs are just encrypted tunnels hiding your traffic from one hop to another. The company behind a VPN can still access your information, sell it or pass it along to law enforcement. With Tor, there’s no link between you and your traffic, according to Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University. Tor is built in the “higher layers” of the network and routes your traffic through separate tunnels, instead of a single encrypted tunnel. While the first tunnel may know some personal information and the last one may know the sites you visited, there is virtually nothing connecting those data points because your IP address and other identifying information are bounced from server to server into obscurity.</p><p>In simpler terms: using regular browsers directly connects you and your traffic, adding a VPN routes that information through an encrypted tunnel so that your internet service provider can’t see it and Tor scatters your identity and your search traffic until it becomes almost anonymous, and very difficult to identify.</p><p>Accessing unindexed websites adds extra perks, like secure communication. While a platform like WhatsApp offers encrypted conversations, there could be traces that the conversation happened left on the device if it’s ever investigated, according to Crandall. Tor's communication tunnels are secure and much harder to trace that the conversation ever happened.</p><p>Other use cases may include keeping the identities of sensitive populations like undocumented immigrants anonymous, trying to unionize a workplace without the company shutting it down, victims of domestic violence looking for resources without their abuser finding out or, as Crandall said, wanting to make embarrassing Google searches without related targeted ads following you around forever.</p><p>Still, with added layers of security can come some additional hiccups, like lag or longer loading times. That could be true for some users depending on what they do online, but anecdotally it's gotten a lot faster in recent years, and users have said they barely notice a difference compared to other browsers. Sameer Patil, associate professor at the School of Computing at the University of Utah, studied this by having students and staff try out Tor as their main browser. “I was personally very surprised at how many sites and things just work fine in the Tor browser. So not only did they work as intended, but they also were fast enough,” Patil said.</p><p>But even if online privacy isn’t your main concern personally, using Tor can help support industries that heavily rely on it. By using the anonymous and secure browser, you’re supporting activists, journalists and everyone else’s privacy because the more people that use it, the more secure it gets, according to Patil. If only certain sensitive groups use it, it’ll be easier to deanonymize and ultimately track down identities. When you’re one in a billion using it, that task becomes nearly impossible.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tor-dark-web-privacy-secure-browser-anonymous-130048839.html?src=rss

<p>Samsung made a huge flex this week by hosting its first Unpacked event in Seoul, South Korea (sorry NYC!). In this episode, Cherlynn, Devindra and Senior Writer Sam Rutherford dive into all of Samsung’s news: The Galaxy Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, Watch 6 and Tab S9. Is Samsung playing it safe this year, or is it actually bringing something new to the world of foldables? Also, we discuss Twitter’s rebrand to “X” (<em>sigh</em>), as well as why astrophysicist Avi Loeb is likely wrong about his extraterrestrial alien balls.</p><p>Listen below or subscribe on your podcast app of choice.

## The Morning After: Tesla reportedly formed a secret team to quash driving range complaints

<p>Tesla is facing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-allegedly-formed-a-team-to-quash-driving-range-complaints-164750696.html">allegations</a> that it's trying to minimize complaints about performance. <em>Reuters</em> sources claim the company had a secret Diversion Team in the Las Vegas area to cancel range-related service appointments.</p><p>If a customer complained the range didn't live up to marketing claims, advisors would tell owners that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) range figures were just predictions and battery degradation would reduce range. Tesla supposedly began tinkering with range estimates a decade ago to exaggerate figures when an EV was fully charged. Cars would only begin showing more accurate range numbers below a 50 percent charge. The company also used a 15-mile range buffer when the estimate reached zero, much as combustion engine cars still have fuel in the tank when the gauge reads empty.</p><p>Tesla isn't the only EV company accused of inflating its range estimates, but it may be worse than most. The standards body SAE International recently published a study indicating EVs typically fall 12.5 percent short of their official range in highway driving. One of the co-authors, Gregory Pannone, told <em>Reuters</em> Tesla's shortfall was 26 percent – over double that average. It’s also faced accusations of exaggerating EV driving range in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-tesla-fine-ev-range-disclosure-cold-weather-153655339.html">past</a>.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p>​​<em>You can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</em></a></p><p>​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-testing-verification-labels-for-brands-174640320.html">Reddit is testing verification labels for brands</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mycle-cargo-is-almost-the-longtail-of-the-people-ive-been-waiting-for-130046591.html">Mycle Cargo is almost the cargo bike I’ve been waiting for</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/goodrx-now-offers-an-ios-medicine-cabinet-for-managing-prescription-meds-130002408.html">GoodRx now offers an iOS Medicine Cabinet for managing prescription meds </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-4-pack-falls-back-to-85-075538136.html">Apple AirTag 4-pack falls back to $85</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-pc-games-150000910.html">The best PC games for 2023</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-probes-the-limits-of-redemption-130025700.html">‘Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ probes the limits of redemption </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-drops-two-classic-zelda-titles-for-switch-online-subscribers-160801831.html">Nintendo drops two classic Zelda titles for Switch Online subscribers </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-and-galaxy-z-flip-5-110015244.html">How to pre-order the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5</a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nicki-minaj-will-be-a-playable-character-in-call-of-duty-051544179.html">Nicki Minaj will be playable in Call of Duty</a></h2><h3>Snoop Dogg is already in the game.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nicki-minaj-will-be-a-playable-character-in-call-of-duty-051544179.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ff1bcad0-2d27-11ee-af78-58c05d0f6db4" style="height: 380px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Activision</div></figure></a><p>I’m not sure how much the Venn diagram of <a href="https://nickiminaj.fandom.com/wiki/Barbz">Barbz</a> and <em>Call of Duty </em>players overlap, but here we are. <em>Call of Duty </em>Season 5 will feature Nicki Minaj as the first ever playable female celebrity Operator character.

## Ford expects to reach its EV production goal a year later than planned

<p>Ford will take just a bit longer to reach the electric vehicle production goal it set for itself. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/27/ford-evs-earnings/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> reports, Ford CEO Jim Farley now expects the automaker to be able to start producing 600,000 EV units per year sometime in 2024. The company was originally aiming to reach that production level <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-manufacturing-rate-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-131424727.html">in late 2023</a> with the help of lithium iron phosphate battery packs, which will help Ford cut manufacturing costs and reduce its dependence on nickel and other materials prone to shortage.</p><p>In the company's <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/693218008/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/Ford-Pro-Ford-Blue-Drive-Solid-Second-Quarter-Results-Company-Raises-Expectations-for-Full-Year-2023-Profitability.pdf">earnings report,</a> (PDF) Farley explained that the "[t]he near-term pace of EV adoption will be a little slower than expected," but that he believes it's going to "benefit early movers like Ford." He added: "EV customers are brand loyal and we’re winning lots of them with our high-volume, first-generation products." The automaker's all-electric division did well in the second quarter of the year, with revenue from the first generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-gt-first-drive-video-150011920.html">F-150 Lightning</a> and the Mustang Mach-E vehicles increasing by 39 percent.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ford was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-doubling-f-150-lightning-production-150000-vehicles-per-year-110034432.html">inundated with pre-orders</a> for the F-150 Lightning after it was announced and had to temporarily stop taking reservations due to the demand. The company has recently slashed the vehicle's prices citing increased production capacity, though it could also be because it's looking to entice more customers who are also eyeing models by rivals like Tesla and General Motors.&nbsp;</p><p>Ford CFO John Lawler said "[t]he transition to EVs is happening, it just may take a little longer" and "it will be a little slower than the industry expected." The automaker was also aiming to manufacture 2 million EVs a year by 2026, but this delay affects that goal, as well. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNy9mb3JkLXB1c2hlcy1iYWNrLWV2LXRhcmdldC13YXJucy1vZi13aWRlci1sb3NzZXMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGVkNWMzYTgtY2U1OS00Y2M5LTg5YjYtMWI4YjM0M2M5ZmQ0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeI39HEd49yA-M1ZbZeVK9p78nQ4gZ0-Zj3rDEv7igrO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F07%2F27%2Fford-pushes-back-ev-target-warns-of-wider-losses.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> said Ford now doesn't know when it can reach that level of production, but Lawler assured that the company will still invest the same amount of money into its EV endeavors.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ford-expects-to-reach-its-ev-production-goal-a-year-later-than-planned-101804539.html?src=rss

## Apple cracking down on 'fingerprinting' with new App Store API rules

<p>Apple will soon start cracking down on Apps that collect data on users' devices in order to track them (aka "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-apple-safari-canvas-fingerprinting.html">fingerprinting</a>"), according to an <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RldmVsb3Blci5hcHBsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnRhdGlvbi9idW5kbGVyZXNvdXJjZXMvcHJpdmFjeV9tYW5pZmVzdF9maWxlcy9kZXNjcmliaW5nX3VzZV9vZl9yZXF1aXJlZF9yZWFzb25fYXBpIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMTUzOTAxOS1lMDNjLTRiOTYtODc4My05ZWU5OTZlYTlkMWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVO9Ijn4HAc0LsupWf_lNNXDqZrs9x-LWgxHtcuSOtyT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fdocumentation%2Fbundleresources%2Fprivacy_manifest_files%2Fdescribing_use_of_required_reason_api">article on its developer site</a> spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/27/app-store-describe-app-api/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>. Starting with the release of iOS 17, tvOS 17, watchOS 10 and macOS Sonoma, developers will be required to explain why they're using so-called required reason APIs. Apps failing to provide a valid reason will be rejected started in spring of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Some APIs... have the potential of being misused to access device signals to try to identify the device or user, also known as fingerprinting. Regardless of whether a user gives your app permission to track, fingerprinting is not allowed," Apple wrote. "To prevent the misuse of certain APIs that can be used to collect data about users’ devices through fingerprinting, you’ll need to declare the reasons for using these APIs in your app’s privacy manifest."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new rules could increase the rate of app rejections, some developers told <em>9to5Mac</em>. For instance, an API called UserDefaults falls into the "required reason" category, but since it stores user preferences, it's used by a lot of apps. At the same time, it sounds like Apple will basically need to take a developer's word for reason declarations. If those prove to be false, though, it would certainly have a paper trail for any potential penalties.&nbsp;</p><p>Fingerprinting apps can use API calls to retrieve characteristics of your smartphone or PC, including the screen resolution, model, OS and more. It can then take all this information and create a unique "fingerprint," so it can identify you when you go to other apps or websites.</p><p>Apple effectively declared war on tracking when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-now-available-170536951.html">released iOS 14.5 in 2021</a>, requiring developers to ask users' permission before tracking them. Since that feature arrived, only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-users-reject-app-tracking-165309407.html">4 percent of US iPhone users</a> have agreed to app tracking. Now, it's trying to stop fingerprinting (also called canvas fingerprinting), which first appeared in the digital zeitgeist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-22-canvas-fingerprint-web-tracking.html">a decade ago</a>. Back in 2018, Apple said it would address fingerprinting on macOS by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-apple-safari-canvas-fingerprinting.html">limiting the data</a> that websites can access on its Safari browser, and now, it's addressing the issue with apps as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-cracking-down-on-fingerprinting-with-new-app-store-api-rules-080007498.html?src=rss

<p>NASA is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-launches-beta-site-on-demand-streaming-app-update-coming-soon">launching</a> its very own streaming platform called NASA+ sometime this summer. While the space agency already livestreams launches and other events on its website, NASA+ will feature not just live broadcasts, but also collections of original video series. A handful of the first shows on the platform will even be new titles launching with the service, and what's even better is that it will be free and will not be interrupting shows with ads. In other words, it's where you should go if you want to binge watch NASA and space content.&nbsp;</p><p>The streaming service will be available through the agency's iOS and Android apps on mobile devices. You'll also be able to access it on desktop and mobile browsers, as well as stream shows on demand through media players, such as Roku, Apple TV and Fire TV.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Marc Etkind from NASA's Office of Communications said:</p><p>&quot;We’re putting space on demand and at your fingertips with NASA’s new streaming platform.

It's currently working on a new web (and app) experience that can better consolidate information about its missions, research projects and updates about the Artemis program, among other things. NASA has numerous websites for different programs and divisions, but the new experience will include content from several of them. It will also feature integrated navigation and search function for easier access to information across NASA websites. You can visit the <a href="https://beta.nasa.gov/">beta version</a> of the upgraded web experience right now, but take note that the agency plans to connect more libraries and websites to it even after it's been fully launched.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasa-is-the-space-agencys-very-own-streaming-platform-063042960.html?src=rss

## Formula E breaks indoor land speed world record in 'unlocked' Gen3 car

<p>Ahead of the final two races of Season 9 in London, Formula E showed off the &quot;unlocked&quot; potential of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen3-car-is-living-up-to-its-potential-after-a-rocky-start-130007090.html">Gen3 electric race car</a>. The EV series has claimed the world record for indoor land speed, clocking in at 135.9 MPH (218.71 KPH) in a GenBeta development car. The run took place on a .176-mile straight on the London E-Prix circuit, a portion of which is inside the ExCeL London arena. The car, piloted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mclaren-formula-e-gen3-interview-150058523.html">NEOM McLaren Formula E driver Jake Hughes</a>, beat the previous record of 102.7 MPH (165.2 KPH) by 33 MPH.&nbsp;</p><p>Hughes went head-to-head with fellow driver Lucas di Grassi (Mahindra Racing) in a modified version of Formula E's duels format typically used for qualifying. Each one was given a chance to set the fasted speed on the indoor section of track and both bested the former world record on all three of their practice runs before making official attempts. Neither Hughes nor di Grassi had driven the GenBeta car prior to this exhibition.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Formula E says the GenBeta car has a number of upgrades to make it faster and more powerful than the Gen3 car used in race events. First, it has an enhanced power output of 400kW, up from 350kW in race trim. The added power comes via all-wheel drive for the first time in a Formula E car through &quot;activation of the front powertrain kit&quot; for more traction while accelerating.&nbsp;</p><p>“The GenBeta is the first time that four-wheel drive has been activated in a single-seater race car for both acceleration and braking regeneration,&quot; explains Alessandra Ciliberti, Formula E's technical manager. &quot;The GenBeta showcases what will be possible for Formula E racing in the near future.”</p><div id="6e9d5729465548df94aca2138fee6001"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The GenBeta car was also running softer Hankook tires which afforded &quot;faster warm-up and better peak grip.&quot; The harder race-day tires are currently designed for all conditions and to offer low degradation over the course of an E-Prix. Additionally, 3D-printed wing endplates, wheel fins and a wind deflector were installed for enhanced aerodynamics and peak straight-line speed. Al was also used to analyze the drivers' runs, powered by Google's Vertex platform and McKinsey &amp; Company's QuantumBlack, helping interpret telemetry and fine-tune strategy.</p><p>In order to make the record official, the drivers had to start from a standstill and completely stop inside the convention center. This meant taking a 130-degree turn at about 25 MPH before going flat out along the straight. Speeds were captured 16.4 feet before the drivers hit the breaking zone, or the section of the circuit needed for them to stop and remain inside the building.&nbsp;</p><p>The regular Gen3 car is already the fastest and most efficient electric racer ever built. It's capable of over 200 MPH at top speed and generates 40 percent of the power it needs to complete an E-Prix through braking. Formula E describes GenBeta as &quot;an innovation platform&quot; that was created by the racing series, the FIA, Sabic and Hankook. Projects with the vehicle are meant to experiment with new materials and technology in a bid to increase performance, efficiency and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-breaks-indoor-land-speed-world-record-in-unlocked-gen3-car-040005749.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amd/">AMD</a> has revealed its first mobile gaming processor with 3D V-Cache.

The tech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-cpu-3d-v-cache-zen-4-160018871.html">arrived on desktop processors</a> last year, and soon you'll be able to pick up a laptop with a 3D V-Cache CPU.</p><p>This approach allows AMD to cram extra 64MB of L3 cache onto the Ryzen 9 7945X3D. For a total of 144MB. That helps mitigate the chances of cache miss. If your system can't find information it's looking for in the cache, it has to go to system memory. That could result in processes taking 10 times longer to carry out, according to AMD. The company claims its 3D V-cache approach can help increase the frame rates of games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By moving vertically instead of padding more cache onto a CPU's typical 2D plane, AMD is able to increase the size of the cache without having to make the chip wider or longer. In essence, the company can get more performance out of a CPU while avoiding any increase to the horizontal real estate it takes up on a motherboard.</p><p>The company claims this is the fastest mobile gaming processor on the planet, and that it's more than 15 percent faster than the Ryzen 9 7945HX on average. It has 16 cores, 32 threads, up to 5.4 Ghz boost speeds and 55W+ TDP. The CPU is built on the Zen 4 architecture.</p><p>You won't have to wait too long to get your hands on a laptop that uses the Ryzen 9 7945X3D. ROG's Strix Scar 17 X3D machine will be available on August 22nd.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-its-first-laptop-processor-with-3d-v-cache-010028830.html?src=rss
