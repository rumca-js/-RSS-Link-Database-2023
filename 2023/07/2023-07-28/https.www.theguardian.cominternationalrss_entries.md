## ‘The lowest I’ve ever been’: how playing Jar Jar Binks led to abuse, near death – and saving Baby Yoda

<p>Ahmed Best was overjoyed when cast as Star Wars’s Jar Jar Binks – until the threats of violence began. As a podcast tells his story, he talks about hate, making movie history and a glorious comeback in The Mandalorian</p><p>One foggy night at 3am, the actor who plays Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars found himself clinging to the edge of Brooklyn Bridge. An instant ago, he had been on the public walkway, but now he was teetering on its brink. As the breeze blew around him, he gazed out at the Statue of Liberty. He saw the river below, and as he hung precariously above a 39m drop, one thing kept going through his mind: “I’ll show all of you. I’ll show you what you’re doing to me. And when I’m gone, <em>then</em> you’ll feel exactly what I went through.”</p><p>This is the lowest moment of new Ted-produced podcast The Redemption of Jar Jar Binks. It tells the story of Ahmed Best, who played what was meant to be one of Star Wars’ most exciting new characters, only to end up being the first ever recipient of a torrent of online abuse that spilled over into worldwide press coverage. We hear him go from being on the cover of Vanity Fair alongside Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor to receiving death threats – only to make an astonishing comeback. It’s quite the journey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/28/star-wars-ahmed-best-interview-jar-jar-binks-the-phantom-menace-the-mandalorian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Even those who consider themselves socially progressive clam up when it comes to those on benefits reproducing</p><p>Since becoming a parent, I no longer have much time. There are 4,524 unread emails in my inbox, and I only recently got a pedicure despite the fact that it’s been at least 13 months since I’ve been able to see my feet again. But it turns out that I do have time to be properly livid with the Labour party, which is refusing to budge on its failure to promise to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/17/labour-party-poverty-families-two-child-benefit-cap">scrap the two-child benefits policy</a>, despite the fact that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/06/more-than-1m-children-growing-up-in-poverty-under-two-child-benefits-limit">it has pushed</a> a quarter of a million children into poverty and 850,000 even deeper below the breadline.</p><p>Perhaps it’s tone deaf to talk of pedicures in the same breath as child poverty, but these small things mothers do for themselves – getting our roots done, or even just a long, hot bath – help us stay sane. The toll that parenting takes on your body doesn’t stop after birth: it is physical, bone-aching work<strong>,</strong> and birth of course can lead to myriad long-term health issues.
