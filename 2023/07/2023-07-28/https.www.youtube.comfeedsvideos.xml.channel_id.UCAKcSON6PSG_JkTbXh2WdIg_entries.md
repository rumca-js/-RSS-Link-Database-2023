On Thursday, July 6, Margaret Glaspy performed a Microshow set at the Clown Lounge, located in the basement of the Turf Club in St. Paul. Glaspy’s next album is Echo The Diamond, which releases Aug. 18, 2023 on @atorecords, and in her Microshow performance, Glaspy treated the audience to several songs from the forthcoming release as well as selections from her back catalogue. The audience consisted of lucky winners who had entered for a chance to attend this unique performance.

“What a spectacular place to play music,” Glaspy said of the Clown Lounge. “I’m really enjoying this atmosphere a lot. It’s my absolute pleasure to be here, and my absolute pleasure to be here with The Current, the greatest radio station of all time.”
