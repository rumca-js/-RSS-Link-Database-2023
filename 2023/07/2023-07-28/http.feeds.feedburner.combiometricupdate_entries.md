		School security in the United States has never looked more like a Robocop movie, with schoolboards turning to technological solutions for the problem of chronic mass shootings.

Working on the principle that the way to fight guns is with more guns, faster, the school district in Oconee County, South Carolina has installed <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/a-lot-rides-on-biometric-gun-safes-in-schools-their-effectiveness-is-debatable">biometric gun safes</a> in each of its schools. According to a local news source, <a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/sro-south-carolina-school-rifles-gun-safes/44664128">WYFF</a>, a total of 18 safes have been placed at undisclosed locations in three high schools, three middle schools ten elementary schools, and two academies.

The safes mean that school resource officers responding to reports of a mass shooter can access their rifles quickly, in the school, using their thumbprints or other biometrics, rather than having to retrieve them from their vehicles.

According to WYFF, officials said the construction of the gun safes makes cracking them “virtually impossible.”
<h2>Anti-shooter tech on display at Las Vegas conference</h2>
The Oconee safes were purchased from an unnamed vendor in Atlanta. However, school boards looking to beef up their security arsenal might plan a future shopping trip to the <a href="https://schoolsafety911.org/schoolsafety/">National School Security Conference</a>, which took place at the Tropicana Casino in Las Vegas.

Michigan, for instance, invested in several new security tools for its Detroit schools, many of them technology-based and aimed at slowing down active shootings in progress. <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/las-vegas-firms-pitch-mass-shooter-security-schools-does-it-work">Bridge Michigan</a> reports that, following a school shooting in 2021, the state’s budget for school security increased seven-fold, and now totals up to $335 million.

As in many industries, with government investment comes an expanded market. Offerings on display at the Vegas show included bulletproof window decals and whiteboards, integrated body camera systems, bleeding control kits, and panic button necklaces. Facial recognition and other biometric systems were well represented; <a href="https://zeroeyes.com/">ZeroEyes</a>, a security firm founded by former Navy SEALs, was there to push a platform that wires AI and video analytics into existing school security cameras for real-time gun detection.

According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/06/the-school-security-industry-was-valued-at-3point1-billion-in-2021.html">2022 report</a> from CNBC, the school security industry in the U.S. is now worth $3.1 billion.

According to Education Week’s <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2023/01">school shooting tracker</a>, there have been 23 school shootings that resulted in injuries or death in the U.S. since the beginning of 2023.

## CBP One app faces lawsuit from rights organizations

		The U.S. government’s policy of requiring asylum seekers to book an appointment through the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/biometrics-registration-on-the-way-to-the-us-border-is-not-getting-easier-for-migrants">CBP One biometric smartphone app</a> is facing a court challenge from two immigrants’ rights groups.

The Associated Press reports that Al Otro Lado and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, along with ten individuals from countries including Mexico, Haiti, Nicaragua and Russia, on Friday filed a class action lawsuit against the Biden administration arguing that the app cuts off access for a wide swath of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/migrant-activists-in-us-say-mistakes-hindering-cbp-one-app">migrants and asylum seekers</a>.

Under the current policy those who do not have an appointment are turned away and restricted from further pursuit of the U.S. asylum process. A federal court recently blocked the practice after <a href="https://cgrs.uclawsf.edu/news/federal-court-blocks-biden-asylum-ban">ruling it to be illegal</a>, but delayed their ruling from taking effect for 14 days.

Meanwhile, border agents continue to unlawfully tell asylum seekers, “there’s an app for that.”

“CBP One essentially creates an electronic waitlist that restricts access to the U.S. asylum process to a limited number of privileged migrants,” say the litigants in the <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/node/6005">lawsuit</a>, who are represented by the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies, the American Immigration Council (AIC), the Center for Constitutional Rights, and lawyers Mayer Brown LLP. The suit contends that many migrants and asylum seekers have difficulties accessing an internet connection, and that those who can have trouble navigating the app in a foreign language.

A press release from AIC says that “even in the best of circumstances, CBP One is notoriously glitchy, and its discriminatory <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/even-accurate-and-unbiased-facial-recognition-brings-privacy-cost-harms-groups-say">facial recognition technology</a> has prevented many darker-skinned and Black migrants from obtaining an appointment.” It claims some asylum seekers have spent months trying to secure a booking through the app, suffering in violent and unstable border encampments while they wait.

“This lawsuit argues that the government’s policy of turning back asylum seekers who do not have a CBP One appointment violates U.S. law, the government’s own guidance, asylum seekers’ due process rights, and the United States’ obligations under international law, which prohibit the government from returning refugees to countries where they face persecution or torture,” it says.
<h2>Illegal process works to limit immigration, but lawsuits dog progress</h2>
For the Biden administration, the limitation on asylum imposed by the biometric requirements is a double-edged sword. One the one hand, the system has been decreed as unlawful, and thus adds to the larger legal tangle the government faces over immigration policy. On the other hand, it has proved effective. A recent update from <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-june-2023-monthly-update">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) showed “a significant and continuing decline in migrant encounters along the Southwest border.” According to a report from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188438846/illegal-border-crossings-are-down-one-big-reason-why-is-now-part-of-a-court-figh">NPR</a>, the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico illegally is lower than it has been since early 2021.

But while the government says they are merely trying to implement safe and orderly pathways to asylum in the wake of the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/u-s-mexico-border-wall-what-it-really-looks-like/5/">rigid policies</a>, frustrated rights groups see a tool that dissuades people from claiming a legal right.

Nicole Elizabeth Ramos, the director of <a href="https://alotrolado.org/">Al Otro Lado’s</a> border rights team, said in a release, “I find it difficult to explain to asylum seekers and our staff, many of whom have been impacted by illegal U.S. border policies themselves, how despite the fact that a federal court ruled almost two years ago that turning asylum seekers away from U.S. ports of entry is illegal, we must re-litigate this issue today.”

A <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cbp-one-app-fails-asylum-seekers-report">report</a> from the International Rescue Committee, a refugee and humanitarian aid organization, put it bluntly: “Hinging access to seek and enjoy asylum on whether people fleeing for their lives can book an appointment on a smartphone app is neither right nor practical.” A <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/more-criticism-for-border-live-testing-app-for-asylum-seekers">biometric asylum app</a>, it says, “should never be the only means to effectively request protection at a U.S. port of entry.”

Furthermore, the app presents significant risk for privacy violations. In a May policy briefing, Erika Guevara-Rosas of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/05/usa-mandatory-cbp-one-violates-right-asylum/#:~:text=The%20way%20in%20which%20the,by%20'pinging'%20their%20phones.">Amnesty International</a> said that “asylum-seekers are forced to install the application on their mobile devices, which enables U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect data about their location by ‘pinging’ their phones.”

“The U.S. must ensure that asylum-seekers have due process rights regarding refugee status determination procedures,” she said, “and that they are not returned to places where they may be at risk of harm.”

## Liminal sees opportunities in financial services onboarding landscape

		Market intelligence firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/liminal">Liminal</a> has published a list of the top 32 companies working in compliance and fraud prevention for onboarding.

“While many providers are actively developing key capabilities, no single vendor has dominated the market yet, creating a prime opportunity” for younger and smaller companies, according to Liminal's report.

The <a href="https://liminal.co/research/link-index/account-opening-financial-services/">Link Index Report for Account Opening in Financial Services</a> evaluated 150 providers in the financial sector. Among the top 32 were <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/experian">Experian</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idnow">IDnow</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/incode-technologies">Incode</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/mitek-systems-inc">Mitek</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/onfido">Onfido</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/trulioo">Trulioo</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/shufti-pro">Shufti Pro</a>.

According to Liminal’s data, buyers choose providers according to several factors, including speed and accuracy (94 percent), product capabilities (81 percent) and value for money (71 percent). Almost 90 percent of buyers are also looking for enhanced fraud capabilities.

Buyers can reap a $3.50 return on investment thanks to fraud and compliance cost savings, user-experience improvements and automated processes, the analysis firm claims. In addition, they can expect up to a 17 percent reduction in fraud at account opening and an equal reduction in customer abandonment.
<h2>Liminal says $3.2B invested in digital ID firms so far this year</h2>
Liminal also issued a fresh report on the digital identity market which showed that macro market conditions have changed since the rush of 2020 and 2021.

While 2021 was a rush of investment in digital IDs, amounting to $71.4 billion in 87 product contracts, 2022 slowed -- $8.7 billion investment in 32 deals. This year has so far recorded 32 deals collectively valued at $3.2 billion, according to the <a href="https://liminal.co/articles/investing-in-identity/">Investing in Identity</a> report. Liminal says that the pace of deals may slow later this year.

However, corporate acquisitions will continue.

“The narrative is shifting from growth to value investing, and significant consolidation of digital identity solution providers is anticipated,” the report says.

The report also notes that the digital ID sector has seen an explosion of new companies. In 2016, there were only around 300 firms operating in the industry while that number reached 2000 in 2023, according to Liminal.

## Galaxy phone users in India now have access to digital IDs via Samsung Wallet

		It is now possible for users of Samsung Galaxy smartphones to access their Aadhaar digital ID, PAN cards and other digital credentials on their devices using the Samsung Wallet, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/samsung-users-can-now-access-aadhaar-pan-card-on-their-smartphones-heres-how/articleshow/102079538.cms">reports</a> The Times of India (TOI).

Users can also carry other documents such as their driver’s license, vehicle registration documents and even their CoWIN vaccination certificates.

Users of the Samsung Galaxy devices can equally update their Samsung Pay service automatically or manually which is now linked with the Samsung Wallet, according to the outlet. The Wallet enhancements also work with the Samsung Pay and Samsung Pass services on their Galaxy smartphones.

The upgrade comes with many new features and benefits, the report says, including the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/samsung-pushes-wallet-for-biometric-payments-ids-apple-allows-mdls-in-its-wallet">ease of payment</a> using Samsung Pay.

Other benefits include the ability for Samsung Galaxy smartphone holders to use the Samsung Pass for access to many other mobile applications through biometric authentication, recharge FASTag electronic toll collection accounts, store flight boarding passes, and book train tickets, among other functions.

TOI also explains that from the Samsung Wallet, passengers will also be able to show their travel credentials such as passports at airports.

Other than carrying personal ID credentials, it is said that with the Samsung Wallet, users will be able to have access to more than 2,000 different services, including UPI, bill payment services, other IDs, mobility and travel documents, among others.

The Samsung Wallet is protected by Samsung Know, which uses biometrics to ensure the protection and safety of users’ personal data.

Samsung says the innovation is meant to support the Indian government’s digital transformation drive.

## ID authentication vendor seeing fewer financial fraud attempts in Africa

		ID fraud attempts are falling across Africa compared to the previous year, a new marketing KYC report from authentication firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smile-identity">Smile Identity</a>.

Smile's <a href="https://usesmileid.com/reports-and-guides/the-state-of-kyc-in-africa-mid-year-report-2023?utm_source=Our+blog&amp;utm_medium=Ownedmedia&amp;utm_campaign=H1+2023+report">mid-2023 look at KYC in Africa</a> states that the number of fraudulent KYC attempts that the company identified during the first half of this year was down 23 percent, five percentage points down from the drop experienced during the same period last year.

The company says the drop in attempts that it has identified indicates that the total number of fraudulent KYC attempts is falling across the continent.

The report is based on analysis of 75 million unique ID checks performed since 2018 by Smile ID, which <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/new-partnerships-for-document-scanning-and-kyc-expansions-show-id-verification-demand">recently renamed itself</a> Smile Identity.

The three IDs that are most targeted by fraudsters were the national IDs of Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. The most common tactic was using stolen or lost IDs for KYC during onboarding.

Another interesting point from Smile’s report is the increase in African women using online verification. During the past two years, the portion of female ID verifications performed by Smile systems has grown from 10 percent in the third quarter of 2021 to 35 percent during the first half of this year, according to the company.

The company emphasized growth it is seeing in female verification in three sectors: buy-now, pay later, banking and lending and remittances, according to the company.

Smile’s report also provided an overview of digital identity initiatives across Africa, including Ethiopia’s enrollment for its Fayda national ID, Kenya’s decision to introduce a unique personal identifier and Uganda’s planned launch of a digital ID scheme in the last quarter of 2023.

The continent, however, is also facing challenges with global anti-money laundering watchdog, Financial Action Task Force adding more countries to its "Grey List," which publicizes deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regimes. This year, South Africa, Nigeria and Cameroon were listed.

Additions to the task force's Grey List will "significantly impact the KYC ecosystem on the continent due to the growing number of countries on the list and the profile of countries now involved,” the report states.

In April, Smile <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/smile-acquires-appruve-to-expand-identity-verification-footprint-across-africa">bought</a> Inclusive Innovations, parent of ID verification firm<a href="https://www.appruve.co/"> Appruve</a>.
<h2>iiDENTIFii pitches liveness to African countries on 'Grey List'</h2>
South African authentication and onboarding vendor <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/iidentifii">iiDENTIFii</a> claims that it is possible to reverse the country’s grey-listing by the task force in 18 months through broad implementation of liveness detection. South Africa was added to the Grey List in March and is expecting a review of the decision in January 2025.

Banks are among the most vulnerable institutions to money laundering, particularly in cross-border transactions, says iiDENTIFii. The company claims it was hired by three South African banks to fortify their digital identification and onboarding and is offering a defense against digital injection attacks.

“This is part of a wider banking strategy to protect companies and consumers against AML and fraud,” says Murray Collyer, iiDENTIFii's chief operating officer. “Over the next 18 months, we believe the full impact of this solution will be visible and hopefully play a part in shifting the needle on the grey-listing decision.”

Collyer emphasizes the importance of liveness detection, as well as the difference between presentation attack detection and digital injection attack detection.

In September, the company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/iidentifii-secures-15m-in-funding-to-expand-face-biometric-authentication-across-africa">secured</a> US$15.2 million in a series A round to expand its face biometric authentication lines.

## Privacy group challenges Ryanair’s use of facial recognition

		Digital rights group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">NOYB</a> has filed a <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-07/Complaint%20Ryanair%20-%20Redacted%20en-US.pdf">complaint</a> against Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers. The complaint alleges that Ryanair is infringing on customers' data protection rights by using facial recognition for identity verification when booking through online travel agents and directly on its website or app.

NOYB, a European non-profit group led by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, lodged the complaint with Spain's data protection agency on behalf of a complainant who booked a Ryanair flight through the Spanish-based online travel agency, eDreams ODIGEO.

According to Ryanair's website, the airline justifies using facial recognition to comply with safety and security requirements since travel agents often do not provide customers' contact and payment details.

The airline's face biometrics capability is supplied by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/getid">GetID</a>, according to NOYB.

To avoid facial recognition, passengers can arrive at the airport at least two hours before departure or submit a form with a picture of their passport or national ID card in advance. Ryanair states that the form submittal process may take up to seven days to complete. However, booking through Ryanair’s website or mobile app does not require such verification.

"There is no reasonable justification for Ryanair to implement this system," NOYB said in a statement. "Instead, it seems like the airline is willingly violating their customer's right to data protection in order to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over alternative booking channels."

NOYB has previously succeeded in privacy challenges against some of the world's largest multinational companies across the European Union under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in 2018.

NOYB alleges that Ryanair's verification procedures do not comply with GDPR because the company does not provide clear information about the purpose of the “invasive facial recognition process.”

In defense of its practices, Ryanair states that its biometric and non-biometric processes fully comply with all GDPR regulations. The airline argues, "Online travel agents scrape Ryanair's inventory and, in many cases, miss-sell our flights and ancillary services with hidden mark-ups and provide incorrect customer contact information/payment details," the airline said in a statement.

"As a result, and in order to protect customers, any customers who book through an online travel agent are required to complete a simple customer verification process. This is to ensure that they make the necessary security declarations."

Ryanair is also facing a lawsuit over its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/face-biometrics-deployed-by-emirates-three-airports-but-italy-lawsuit-shows-resistance">facial recognition for third-party ticket sales</a>, filed by an Italian tourism trade group.

		The U.S. State Department has awarded $320 million in visa task orders to General Dynamics for consulates in South America. The contracts include biometric enrollment services as part of visa-application support.

<a href="https://www.gdit.com/">General Dynamics Information Technology</a> was awarded two <a href="https://streamlinegovcon.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-recompete-from-a-contract-managers-perspective/">recompete task orders</a> (where a government solicits pitches for the continuation of a contract that is ending).

"Demand for visa and other consular services is growing at an unprecedented pace," according to a statement from Paul Nedzbala, a senior vice president at GDIT. Biometric captures at U.S. consulates dates back at least <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202010/all-visitors-to-us-to-submit-biometrics-before-visa-application-under-white-house-draft-plan">to 2020</a>, when the White House announced plans to update procedures.

The so-called Andean South America order, $200 million has been allotted for digital ID and other services in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. A $120 million recompete order was signed for similar work in Brazil.

In both cases, the orders are for two years with four two-year option periods.

The General Dynamics unit performs visa services to the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs in 50 nations, according to the company.

Along with biometric enrollment, the orders cover services including appointment scheduling, fee collection and data analytics.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sita">SITA</a> has announced an agreement with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/indicio">Indicio</a>, which specializes in open-source verifiable data technology and trusted digital ecosystems, to accelerate developing and deploying digital identities for travel.

The partners say they are driving innovation in open-source, decentralized identity technologies that enable seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving processes in the airport and throughout the journey.

The development of digital identities or Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) enables passengers to securely create a digital version of their physical passport that meets International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. The DTC is stored as a verifiable credential in the passenger’s mobile wallet. The supporting technology has been built to ensure authenticity and integrity, and ownership can be automatically and repeatedly verified, thereby reducing the risk of fraud. Travelers keep control of their personal data and consent to share only the data needed before and during their travels.

The deal comes after a successful <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/partnerships-for-pangiam-sita-and-embross-to-ease-travel-processes">technology trial with the Aruba government</a>. Arriving passengers at Queen Beatrix International Airport applied for travel authorization through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNmQAEjwPjA">simplified procedure</a> that removed the need for manual input of information from paper travel documents. Using a DTC, passengers could consent to share relevant data directly from the digital wallet on their mobile device with multiple parties, from government officials at entry points to businesses such as hotels and car rental companies.

Jeremy Springall, SVP of SITA at Borders, says: “The adoption of digital identities will be the biggest technology breakthrough in the travel industry in decades. It will simplify the identification process at every step of the journey and open up opportunities for the air transport industry to fully embrace the benefits of seamless travel and the digital economy. SITA, together with Indicio, are proud to be leading the charge.”

Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, says: “It is difficult to understate just how significant SITA’s leadership has been in the field of open-source verifiable credential technology and decentralized identity; over the past three years, we’ve collaborated to push this technology forward with a shared vision for what it can do. And we delivered. The horizon has now expanded, filled with a myriad of applications. With SITA’s DTC using Indicio Proven technology, we will make all these applications a reality for passengers, aircrew, airports, borders, hotels, and governments. We are excited about what this partnership can build and deliver.”

		Technologies such as mobile biometric identification and vehicle tracking could be the European Union’s alternative to reintroducing internal border controls, according to a new <a href="https://frontex.europa.eu/innovation/announcements/report-from-the-conference-on-innovative-technologies-for-strengthening-the-schengen-area-Njaqc9">report</a> published by the European border agency <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/frontex">Frontex</a> this week.

The report presented recommendations delivered during the Conference on Innovative Technologies for Strengthening the Schengen Area, which took place in Warsaw, Poland in March. The conference was co-hosted by the European Commission, Frontex and Europol, bringing together European and national-level law enforcement and border officials with private sector representatives from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a>, <a href="https://grantdetection.com/">Grant Detection</a>, <a href="https://www.optoprecision.de/en.html">OptoPrecision</a>, <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/defence">Airbus Defence</a> and more.

The recommendation hopes to solve the EU’s <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/schengen-states-extend-border-checks-ignoring-eu-court/a-63747406">ongoing conundrum</a> in keeping the Schengen Agreement which promises the free flow of both goods and people across internal borders. Since the migrant crisis of 2015, several member states have been re-introducing border checks.

“Innovative solutions, such as mobile biometric identification and vehicle tracking technologies, can improve law enforcement capabilities and reduce the reintroduction of internal border controls to last resort situations,” the report notes.

The report also highlighted the use of more compact and portable devices, which make border checks more mobile and flexible.

Among other key messages is the need for more cooperation with industry. To achieve this, the EU should first develop a “unified and standardized approach towards data collection.” Another task would be to define feasible, legally compliant and socially acceptable procedures for technical solutions that could be shared among member states.

Representatives from several member states also argued for including intra-EU flights into the Advanced Passenger Information (API) Directive, which obliges air carriers to transmit data from passengers arriving from third countries to EU member states before the flight's take-off in order to combat illegal immigration.

Last month, Frontex published research into biometric technologies which identified the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/frontex-sees-5-new-biometric-techs-to-use-on-borders">five most promising solutions</a> that could be used by border control agencies in the next 20 years. Frontex is currently helping the EU prepare for its upcoming biometric Entry and Exit System (EES) while <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/frontex-invites-companies-to-pitch-border-biometrics-in-preparation-for-ees">inviting border technology makers</a> to submit products for evaluation.

The agency, however, has also come under criticism over the sinking of the Adriana boat with EU Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly<a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/07/26/eu-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-frontexs-role-in-deadly-adriana-shipwreck?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1690358521"> launching an investigation</a> this week into Frontex's role in the deadly migrant shipwreck. During the first six months of 2023, the agency detected more than <a href="https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/central-mediterranean-top-migratory-route-into-the-eu-in-first-half-of-2023-XtMpdL">132,000</a> irregular border crossings at the EU’s external borders.

## PhD student uses deepfake to pass popular voice authentication and spoof detection system

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Waterloo (UW) cybersecurity PhD student Andre Kassis published his findings after being granted access to an account protected with biometrics using deepfake AI-generated audio recordings. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A hacker can create a deepfake voice with five minutes of the target's recorded voice, which can be taken from public posts on social media, the research shows. GitHub's open source AI software can create deepfake audio that can surpass voice authentication.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He used the deepfake to expose a weakness in the Amazon Connect voice authentication system, a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/how-secure-are-voice-authentication-systems-really">UW release</a> reveals. Four-second attacks on Connect had a 10 percent success rate, and attacks closer to 30 seconds were successful 40 percent of the time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the company added biometric anti-spoofing software that could find digital markers on a voice recording, revealing if it was made by a machine or human. This worked until Kassis used free software to remove the digital markers from his deepfakes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">His method can bypass less sophisticated voice biometric authentication systems with a 99 percent success rate after six tries, according to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our attack," says Kassis in </span><a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2023/933600a951/1OXH3q5Io6Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his journal article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, "targets common points of failure that all spoofing countermeasures share, making it real-time, model-agnostic, and completely blackbox without the need to interact with the target to craft the attack samples." The countermeasures use easily identifiable and forgeable cues to differentiate between spoofed and authentic audio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Urs Hengartner, a computer science professor who is Kassis' supervisor and report co-author, said that “by demonstrating the insecurity of </span><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/ai-tools-make-layering-technologies-a-requirement-for-voice-authentication"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voice authentication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we hope that companies relying on voice authentication as their only authentication factor will consider deploying additional or stronger authentication measures."</span>
