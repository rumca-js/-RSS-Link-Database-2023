<p>Former England and Hampshire spinner remembers the Australian legend as he opens up on his own struggles with Parkinson’s and family bereavements</p><p>Shaun Udal has mixed memories of the T20 Blast, then known as the Twenty20 Cup. On 13 June 2003, he played in the very first game as Hampshire Hawks took on Sussex Sharks at a sun drenched Rose Bowl. “We were sat in a dugout wondering whether this was going to be some new dawn for cricket,” he remembers.</p><p>Easy to forget now but those early days of the format were full of innovation, yet compared to the retina-scalding razzle dazzle of the Indian Premier League, the brave new world of 2003 now looks distinctly parochial. Quaint, even. Udal recalls watching as the Hawks’ opening pair of James Hamblin and Derek Kenway walked out to the middle – batting pioneers in black cricket kit with charcoal piping. “Most of us thought that it might just be a hit and giggle, over in a couple of years,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/14/shaun-udal-shane-warne-seemed-invincible-i-cant-get-my-head-around-the-fact-hes-gone">Continue reading...</a>

Judge who made a lasting impact on immigration and sexual offence law and went on to become a supreme court justice<p>Centuries of common law precedents were overturned by Simon Brown in 1990 when, as a high court judge, he ruled that a husband could be found guilty of raping his wife. His decision that “there is no marital exemption to the law of rape” was upheld by the higher courts and confirmed in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Until then, the 250-year-old principle that a husband cannot be guilty of raping his wife “on account of the matrimonial consent which she has given, and which she cannot retract” was accepted in the courts.</p><p>Brown, who has died aged 86 of cancer, later told the House of Lords: “I have few boasts to my name by way of legal achievement, few jewels in my judicial crown, but I can … boast of being the first judge in this jurisdiction … to rule that a husband is not permitted in law to have intercourse with his wife quite simply whenever he chooses.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jul/14/lord-brown-of-eaton-under-heywood-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## Bird Box: Barcelona review –  unnecessary yet not unwatchable Netflix spin-off

<p>Streamer’s meme-magnet horror has spawned a Spanish edition and while it loses out from a lack of Sandra Bullock, it gains a nifty, nasty twist</p><p>With the overwhelming majority of Netflix films now being tossed into the ether without even the faintest of fanfare, it’s hard to remember just what a stir the streamer’s slick survival horror Bird Box <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/07/bird-box-sandra-bullock-netflix-memes-hit">caused back in December 2018</a>. It was the platform’s first genuine blockbuster, racking up record views (it remains the fourth most watched film ever on Netflix) and becoming a shock pop culture phenomenon spawning countless memes and the dreaded, deranged Bird Box Challenge. Yet as loud as the chatter might have been at the time, it went quiet just as fast, talks of a sequel fading as star Sandra Bullock soon spoke of temporary retirement.</p><p>A barely visible cultural imprint and a disinterested leading lady be damned with the streamer hoping that almost five years later, enough people are able to remember a universe that most critics were happy to repress. For all of its viral bluster, Bird Box was a sorry, sloppy spin on A Quiet Place with a far less effective sense-based danger and never quite working as a horror, a fantasy, a family drama or a survival thriller, parroting the work of others without bringing any sense of distinctive personality of its own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/14/bird-box-spain-review-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dutch darts player will become first trans woman to play in a televised PDC tournament after long road back to a sport she loves</p><p>Before everything that happened, before the desolation and the despair, before life changed for ever, there was a set of darts.

She devoured Raymond van Barneveld games on television. She dreamed of playing professionally, travelling the world, her name on the big screen. She was Noa-Lynn van Leuven, even if nobody called her that yet.</p><p>“I just had a feeling with the game,” she says from her home in Heemskerk, just outside Amsterdam. “I like the whole fight around it. I love watching darts, I love playing darts, and even if I wasn’t on the level I am now, I would still love it. I work long days in a kitchen as a chef de partie, and try to practise for an hour every day, so I don’t do much else. I work, I play darts and I sleep.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/14/noa-lynn-van-leuven-darts-interview">Continue reading...</a>

More of it is in front of us right now, with heatwaves scorching through Europe, breaking records, wreaking havoc. In Athens, they closed the Acropolis on Friday as temperatures at the site headed towards 48C. In Lisbon, visitors expecting perfect blue skies have been disappointed to find them streaked with grey – not clouds, but smoke from forest fires. In Italy, there was no spring this year: floods gave way to unbearable heat with barely a pause.</p><p>It’s happening all over – biblical downpours in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2023/jul/10/heavy-rain-deadly-flash-floods-new-york-hudson-valley-video">New York state</a>, unquenchable <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/canada-record-heat-meets-record-wildfires-new-reality-say-scientists.html">fires in Canada</a> – and yet humanity is not acting as if it is confronting a planetary emergency.

Even when the impact is personal, as it was for many Australians when bushfires raged through the country in 2019, opinions prove stubbornly hard to shift: one study found that among those “directly impacted” by the fires, around <a href="https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Polling-January-2020-bushfire-impacts-and-climate-concern-web.pdf">a third saw no connection to the climate</a>.

<p>Exactly why are they striking, who are the big names aboard, is it all streaming and AI’s fault and when will we see actors on screen again? </p><p><strong>Who is on strike? <br /></strong>The strike was called on Thursday morning by US actors’ union Sag-Aftra (which was formed in 2012 after a merger between the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists), after the breakdown in negotiations with the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers), which represents the studio bosses. Sag-Aftra has around 160,000 members: actors in film and TV shows, as well as video game performers, radio presenters, models and YouTube influencers. Technically the union only covers the US, but its Global Rule One demands that members <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/global-rule-one">pull out of any production anywhere</a> in the world.</p><p><strong>Who is Sag-Aftra’s firebrand leader?<br /></strong>The union’s president and figurehead is Fran Drescher, who you might remember from 90s TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nanny">The Nanny</a>. Having faced down a modicum of criticism for shooting off to Italy for a <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/sag-aftra-strike-fran-drescher-italy-kim-kardashian-1235437436/">photoshoot with Kim Kardashian</a> as negotiations were heading for the rocks, Drescher stormed back with an incendiary speech, in which she poured scorn on studio bosses (“They plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them.”) and invoked the spirit of the French Revolution: “Eventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles, and then it’s over!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/14/the-hollywood-actors-strike-everything-you-need-to-know">Continue reading...</a>

## Sunak says he can’t afford public sector pay rises – but look at the white elephants he’s happy to fund | Simon Jenkins

<p>Spending priorities sum up all that is rotten in government.

Had he done so then, we might have avoided six months of debilitating strikes in education, health and other public services. Last year he said he could not afford it. He still says that, demanding that the shortfall of £5bn over two years must come from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-teachers-doctors-set-6-pay-rise-times-2023-07-13/">departmental budgets</a>.</p><p>The cost of the strikes will never be known. But a further cost will come from departments hacking away at their spending over the next two years, when we assume another buffeting will take place. That is the price of holding back government borrowing, keeping down taxes and fighting inflation. Given how poorly Britain is faring compared with other G7 countries, I remain unconvinced that this sort of austerity is truly the way back to growth.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/rishi-sunak-public-sector-pay-rises-education-nhs">Continue reading...</a>

But has success been worth the slog?</p><p>Mahalia Burkmar has a knack for penning earworm-strewn pop about relationship drama: complex feelings, shady exes, just being generally irked by your lover. It’s fitting, then, that the day that we meet for a coffee close to her east London home she’s just had a row with her boyfriend. Happily it’s just a minor tiff: he passes by soon after to collect a set of keys en route to the gym, and the pair kiss and make up. As for the exes that appear frequently in her music, “it’s almost like they had a sonar signal that told them when I was single again … Every man in my life has done it. I’d come out of a relationship and then I would get a message from them and be like … ‘What?!’” She’s written a song about it for her new album, but it isn’t behaviour she endorses. “When I see, ‘Hey stranger’” – the title of the track – “I think: <em>‘Urgh</em>, go away!’”</p><p>Burkmar – better known simply by her first name – has garnered a fervent following in recent years, tackling breakups and growing up with honeyed, occasionally talky vocals that can turn a two-and-a-half minute pop song into a one-act play, reminiscent of Frank-era Amy Winehouse. On I Wish I Missed My Ex, from her 2019 debut album Love and Compromise, she laments the inevitability of an old flame popping up again (you can almost hear the sigh as she sings “You’ll be like ‘Babe, come over’ / I know how this goes, yeah”; today she describes it as “a painful experience that I was trying to play off as being hilarious”). On recent single Cheat, with the 00s pop great <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/01/jojo-good-to-know-review-clover-music" title="">JoJo</a>, the pair unite against a philandering man, for what feels like an updated version of Brandy and Monica’s 90s hit The Boy Is Mine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/14/mahalia-irl-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Neither of you could imagine how you’d feel once your baby arrived – but being an effective parent is about being flexible when things change</p><p><strong>I am currently on maternity leave with my first child. Before I had the baby I agreed to split my maternity leave with my partner 50:50; I planned to take the first</strong><strong> six months with him taking the last </strong><strong>six. I am four months in and finally starting to enjoy my maternity leave; </strong><strong>I feel like I’m getting to know my baby more each day. The first few months were tough and breastfeeding wasn’t easy. My partner took a considerable amount of time off upfront, which really helped as he picked up the household stuff while I focused on the baby. Now my </strong><strong>maternity leave is coming to an end and I really don’t feel ready to go back to work.</strong></p><p><strong>However, my partner is </strong><strong>upset about the possibility of shortening or completely foregoing shared parental leave</strong><strong>. He </strong><strong>said he would be </strong><strong>resentful if I took this time away from him. </strong><strong>But I will feel resentful about going back so soon when everyone around me is still off with their little ones</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/i-want-to-go-back-on-my-decision-to-share-maternity-leave-with-my-partner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New York and Vermont suffer severe flooding, while European heatwave expected to continue into next week</p><p>In the US, what is being termed as a one in 1,000 years flooding event has occurred, with a state of emergency called in New York and Vermont. From Sunday to Tuesday, vast quantities of rain fell across the two states. More than 30 locations in Vermont recorded more than 150mm (5.9 inches) of rain, with Plymouth and Mt Holly recording 230mm and 220mm respectively. At least four bridges are reported to have collapsed in the Plymouth area, leaving some families stranded in their homes. Meanwhile, storms in the state of New York brought more than 175mm of rain in a four-hour period at West Point on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Such large amounts of rainfall led to fluvial flooding as rivers such as the Hudson in New York and the Winooski in Vermont breached their banks. A 43-year-old woman died in the Hudson Valley as flood waters swept her and her dog away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/14/weather-tracker-us-new-york-vermont-floods-south-europe-heatwave">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Crucible, Sheffield<br /></strong>Billed as an opportunity to reframe Boublil and Schönberg’s original, this is more of a tweak but it is a visually captivating production</p><p>Last autumn, a theatre company of British east and south-east Asian artists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/21/theatre-group-pulls-play-from-sheffield-venue-staging-miss-saigon">voiced its objection</a> to the staging of Boublil and Schönberg’s Vietnam war musical for its racially reductive stereotypes. Miss Saigon’s producers defended it as an opportunity to <a href="https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/news/worth-statement">reframe the material</a> in a fresh way.</p><p>There are many positives in their shiny and accomplished crowdpleaser but this is more of a tweak than a rigorous reimagining. Directed by Robert Hastie and Anthony Lau, it is presented as “the first non replica production” of the musical since its 1989 premiere, with lyrics “modified in collaboration with the show’s original writers”. But the story of Vietnamese “bargirl” Kim (Jessica Lee), who falls fatally in love with Chris (Christian Maynard), an American GI posted in Saigon, feels much like the musical we know, complete with stereotypes.

<p>Transgender care also targeted as House due to vote on spending; former Fox host’s forum with Republican presidential hopefuls happening without ex-president</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. Every year for the last 50 or so, Congress passes the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) outlining the defense department’s annual budget, but this year’s bill is looking to be especially contentious. Yesterday, rightwing Republicans, with speaker of the House <strong>Kevin McCarthy’</strong>s blessing, succeeded in adding amendments to the legislation blocking the Pentagon from paying travel expenses for employees seeking abortions out of states, and another barring a healthcare program for the armed forces from providing gender-affirming care.</p><p>The House is expected to vote on final passage of the act around 10.30am eastern time today, but the amendments have sparked a revolt among Democrats, who are telling their lawmakers not to support it. And even if it passes Congress’s lower chamber, it still needs to be approved by the Senate, where <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s allies have a majority and are unlikely to be friendly to conservative attempts to shoehorn culture war priorities into such crucial legislation. There will be plenty of news on this today, but one thing that can be said now is that this battle represents the latest consequence of the far right’s sway in the GOP, which only took control of the House at the start of this year.</p><p><strong>Tucker Carlson</strong>, eyeing a comeback after being fired from Fox News, will at 10am host a forum together with Blaze Media feature Republican presidential candidates <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, <strong>Tim Scott</strong>, <strong>Nikki Haley</strong>, <strong>Vivek Ramaswamy</strong> and <strong>Asa Hutchinson</strong>.</p><p><strong>Biden</strong> is taking it easy today after a long week visiting Nato allies in Europe, with no public events or press briefing scheduled.</p><p><strong>The state of American democracy:</strong> not good, according to a new poll from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/poll-democracy-partisanship-trump-biden-trust-221f2b4f6cf9805f766c9a8395b9539d">The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>.

<p>Prices may be creeping up generally, but there are still some great French wine bargains out there. So long as you know where to look…</p><p>I can’t separate summer from memories of road trips through France in years gone by, and if you’re doing that this year, you’ll no doubt pick up some wine along the way at a much cheaper price than you’ll pay back home. Even so, French wine can still offer amazingly good value here in the UK, particularly if you concentrate on lesser known and unfashionable appellations.</p><p>Muscadet is a good case in point. Yes, it’s usually eclipsed by the slightly cheaper and jauntier picpoul de pinet, but picpoul doesn’t quite have muscadet’s minerality and finesse. And, yes, if you want a wine to go with seafood, these days many of us will probably opt for albariño, but muscadet does the job just as well, and for less than a tenner, which much albariño struggles to achieve. So, if you haven’t tried muscadet for a while, it’s worth revisiting.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/14/french-wines-for-less-than-a-tenner-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

The new host of University Challenge, the third in the show’s 61-year history (following Bamber Gascoigne and, of course, Jeremy Paxman) is wearing his trademark suit and tie. He is also holding a bag for life full of tins. “Who wants a gin and tonic or piña colada?” he asks. This is not a moment I expected.</p><p>Filming has just finished (the tins are Rajan’s way of thanking the crew) and I’m here because, as well as talking to him about taking over as host of the iconic student quizshow, I have been invited to try it out.

So hard, in fact, that having just played I rummage through Rajan’s bag and down an entire piña colada in one go out of stress.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/new-host-new-set-same-fiendish-questions-behind-the-scenes-with-the-all-new-university-challenge">Continue reading...</a>

## A right Royals mess: Reading paying heavy price for rolling the dice

<p>Relegated men have threadbare squad and may be docked points and women’s team, also demoted, are now part-time</p><p>Roll the dice. It is said to be one of the Reading owner Dai Yongge’s go-to phrases but it can feel foolish at the best of times, let alone amid the current backdrop. A thirst to hurriedly elevate the club to the Premier League, after a near-miss six years ago, has spectacularly backfired. Three weeks out from Reading’s first season in the third tier since 2001-02, they are playing catch-up. They have a threadbare squad with a handful of fit senior players, a disillusioned fanbase and a manager who only took charge on Friday, 18 days after being appointed, because of delays obtaining a work permit. They also face the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/16/reading-facing-points-deduction-failing-to-pay-players-wages-efl-charges">threat of another points deduction</a> after failing to pay wages on time.</p><p>Dai, who made his fortune turning disused air-raid shelters into shopping malls in China, has spent about £250m in the six years since he and his sister, Dai Xiu Li, acquired Reading but aside from a sleek training facility, he has very little to show for it. “It’s legalised gambling,” says Paula Martin, chair of the Supporters Trust at Reading of the financial approach. “Throw money at it, and possibly with better advice so that we bought more appropriate players at the time, the gamble might have paid off and we might have been in the Premier League by now.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/14/reading-mess-men-women-relegated-squad-part-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Ruth Wilson narrates this powerful retelling of Ovid’s Pygmalion myth, in which a sculptor falls in love with a statue of a woman</p><p></p><p>This short story from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/27/madeline-miller-on-the-song-of-achilles-it-helped-people-come-out-to-their-parents">The Song of Achilles </a>author Madeline Miller is a powerful reimagining of Ovid’s Pygmalion, in which a sculptor falls in love with a woman he has carved out of ivory and who is, as Miller tells it, literature’s first “incel”. <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/galatea-9781526652065?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">First published in 2013</a>, Miller’s story opens with Galatea – the name means “she who is milk-white” – under the care of a medic who frets about her pale complexion. “I’m always this colour,” explains Galatea, “because I used to be made of stone.”</p><p>Gradually, we learn Galatea’s story: how, 10 years earlier, her husband (who remains deliberately nameless) had prayed to the goddess night after night to bring his sculpture of a perfect, naked woman to life. On touching her arm one day, he realised she was warm and that his prayers had been answered. Only soon he became frustrated as he realised his creation had a mind and a will of her own – “I don’t think he expected me to speak,” Galatea reflects – and resolved to keep her locked away under medical supervision. After Galatea becomes pregnant with their child, Paphos, her husband notices stretch marks on her belly and is enraged. “If you were stone, I would chisel them off,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/galatea-by-madeline-miller-audiobook-review-literatures-first-incel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The food is wonderful, but I cannot say that everything else about eating here isn’t rather peculiar, because it absolutely is</p><p>Three minutes after walking into <a href="https://www.polentina.com/">Polentina</a> in east London, I messaged the person who had tipped me off about it, asking: “Where the hell am I?” I had muttered several much saltier things while I was wandering around an industrial estate in Tower Hamlets, down dusty tracks and weaving my way through overflowing bins while looking for this restaurant, which isn’t quite a restaurant, but rather a canteen in a factory, where the food is, I’d been told, astonishingly good.</p><p>Polentina is the work of <a href="https://www.sophiamassarella.com/">Sophia Massarella, a photographer</a> and a forensically passionate fan of Italian food, although it is clearly the cooking side that has taken over of late. Massarella, a Canadian, started a business during lockdown to recreate the polenta, pasta and salad dishes so loved by the Italian side of her family. Her next, entirely illogical step was to take on this small space in the staff canteen of the sustainable fashion factory <a href="https://www.appareltasker.com/">ApparelTasker</a>, though, in a world where rent, rates and food and staffing costs thwart much creativity in cooking, nothing is remotely logical any more.

<p>The Second Murderer by Denise Mina; Beware the Woman by Megan Abbott; Murder in the Family by Cara Hunter; Black Thorn by Sarah Hilary; The Housekeepers by Alex Hay</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-second-murderer-9781787302853">The Second Murderer</a> by Denise Mina (Harvill Secker, £18.99)</strong><br />Raymond Chandler’s Los Angeles PI Philip Marlowe is reimagined by Mina in a novel that also includes Anne Riordan, who aficionados will remember from Chandler’s 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely, the working title of which was the same as this book. Here, Marlowe is tasked with tracking down Chrissie, only child of stratospherically rich sadist Chadwick Montgomery. The monstrous patriarch isn’t too bothered about being reunited with his daughter – she’s given him a legitimate grandson, so succession is assured – and Marlowe, who finds the young woman quickly, isn’t keen to return her. Matters are complicated by the fact that Riordan, now a professional rival, is also on the case, and because the next time Marlowe sees Chrissie she is standing over a corpse in a Skid Row hotel room. Mina, who is a considerably more efficient plotter than Chandler, remains true to his tone and to Marlowe’s character, while cleaning up his attitude to render him more palatable to modern readers: highly recommended.</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/beware-the-woman-9780349012490">Beware the Woman</a> by Megan Abbott (Virago, £18.99)</strong><br />Abbott’s novel centres on a pregnant junior-school teacher, Jacy, who travels from New York with her husband, Jed, to visit her father-in-law in remote upper Michigan. Dr Ash and his loyal housekeeper are friendly enough, at least initially – and Jacy puts any misgivings down to hormones. However, it gradually becomes clear that unspoken family history simmers beneath the pleasant surface, not least the fact that Jed’s mother died giving birth to him. After Jacy has a miscarriage scare, Dr Ash is increasingly controlling, and Jed sides with him in infantilising his wife and putting her under the care of a judgmental local doctor. Jacy, already struggling with a body that feels no longer her own, grows distrustful as the men override her wishes, effectively imprisoning her. Abbott expertly rachets up the menace towards an unexpected and shocking ending in a claustrophobic and timely chiller about how men deny women agency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

Its charming appearance, combined with relatively easy care, makes the mini monstera (<em><a href="https://www.houseofplants.co.uk/products/rhaphidophora-tetrasperma">Rhaphidophora tetrasperma</a></em>) a favourite among plant lovers.<br /><br /><strong>Light or shade?</strong><br />The plant thrives in bright, indirect light. It can tolerate lower light conditions, but sunlight will help promote healthy growth.<br /><br /><strong>Where should I put it?</strong><br />It looks stunning cascading from a suspended pot, adorning a shelf or climbing a moss pole. Place it near an east-facing window in your front room.</p><p><strong>How do I keep it alive?</strong><br />It’s essential to maintain a warm, moist environment – try misting or placing the pot on a wet pebble tray. However, this plant can generally tolerate normal household humidity. Keep the room temperatures above 13C. Water weekly during the growing season, and in the winter allow the soil to dry out before watering.<br /><br /><strong>Did you know …</strong><br />This Asian native is frequently confused with the Monstera deliciosa. However, the mini monstera stands on its own as a captivating plant.

<p>Cushioned-sole pumps, tapered joggers, and layers on top are comfortable and hardy – and look great on holiday, too</p><p>The right outfit will make your day go better. This starts with nuts-and-bolts functionality: shoes that can get you to the day’s step count without blisters, that kind of thing. But there is way more to it than that. A good outfit makes your day better in less obvious but equally powerful ways. It smooths your passage through the world. When you walk into a room, before you say a word, good clothes are a charm offensive.</p><p>Take, for example, the perfect travel outfit: that it has to be comfy is non-negotiable, obviously. And it needs to be made up of layers that will flex to accommodate changes in temperature. It must be reasonably hardy against smudges and creases. And if your destination is a holiday, it needs to be made up of pieces that will make themselves useful in your holiday wardrobe. Logistical stuff, all important, which I will return to in a moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/14/looking-for-the-perfect-travel-outfit-heres-how-to-upgrade-your-look">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Smalltown Supersound)</strong><br />This Norwegian producer returns from his period forays into the leftfield for an album that is as fizzy and enticing as ever</p><p>Hans-Peter Lindstrøm is nothing if not consistent. The Norwegian electronic producer is known for his romantic, cosmic take on disco: along with his countrymen Todd Terje and Prins Thomas, he helped popularise a sleek, euphoric form that felt novel in the mid-2000s, and which is now the de-facto soundtrack of every hip beachside bar the world over. Once in a while, Lindstrøm will make a left-field, exploratory record before snapping back to the space disco that made him famous.</p><p>Everyone Else Is a Stranger, his first album since the 2020 Prins Thomas collab III, represents the snap-back point: it’s a suite of four gloriously starry-eyed dance epics, filled with cheeky synth whirrs and undulating bass rhythms. It has all the enthusiastic fizz and enticing hue of a £30 bottle of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/23/why-pet-nat-is-so-much-more-than-hipster-bubbles">pét nat</a>; although it’s slightly less exciting than the seductive, moonlit III, it arrives at the perfect point of summer, when the heat is gruelling and the only thing that might help you cool down is 40 minutes of expansive synth jams.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/14/lindstrm-everyone-else-is-a-stranger-review-minor-variations-on-sleek-space-disco-pleasures">Continue reading...</a>

## Ordinary Human Failings by Megan Nolan review – lyrical tale of a family accused

<p>An Irish family in early 90s London become tabloid scapegoats in this politically astute novel of lives foreclosed</p><p>Ordinary Human Failings is a considerably more interesting book than it claims to be. It’s pitched as a procedural thriller of sorts – an unsolved murder, the cops closing in, an ambitious journalist snooping around. While there may be a depressing commercial logic to this framing, it does the novel scant justice; those plot elements amount to little more than a deftly handled framing device. Beyond lies a subtle, accomplished and lyrical study of familial and intergenerational despair, a quiet book about quiet lives. And it also happens to be an excellent novel: politically astute, furious and compassionate. It’s considerably better than Nolan’s first novel, the acclaimed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/03/acts-of-desperation-by-megan-nolan-review-learning-to-say-no" title="">Acts of Desperation</a> – worth stating, given our neophilic literary culture’s obsession with debuts and novelty.</p><p>Set mostly in the early 1990s, it tells the story of the Greens, a family of Irish immigrants who have moved to London in the hope of escaping the social stigma of daughter Carmel’s teenage pregnancy and her brother Ritchie’s escalating alcoholism. Judged reclusive and odd by their new neighbours, the Greens are easy scapegoats when tragedy visits their estate. As we gradually learn more about the psychological and structural forces that have shaped the family, a picture emerges of lives foreclosed; of youthful audacity hardening into resignation and resentment, fresh starts rendered heavy by old habit, sadnesses handed from parent to child like cursed heirlooms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/ordinary-human-failings-by-megan-nolan-review-lyrical-tale-of-a-family-accused">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s wild we’ve been messing around with Timothée Chalamet when we already had Jeremy Allen White – a Michelin-level chef in a white T-shirt trying to turn around a doomed Chicago sandwich shop</p><p>To punish myself for living an imperfect life, I sometimes watch a really terrible TV series right to the very end, just to make sure I am right about it (I always am). This is how I ended up watching the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/23/true-detective-two-review">second series of True Detective</a>, which is dreadful in every possible way: Vince Vaughn is horribly miscast; it’s filmed with all the style of a filler episode of CSI; the central mysterious murder is impossible to care about; and, crucially, it seems to have been written and made and acted in by people who have never consumed any art beyond a mid-game mission from GTA V. Colin Farrell is the only one doing any acting, and even then it’s to such a non-end that I am retroactively rescinding a star from my personal review of The Banshees of Inisherin for his involvement in it.</p><p>Anyway, I’ve been thinking about second-season syndrome as a result, and how common it used to be. Back in 2015, when True Detective was ruining the legacy of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/12/true-detective-box-set-review">first season</a> with the doomed second, it was fairly common to see TV shows not know how to start again after neatly finishing up their first series and getting more lauded than expected. It makes sense: when you’re creating a 10-episode run of TV, you truly don’t know if it’s going to get picked up again, so you try to write a story freestanding enough to make sense if it gets cancelled but with enough loose ends to pick up again should it not be (if you closely watch the early seasons, they kept doing this with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/20/breaking-bad-10-years-on-tv-is-still-in-walter-whites-shadow">Breaking Bad</a>). Then you get the phone call from HBO saying: “We’ve seen the audience figures and guess what – we now love it!” and you realise you’ve painted yourself into a corner. Follow-up problems happen with albums, they happen with books. Sometimes you just run out of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/the-bear-the-best-show-of-2022-is-back-and-its-the-perfect-example-of-how-to-ace-a-second-series">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The notion of ‘boundaries’ is a seductive metaphor for how our relationships should work – but where did it come from?</p><ul><li><em>A version of this piece was first published in <a href="https://www.parapraxismagazine.com/magazine/">Parapraxis magazine</a></em></li></ul><p>We are obsessed with invisible circles.</p><p>“Personal boundaries” – or often just “boundaries” – are nowadays seen as the hallmark of emotional maturity. Wellness influencers promise that if you clarify the line dividing you from those around you, your boyfriend will stop envying your career and start doing the dishes. Children will stay out of your home office. Friends and lovers will stop using you as a screen for their projections. As you are released from everyone else’s psychodrama, your racing thoughts will quiet, and your ability to concentrate will return. You will learn to say the word “no”, protect your time, and double your salary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/what-are-relationship-boundaries-jonah-hill">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Given the mess he will inherit and potential future crises, ‘sticking-plaster politics’ may not sustain public support</p><p>The bigger Britain’s problems get, the more Labour seems to shrink. As almost every economic, social and public sector indicator flashes red, Labour politicians explain that regretfully they will only be able to do a limited amount in government about the worst set of interlocking crises in our modern history.</p><p>The more disenchantment with politics grows, the more narrowly Labour defines the kind of politicians and party members it wants. It excludes or marginalises Corbynistas, leftwingers in general, respected local government radicals such as Jamie Driscoll, and even the mild centre-left organiser Neal Lawson. The few clearly left-leaning figures who remain – for now – in the shadow cabinet, such as Ed Miliband, are briefed against by anonymous Labour sources in the Tory press.

<p>Nicholas Hoult has a blast in this whip-smart, sex and death-filled outing. But it’s the lead who truly shines as the period drama tears through plots packed with bawdy, anarchic fun</p><p>I saw The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos’s film about Queen Anne, at the cinema when it came out, and I remember the loud tutting of some people sitting nearby who seemed outraged by every rude word and sex scene. Clearly, they had expected a period drama in a more traditional sense, and its bawdy take on history wasn’t for them. The Favourite’s co-writer, Tony McNamara takes another cock-eyed look at history with The Great, debuting its third season in the UK at last. I suspect those cinema-goers would approve of this even less than The Favourite.</p><p>It’s their loss. For those yet to fall for its ample charms, The Great plays hard and fast with the rise of Catherine the Great, Empress of all Russia, and her attempts to modernise the nation. But newcomers should not start with season three, and in fact should stop reading now. It is well worth going back to the start to see how everybody got to their positions, and almost requires notes to keep up. It is impossible to accuse The Great of being boring, as every episode romps along at speed, fuelled mostly by those twin engines of every good story, sex and death.</p><p>The Great series three is on Lionsgate+</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/the-great-season-three-review-elle-fanning-absolutely-carries-this-rip-roaring-series">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Living in her childhood town, the two-time Brit award winner is finally content. But, she says, insecurity still creeps in – especially after ferocious scrutiny of her appearance</p><p>Jorja Smith was done with London. It was early 2021, about five years since the singer had left her home in Walsall at 18 to try to make it big in music. She hadn’t done badly: two Brit awards and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/26/mercury-prize-2018-shortlist-nominees-noel-gallagher-florence-and-arctic-monkeys">Mercury prize</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/grammy-nominations-2019-cardi-b-kendrick-lamar-drake-lead">Grammy</a> nominations followed her atmospheric 2018 debut album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/10/jorja-smith-lost-and-found-review-eclectic-silken-slow-jams">Lost &amp; Found</a>. But she was not all that happy. “I got really overwhelmed in London,” she says. “I realised it was the smallest thing: not being able to see the sky. Back home, bro, there’s trees everywhere, whereas here I felt trapped.”</p><p>She moved back to Walsall, where she is renting a cottage while waiting for builders to finish doing up a 400-year-old farmhouse she bought in 2019. With all due respect to the West Midlands market town, it is not where you tend to find young pop-R&amp;B stars, let alone one with 3.7 million Instagram followers who has worked with Drake, Stormzy, FKA twigs, Burna Boy and Kendrick Lamar and walked in more than one fashion show. She now tends to split herself in two: there is Jorja, the performer (she uses air quotes the first time she speaks about herself like this, pastel talons swooping), and Jorja, the girl born down a quiet road of red-brick terraced houses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/14/i-dont-even-know-how-to-be-me-quite-yet-jorja-smith-on-self-doubt-body-positivity-and-her-stunning-second-album">Continue reading...</a>

What matters is how you feel about it</p><p><strong>My husband has a strong urge for sex. I have been sexually unavailable to him because I was pregnant back-to-back with two kids after our marriage.

The BBC suspended the presenter and the police began investigating, although they quickly concluded it was not a matter for them.
