The PlayStation exclusive Horizon franchise will be around "for a very long while" according to Guerrilla Games, which has plans for Aloy and friends way beyond a Forbidden West sequel.

As reported by Games Radar, studio director Jan Bart van Beek spoke during the game developer conference Develop:Brighton and revealed that Guerrilla has 16 plans for future developments.

"We're going to be continuing it for a very long while," he said. "As people probably already know, we're also going to be working on a multiplayer game," something that's "a massive shift for the studio, almost on the same level as doing the first Horizon".
