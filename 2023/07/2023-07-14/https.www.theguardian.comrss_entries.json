Massarella, a Canadian, started a business during lockdown to recreate the polenta, pasta and salad dishes so loved by the Italian side of her family. Her next, entirely illogical step was to take on this small space in the staff canteen of the sustainable fashion factory <a href=\"https://www.appareltasker.com/\">ApparelTasker</a>, though, in a world where rent, rates and food and staffing costs thwart much creativity in cooking, nothing is remotely logical any more. Anyone with enough investment can serve gold-leafed slop in Mayfair, but it requires genuine guts and passion to take on a few tables in Bow that look out on a load of sewing machines.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/14/polentina-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/14/polentina-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review", "date_published": "2023-07-14T11:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 team guides part 22: France", "description": "<p>With the squad seemingly united after the departure of coach Corinne Diacre, France have their eyes on the latter stages of the tournament</p><p><em>This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/women-s-world-cup-2023--guardian-experts--network\">Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 Experts\u2019 Network</a>, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 July.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/14/womens-world-cup-2023-team-guides-part-22-france\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/14/womens-world-cup-2023-team-guides-part-22-france", "date_published": "2023-07-14T11:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018So drained and so exhausted\u2019: readers on severe heat and floods in the US", "description": "<p>With blazing heat across the US making people suffer, Guardian readers share their stories of a summer of extreme weather</p><p>The US has been gripped by extreme weather, with millions of Americans either struggling with severe heat warnings or dealing with floods and tornado damage.</p><p>Parts of the US north-east braced for further thunderstorms and the potential for more floods while the south-west baked in unprecedented heat.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/readers-on-severe-heat-and-floods-in-the-us\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/readers-on-severe-heat-and-floods-in-the-us", "date_published": "2023-07-14T11:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The best recent crime and thrillers \u2013 review roundup", "description": "<p>The Second Murderer by Denise Mina; Beware the Woman by Megan Abbott; Murder in the Family by Cara Hunter; Black Thorn by Sarah Hilary; The Housekeepers by Alex Hay</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-second-murderer-9781787302853\">The Second Murderer</a> by Denise Mina (Harvill Secker, \u00a318.99)</strong><br />Raymond Chandler\u2019s Los Angeles PI Philip Marlowe is reimagined by Mina in a novel that also includes Anne Riordan, who aficionados will remember from Chandler\u2019s 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely, the working title of which was the same as this book. Here, Marlowe is tasked with tracking down Chrissie, only child of stratospherically rich sadist Chadwick Montgomery. The monstrous patriarch isn\u2019t too bothered about being reunited with his daughter \u2013 she\u2019s given him a legitimate grandson, so succession is assured \u2013 and Marlowe, who finds the young woman quickly, isn\u2019t keen to return her. Matters are complicated by the fact that Riordan, now a professional rival, is also on the case, and because the next time Marlowe sees Chrissie she is standing over a corpse in a Skid Row hotel room. Mina, who is a considerably more efficient plotter than Chandler, remains true to his tone and to Marlowe\u2019s character, while cleaning up his attitude to render him more palatable to modern readers: highly recommended.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/beware-the-woman-9780349012490\">Beware the Woman</a> by Megan Abbott (Virago, \u00a318.99)</strong><br />Abbott\u2019s novel centres on a pregnant junior-school teacher, Jacy, who travels from New York with her husband, Jed, to visit her father-in-law in remote upper Michigan. Dr Ash and his loyal housekeeper are friendly enough, at least initially \u2013 and Jacy puts any misgivings down to hormones. However, it gradually becomes clear that unspoken family history simmers beneath the pleasant surface, not least the fact that Jed\u2019s mother died giving birth to him. After Jacy has a miscarriage scare, Dr Ash is increasingly controlling, and Jed sides with him in infantilising his wife and putting her under the care of a judgmental local doctor. Jacy, already struggling with a body that feels no longer her own, grows distrustful as the men override her wishes, effectively imprisoning her. Abbott expertly rachets up the menace towards an unexpected and shocking ending in a claustrophobic and timely chiller about how men deny women agency.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/14/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup", "date_published": "2023-07-14T11:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Helen Graham\u2019s recipe for peanut, date and tahini banoffee pie", "description": "<p>A Middle Eastern twist on this classic sweet treat sees Bubala\u2019s executive chef combine her favourite flavours for a \u2018life-affirming\u2019 result</p><p>This vegan treat is a little bit bonkers: banoffee pie by way of the Middle East.
