You can no longer buy new coins, and all awards and coins will go away after September 12th. The existing approach leads to &quot;clutter&quot; and provides content that some don't believe is all that valuable, Reddit says.

Oh, and he also died at one point (following an extended free dive into an underwater data bank). But in the latest film, <em>Dead Reckoning Part 1</em>, Ethan Hunt faces his toughest opponent yet: an omnipotent AI that could reshape geopolitics as we know it. After defying the laws of physics, it only makes sense that he has to defeat a god.</p><p>As ludicrous as that may sound, it also fits perfectly within the <em>Mission: Impossible </em>series, a universe where Ethan Hunt has been described as the &quot;living manifestation of destiny,&quot; and everyone is well aware that the &quot;Impossible Mission Force&quot; sounds like something pulled out of a comic book. At this point, it's a franchise that exists for Tom Cruise and his collaborators \u2014 most recently, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie \u2014 to go wild with spy gadgets and death-defying stunt sequences. It's made by spy movie geeks, for spy movie geeks.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"d3f0110f7eea48c5bbd8104f8a16c380\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>That's been true of the series from the start. The original TV show centered on grounded spy craft, albeit in a world where people could easily impersonate others with realistic face masks. Brian de Palma's 1996 film was a throwback to paranoid '70s spy thrillers, but it also made room for gadgets like glasses that wirelessly transmitted crystal clear video. And, of course, there's the nail-bitingly tense infiltration of a CIA server room, a scene that infiltrated pop culture for years.</p><p>John Woo's <em>Mission: Impossible 2</em> is far less cerebral, but it also leans heavily into his operatic Hong Kong action style. It's not a great movie, I'll admit, but as a fan of Woo's action films, I can't help but be thrilled by the car chase meet cute, and the balletic finale which morphs from a motorcycle chase into a hand-to-hand fight on a beach.</p><figure><img alt=\"Rebecca Ferguson in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/78eb8e61-2277-11ee-b9ca-d9b15ad1f843\" style=\"height: 1345px; width: 2500px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Paramount Pictures and Skydance</div></figure><p>After a slight hiatus, JJ Abrams rebooted the franchise in 2006 with <em>Mission: Impossible 3</em>, a film that built upon the spy shenanigans from his TV series, <em>Alias</em>. Since then, the franchise has been on a constant quest to one-up itself. 2011's <em>Ghost Protocol</em> goes full on Buster Keaton with every set piece (director Brad Bird essentially turns Ethan Hunt into a character from <em>The Incredibles</em>), culminating in the scene where Cruise himself actually scaled the Burj Khalifa.</p><p>Arriving amid Daniel Craig's James Bond run (which is filled with movies I either love or absolutely hate), and the end of the original Jason Bourne trilogy, <em>Ghost Protocol</em> felt like a throwback to everything that made the <em>Mission: Impossible</em>TV show so addictive. There's a loyal and highly-skilled team, a nefarious villain and tons of gadgets on display. But crucially, things don't always work out as Hunt and crew expect, which makes the franchise more relatable to all of us with failing gadgets. (Every time my iPhone crashes, I can't help but be grateful I'm not climbing the Burj Khalifa with only a single high-tech gecko glove.)</p><p>With the arrival of Christopher McQuarrie, who directed 2015's <em>Rogue Nation</em> and its sequels, <em>Mission: Impossible </em>found a groove that differentiated it from most other modern franchises. Almost like action film jazz, McQuarrie and Cruise frequently came up with ideas for set pieces and built movies around them. Scripts were reworked on the fly. Normally this would spell disaster, but McQuarrie ended up thriving in the chaos. Together with stunt coordinator Scott Eastwood, he also managed to push the series into astounding new practical set pieces (see: Ethan Hunt hanging out of a plane in <em>Rogue Nation</em>, or the extended skydiving sequence in <em>Fallout</em>).</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/78eb8e60-2277-11ee-9ffe-430c584c0c1f\" style=\"height: 1094px; width: 2500px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Paramount Pictures and Skydance</div></figure><p><em>Dead Reckoning Part 1</em> builds on McQuarrie's previous entries. This time, Hunt and a new companion (Hayley Atwell's Grace) are chased through Rome's narrow streets while driving a souped-up, tiny Fiat. He base-jumps off of a mountain using a motorcycle. He fights on a real train speeding along at 60MPH. All the while, he's trying to stop the villainous AI, known only as The Entity.</p><p>On the face of it, <em>Dead Reckoning </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html\"><ins>shares plenty with </ins><em><ins>Mrs. Davis</ins></em></a>, the latest show co-created by Damon Lindelof which also features a tough protagonist against an all-powerful AI. The film also dabbles in similar themes: Surely an omnipotent artificial intelligence would also inspire near-religious devotion. In <em>Dead Reckoning</em>, that's embodied by Gabriel, the angelically named sociopath played by Esai Morales.</p><div id=\"4cb1499c01734c7fa1dd0d907b59db97\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>While the film rarely slows down to explore the true impact of AI, Hunt and his team \u2014 Simon Pegg's Benji, Ving Rhames' Luther \u2014 instantly grasp the larger implications. Whoever can control the AI could basically control the world \u2014 not merely through physical force, but by defining truth and reality itself. An AI could erase a person from surveillance footage, or turn them into someone else entirely. Nothing can be trusted. As we grapple with the impact of ChatGPT and generative AI in real life, it\u2019s hard not to feel like we\u2019re on a similar path. (It's also funny to see in the midst of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, which are directly tied to complaints about studios taking advantage of creatives with AI.)</p><p>As much as I love other action film franchises \u2013 like <em>John Wick\u2019s</em> increasingly elaborate choreography, or the sheer ridiculousness of the <em>Fast and the Furious \u2013</em><em>Mission: Impossible</em> remains uniquely enjoyable. It\u2019s committed to delivering astonishing practical stunt work. It\u2019s self-aware just enough to poke fun at itself. And a part of me hopes that somehow, a team of geeks can also fight back against the excesses of AI.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-review-185939336.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-review-185939336.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-14T18:59:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Brimstone's decarbonized cement passes crucial third-party strength test", "description": "<p>Let\u2019s end the week with a bit of good news for our future as a species on this floating ball of dirt.

This is a big deal, as portland cement is not some niche product, as it comprises 95 percent of all cement produced in the United States. Chances are, if you are in a building made from cement, you\u2019re surrounded by ordinary portland cement (OPC).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><a href=\"https://www.brimstone.com/\">Brimstone</a> says the carbon-negative cement is identical in \u201call respects\u201d to OPC, including performance, safety, and overall chemical composition. The only difference is that it wasn't manufactured using the conventional, carbon-intensive methods. The company also notes that its \u201cstrength, workability, durability, and compatibility with steel and other materials\u201d make it an ideal choice to \u201cbuild structures safely and efficiently.\u201d</p><p>There are plenty of other alternative building materials out there, but this is actual portland cement, so adopting Brimstone\u2019s product won\u2019t force \u201cmillions of construction workers to get retrained to use a new material,\u201d according to CEO Cody Finke. He also touts that the product will be \u201cequal or lower cost to other options\u201d and will \u201cslash carbon emissions.\u201d</p><p>Being as this is the same industry-standard portland cement used for over 150 years, the company won\u2019t have to jump the usual regulatory hurdles when developing a new building material, with the company boasting \u201cthe same buildings, bridges and roads being built today can be built tomorrow without carbon.\u201d</p><p>How did it manage such a feat? Conventional cement production involves heating limestone to ultra-high temperatures, which releases large quantities of CO2 embedded in the rock. Brimstone went with carbon-free calcium silicate rock, so there\u2019s no CO2 to release. As a matter of fact, the process generates trace magnesium compounds that absorb pre-existing CO2 from the air, making this concrete carbon-negative.</p><p>It\u2019s no secret that traditional cement is a major contributor to the world\u2019s climate problem, as cement production accounts for 7.5 percent of global CO2 emissions and 5.5 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.

You don\u2019t have to fumble with a cable when trying to get a quick charge for a device at the end of a long day, and you\u2019re less likely to trip over wires. But finding a truly good charger isn\u2019t as simple as looking for the model with the best charging speed and most impressive spec sheet. We\u2019ll let you know what to look for when shopping for a single-device charger, and recommend some good models that are worth your attention whether you use an \u200biPhone or Android smartphone.</p><h2>What to look for in a wireless charger</h2><p>It\u2019s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the size and features of the phone you have right now. Resist that urge \u2014 this is an accessory you\u2019ll probably have for years, and you don\u2019t want to replace it every time you buy a new handset. Instead, think about the phones you\u2019re likely to use down the road. If you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you\u2019ll want a more universal design.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You\u2019ll also want something that accepts a variety of device sizes. Certain wireless charging stations don\u2019t work well with the iPhone 13 mini or other particularly small phones, for instance. If you think you may change phone sizes at some point, a pad charger is a wiser choice. With that said, you\u2019ll still want to pay attention to any potentially limiting design features, such as prominent cradles and lips.</p><p>Also, consider wireless chargers with modular components. While you\u2019ll have to invest exclusively in one company\u2019s ecosystem, this gives you room to grow as your gadget needs change. You can add a charger for a second phone or smartwatch, and some systems even offer modular batteries to supply power on the go. Just be sure to look at a<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html\"> multi-device charger</a> if there\u2019s a very good chance you\u2019ll expand your setup in the future.</p><h2>Where and how will you use your charger?</h2><figure><img alt=\"iPhone on wireless charger\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c9a24a20-b7a0-11ed-b3cd-16d5d607f8d1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Pontus Wellgraf on Unsplash</div></figure><p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside for quick access in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging. If you intend to place your charger on a nightstand, you\u2019ll usually want a pad. With a stand, even a dim always-on display can prove distracting when you\u2019re trying to sleep. You may also want a wireless charging pad if your phone will sit on a low table, as it might be easier to grab in a rush. Look at compact models if space is tight.</p><p>On your desk, you may prefer a stand to quickly glance at alerts or make video calls. Want something more travel-friendly? A puck or similarly minimalist design is typically best. You may also want a charger with a battery (either modular or built-in) for camping or whenever an outlet isn\u2019t nearby.</p><h2>Performance matters, to a point</h2><p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html\"> fast charger</a> can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits.</p><p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you\u2019ll need a MagSafe charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you\u2019ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you\u2019ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p><p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Google\u2019s second-generation Pixel Stand, for example, delivers up to 23W for a Pixel 6 Pro or<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html\"> Pixel 7 Pro</a>. Optimized designs like this can make sense if you\u2019re loyal to one brand. Be sure to get a charger that still works well with other manufacturers\u2019 phones, though, as you don\u2019t want to replace your accessory (or endure sluggish speeds) if you switch brands.</p><h2>Quality, box contents and the little details</h2><figure><img alt=\"iPhone on wireless charging stand\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/50a7df30-b7a1-11ed-bfef-883a433a4df2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Michael Soledad on Unsplash</div></figure><p>Once you\u2019ve chosen the form factor and performance levels that meet your needs, you\u2019ll want to consider the fit and finish. You\u2019re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in quality could make the difference between joy and frustration.</p><p>If your charger doesn\u2019t use MagSafe, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won\u2019t slide around. If you\u2019re buying a stand, check that it won\u2019t tip over or wobble.</p><p>Pay attention to what\u2019s included in the box. Some models don\u2019t include power adapters, and may even ask you to reuse your phone\u2019s USB charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it. Also, some cables and chargers are better than others. A USB-C charger is more future-proof, while braided cables may be less likely to break or tangle.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p><p>By now, you should know what to look for. While it would be impossible for us to test every charger, we\u2019ve tried numerous models and have some favorites.</p><h2>Best overall wireless charging pad: Otterbox OtterSpot Wireless Charging System</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s no shortage of portable wireless chargers, but it\u2019s rare that you can find one which is as well-suited to your desk as it is your bag.

The base unit is stable, includes a power adapter and accommodates a wide range of phone sizes. But it really shines when you want to leave home. You can buy as many as three 5,000mAh portable batteries that optionally stack on top of the base to recharge, and serve as completely wireless chargers on the go. Those batteries can power wired devices through USB-C ports, too.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the fastest charger given its 10W output, and the base alone is normally expensive at $55 (though it\u2019s down to $38 as we write this). If you want a station you really can use everywhere, though, the OtterSpot is a top pick that can grow along with your needs.</p><h2>Runner up wireless charging pad: Belkin BoostCharge Pro Portable Wireless Charger Pad</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s easy to find wireless charging pucks that are fast or portable, but rarely both \u2014 and certainly not as well-considered as<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e6618fee-bbbf-4638-9bf5-e216442c18d0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Belkin&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNjYxOGZlZS1iYmJmLTQ2MzgtOWJmNS1lMjE2NDQyYzE4ZDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVsa2luLmNvbS9wb3J0YWJsZS13aXJlbGVzcy1jaGFyZ2VyLXBhZC13aXRoLW9mZmljaWFsLW1hZ3NhZmUtY2hhcmdpbmctMTV3L1AtV0lBMDA0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFmZTNkMWU4LTU1ZTEtNDBkNS1hNDYzLTEzMzZkZDkxNmYxOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR1SwMD20XeGVPvHCRBqK7HI_Tge020v6EI1R2OEJa0b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fportable-wireless-charger-pad-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w%2FP-WIA004.html&amp;uuid=Om9sUhx2NwtpJSz719415\"> Belkin\u2019s BoostCharge Pro Portable Wireless Charger Pad</a>. Its extremely compact design not only offers 15W MagSafe charging (plus Qi charging when flat), but includes a kickstand that lets you watch videos while you power up. Add a long 6.6ft braided cable and this is an ideal charger whether you\u2019re traveling or catching up on TV shows.</p><p>The emphasis on MagSafe may make the Belkin BoostCharge less appealing for Android devices. It\u2019s a definite step up from Apple\u2019s more affordable but simpler MagSafe Charger, however. And importantly, you have the choice of buying Belkin\u2019s accessory with ($80) or without ($60) a power adapter.</p><h2>Best budget wireless charging pad: Anker 315 Wireless Charger</h2><p></p><p>If you just need the basics,<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1XaXJlbGVzcy1DaGFyZ2luZy1Db21wYXRpYmxlLUluY2x1ZGVkL2RwL0IwQjQ2OUhMTkw_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbXctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFmZTNkMWU4LTU1ZTEtNDBkNS1hNDYzLTEzMzZkZDkxNmYxOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXM1cKAiN5HW9eMUUcGAdwn4Tcym6hSYK7s0ZBVsiNkC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Included%2Fdp%2FB0B469HLNL&amp;uuid=WAGzMGPGCAGIHxKT23419\"> Anker\u2019s 315 Wireless Charger</a> offers significant value from a well-known name. It tops out at 10W (7.5W for iPhones), doesn\u2019t include a power adapter and relies on a microUSB cable, but it also costs only $15. Even if you have to buy an adapter, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better deal.</p><h2>Best overall wireless charging stand: Belkin BoostCharge 15W Wireless Charging Stand</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s fierce competition in the wireless charging stand space, and it\u2019s easy to get a good 15W charger if you\u2019re willing to pay.

The lip at the bottom will keep your phone stable, and dual charging coils let you use the device while watching a video in landscape mode.</p><p>There\u2019s no MagSafe or other device-specific charging optimizations on this one. And like many wireless charging stands, this doesn\u2019t officially support the iPhone 13 mini and similarly small handsets. But there\u2019s otherwise little to complain about here \u2014 this is a no-nonsense power solution at a good price.</p><h2>Runner-up wireless charging stand: Spigen ArcField PF2102</h2><p></p><p>There aren\u2019t many great options for wireless chargers that use Samsung\u2019s fast power delivery technology, particularly if you want a stand.

The new version should still function best as a smart alarm clock, as its 5.5-inch panel is a more natural fit on a bedside table than the larger Echo Show models. Its ambient light sensor automatically lowers the screen's brightness when it's dark, while a tap-to-snooze function lets you smack the top of the device for a few more minutes of rest. It's still an Echo, so it can also stream music, pull up weather info, control smart home devices and do other Alexa-related tasks. And while no device like this is ideal for the privacy-conscious, there's at least a physical camera shutter and a mic mute button.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The new Echo Show 5 slightly improves the processor and speaker system, though it still won't be as fast or full-sounding as the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg0REM0TFc2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFwcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTVkZDA5MTItNzkwNy00MmUxLWE2OTMtZGNhMGIwNjNiYjY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAATvby5w7z50_Yuq8H14DMLrWq1u1kWgFMcl7ilblz-Fm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB084DC4LW6\">Echo Show 8</a>, our chief recommendation for those who want an Alexa smart display. (That 8-inch display is now available for $75, which is $15 more than its Prime Day price.) Likewise, the 2-megapixel camera is mediocre for video calls, and the 960 x 480 resolution display is far from luxurious for viewing photos. Still, if you regularly use Alexa, have limited space and want to pay as little as possible for a competent display, the Echo Show 5 makes sense at this price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-is-back-on-sale-for-50-144458072.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-is-back-on-sale-for-50-144458072.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-14T14:44:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best smart home gadgets for 2023", "description": "<p>Whether you\u2019re just dipping your toes into the smart home space or adding new devices to your growing setup, there have never been more IoT gadgets for you to choose from. But before you dive in, we have some advice. For one, don\u2019t try to outfit your entire smart home in one go \u2013 that goes for both newbies and those familiar with smart home gadgets. Not only can this be quite expensive, we think it\u2019s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them, or to see how they pair with the rest of your home\u2019s ecosystem. And if you haven\u2019t already, you should decide which voice assistant you prefer. We offer some advice on how to pick the right one below, along with our suggestions for the best of each smart device category, with alternate suggestions where appropriate.</p><h2>Before you start, pick a voice assistant</h2><p>While plenty of the best smart home devices are platform agnostic, there are some \u2014 smart speakers and smart displays in particular \u2014 that require you to choose your voice assistant. Currently, that means deciding if you\u2019ll use the Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa on a regular basis (I\u2019ll address Siri in a moment.) They\u2019re both compatible with various smart home products from light bulbs to robot vacuums, but there are certain devices that work best with either Google or Amazon. Nest products, for example, are more compatible and have more functionality with Google-powered speakers and displays. They can still work with Amazon devices, but certain features might be disabled. The same holds true with Amazon products: They work better if they\u2019re in the same ecosystem.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>So how do you choose between Alexa and Google Assistant? It really depends on your personal preferences. Do you listen to Audible, watch Prime Video and tend to do a lot of shopping on Amazon? Then you might lean toward an Alexa-powered smart home device. Do you use a lot of Google services like YouTube and Google Podcasts? A Google-powered device might be best.</p><p>If you want a voice assistant that\u2019s great at answering questions, Google Assistant tends to be better than Alexa. Amazon\u2019s helper, on the other hand, currently supports more smart home products. The company\u2019s smart speakers and displays also support the Zigbee smart home protocol, and some devices even have built-in smart home hubs. Both Google and Amazon devices can sync with your calendar, though Google\u2019s tend to work better with Google services. Plus, if you already have an Android phone, you might be more comfortable with Google Assistant anyway.</p><p>But what about Siri? Apple\u2019s assistant supports voice commands as well, but it doesn't have as many compatible devices as Google or Amazon. The HomePod mini and the (now discontinued) HomePod are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market at the moment, too. That said, it\u2019s not too hard to find Apple HomeKit-compatible gear as more third-party companies add support for it, but you currently have a smaller pool of devices to choose from.</p><h2>Best smart speaker: Sonos Era 100</h2><p></p><p>Our recommendation for the best smart speaker is the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTEwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODU5Y2U0MTgtZmU2Mi00YTRmLTk1NmYtMzAzYmU5ZTA1YTFmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdzzLNyIaAWtF5hlcu_AkSLL0HYMlTnGY7HwGt022nHY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-100\">Sonos Era 100</a>. It\u2019s compact enough to fit in most areas in your home, but more importantly, it delivers excellent audio quality that\u2019s superior to a lot of other smart speakers out there. When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room \u2014 which requires the iOS app \u2014 the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn\u2019t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it\u2019s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable. It\u2019s also compatible with a slew of streaming services to play music, including major ones like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>The main benefit that a Sonos speaker brings over the competition is that it\u2019s a gateway to a multi-room audio setup that you can build out over time. It\u2019s also convenient if you plan on building a home theater setup later on, as the Era 100 integrates well with Sonos soundbars.</p><h2>Runner-up: Amazon Echo Studio</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FY2hvLVN0dWRpby9kcC9CMDdHOVkzWk1DP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWduLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NTljZTQxOC1mZTYyLTRhNGYtOTU2Zi0zMDNiZTllMDVhMWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcrizQP0M3dw26ikW8a9J-cqOikD_fIqVampzaQ6QdwW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEcho-Studio%2Fdp%2FB07G9Y3ZMC\">Amazon\u2019s Echo Studio</a> is a great choice if you know you prefer Alexa to the Google Assistant for voice control. The latest Studio, which was just announced, has been retooled with new spatial audio processing that improves on the company\u2019s previous 3D sound technology. It also has an improved frequency range, with increased mid-range clarity and deeper bass, and a built-in smart home hub for connecting things like smart lights, switches, plugs and more. And if you have a Fire TV device or an actual Fire TV set, you can pair the Studio with it to get a killer home-theater sound setup.</p><h2>Best $100 smart speaker: Amazon Echo</h2><p></p><p>For those with tighter budgets, there are a handful of smart speakers around $100. We <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-smart-speakers-guide-google-amazon-echo-sonos.html\">recommend</a> picking up one of the three latest smart speakers from either Google, Amazon or Apple.

Our colleague Nate Ingraham <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-2020-review-130046336.html\">said</a> its bass is impressive and the mid-range frequencies are pretty powerful.

The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html\">Echo Show 8</a>, on the other hand, is perfectly sized for a living room and most other rooms in the house. Like other Alexa-powered smart displays, it supports plenty of video streaming services including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix and it comes with a couple of built-in browsers that you can use to surf the web on its touchscreen. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t support YouTube, which is a pretty notable omission considering how ubiquitous the service is. As a workaround, you can access it via the aforementioned browsers, but the experience isn\u2019t as smooth as if it were a native app.</p><p>You can use the Show 8 to make video calls with any phone or tablet with the Alexa app. Alternatively, it supports Skype, Zoom and Amazon\u2019s own Chime service. Like the Nest Hub Max, the Show 8 also has an optional face-tracking feature that follows your movements around the room during a call.</p><h2>Best Google smart display: Nest Hub (2nd gen)</h2><p></p><p>Our favorite Google-powered smart display is the second-generation <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtSHViLTJuZC1HZW4tU21hcnQtSG9tZS1EaXNwbGF5LXdpdGgtR29vZ2xlLUFzc2lzdGFudC1DaGFyY29hbC80ODg0ODkzNjkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1OWNlNDE4LWZlNjItNGE0Zi05NTZmLTMwM2JlOWUwNWExZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXvixQCgcTGabKbKa8ryx4FGXn6wlqoW9QjWLlBXd8lm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-2nd-Gen-Smart-Home-Display-with-Google-Assistant-Charcoal%2F488489369\">Nest Hub</a>. It has a 7-inch screen, which makes it just big enough to fit in most rooms in the house. The size also makes it work well as a digital photo frame. You can set it up to pull in pictures of friends and family from your Google Photos library, and there\u2019s a smart algorithm that automatically uses the best shots while avoiding the blurry ones. As you might expect, you can also use the display to watch YouTube, Netflix and other streaming services.</p><p>Plus, a smart display without a camera is great if you want to place it in more intimate places like the bedroom, where you might be more protective of your privacy.

One benefit of the camera is that it gives you the option for Face Match, a feature that automatically recognizes individual members of the house and then displays the information that\u2019s pertinent only to them, like calendar alerts.</p><p>Additionally, the camera adds a unique gestures feature that lets you play and pause media simply by holding up your hand to the screen, which is convenient if you need to stop the music without having to shout across the room. The Google Nest Hub Max also has better audio quality than the Hub thanks to its larger speakers.</p><h2>Best smart lights: Philips Hue</h2><p></p><p>One of the easiest ways to introduce smart home technology into your home is to swap out your existing light bulbs with smart ones. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html\">Smart light bulbs</a> let you control your lighting remotely, either via an app or with your voice. They add automation and scheduling to the mix, so you can have them turn on and off at certain times of the day. Some also let you adjust the smart bulb's brightness and color temperature, or even let you create a custom light scene.</p><p>Our favorite smart lighting products come from Philips Hue, and the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLUh1ZS1TdGFydGVyLUNvbXBhdGlibGUtQXNzaXN0YW50L2RwL0IwOTVLUVNYWUg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ24tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1OWNlNDE4LWZlNjItNGE0Zi05NTZmLTMwM2JlOWUwNWExZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUWaJdB-p7nuHaIln7Res2Gr0_SQeMPQvdSyFfHYjsF5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Hue-Starter-Compatible-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB095KQSXYH%3F\">White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit</a> is a particularly good entry point as it includes three Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 60W LED smart bulbs; a Hue hub that lets you control up to 50 lights; and a Smart Button if you want to have the option of turning off the lights without having your phone around.</p><p>This kit offers lots of versatility in lighting styles; you can change not just the brightness of the smart light bulb but also the color temperature and experiment with all different shades of the rainbow, decking out your room in whatever light scene you desire.

Not only can you find them pretty much anywhere, but they\u2019ll work with Google, Amazon and Apple\u2019s HomeKit. Since all the bulbs connect to the Hue hub via the Zigbee protocol (and not your home\u2019s WiFi), it tends to be more reliable and it won\u2019t slow down your home internet connection either.</p><h2>Best budget smart lights: TP-Link Kasa Smart WiFi Light Bulb</h2><p></p><p>TP-Link makes a bunch of affordable IoT gadgets and we liked the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LYXNhLVNtYXJ0LUNoYW5naW5nLURpbW1hYmxlLUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjA4VEI4WjVIRj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1nbi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODU5Y2U0MTgtZmU2Mi00YTRmLTk1NmYtMzAzYmU5ZTA1YTFmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAW2qFQsBg5f6Nwlh5qgdyThm3-RFfnT2i1F7j6KBnJWk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKasa-Smart-Changing-Dimmable-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08TB8Z5HF\">Kasa Smart WiFi light bulbs</a> enough to name them our favorite budget devices in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html\">smart lights guide</a>. They're easy to install and remain reliably connected, plus their companion mobile app is clean and easy to use. These are full-color smart bulbs and we like how changing up the color of your lights is as easy as dragging your finger around a color wheel in the app. Of course, you can stick with different temperatures of white light too, adjusting from warm to cool as needed.</p><p>You can also set schedules, allowing your lights to turn on and off at specific times throughout the day, and the app's \"usage\" section shows you each bulb's energy use over time, plus an estimate of how much energy you\u2019re saving by using a smart light instead of a regular one. Ultimately, we like how much value these bulbs pack into an attractive price tag \u2014 a four-pack typically costs $40, but you can sometimes find it on sale for as low as $30.</p><h2>Best security camera: Wyze Cam V3</h2><p></p><p>Home security cameras are helpful for catching intruders, nabbing porch pirates or just keeping an eye on your pet while you\u2019re out of the house.

Plus, thanks to its IP65 waterproof rating it can be used either indoors or outdoors, and it has color night vision that\u2019s capable of recording nighttime video in full color.</p><p>Like previous-gen models, it sends alerts to your phone whenever it detects sound or motion. You can also customize Motion Detection Zones that allow you to adjust just how sensitive you want the motion sensor to be. It also offers 24/7 continuous video recording that you can store via a 32GB microSD card (not included).</p><p>We especially like that the Wyze doesn\u2019t require a subscription; free cloud storage is included with the purchase, and you\u2019ll always have access to the last 14 days of recording on the app. Be warned, however, that the free account can only hold 12-second clips every five minutes. If you want it to record unlimited motion, consider upgrading to a Cam Plus subscription, which includes additional features like alerting you if it detects a person or a package. Fortunately, it\u2019s inexpensive at $2 a month or $15 a year.</p><h2>Best wireless security camera: Blink cameras</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s a lot to like about the Wyze Cam V3, but it needs to be plugged in.

They both run on AA batteries, so you can place them anywhere you want, and they have a battery life of around the cells need replacing. The Blink Outdoor is weather resistant, but otherwise both cameras are the same. They both have night vision, motion detection and two-way audio. You can store clips in the cloud via the Blink Subscription Plan or you can also save events locally to a Sync Module 2 via a USB flash drive (sold separately). Unfortunately, Blink works with Alexa only, which could be a non-starter for some.</p><h2>Best doorbell camera: Arlo Essential Video Doorbell</h2><p></p><p>If you want a camera specifically for your front door, a doorbell camera makes more sense than a standalone option.

It delivers high-quality HDR footage along with a 180-degree view so you can see a person from head to toe and it can ring your phone with a video call whenever someone rings the bell. There\u2019s also two-way audio so you can talk to whoever\u2019s at the door.</p><p>A highlight of this doorbell is that it comes with a three-month trial to Arlo\u2019s Smart subscription service, which includes a motion detection feature that can tell the difference between a person, package, vehicle or animal. Senior Editor Devindra Hardawar <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html\">said</a> that he really appreciated the package alerts; it did a good job of telling him whenever UPS dropped off a box. It\u2019s such a useful feature, in fact, that we recommend keeping the service beyond the trial period.</p><p>You should be able to use the Arlo Essential Video Doorbell with either Google or Amazon\u2019s smart displays, but it won\u2019t be fully integrated. You\u2019ll be able to view the webcam on the display, but if someone rings the doorbell, they won\u2019t automatically show up on the screen.

We recommended it in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">budget robot vacuum guide</a> as it did a great job cleaning hard and carpeted surfaces. (We liked the Shark Ion RV761, too, but the Roomba 694 is a newer model.) Plus, the app is really easy to use for luddites and the tech savvy alike. And just in case you don\u2019t have access to the app \u2014 maybe you left your phone in another room, for example \u2014 the Roomba 694 has manual controls as well.</p><p>One of the reasons the Roomba 694 cleans so well is that it has a three-stage system that tells it to suck up dirt while also navigating around obstacles. When it encounters an especially filthy area, it focuses in on it, making sure it\u2019s clean before moving on. You can also manually instruct it to clean a specific spot in case you need it. And if you prefer to talk to your robot vacuum cleaner, the Roomba 694 works well with both Alexa and Google Assistant.</p><h2>Best high-end robot vacuum: iRobot Roomba s9+</h2><p></p><p>If you don\u2019t mind spending more money on an even better robot vacuum, we recommend the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9pUm9ib3QtQXV0b21hdGljLURpc3Bvc2FsLUNvbm5lY3RlZC1BbnRpLUFsbGVyZ2VuL2RwL0IwN1FYTTJWNlg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ24tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1OWNlNDE4LWZlNjItNGE0Zi05NTZmLTMwM2JlOWUwNWExZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdISNj2Q82kUotx6EwWM0th8Oo7KTo0cC5ytAcGMkggi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiRobot-Automatic-Disposal-Connected-Anti-Allergen%2Fdp%2FB07QXM2V6X\">Roomba s9+</a>. It has the strongest suction power of any Roomba, so it's not surprise that it cleans both carpet and hard floors well. It has a mapping technology that helps it keep track of all the different rooms in your home to clean it in the most efficient way possible. But arguably the best thing about the s9+ is that after each job, it automatically empties its bin into a clean base that can hold about 60 days worth of dirt. In short, the s9+ is worth the splurge if you want a robot vacuum that doesn\u2019t require a lot of attention.</p><h2>Best smart plug: Wyze Plug</h2><p></p><p>Smart plugs are the easiest way to add a bit of connectivity to your home without spending a ton of money.

We especially love that it offers two-factor authentication (the rest of the smart plugs we tried did not have this). You can schedule it to go on and off at different times and days. The Wyze Plug works with Alexa, Google Assistant (though you\u2019ll have to go through the Google Home app to pair it) plus the IFTTT service.</p><h2>Runner up: TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini</h2><p></p><p>Another solid option is TP-Link\u2019s <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LYXNhLVNtYXJ0LVJlcXVpcmVkLUNlcnRpZmllZC1FUDEwL2RwL0IwOTE2OTlaM1c_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ24tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1OWNlNDE4LWZlNjItNGE0Zi05NTZmLTMwM2JlOWUwNWExZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARpwf-EqGKEu74FpyDSN4lVwjCSm36Aaz8YA5PYMUWdl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKasa-Smart-Required-Certified-EP10%2Fdp%2FB091699Z3W\">Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini</a>. We didn\u2019t find the app as easy to use \u2014 installation was not as seamless as the Wyze \u2014 but once you get past that, it\u2019s still just as capable. Just like with the Wyze Plug, you can schedule the plug to turn on and off at certain times and days of the week. On top of that, the Wi-Fi connected Kasa actually offers scheduling around sunrise or sunset times, a feature that the Wyze lacks. It works with Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, IFTTT plus Samsung SmartThings.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-14T14:40:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta blocks EU users from accessing Threads through a VPN", "description": "<p>Don't try to sign up for Threads through a virtual private network (VPN) if you live in Europe.

All they need to do is plug it into their TV\u2019s HDMI port, connect it to WiFi and then they\u2019ll have access to pretty much all of the streamable content they could ask for. There are apps for Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and even more niche services like Criterion Channel, so chances are they will be able to watch whatever they want on it. And, who knows, maybe they\u2019ll find new things to binge for free on The Roku Channel. The on-screen interface is easy to navigate, too, and we appreciate that the Roku remote that comes with the dongle can be used to control the TV itself, including power and volume.

It\u2019s a relatively compact mouse with comfortably textured side grips, a speedy scroll wheel, and Logitech claims its SilentTouch technology reduces click noise by 90 percent. It\u2019ll connect to their computer of choice via Bluetooth or with the included receiver, and students can customize the side buttons using Logitech\u2019s Options software. But arguably the best thing about this mouse is its battery life \u2014 it\u2019ll last roughly two years on one AA battery, so they might be able to go a couple of semesters without even thinking about changing it.</p><h2>Anker 341 7-in-1 USB-C hub</h2><p></p><p>If your student invested in a new laptop recently, chances are they are sorely lacking in the ports department. Most of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\">best laptops</a> available today only have a couple of USB-C ports built in, with maybe a lone USB-A connector if you\u2019re lucky. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1VcGdyYWRlZC1EZWxpdmVyeS1QaXhlbGJvb2stQTgzNDYwQTIvZHAvQjA3WlZLVFA1My8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTh6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNzcxNjZiZS01YWM2LTM4MDYtOTk1ZC03ZmM4MjVmZmU0YTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAedpHpKA9DcufO8ys0jPXMoPhkOYx-Pf4jPJRYr-nWyz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Upgraded-Delivery-Pixelbook-A83460A2%2Fdp%2FB07ZVKTP53%2F\">Anker\u2019s 7-in-1 USB-C hub</a> can make their academic lives much easier by giving them a bunch of extra ports when they need them most. If they ever need to transfer photos from an SD card or upload portions of a project from a thumb drive, this hub will let them do so by only taking up one of their laptop\u2019s built-in USB-C connectors. The hub itself even has an open USB-C port that supports passthrough charging up to 85W, which means they\u2019ll never run out of battery, even in the middle of laborious tasks.</p><h2>8BitDo Pro 2</h2><p></p><p>Academic life will quickly become overwhelming if it\u2019s all work and no play. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS84Qml0ZG8tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUNvbnRyb2xsZXItU3dpdGNoLUFuZHJvaWQtUmFzcGJlcnJ5L2RwL0IwOFhZOEg5RDU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTh6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNzcxNjZiZS01YWM2LTM4MDYtOTk1ZC03ZmM4MjVmZmU0YTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASHM3bM_wfmbQBYBywYdTMCRHA_DNgARtRK_luSJKfN1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry%2Fdp%2FB08XY8H9D5\">8Bitdo\u2019s Pro 2</a> controller can make a student\u2019s game time more enjoyable and comfortable. In general, 8Bitdo\u2019s controllers are more ergonomic than, say, relying on a keyboard and mouse when playing certain PC games. They\u2019re also a dramatic improvement over the Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons which, if we\u2019re honest, aren\u2019t the most comfortable to use for long stretches of time. The Pro 2 is compatible with the Switch, Windows, macOS, Android and Raspberry Pi, and they can map functions to buttons using its companion smartphone app. Your student will appreciate that they can charge it up with any USB-C cable they have lying around, but also that they can remove the battery pack and power it with AA batteries if they want to avoid frequent recharges.</p><h2>Echo Dot</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlCOFYxTFozP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4ei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzc3MTY2YmUtNWFjNi0zODA2LTk5NWQtN2ZjODI1ZmZlNGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdarswg8NUb07YGc6Qf5krZKy8ysHXYhLBXE03Zy6u7m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09B8V1LZ3\">Echo Dot</a> is Amazon\u2019s most popular smart speaker for a reason: It\u2019s small, it sounds pretty good for its size, and it does a lot more than just play music. Students will like the fact that it won't take up much space on their desks and that they can ask Alexa to play music from Spotify, Apple Music and other services whenever they want to have an impromptu dorm-room dance party. And, since it plugs into a wall outlet, they never have to remember to charge the Echo Dot like they would with a portable speaker. What's more, when an assignment stumps them, students can consult Alexa for help. Are we suggesting they ask Alexa for the answers to all their homework conundrums? Not exactly, but at the very least, it\u2019ll be fun to see how much the voice assistant actually knows about any given topic.</p><h2>Anker Powerline cables</h2><p></p><p>When you're a student, there\u2019s nothing worse than realizing your iPhone is down to 2 percent battery in the middle of a long day filled with classes, extracurriculars and study sessions. The charging cable that came with your phone has probably served you well, but having a second, longer cable can allow you to power up in dire situations even when the closest outlet is across the room.

All they\u2019ll need to do is remember one master password, and that will give them access to all of their other login information. 1Password\u2019s browser extensions will even automatically fill in the right usernames and passwords for the websites they\u2019re trying to access, and when the software spots a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-password-managers-130023333.html\">weak password</a> in their vault, it\u2019ll suggest ways to make it stronger.</p><h2>Otterbox Fast Charge power bank 15,000</h2><p></p><p>An accessory that a student will likely never leave home without is a power bank, and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL2Zhc3QtY2hhcmdlLXBvd2VyLWJhbmstdXNiLWEtYW5kLXVzYi1jLWFuZC0xMDAwMC1tYWgtZ3JleS83OC04MDY5MC5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzc3MTY2YmUtNWFjNi0zODA2LTk5NWQtN2ZjODI1ZmZlNGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUA5e5IPF5rtWazOYzDu0M34AAe1QE_z8wFPVZJG259V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Ffast-charge-power-bank-usb-a-and-usb-c-and-10000-mah-grey%2F78-80690.html%3F\">Otterbox\u2019s 15,000mAh Fast Charge battery</a> is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">one of our top picks</a>. It has a simple, not-too-heavy design that includes one 18W USB-C port and an equally powerful USB-A port, allowing them to power up two devices simultaneously. In our testing, its capacity allowed it to provide two additional full charges to iPhones and Samsung Galaxy handsets. It also didn\u2019t lose too much charge when sitting dormant either, which means the student in your life can toss it in their backpack, forget about it, and know that when their phone\u2019s close to death a few weeks later, they can pull it out for a top-up. Just make note that Otterbox offers 10,000mAh, 15,000mAh and 20,000mAh versions of this pack, so choose the proper capacity when you buy.</p><h2>Chipolo One</h2><p></p><p>We all forget things now and then, but students can be prone to leaving things behind, especially when they\u2019re running out the door to get to class. A <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaGlwb2xvLU9ORS1Mb3VkZXN0LVJlc2lzdGFudC1CbHVldG9vdGgvZHAvQjA4MzJZQ1dIVi8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTh6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNzcxNjZiZS01YWM2LTM4MDYtOTk1ZC03ZmM4MjVmZmU0YTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWUtqIOPpXui24d7MbBvoyEnndt7poUzToPZLxCNi7fs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Loudest-Resistant-Bluetooth%2Fdp%2FB0832YCWHV%2F\">Chipolo One</a> tracker can help them make sure to take their keys, wallet, bag or jacket with them by alerting them when their belongings have been left behind. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html\">In our testing</a>, Chipolo\u2019s separation alerts kicked in after moving only a couple hundred feet away from the item in question, which means the student in your life won\u2019t go far before they find out that they\u2019re missing something. Chipolo also doesn\u2019t discriminate between operating systems \u2014 anyone with an iPhone or an Android device can download the companion app and use the tracker to keep tabs on important stuff.</p><h2>Samsung Pro Plus microSD card</h2><p></p><p>It may not be the flashiest gift, but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEMxUFBXVFdUP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4ei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzc3MTY2YmUtNWFjNi0zODA2LTk5NWQtN2ZjODI1ZmZlNGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZPUmFBKkcMlmDqkUR-vZQXS1sJNFUfVMokX_z53Bnzt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C1PPWTWT\">Samsung\u2019s Pro Plus microSD card</a> could be something a student uses on a regular basis. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-microsd-card-130038282.html\">This card</a> has fast enough read and write speeds to handle any challenge, be it storing high-res images on their mirrorless camera or saving extra games on their Nintendo Switch,. Samsung includes a full-sized adapter with it as well, so they can use it in devices that only take SD cards if need be. We also appreciate that it\u2019s a durable little accessory, too, with water, temperature, magnet and drop protection to keep all of their information safe even amidst accidents.</p><h2>Google One subscription (100GB)</h2><p></p><p>Easy access to documents and files is crucial for any student. Many universities in the US provide students with access to some sort of cloud storage system for their work, but if your student doesn\u2019t have that, a <a href=\"https://one.google.com/u/1/plans\">Google One subscription</a> will help them. For $20 annually, they\u2019ll get 100GB of Drive space that they can share with up to 5 other people, VPN access for multiple devices, dark web monitoring and extra Google Photo editing features like Magic Eraser. For students, the Drive storage space will be most useful, allowing them to save as many versions of a paper as they need on top of all their old presentations, resources and other assignments. And they\u2019ll be able to access those files from anywhere, allowing them to work even when stuck in an airport on their way home for a visit or sitting on the subway on their way to class. Drive storage also applies to Gmail as well, so if they have important messages that they want to hold on to for the long haul, they can do so without worrying about freeing up more space in their inbox.</p><h2>Tribit Stormbox Micro 2</h2><p></p><p>While the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UcmliaXQtU3Rvcm1Cb3gtUG9ydGFibGUtU3BlYWtlci1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDlRNTkzMjFOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4ei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzc3MTY2YmUtNWFjNi0zODA2LTk5NWQtN2ZjODI1ZmZlNGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYD7zfGHJgUX9VCKIcijkN8q7a8uwC0DQQa1I9_a_Bv4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTribit-StormBox-Portable-Speaker-Built%2Fdp%2FB09Q59321N\">Tribit Stormbox Micro 2</a> comes in slightly higher than our $50 threshold, we still think it\u2019s worth mentioning as a solid, affordable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html\">Bluetooth speaker</a> for students. It pumps out solid sound at high volumes, and it\u2019s supremely portable, measuring only 4.1 x 3.9 x 1.6 inches. It can easily attach to a bike or a backpack, and it\u2019ll last nearly all day long with its 12-hour battery. But the kicker for students is the speaker\u2019s ability to double as a USB-C power bank. That means they won\u2019t have to remember to bring a totally separate power pack with them, and they\u2019ll still be able to power up their phones while they\u2019re out. While the Micro 2 typically costs $60, we\u2019ve seen it on sale for closer to $50.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/school-tech-under-50-140026676.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/school-tech-under-50-140026676.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-14T13:05:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Microsoft gets closer to buying Activision Blizzard", "description": "<p>It looks like Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is trucking along, following a court rejection of the FTC\u2019s injunction attempt.

And while it hasn\u2019t happened yet, given the increased focus on reducing e-waste and expanded support for<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/usb-c-upgrade-power-104536539.html\"> USB Power Delivery</a> (USB-PD), I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that trend crosses over into the laptop market sometime in the next five years. So to help sort out the confusion, I gathered 14 different chargers from a range of brands and tested each one with five different devices to find out which one is the best fast charger.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>The methodology for my experiment is intended to be as straightforward as possible. I drained each device to 10 percent battery, plugged in a power brick and then recorded the amount of charge added every 10 minutes for an hour. Each adapter was plugged directly into a standard 120-volt outlet (without the use of a power strip or any extension cords), and when possible I used the cable that either came included with the battery charger or one made by the same manufacturer as the device. If that wasn\u2019t an option, I used certified 100-watt USB-C cables made by Anker, Apple and others.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Because the charging rate for devices varies depending on how much juice you have, I wanted to measure how well each adapter was able to match each gadget\u2019s optimal charging speed. Generally, charging is slower between zero and 20 percent before speeds ramp up until the battery hits 80 percent, at which point things slow down again to protect and preserve the health and longevity of the power cell. For charging stations with multiple ports, I always selected the port with the highest power output while also not having multiple devices connected.</p><figure><img alt=\"The five devices we used to test the chargers are the iPhone 13, a Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Nintendo Switch (a launch model from 2017), a 2021 Dell XPS 13 and a 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/ba58f6c0-296d-11ed-bef6-ad702f61485a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>As for the devices themselves, I selected an Apple iPhone 13, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Nintendo Switch (a launch model from 2017), a 2021 Dell XPS 13 and a 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro. This assortment was chosen to cover a wide range of power draws from 20 watts (iPhone 13) all the way up to 140 watts (M1 Max MBP). Also, every system was tested while idle (i.e. no additional apps or games running) in order to ensure consistent results.</p><p>One important thing to note is that while the USB Implementers Forum has approved support for USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) charging at up to 240 watts, adapters that actually support that power output don\u2019t exist yet. Additionally, while there are a handful of cables that can handle more than 100 watts of juice, they are somewhat rare or hard to get.</p><h2>The chargers</h2><p>With so many different chargers of varying power outputs to test, I broke things down into three categories. There are the 30-watt and under chargers, which are primarily designed for smartphones and other small mobile devices. Then we move up to 45 to 65-watt chargers (give or take a watt or two) that can handle things like phones along with a number of thin and light laptops. Finally, we have chargers that output 100 watts or more, which are good for pretty much anything besides the biggest and most power-hungry gaming laptops. Many of these higher wattage adapters also feature multiple ports, so can you top up additional devices at full speed. However, because not every power brick supports multi-device charging, I didn\u2019t include that as a testing metric.</p><p>You can see a full list of the chargers we tested below:</p><ul><li><p><a

most cell phones along with some larger devices like the Nintendo Switch. In our testing, all of the 30-watt chargers performed equally well, with each one able to get the iPhone 13 to around 80 percent battery charge in less than an hour while also completely refilling the Galaxy S22 Ultra in 60 minutes. However, as you can see, these smaller, low-wattage bricks struggled to refill both the XPS 13 and especially the MacBook Pro. Yes, you can do it, but it's rather sluggish (the XPS 13 even surfaced a slow charger notification), and because I tested each device while idle, there\u2019s a good chance these chargers may not be able to keep these laptops topped up while under load.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Anker 711 (middle right) is our favorite 30-watt charger thanks to its fast speeds and compact size. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/54811340-296e-11ed-b695-0c30da31f850\" /><figcaption>The Anker 711 (middle right) is our favorite 30-watt charger thanks to its fast speeds and compact size. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>However, the one thing that sticks out is the performance of Apple\u2019s 20-watt brick, whose lower output caused it to lag behind \u2014 every other adapter provided faster charging. While it was able to keep up with rival devices when refilling the iPhone 13, its wattage is so low it couldn\u2019t even trickle charge the XPS 13. Dell\u2019s power management did not even recognize that a charger was plugged in. That means this adapter is much less useful if you need to quick charge more power-hungry gadgets in a pinch. And I should mention I didn\u2019t bother testing the old 15-watt Apple power cubes, which can\u2019t even support the iPhone 13\u2019s full 20-watt charging speeds. Anyone still using one of those really ought to upgrade.</p><p>If all you want is a power brick to keep small devices powered up, our choice for best charger is clear: the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUo0WFJTWkovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZpLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlOWYxYTRhMi0xYTUyLTQ2MWMtOTFlMS04NWViN2UxOWY1MDkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZw74rQ6E3ST1eWaeXDObymBroUBSXMIaxlabWdv4VhA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09J4XRSZJ%2F\">Anker 711</a>. Not only did it deliver the best speeds in its class, but it's also the smallest, which makes it super easy for it to disappear in a bag.</p><h2>Best 65-watt charger: Anker 735 GaN Prime</h2><p></p><p>Here\u2019s where things start to get interesting because while a number of these chargers have similar power outputs (aside from the Samsung 45-watt brick, of course), the actual results were a bit more varied. Both the Nekteck and the Belkin only managed to get the S22 Ultra to around 80 percent battery after an hour, compared to the Anker, Samsung and Satechi chargers which all hit 100. This suggests that both chargers aren\u2019t properly communicating with the S22 Ultra in order to take advantage of its 45-watt charging speeds, which I was able to confirm by using a USB-C volt meter. Meanwhile, as expected, Samsung\u2019s 45-watt charger did great when connected to the S22 Ultra, but its lower output meant it could not keep up with the 60 and 65-watt bricks.</p><figure><img alt=\"Anker once again takes the crown for our favorite 60-watt charger with the 715 (middle), because even though it's a bit more expensive than the Nekteck, it's smaller, has more ports, and features wider compatibility with more devices like the S22 Ultra.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/8730b110-296e-11ed-b6bb-96c783c2821a\" /><figcaption>Anker once again takes the crown for our favorite 60-watt charger with the 735 (middle), because even though it's a bit more expensive than the Nekteck, it's smaller, has more ports, and features wider compatibility with more devices like the S22 Ultra.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Somewhat surprisingly, every charger in this category performed well when hooked up to the XPS 13, with each adapter finishing within one percent of each other (around 58 percent) after an hour. However, when it comes to the thirsty MacBook Pro, every extra watt makes a difference, with the Anker 735 and Samsung Triple Port Charger edging out the competition, even though they\u2019re still much slower than Apple\u2019s included brick. It\u2019s also telling that on the Belkin 60W, its fastest charging port actually denotes charging speeds of between 50 and 60 watts, which is why it couldn\u2019t quite keep up with the other 60-watt chargers I tested.</p><p>As for picking a winner, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODc4NlNIWFYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZpLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlOWYxYTRhMi0xYTUyLTQ2MWMtOTFlMS04NWViN2UxOWY1MDkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXUeo4SLKLUpcdgsaLDp7rdmAMNsrAHMfOxCWFxO1CPm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08786SHXV%2F\">Nekteck\u2019s 60-watt brick</a> is the cheapest while also being one of the few options that come with an included charging cable.

While all of these bricks are listed at or above 100 watts, the primary charging ports on the Satechi and Belkin are actually capped at 90 or 96 watts. And that\u2019s before you consider multi-device charging, which splits the total output across the other ports with the ratio varying depending on the specific model.</p><figure><img alt=\"While Razer's 130-watt GaN charger (top middle) is the most expensive of the bunch at $180, it earned our pick as the best 100-watt or higher charger due to its more compact design, strong power output and the inclusion of useful extras like international outlet adapters and a braided 100-watt USB-C cord. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/008fb4c0-296f-11ed-a7fb-697a8d2e9e3a\" /><figcaption>While Razer's 130-watt GaN charger (top middle) is the most expensive of the bunch at $180, it earned our pick as the best 100-watt or higher charger due to its more compact design, strong power output and the inclusion of useful extras like international outlet adapters and a braided 100-watt USB-C cord. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>During testing, all four had no issue topping up the smartphones, the Switch and the XPS 13, though once again Belkin\u2019s adapter couldn\u2019t fully recharge the S22 Ultra despite having more than enough wattage. On the flip side, while Razer\u2019s charger has a higher max output than either the Belkin or the Satechi, there wasn\u2019t much difference in charging speeds when connected to the MacBook Pro. And this isn\u2019t due to a lack of higher wattage cables, as both USB-C ports on the Razer brick are capped at a combined 100 watts.</p><p>Meanwhile, as one of the rare 140-watt power adapters on the market, Apple\u2019s brick is super quick and did an expectedly great job of refilling the MacBook Pro. However, I should mention that it's the only power brick in this segment that comes with a single port, which kind of feels like a missed opportunity for the Apple ecosystem.</p><p>So for anyone that wants a charger that can top up an ultraportable laptop quickly while still having juice to spare, I prefer <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTlWTEhIR1o_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZmktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU5ZjFhNGEyLTFhNTItNDYxYy05MWUxLTg1ZWI3ZTE5ZjUwOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUlhXrsfTKbI9Yv7Umk3R043GNkyCDZXMsKiNwtrfM62&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB099VLHHGZ\">Razer\u2019s 130-watt GaN adapter</a>. It\u2019s the best charger in this category, as well as the smallest and most expensive at $180. On top of that, it comes with two international wall adapters (for UK and EU outlets) and a braided 100-watt USB-C cable, all of which you don\u2019t get from any others in this category.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"Our top picks for the three power output ranges are the Anker 711, Anker 715 and the Razer 130-watt GaN charger. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/0c236120-296e-11ed-a1ff-16c474df2be0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Obviously, there are a lot more than just 14 super fast chargers on the market, and sadly I don\u2019t have the time to test them all. These days, discharging a phone from 100 percent battery to dead can take upwards of 15 hours, so depending on the device, I can only test one power brick per day. Just gathering all this data took the better part of two months. And unfortunately, while I was running this test, Anker <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/anker-third-generation-gan-chargers-ganprime-163056106.html\">came out with a new generation of power adapters</a> that I haven't had the chance to evaluate just yet.&nbsp;</p><p>That said there are still some important takeaways. First, in order to ensure optimal charging speeds, make sure your charger can supply the proper amount of power. Manufacturers typically list a device\u2019s max charging speeds, while power adapters clearly label their USB types and outputs. And when in doubt, you can look at the fine text on the charger itself, though you might have to do some math. Just remember, watts equals volts times amps. Furthermore, in the case of adapters with multiple ports, you\u2019ll check to see how its total wattage is split when connected to multiple devices.</p><p>Then there are other factors like size and weight you\u2019ll want to consider, with newer gallium nitride adapters (GaN) often featuring more compact designs and better power efficiency. And if you\u2019re ever truly in doubt, you can simply opt for a fast charger made by the same company as your phone, laptop or other gadgets, something that\u2019s especially true for devices like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-10-t-review-speed-above-all-specs-price-availability-153054303.html\">OnePlus 10T</a> that feature speedy proprietary charging protocols.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-14T12:00:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Virgin Galactic's first private passenger spaceflight will launch next month", "description": "<p>Virgin Galactic, having flown its first commercial spaceflight in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-completes-its-first-commercial-spaceflight-161701356.html\">late June</a>, is ready to take civilians to the edge of space, briefly.
