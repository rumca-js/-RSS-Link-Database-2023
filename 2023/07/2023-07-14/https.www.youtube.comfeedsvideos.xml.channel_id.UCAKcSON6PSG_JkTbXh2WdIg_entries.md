On Saturday, May 6, 2023, rising musician Genesis Owusu performed an electrifying eight song set at Amsterdam Bar & Hall in St. Paul. 

The genre-defying artist celebrated his debut album release, 'Smiling With No Teeth,' in March 2021 with a sold-out national theatre tour, and this was his second time in the Twin Cities. Alongside his Good Club, Genesis Owusu delivered a powerful performance packed with fierce vocals, meaningful movements, and crowd participation.
