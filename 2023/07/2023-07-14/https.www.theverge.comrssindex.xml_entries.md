  <p id="infxHX">Larry Hryb, an Xbox employee perhaps better known by his “Major Nelson” alias, is leaving Microsoft, he announced on Friday. Hryb has been a major face for many of Xbox’s marketing activities since the days of the original Xbox and Xbox Live online service, through the launch of the Xbox 360 and all of the years since.</p>
<p id="ZeLsYk">“After 20 incredible years, I have decided to take a step back and work on the next chapter of my career,” <a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/1679913767214231552">he tweeted</a>. “As I take a moment and think about all we have done together, I want to thank the millions of gamers around the world who have included me as part of their lives.”</p>

  <p id="sIRfTq">Bob Iger has a lot to say about Disney’s future. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-disney-ceo-bob-iger-speaks-with-cnbcs-david-faber-on-squawk-box-today.html">During a 40-minute interview with CNBC</a>, the CEO talks about what the company could look <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23793027/disney-ceo-bob-iger-contract-2026">like over the next four (or more) years under his control</a> — and it could drastically change some of Disney’s biggest brands.</p>
<p id="WH2bmn">One of those changes includes slashing the company’s spending on Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em>-related content. As for why, Iger says the influx of Marvel TV shows “diluted focus and attention,” on its films, resulting in disappointing performances at the box office. </p>
<p id="BwqqWH"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23597979/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-review"><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em></a> was one of those films.

The movie came out on Friday in Japan under the title <em>Kimitachi wa Do Ikiruka</em> (translated as <em>How Do You Live?</em>), but GKIDS is only saying that it will be out in theaters “later this year.”</p>
<p id="cNjZTe">Ahead of the film’s release, Studio Ghibli only shared the Japanese title and a <a href="https://twitter.com/JP_GHIBLI/status/1679626765646413824">couple</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/JP_GHIBLI/status/1679505979262619649">images</a> of some kind of bird-like creature — there hasn’t even been a trailer — so there are a lot of unknowns about what the film might actually be about.

  <p id="L2FZlj">I don’t particularly love editing my photos on a regular old slab phone anymore. Even on something large like the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the aspect ratio demands more zooming and panning than I’d like. Slapping on a quick filter or making some light tweaks is fine, but anything more than that and I’m itching for my Mac or an iPad. None of this is the fault of software, mind you; Adobe’s been on a run of some phenomenal Lightroom updates this year, and indie developers like the team behind Pixelmator are <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/">impressively keeping pace</a>. That aspect of editing has never been better or more capable; it’s having to work within the confines of a small screen that’s the real limitation.</p>

  <p id="yHUcqt">I don’t have hard data on this, but most people probably rank switching to a new phone somewhere around “dental cleaning” and “trip to the DMV.” A few years ago, I felt that way, too. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/allison-johnson">Dozens of phone reviews later</a>, switching devices has become just as routine as taking out the recycling every week. </p>

<p id="pGELEN">Back in 2006, <em>South Park</em> finally made itself relevant to me with its <em>World of Warcraft</em> episode. In the episode, the boys take up the MMO and try to recruit Butters to join them. He refuses, explaining that he has simpler tastes, preferring to play <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure </em>instead.</p>

<p id="gpXvgH">It’s a throwaway line, meant to elicit nothing more than a sneer from the gamers watching that Butters would dare admit aloud to playing something so childish. But though the game sounded exactly like a PlayStation 2 Japanese-only launch title or something that was on a CD-ROM for Windows 98, it didn’t actually exist. </p>
