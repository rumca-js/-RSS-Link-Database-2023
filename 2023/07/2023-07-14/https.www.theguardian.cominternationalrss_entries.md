<p>Sasi Laut is a traditional ceremony performed by local communities in Raja Ampat on the Bird’s Head peninsula in the newly formed Indonesian province of Southwest Papua. This ceremony is performed at the start or the end the sea harvest season. The people in Raja Ampat believe that when they go out to sea, their success depends on the Sasi ceremony. The practice sustainably provides significant benefits to the preservation of marine life in Raja Ampat. By closing off a chosen area until a specified time, Sasi Laut ensures an abundant harvest in highly sought-after catch such as lobster and sea cucumber</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2023/jul/15/in-pictures-in-the-islands-of-indonesia-the-tradition-of-sasi-laut-reaps-the-rewards-of-sustainability">Continue reading...</a>

Those long weeks of cool, gloomy weather were the backdrop to my first sowings of climbing beans, courgettes and their kin being ravaged by slugs, snails and peculiar winds. Yet there’s one plant that, no matter how wobbly the start to the main growing season, I always trust will grow reliably and pleasingly – and that’s basil.</p><p>Possibly not the most exciting plant choice to write a love letter to, but I was just potting on the various varieties I’ve been growing and basking in their delicious scent and sturdy growth. They are far more robust when grown from seed than the potted basil sold in supermarkets, which is often floppy and less flavoursome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/14/theres-still-time-to-sow-basil-seeds-garden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Starting out gritty, this likable film turns into a mystery-comedy thriller and boasts excellent performances from Foxx, John Boyega and Teyonah Parris</p><p>Screenwriter Juel Taylor makes his feature directing debut with his own co-written script; it’s an odd, slightly baffling but likable piece of work. It’s a conspiracy mystery-comedy that starts out as a neo-blaxploitation romp or supersmart satire on race and white privilege that you might compare with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/17/get-out-review-fantastically-twisted-horror-satire-on-race-in-america">Get Out</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/06/sorry-to-bother-you-review-boots-riley-lakeith-stanfield-tessa-thompson">Sorry to Bother You</a>. But then it broadens into something sillier and goofier, almost a kids’ movie. I can imagine it building a cult fanbase by being shown every Christmas Eve on TV, and it’s certainly got three powerhouse performances from Teyonah Parris, Jamie Foxx and John Boyega.</p><p>The scene is a deprived African American neighbourhood where people listlessly drink certain branded types of what appears to be alcoholic soda, munch down fried chicken and use chemicals on their hair. Tyrone (Boyega) is a drug dealer who is discontented at a rival player moving in on his turf, and also annoyed at money owed to him by notorious pompadoured pimp Slick Charles. Slick is played by Foxx, and is always complaining about the ungrateful, unreliable women he’s exploiting and indignantly announcing things like: “At the 1995 Players’ Ball I was Pimp of the Year!” His main earner is the wisecracking Yo-Yo, played with whipsmart presence by Parris.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/14/they-cloned-tyrone-review-powerhouse-jamie-foxx-in-satire-turned-goofy-caper">Continue reading...</a>
