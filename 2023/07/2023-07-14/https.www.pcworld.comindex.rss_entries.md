<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is an awesome gaming monitor, bringing the incredible contrast and realism of OLED in a 34-inch widescreen panel. Though priced at $1,099&mdash;not inexpensive for most people&mdash;it&rsquo;s a better value than most high-end gaming monitors.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s excellent image quality provides a vivid, immersive, rich experience with deep black levels and bright highlights. Games seem to leap out of the display, as if you&rsquo;re looking through a window rather than staring at your computer screen. Gamers who like dark, moody genres, such as horror games, will appreciate the monitor&rsquo;s ability to reach deep black levels with minimal loss of detail.</p>

<p>This monitor offers an enhanced refresh rate of up to 165Hz and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro for smooth frame pacing in games. It also has better-than-average motion performance at lower refresh rates, a benefit of the OLED panel&rsquo;s fast pixel response times.</p>

<p>The monitor isn&rsquo;t bright and has a glossy display coat that can reflect light, so it&rsquo;s best in a dark room. We also noticed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549438/where-are-all-the-oled-monitors-why-the-best-displays-arent-on-the-pc.html">the OLED panel</a> has trouble rendering small fonts smoothly. These are minor issues and have less impact on games than other scenarios.</p>

<p>Connectivity is acceptable, with two DisplayPort inputs and one HDMI, and a USB-A hub with four ports. There&rsquo;s a healthy range of menu options that help gamers change the image quality to their preference.</p>

<p>Released in 2020, the LG Ultragear 34GN850-B, was the best ultrawide gaming monitor to debut that year, and only recently defeated by the Alienware AW3423DWF. In response, LG slashed the former champion&rsquo;s price from an MSRP of $999.99 to $699.99 at most retailers (and it has occasionally sold for as little as $599.99).</p>

<p>Though no longer at the top of its class, LG&rsquo;s Ultragear 34GN850-B is an attractive monitor with excellent color performance, a high maximum brightness, and good motion performance from its fast &ldquo;Nano IPS&rdquo; panel. It looks slightly sharper than the Alienware, despite the fact they both have the same native resolution. The LG is arguably better than the Alienware for mixed productivity and gaming use, as display glare is not an issue and small text doesn&rsquo;t appear pixelated.</p>

<p>The LG Ultragear 34GN850-B offers an enhanced refresh rate of up to 144Hz (with a 160Hz overclocked mode) and is officially compatible with both <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync</a>. Its overall motion performance is not as good as the Alienware, but it&rsquo;s close, and better than budget alternatives like the AOC CU34G2X.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the catch? Contrast. The monitor&rsquo;s IPS panel has the lowest contrast ratio of the three monitors we recommend here and can look hazy in dark scenes. It looks best in a moderately to brightly lit room, as this makes the lack of contrast less noticeable.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s connectivity and features are consistent with high-end monitors: two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, and a two-port USB hub. A few more USB ports would be appreciated but, at this price, the available options are acceptable.</p>

<p>The AOC CU34G2X is a rare budget-friendly ultrawide monitor, retailing at or below $349.99. It does make a few compromises to reach that price point&mdash;but image quality isn&rsquo;t among them.</p>

<p>The 34-inch ultrawide monitor has a VA panel that provides good contrast and vibrant color performance. Its maximum brightness is a bit low, but similar to the Alienware AW3423DWF in SDR content (the CU34G2X does not support HDR). The AOC monitor offers 3440&times;1440 resolution, the same as the other monitors on this list, so it looks just as sharp. Gamers who aren&rsquo;t particular about image quality will find it difficult to tell the difference between this monitor and the more expensive LG Ultragear 34GN850-B.</p>

<p>The AOC CU34G2X is an ultrawide gaming monitor with a refresh rate up to 144Hz, and it delivers solid motion performance. However, it doesn&rsquo;t officially support either AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync. Both standards should work unofficially but, because the display is not certified, owners may experience flickering when game frame rates dip too low. Gamers may need to rely on using V-Sync in some titles.</p>

<p>Though the monitor&rsquo;s image quality is impressive for the price, its aggressive red-and-black design is even more in-your-face than LG&rsquo;s Ultragear and might turn off some gamers. Material quality is mediocre, as well, so the monitor doesn&rsquo;t look as premium as the LG or Alienware alternatives.</p>

<p>Connectivity, on the other hand, is excellent, with two HDMI and two DisplayPort and a four-port USB-A hub. That&rsquo;s the best of any monitor on this list&mdash;not something we&rsquo;d expect from a budget display. The monitor also includes a height-adjustable stand, a perk that budget ultrawide monitors often ditch.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-an-ultrawide-gaming-monitor">What to look for in an ultrawide gaming monitor</h2>



<p>Ultrawide gaming monitors are an awesome choice for PC gaming, yet remain a tiny niche compared to far more popular 27-inch and 32-inch widescreen gaming monitors. According to the latest Steam Hardware Survey results, less than 2 percent of all PC gamers on Steam have an ultrawide monitor.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a shame, and limits choice when buying an ultrawide monitor. Still, gamers should key an eye on these features when making a purchase.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="panel-type-is-a-big-deal">Panel type is a big deal</h3>



<p>Ultrawide monitors offer IPS, VA, and OLED panels. Each has advantages and disadvantages.</p>



<p>IPS panels are the most common, and for good reason. They display a wide range of color, have great color accuracy, can reach high levels of brightness, and look sharp at any given resolution. However, their low contrast ratio can be a problem for darker games, which can appear hazy and lack detail. IPS panels are best for mixed use in brightly lit rooms.</p>



<p>VA panels are often found in budget ultrawide monitors, though some companies (most notably Samsung) also use them in high-end displays. They have better contrast than IPS panels and deliver similar color performance. VA panels can struggle with motion performance and budget VA panels tend to fall behind IPS in brightness.</p>



<p>OLED is the leader in overall image quality. It provides the best results in color gamut, color accuracy, contrast, and motion performance. Sharpness is often reduced compared to IPS and VA, but most people will find it a minor downgrade. OLED tends to lead in HDR as well: Mini-LED can exceed it in some cases, but few ultrawide monitors use Mini-LED technology.</p>



<p>In general, OLED is better than IPS, and IPS is better than VA. Some gamers might prefer VA over IPS, however, especially when gaming in a dark room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="refresh-rate-and-pixel-response-times">Refresh rate and pixel response times</h3>



<p>All the ultrawide gaming monitors we recommend share a similar refresh rate (between 144Hz and 165Hz). That implies they have similar motion performance, but there&rsquo;s more to it.</p>



<p>OLED monitors, such as the Alienware W3423DW, have the best motion performance overall. They offer not only a high refresh rate but the lowest pixel response times (often quoted at .03 to .05 milliseconds), which means pixels transition between colors quickly. This reduces motion blur at both high and low refresh rates, giving OLED an edge.</p>



<p>IPS monitors tend to have the second-best pixel response times, with models like the LG Ultragear 34GN850-B quoting response times of one millisecond. VA panels can also achieve one millisecond response times, though some panels may lag this standard.</p>



<p>In summary: look at refresh rate first, then look at pixel response time to compare monitors with the same refresh rate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="be-wary-of-large-ultrawide-displays">Be wary of large ultrawide displays</h3>



<p>The only ultrawide gaming monitors we currently recommend are 34-inch ultrawide gaming monitors with 3440&times;1440 resolution.</p>



<p>A variety of larger ultrawide gaming monitors are available. This includes 45-inch ultrawide monitors like the Corsair Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240 and LG Ultragear 45GR95QE, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1371206/samsungs-insane-8k-ultrawide-monitor-can-hit-up-to-900hz.html">as well as super-ultrawide monitors like the Samsung Odyssey G9 series</a>.</p>



<p>However, these larger monitors carry high price tags and tend to have issues in overall usability. The larger 45-inch ultrawide options don&rsquo;t increase resolution compared to 34-inch models, so they can appear a bit soft and pixelated. The 49-inch super-ultrawide models can be a match for hardcore simulation gamers but aren&rsquo;t widely supported in more mainstream game genres.</p>



<p>Extremely large and super-ultrawide gaming monitors are a niche within a niche. They might be a go-to pick in the future, but for now it&rsquo;s best to stick with more widely supported 34-inch, 3440&times;1440 monitors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dont-buy-an-ultrawide-for-console-gaming">Don&rsquo;t buy an ultrawide for console gaming</h3>



<p>Looking to buy a monitor for console gaming? Don&rsquo;t buy an ultrawide monitor.</p>



<p>None of the current game consoles support ultrawide resolutions. This is true even in games that have a PC release with ultrawide support. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A game console connected to an ultrawide monitor will still display an image, but it will be restricted to the usual widescreen display space, leaving black bars on either side of the screen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PC World&rsquo;s staff and freelance reviewers spend hundreds of hours conducting in-depth testing that compares monitors across a broad range of price points and capabilities, from $100 budget monitors to legendary top-tier displays priced beyond $3,000. We personally test dozens of monitors every year to find the best pick for every category and price point.</p>



<p>We use a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. It delivers objective measurements for a range of metrics including brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, color temperature, and gamma. These results are logged, which makes it easy for PC World reviewers to compare different monitors. It also eliminates subjective bias&mdash;an important point, as differences in room lighting, time of day, and the type of content viewed can easily change a reviewer&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>Most ultrawide monitors have a 34-inch panel with a 21:9 aspect ratio, which is the best option for most gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some ultrawide monitors are available in larger sizes, but these typically aren&rsquo;t the best choice for gamers. Many do not support high refresh rates. Those that do are expensive and often use the same 3440&times;1440 resolution found on smaller ultrawide monitors, which means they appear less sharp than a 34-inch display.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Nearly all 34-inch ultrawide monitors have a display resolution of 3440&times;1440. This is an excellent choice for gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s sharp enough to look impressive in modern games. However, this resolution remains significantly lower in total pixel count than 4K, which makes it less demanding on graphics hardware. That&rsquo;s good news if you have a midrange graphics card like an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html">Nvidia RTX 3060</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394984/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-asus-rog-strix.html">AMD Radeon RX 6650XT</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larger 38-inch models have a higher resolution of 3840&times;1660&mdash;however, nearly all these monitors lack support for high refresh rates, making them a bad choice for gamers. LG offers <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34WK95U-W-ultrawide-monitor&amp;xcust=2-3-1439692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a line of 34-inch 5K2K ultrawide monitors with 5120&times;2160 resolution</a>, but this line also lacks support for enhanced refresh rates.</p>



<p>A few new 45-inch ultrawide monitors are available with 3440&times;1440 resolution. This can be a problem, because stretching the same resolution across a much larger display reduces sharpness. We recommend 3440&times;1440 only for 34-inch ultrawide monitors.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A refresh rate of 144Hz to 165Hz is ideal for most ultrawide gaming monitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very few ultrawide monitors exceed this refresh rate, and those that do are too expensive to make it a good value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, gamers shopping for an ultrawide gaming monitor are likely to prefer immersive and graphically demanding games that make it difficult to see the full benefit of a refresh rate above 144Hz. You&rsquo;ll need a high-end video card, like an RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon 6800, to drive most ultrawide gaming monitors at frame rates above 144 frames per second.</p>

<p>HDR isn&rsquo;t a must-have for an ultrawide gaming monitor, but it&rsquo;s a nice addition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming is a great use case for HDR&mdash;arguably the best, in fact&mdash;and it can deliver improved image quality. We recommend buying an ultrawide gaming monitor with HDR support if your budget is $500 or more.</p>

<p>The HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless really impressed me when it came out. Budget-conscious esports players could scarcely find a better mouse&mdash;with its pinpoint accuracy, ultra-light weight, and a price tag so reasonable you could barely believe the value, it was not only suitably primed to cross swords with performance goliaths in competitive matches but wouldn&rsquo;t make much of a dint in your tournament winnings either.</p>



<p>Based on that history, it was with bated breath that I sized up the pros and cons of the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless, HyperX&rsquo;s successor. The verdict? While the price is a little bit heftier than before, it&rsquo;s a very worthy sibling.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559298/best-wireless-gaming-mice.html">best wireless gaming mice</a> to learn about competing products.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-features">HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless features</h2>



<p>So, what features are worth drooling over this time? At least three things get my attention immediately. First and most notably, it weighs exactly the same as the Haste 1 Wireless&mdash;a lofty 61 grams, so it feels as light as a feather in your hand. That&rsquo;s despite the addition of an upgraded HyperX 26K sensor, and a new solid upper shell, which replaces the Haste 1 Wireless&rsquo;s perforated one.</p>



<p>A mere 61 grams also puts it in good company&mdash;making it 2 grams lighter than premium pro-grade esports mice like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475704/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">Logitech&rsquo;s G X Pro Superlight</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663595/razer-deathadder-v3-pro-gaming-mouse-review.html">Razer&rsquo;s DeathAdder V3 Pro</a>, both of which cost upwards of $60 more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I found I had all the speed and accuracy I needed to win out in most spontaneous firefights.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Suffice to say, that loftiness means the quick movement we achieved so easily in the Haste 1 Wireless is just as easily reproduced in the Haste 2 Wireless. Merely bump it and your curser will shoot across the screen like a falling star. Move it quickly for real and you&rsquo;ll need bionic vision to see the curser&mdash;yes, it&rsquo;s that quick.</p>



<p>Secondly, the Haste 2 Wireless adds Bluetooth connectivity to its super-speedy 2.4GHz connectivity, which is a feature that neither the Haste 1 Wireless nor a string of more expensive esports rivals have. So, in saying that, the Haste 2 Wireless is one of the more versatile esports mice you can currently buy.</p>

<p>The third and most surprising thing to note about it is surely its price. Somehow HyperX has managed to keep it down to just $89.99&mdash;admittedly that&rsquo;s a steep increase over the original&rsquo;s $59.99 shipping price, but seems reasonable considering all the upgraded technology onboard, and when you compare it to the price of rivals like the $149.99 Razer DeathAddver V3 Pro.</p>



<p>Once again, esports players who give it a go will likely be more than satisfied with what they&rsquo;re getting for their money.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-design-and-build">HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless design and build</h3>



<p>The Haste 1 Wireless&rsquo;s design is written all over the Haste 2 Wireless. In fact, from its symmetrical shape to its six compact programmable buttons, it looks very similar to before. But alas there are some refinements worth noting.</p>



<p>For example, while the button setup is identical, comprised of two main clicks, two buttons on the left-hand side, a single mouse-wheel click, and an unobtrusive DPI switcher&mdash;they feel much clickier and louder this time round. They&rsquo;ve all been upgraded with custom HyperX Switches and are now rated for a whopping 100 million clicks&mdash;that&rsquo;s 40 million more clicks than the Haste 1&rsquo;s Golden Micro Switches.</p>



<p>Additionally, while there are no surprises in the dimensions&mdash;the depth, height, and width being virtually identical as before at 4.9 x 1.50 x 2.6 inches&mdash;the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s solid top makes it functionally superior. How so? For one, it won&rsquo;t cause the dotty indentations claw grippers were prone to get on the tips of their fingers from pressing against the Haste 1&rsquo;s perforated top.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not even accounting for how much more comfortable it now feels too. While palm and fingertip grippers are unlikely to notice much difference in snugness levels, claw grippers will no longer feel like they&rsquo;re pressing down on a porcupine&mdash;a small point which is sure to win over a legion of new fans.</p>



<p>Regardless of grip type, though, the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s matte plastic finish is a most welcome upgrade. In fact, the thousands of tiny bumps covering its body do a much better job of holding your hand firmly in place, providing a greater sense of control than previously. They also extinguish any sign of your fingerprints, so this mouse always looks sharp next to your rig.</p>



<p>The underside of the Haste 1 Wireless&rsquo;s successor has had a slight upgrade too. In addition to the four virgin-grade PTFE skates we saw in the Haste 1 Wireless, you now also get a full ring of PTFE around the sensor, so there&rsquo;s a noticeable absence of friction on tabletops.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless" class="wp-image-1988340" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Underside_edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Unlike its predecessor, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless has a solid band of virgin-grade PTFE around its sesnor.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Haste 2 Wireless also comes with a useful set of accessories. A peek in the box reveals extra grip tapes, as well as additional PTFE skates. But you also get a 5.9-foot braided USB A to USB C paracord, which doubles as both a wired connection and a charger. HyperX claims the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s battery lasts a very respectable 100 hours from a single charge.</p>



<p>Only black and white color options are available, but they each look remarkably stylish. The only visible signs breaking up my white review unit&rsquo;s visage were two attractive HyperX logos&mdash;one on top and the other on the left-hand side, each accentuating rather than spoiling its appearance. Clearly, this is a mouse worth showing off to your friends at every opportunity.</p>



<p>The one caveat to that is if your friends are diehard fans of RGB. That&rsquo;s because you still only get the one RGB zone located in the mouse wheel, which for an esports mouse of this caliber is a little underwhelming. Still, this is just a trifle that won&rsquo;t make any difference to your gameplay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-wireless-perform">How does the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless perform?</h3>



<p>The Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s sensor tracks movement at a maximum resolution of 26,000 DPI with an accuracy of 650 inches per second. A maximum acceleration of 50G and polling rate of 1,000Hz round out the rest of the sensor&rsquo;s performance specifications.</p>



<p>To test the sensor&rsquo;s performance, I loaded up a game of <em>Insurgency</em>, trying out a range character types from Riflemen to Snipers and switching randomly between the mouse&rsquo;s four preset DPI settings. Here, I made maneuvers ranging from quick short jerks to larger crisscross motions and circular movements, watching all the while for glitches or stuttering in my mouse&rsquo;s movement.</p>



<p>Indeed, the mouse handled superbly in just about every situation, no matter what kind of movement I used, or DPI setting it was in. The sensor tracked my movements perfectly and fluidly, without even the slightest hint of smoothing or stuttering. It seemed to me like its quick responsiveness even helped even out the playing field when I joined overseas servers and was lumped with tedious 300-millisecond pings.</p>



<p>While the wired version of the Haste 2 has an outstanding 8,000Hz polling rate, which allows it to send up to eight times more data per second and reduce latency to 1/8th of a millisecond, the Wireless version gets by with a 1,000Hz polling rate. That being the case, 1,000Hz is still perfectly fine for ultra-fast competitive play&mdash;I found I had all the speed and accuracy I needed to win out in most spontaneous firefights.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless" class="wp-image-1988362" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>While the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s design is quite compact it will comfortably fit most small- to medium-sized hands.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s symmetry and compactness was also a big asset to my play. I was delighted to find it slid around my mat with the same laser-like precision as I saw in the Haste 1 Wireless, which made pinpointing targets exceptionally quick. This was really something I noticed after ditching my mouse pad and playing on tabletops, the extra skates really making an impact on how smooth it moved.</p>



<p>But while I could pinpoint targets as quick as lightning, there seemed a bit of a disconnect in my firing. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that&rsquo;s not because the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s buttons lack any responsiveness: they&rsquo;re impressively quick. It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not as well served by the mouse&rsquo;s design as some rivals&mdash;a point that deserves some explanation&hellip;.</p>



<p>Put simply, at times I found myself craving two features that in my view would have provided a mechanical advantage to firing. Number one is a hump beneath my index finger, like the one you see in the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro. Indeed, had my finger been slightly elevated like in the V3 Pro I&rsquo;m sure I would have benefited from the same millisecond speed advantages I tend to get when playing with the Razer. It&rsquo;s a minor point, but one that serious gamers may want to take note of.</p>



<p>The other thing I really could have done with in the Haste 2 Wireless is slightly flared main buttons. Although the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s compact buttons provided a comforting predictability to my aiming, when my clicking got really frantic, my index finger, which was a little cramped, tended to move slightly to the left, so that I experienced just the slightest lateral mouse movement. A little extra button space would have put a stop to that.</p>



<p>Although not a huge deal, that did occasionally mean that instead of hitting my target square-on at the kill point, I hit them somewhere less lethal. Could this drawback have affected my K:D ratio? Quite possibly.</p>

<p>Still, these are just my personal musings. In fact, there will be tons of players that will actually prefer the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s compact buttons and more symmetrical design.</p>



<p>Surely, in choosing the Haste 2 Wireless over mice with these asymmetrical traits, the upside is you can apply any of the three main grip styles and not have to worry about losing out on any performance. Plus, left-handers will find it a whole lot easier, too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyperxs-ngenuity-software">HyperX&rsquo;s Ngenuity software</h3>



<p>HyperX&rsquo;s Ngenuity software is the Haste 2 Wireless&rsquo;s go-to software app, which you can download for free in just a minute from the Microsoft Store. In it you can assign functions to your six programmable buttons, adjust your DPI settings, and make color and effects changes to the mouse&rsquo;s RGB zone, too.</p>



<p>I mainly used Ngenuity to change DPI settings. You can simply add an additional DPI setting by hitting the + icon at the bottom of the app window, while changing the values of the four default DPI settings is as straightforward as moving sliders. The app also conveniently prompts you when you need firmware updates so there&rsquo;s no need to sift through HyperX&rsquo;s official website looking for them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Haste 2 Wireless doesn&rsquo;t have any onboard memory to store your pre-made presets&mdash;however, you can still save them within the app itself and switch between them with just a few clicks. Ngenuity also has a feature called Gamelink that will automatically activate presets that have been linked to your favorite games or applications, which saves you a ton of time.</p>

<p>HyperX&rsquo;s original PulseFire Haste Wireless was one of the best value esports mice you could buy at the time of its release, offering gamers a taste of pro-grade functionality at a reasonable price. A year on, the company has delivered a sequel that, while costing a little more than before, packs in some excellent upgrades whilst amazingly keeping the weight exactly the same.</p>



<p>Unless you need a particular shape of design for your trusty esports rodent or can&rsquo;t live without tons of RGB or an 8,000Hz Hyperpolling rate, this mouse has everything you could want. It&rsquo;ll also keep a ton of change in your hip pocket.</p>

## I got this crazy keypad to improve at PC games. I still suck

<p>I&rsquo;m not great at games. At least, not on PC. I have no aptitude for using a mouse and keyboard.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s right&mdash;I play <em>everything</em> with a controller.</p>



<p>At least, I play all of my usual genres with a controller. And, up until about a year ago, the arrangement worked. A non-zero number of PC gamers may be shrieking silently (or loudly) about how unideal it is to play certain games with analog sticks, but I never had a problem.</p>



<p>Then my friend group decided to play PvP games. On PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I&rsquo;m playing <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and drunkenly lurching off a boat into water (my character, not me), and then the next, I&rsquo;m trying to line up headshots on a human opponent who most definitely knows how not to get shot.</p>



<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long to realize I needed a lot of help, and that assistance had to come either from my friends or divine intervention, because I certainly didn&rsquo;t seem capable of helping myself. So I did what everyone with wishful thinking does. I bought stuff to fix my problem. Specifically, I bought the weirdest, wildest, and arguably coolest gaming keypad available.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enter-the-azeron-cyborg-gaming-keypad">Enter the Azeron Cyborg gaming keypad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Azeron Cyborg Compact gaming keypad thumbstick" class="wp-image-1982306" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_3627-sm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d find a keypad with an actual analog thumbstick.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / Foundry</p></div>



<p>My problem with mouse and keyboard is the keyboard. For whatever reason, using the WASD keys for navigation still has yet to click in my brain. Add in the surrounding keys for triggering abilities and the communication between my hand and my brain goes out a window.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Then back in April, I stumbled upon this <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1680265/real-pc-enthusiasts-swear-these-24-accessories-changed-their-life.html">r/buildapc thread on Reddit</a>. Among all the fantastic PC accessory recommendations was one for the Azeron Cyborg. It looked absolutely insane (and straight out of a Terminator movie), but what caught my attention was its <em>actual thumbstick</em>.</p>



<p>During the first few weeks of online slaughter (mine, not my opponents), I had wistfully thought how having a left thumbstick for navigation but a mouse for aiming would combine the best of both my worlds. But the Razer Tartarus and similar gaming keypads only had d-pads, not full 360 analog sticks.</p>



<p>I took this new discovery as as sign, especially when I looked on the Azeron site and saw a gently used model going for $140 USD. (A new one costs about $200 USD.) Impulse purchases are rare for me, but this seem fated. Desperation to not always be the weak link on my team may have added incentive to buy.</p>



<p>Twenty-five bucks in shipping and a handful of days later, my package safely completed the journey from Latvia and landed on the PCWorld office&rsquo;s doorstep. And that&rsquo;s when I learned some hard truths about myself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-new-problem-emerges">A new problem emerges</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Azeron Cyborg Compact gaming keypad upside down" class="wp-image-1982307" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_3631-sm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The amount of adjustability is astounding.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The Azeron Cyborg comes in two flavors: standard, which positions a set of buttons above your fingertips, and Compact, which places those buttons on shorter posts. You can also adjust the thumbstick positioning on the standard model&mdash;a feature I completely underestimated when I purchased my used Compact model in sparkly galactic purple.</p>



<p>This keypad is dizzyingly programmable <em>and</em> adjustable. You get 29 mappable keys overall, which includes the 5-way rocker switch and thumbstick. Key mapping is extremely simple&mdash;you just download Azeron&rsquo;s software and start assigning keys&mdash;and you get two separate profiles that you can program. Key presses feel good too, with satisfying clicky feedback.</p>



<p>For the games I played (primarily <em>Overwatch 2</em>), I didn&rsquo;t even use all 13 buttons within my immediate reach. Part of this had to do with fit. Even weeks later, my pinky can&rsquo;t tap its nearby keys easily. This is despite me buying the smaller of the keypad&rsquo;s two sizes, and also fussing with the positions of each key tower. You can change the distance and the spacing, but I never found the perfect sweet spot for my whole hand.</p>



<p>But I can&rsquo;t blame fit entirely for my new struggle, which is overcoming my very fixed muscle memory on controller.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="i-am-my-own-worst-enemy-as-usual">I am my own worst enemy, as usual</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Azeron Cyborg Compact gaming keypad top buttons" class="wp-image-1982305" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_3629-sm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I ended up using  just a few of the buttons for my usual games.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / Foundry</p></div>



<p>During my formative years, I played platformers and action-adventure games almost to the exclusion of everything else&mdash;and it seems to show. A major issue of mine in PvP games is movement. I walk in straight lines, as the worst (best) noobs do. But platformers, my favorite genre, <em>rewards</em> that kind of steady tracking. That&rsquo;s what I spent countless hours optimizing for, while also lacking exposure to genres (and game modes) that reward the opposite.</p>



<p>So first problem: I don&rsquo;t think to strafe.</p>



<p>Second problem: The motion for strafing on an analog stick feels <em>wrong</em> to me.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, owning an Azeron gaming keypad does nothing to solve these first two issues, since it has a thumbstick. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even figure out the second one until I forced myself to try using WASD in a low-stakes <em>Overwatch</em> match. You should have seen my face when I realized how effortless strafing felt when tapping two distinctive keys, rather than wiggling a stick back and forth.</p>



<p>Third problem: I am not used to using fingers beyond my thumb and forefinger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a standard controller user, all I ever use are two fingers per hand. On occasion I might bring in my middle fingers if I have to press both the bumper and the trigger buttons at the same time, but it&rsquo;s rare. (A fancier controller like the Xbox Elite has more buttons and thus can require more fingers, but I don&rsquo;t use that type.)</p>



<p>Fourth problem: The controls are distributed differently than on controller.</p>



<p>The Azeron Cyborg doesn&rsquo;t change the how many functions you perform with your left hand for a mouse and keyboard setup. It just offers them in a different form factor. And compared to controller, it&rsquo;s about the opposite of what I&rsquo;m used to. On a controller, I&rsquo;m using my right hand for an analog stick (camera angle/melee), the four face buttons (which usually map to weapon choice, reload, jump, and crouch in a shooter), and a set of shoulder and trigger buttons (abilities). On mouse and keyboard, my right hand gets left click (primary ability), right click (secondary ability or zoom), and the scroll wheel (weapon choice/melee). At least, it does on a basic mouse, which is all I have currently.</p>



<p>Long story short, I have a lot of retraining to do and new muscle memory to build if I want to get anywhere in PvP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-shook-out">How it shook out</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Azeron Cyborg Compact gaming keypad with hand on it" class="wp-image-1982308" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_3637-sm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I should have bought the standard Cyborg model for the adjustable thumbstick, since stretching my hand this far is just a little too uncomfortable. Alas.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / Foundry</p></div>



<p>While the Azeron has not been able to cover for skills I never developed, I&rsquo;m not disappointed. I knew it was probably going to be a long shot. (I&rsquo;ve been through this before with photography gear.) I think it&rsquo;s a great keypad, and I like how much you can customize it. That includes how it looks, too. If you buy new, you can pick color (so many fun shades!), palm rest style, thumbstick style, and which hand it&rsquo;s designed for (right or left).</p>



<p>And the Cyborg <em>has</em> done more than providing insight into my long-standing inability to adapt to mouse and keyboard. My gameplay with hitscan characters in <em>Overwatch</em> is better&mdash;I don&rsquo;t miss as many shots with Ana when playing support, for example. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still suck. But I can see glimpses of what life is like when you don&rsquo;t completely suck. It&rsquo;s a nice counter to getting older and stiffer, which have dulled my reflexes and made precision thumbstick movements harder. I once dreamed of getting even half as good as former colleagues on controller&mdash;they could go up against PC players, much to the surprise of developers during demos. But that&rsquo;s beyond me now.</p>



<p>My only real complaint about the Cyborg is that I bought the wrong model. The Compact version&rsquo;s thumbstick isn&rsquo;t adjustable, and for my narrow hand it&rsquo;s positioned a little too low to feel comfortable. Where the directional switch sits, that&rsquo;s where I want the thumbstick to be. I get an ache in my hand after playing for about 90 minutes or more. If Azeron (or a community member) were to release a 3D printer file for a housing that reversed the positions of the thumbstick and rocker switch, I think I could game for longer stretches.</p>



<p>Regardless, the Cyborg has made mouse and keyboard feel less like a sink or swim proposition. Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll get to basic WASD competency. But so far, that day has yet to come. In the meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve now got floaties to keep me from drowning.</p>

<p>Office monitors are a hotly contested segment of the monitor arena. Unlike gaming and entertainment monitors, which trumpet incredible contrast and motion clarity, office monitors boast useful connectivity and adjustable ergonomic stands. The ThinkVision P32p-30 delivers both, but high pricing degrades its appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974978" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p><span> </span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30 is a high-end office productivity monitor with a 32-inch 4K panel. It also supports HDR, but it&rsquo;s not VESA DisplayHDR certified&mdash;which, as I&rsquo;ll discuss, has consequences for its HDR performance.</p>



<ul>
<li>Display size: 32-inch 16:9 widescreen</li>



<li>Native resolution: 3840&times;2160</li>



<li>Panel type: IPS LCD</li>



<li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li>



<li>Adaptive Sync: None</li>



<li>HDR: Yes, HDR10</li>



<li>Ports: 1x Thunderbolt 4/USB-C-in with 100 watts Power Delivery, 1x Thunderbolt 4/USB-C-out with 27 watts Power Delivery, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x DisplayPort 1.4,1x audio-out, Ethernet, 1x USB-B in, 4x USB-A out</li>



<li>VESA mount: Yes, 100x100mm</li>



<li>Speakers: Yes</li>



<li>Price: $1,075</li>
</ul>



<p>However, many office users care more about a monitor&rsquo;s added features and connectivity than its image quality. The P32p-30 has compelling perks. It supports both Thunderbolt 4 and USB-C, offers Power Delivery over two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and delivers significant downstream connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974979" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Lenovo opted for a simple, modern design for the ThinkVision P32p-30.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30 opts for an elegant look with thin bezels along the top and sides of the monitor and a larger (but still rather slim) chin along the bottom. It&rsquo;s a similar story around back, where Lenovo chooses a simple, curved plastic rear panel adorned only by the Lenovo logo. The monitor looks modern but doesn&rsquo;t attract attention.</p>



<p>An ergonomic stand comes standard and adjusts for height, tilt, and swivel. It also rotates 90 degrees for use in portrait orientation. These features are typical for an office productivity monitor, but the P32p-30 offers solid flexibility with up to 155mm of height adjustment, 27 degrees of tilt, and 90 degrees of swivel. A 100x100mm VESA mount is adjustable for use with third-party monitor stands and arms, too.</p>



<p>In fact, the stand is the only portion of the monitor&rsquo;s design that stands out. It has a simple, flat-based design that doesn&rsquo;t take up much desk space despite the monitor&rsquo;s large 32-inch panel. The stand also has a small, red cut-out on its right side that can be used to hold a phone or small notebook upright. It&rsquo;s a small detail but, given how frequently I see a smartphone holder on modern work-from-home setups, it could prove useful.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974980" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30 connectivity complete with Thunderbolt 4 and USB-C.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The ThinkVision P32p-30 is a Thunderbolt 4 monitor and can be used as a Thunderbolt 4 or USB-C dock.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It provides one Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C and one Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C out. When the Thunderbolt 4-in is connected, it can expand a connected device&rsquo;s connectivity to four additional USB-A ports and a Gigabit Ethernet port. These ports can also be accessed over USB-B.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>An ergonomic stand comes standard and adjusts for height, tilt, and swivel. It also rotates 90 degrees for use in portrait orientation.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>USB Power Delivery is supported, as well. The monitor can deliver 100 watts of Power Delivery over the Thunderbolt port, which is enough to handle most mid-range professional laptops. It can also provide 27 watts over Thunderbolt 4-out. That&rsquo;s handy if you want to pass data through to a device that requires power, such as a portable monitor or external hard drive. Many competitors only support Power Delivery over one port or, if multiple ports are supported, provide less power.</p>



<p>The P32p-30&rsquo;s connectivity is similar to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693931/dell-u3223qe-review.html">Dell U3223QE</a>&lsquo;s, but with a few notable differences. Dell&rsquo;s alternative supports USB-C, but not Thunderbolt 4, and provides less USB Power Delivery overall. The Dell makes up for that with one additional USB-A downstream and DisplayPort-out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lenovo uses a joystick on the rear right flank to control the monitor&rsquo;s features and options. It&rsquo;s easy to access and responds quickly to input. Lenovo&rsquo;s menu system is solid, too, with clearly labeled options and a (relatively) large, high-contrast font.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974981" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30 menu.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Options are a bit light, however. The monitor provides several presets, which includes modes tuned for the sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamut, as well as a custom color mode with RGB customization. However, the monitor has only two color temperature presets and doesn&rsquo;t offer gamma customization.</p>



<p>The options instead focus more on office productivity. It provides a KVM switch, which makes it possible to swap between devices connected to the display when peripherals are attached to the monitor&rsquo;s USB ports, and a picture-by-picture mode. Speakers aren&rsquo;t included.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30s-sdr-image-quality">How is the Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30&rsquo;s SDR image quality?</h2>



<p>The ThinkVision P32p-30, like many office productivity monitors, is technically capable of HDR, but SDR is clearly the priority. Virtually all common productivity tasks, from spreadsheets to photography and even most digital design and art, still happens in SDR.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974982" height="805" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Brightness comes in a bit behind the pack at a maximum of 329 nits. This, to be clear, is perfectly fine for SDR content and should hold up in most corporate and home office environments, which typically offer some form of light control. However, the ThinkVision P32p-30 might feel a bit dim in a very brightly lit office, or when used adjacent to a sunlit window. Lenovo&rsquo;s competitors score better and, as a result, will remain comfortable to use in brighter rooms.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974984" height="844" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>While the P32p-30&rsquo;s brightness is so-so, it scores better in contrast with a maximum contrast ratio of 1230:1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is a good result for a monitor with a conventional IPS LCD panel and edge-lit backlight, and the P32p-30 outperforms most competitors. Dell&rsquo;s U3223QE takes the win, though, with a new IPS Black panel that can deliver a lower level of luminance in dark content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ThinkVision P32p-30&rsquo;s contrast offers a sense of dimensionality and depth that holds up best in a lit room. It does show &ldquo;IPS Glow&rdquo; in dark content, however, which casts a hazy gray across scenes that should appear black. This is a common problem with office monitors and can only be avoided with an upgrade to an OLED or Mini-LED display.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974986" height="807" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The P32p-30&rsquo;s color gamut is a weakness, as it displays only 91 percent of DCI-P3 and 85 percent of AdobeRGB. That&rsquo;s not a bad result on the whole but compares unfavorably to most monitors in this price bracket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could prove a problem for content creators who need to work in a wide color gamut such as DCI-P3 or AdobeRGB, as the monitor will be unable to display a significant portion of colors in those gamuts. It also makes the P32p-30 appear less saturated and vivid than some competitors in day-to-day use. Again, it&rsquo;s not bad (indeed, most owners would see any reason to complain until the monitor is compared side-by-side with a competitor), but alternatives like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693931/dell-u3223qe-review.html">Dell U3223QE </a>and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1794810/asus-proart-pa279crv-review.html">Asus ProArt PA279CRV </a>clearly beat the Lenovo.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30" class="wp-image-1974989" height="872" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>While the P32p-30&rsquo;s color gamut is disappointing, its color accuracy holds up, delivering the second-best result in this competitive set. The monitor provides a realistic image, and content appears as its creator intended. That&rsquo;s important for photographers, digital artists and designers, and videographers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monitor also scored a gamma curve of 2.2, which is our preferred target, and a color temperature of 6600K, which is only a hair off our preference of 6500K. These scores, alongside the monitor&rsquo;s good color accuracy, add up to a balanced, realistic, and inviting picture that looks nice out of the box. In this sense, the P32p-30 subjectively seems to outperform its objective test results, providing a more natural and refined picture that might be expected given its modest color gamut.</p>



<p>Sharpness is a perk, too, as the P32p-30&rsquo;s resolution of 3840&times;2160 works out to a pixel density of 139 pixels per inch (ppi). That&rsquo;s much better than a 32-inch 1080p monitor, which offers only 69ppi, or a 32-inch 1440p monitor, which delivers 93ppi. The monitor&rsquo;s image looks extremely sharp and crisp with little to no visible pixelation around small fonts and interface elements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The P32p-30&rsquo;s overall SDR image quality is good, but not remarkable. It provides a realistic, inviting picture that can handle a wide range of content well, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to impress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30s-hdr-image-quality">How is the Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30&rsquo;s HDR image quality?</h2>



<p>The ThinkVision P32p-30 technically supports HDR10, but it lacks VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification, which means it can&rsquo;t reach a peak brightness of at least 400 nits. That agrees with my testing, which found the monitor&rsquo;s peak brightness was just 329 nits&mdash;a figure that didn&rsquo;t increase when HDR was turned on.</p>



<p>Even if the monitor were brighter, it would still face problems due to its relatively narrow color gamut, low contrast ratio, and lack of a dynamic backlight. Monitors with a simple edge-lit LED backlight, such as the P32p-30, are never a good choice for HDR, as they can&rsquo;t increase the brightness of highlights without also increasing the brightness of shadows. That&rsquo;s not a good recipe for HDR image quality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-the-lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30s-motion-performance">How is the Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30&rsquo;s motion performance?</h2>



<p>Motion clarity is also mundane, as the ThinkVision P32p-30 has a standard 60Hz refresh rate and quotes a pixel response time no faster than four milliseconds. Those aren&rsquo;t impressive figures and they predictably lead to mediocre motion clarity. Most objects are visible, but significant blur obscures fine details. Small objects, like a baseball speeding across a pitch or a magic missile homing in on its target, appear as a blur streaking across the screen.</p>



<p>The monitor doesn&rsquo;t quote support for Adaptive Sync, either, so the monitor&rsquo;s refresh won&rsquo;t adjust to sync with the frame rate put out by your desktop or laptop&rsquo;s video solution. Gamers who don&rsquo;t engage V-Sync may see screen tearing or micro-stuttering, both of which reduce the fluidity of games in motion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-lenovo-thinkvision-p32p-30-worth-it">Is the Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30 worth it?</h2>



<p>The Lenovo ThinkVision P32p-30 is a competent but overpriced 4K office monitor. It nails the fundamentals of good SDR image quality with adequate brightness, contrast, and color accuracy, but its overall color performance is inferior to its competition. The inclusion of a Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C hub is nice, but many similarly priced competitors can match, or at least come close, to the P32-p30&rsquo;s functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can imagine situations where the P32p-30&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 4 support and superior USB Power Delivery, make it the right choice, but most home office users will be happier with less expensive alternatives like the Dell U3223QE and Asus ProArt PA279CRV.</p>
