I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of downtown San Francisco in the 1945. You can clearly see what's going on in broad daylight, lots of streetcars, old cars from the '30s and '40s, and then there are scenes in the bay area,

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
