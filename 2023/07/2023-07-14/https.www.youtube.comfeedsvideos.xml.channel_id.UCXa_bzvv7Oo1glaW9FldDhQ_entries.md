What can you expect from Baldur's Gate 3? How long will it last, and what will the 1.0 release offer? Is it as massive as the developer has claimed? Here are 15 things you should know about the role-playing game before it launches.

## Ed-0: Zombie Uprising PS5 Review - IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOMMEND

If you’re looking for a solid rogue-like that’ll challenge you in and offer satisfying rewards along the way, Ed-0 Zombie Uprising is not for you. While the game features the basic elements of a rogue-like, it lacks any sense of strategy or balanced difficulty implementation. 

Like the worlds of a rogue-like, literally everything in Ed-0 feels completely random making your success or failures often dependent on the in-game chaos. Combat is bland as you’ll find yourself hacking and slashing furiously only to minimal damage. And while the game favors the life bar of your enemies, it doesn’t treat you the same as you can only be slapped by a zombie a few times before becoming a ghost. 

Visually, the Ed-0 is uninspired and dull to look at with model designs fit for platforms two generations old. From one rogue-like fan to another, it’s impossible to recommend Ed-0: Zombie Uprising.
