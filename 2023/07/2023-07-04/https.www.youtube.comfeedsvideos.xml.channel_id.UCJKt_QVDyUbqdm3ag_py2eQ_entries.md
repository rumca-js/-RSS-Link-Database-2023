"Flex" (1999) by Kenny Beltrey. Guitars played by Adam Egerer.

Made using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio. Playback from DeliTracker 2.34 with 14Bit-NotePlayer 4.30:
- 14-bit calibrated Paula output
- Exact interpolation with 44336 Hz mixing frequency
- No panning, no 3D and DSP off. Anti-click enabled
- Module reports 32 channels
- 100% flawless playback not guaranteed (the XM replayer is not perfect)
