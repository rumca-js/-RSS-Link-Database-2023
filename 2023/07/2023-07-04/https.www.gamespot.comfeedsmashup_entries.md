<p>Every year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> summer event becomes one of the game's biggest and most beloved attractions, and this year's Summer Escape event may result in more of that same fervor. With many free cosmetics to earn from event challenges, two new breezy skins coming to the shop, a bonus reward for Fortnite Crew members, and some island makeovers, here's everything you need to know about Fortnite Summer Escape.</p><h2>Map change: Sunswoon Lagoon</h2><p>In the thick of this season's jungle biome, a new temporary party headquarters has cropped up. Sunswoon Lagoon will be present on the island until the event ends on July 18. While much of the season has been built on opening seemingly ancient vaults and introducing the Transformers to Forntite's catch-all mythos, loopers look primed to take it easy for a few days.</p><h2>Gameplay changes: Ice cream buffs and fireworks flare gun return</h2><p>If you've participated in past summer events in Fortnite, you're likely familiar with the ice cream cone items, a lineup of different flavors that grant heals and other buffs, like low-gravity jumping. The full freezer of flavors returns in the form of Normal Ice Cream Cone, Frozen Ice Cream Cone, Guzzling Ice Cream Cone, Spicy Ice Cream Cone, and LiL Whip's Special Serve.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-summer-escape-event-starts-today-with-a-ton-of-free-cosmetics/1100-6515621/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The OG Xbox Live Is Back From The Dead--This Is The Team Making It Happen

<p dir="ltr">Xbox Live was born on November 15, 2002. Though it wasn't the first online service offered by a video game console, it's fair to say that the original Xbox was the box that popularized the concept on an industry-wide level. Hits like Project Gotham Racing 2, Phantasy Star Online, and especially Halo 2 introduced a generation of console gamers to the concept of online play, and the world of gaming has never been the same since. And though Microsoft pulled the plug on the original Xbox Live back in 2010, a team of programmers and hackers at <a href="https://insignia.live/">Insignia</a> have brought it back to life on modded Xboxes--a triumph of engineering that serves as a reminder of the importance of digital preservation.</p><p dir="ltr">Insignia is a collaboration between five main developers and hobbyists, along with a community of die-hard original Xbox fans. The project got its start in 2019, when developers Billy and Luke (who, along with the rest of the team, requested to be credited by their first names) decided to work together to see if they could create an alternative to Xbox Live. Luke is the lead developer of Cxbx-Reloaded, an open-source Xbox emulator for Windows; Billy has worked on a number of projects, including an Insignia-esque replacement online service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.</p><p dir="ltr">Luke says that he had considered trying to work on online connectivity multiple times throughout the decade-plus that he's spent working on Cxbx-Reloaded, but it was never top of mind. Once the two of them started working together--and recruited other developers to the cause--they were able to achieve a measure of success more quickly than they expected. "There was no big moment of inspiration at the start," Luke says. "As soon as we saw our first successful login, that inspired me to keep working at it and see it through."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-og-xbox-live-is-back-from-the-dead-this-is-the-team-making-it-happen/1100-6515605/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After Blizzard announced that Overwatch 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-adding-story-missions-in-august-for-15/1100-6515170/">story missions would be available</a> this August in a $15 bundle called Overwatch 2: Invasion, the game's executive producer has warned that there will likely be a multi-season break between new story updates.</p><p>As reported by IGN, executive producer Jared Neuss commented on the game's upcoming content on a Twitch stream with streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1859658905">Emongg</a>. "Don't expect the next round [of story missions] in the next season and the season after that, or anything like that," he said. "It is very much like trying to find that balance between getting [story missions] in front of players quickly because we love story stuff, and giving ourselves enough time to make changes or add features."</p><p>"To be fair, there's a bunch of stuff that we want to do next year, or that are already in development for next year, that will fill the gaps that people will have in between," Neuss clarifies later in the stream. "We're trying to make it so that it doesn't feel like 'and then there's nothing' for a long extended period of time. It's more like 'there's this cool thing!' and 'there's this other narrative thing', 'there's this other narrative thing' - we keep telling interesting stories and moving that all forward."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-producer-says-therell-be-multiple-seasons-between-new-story-missions/1100-6515654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
