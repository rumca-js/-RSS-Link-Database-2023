As Andy Murray’s first round hit-about against a game, likable but outmatched Ryan Peniston came to an end after two ruminative hours the Centre Court crowd rose to offer an unusually tender ovation.

Photographer who captured the glamour and spirit of his native Italy in the 1950s and 60s<p>The photographer Paolo Di Paolo, who has died aged 98, documented the renaissance of Italy following the dark days of the second world war, capturing that country’s 1950s and 60s glamour. His star shone brightly for 15 years before he turned his back on photography, but in that time he recorded the luminosity of cultural figures such as Pier Paolo Pasolini, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/gina-lollobrigida-obituary" title="">Gina Lollobrigida</a> and Tennessee Williams, as well as the optimism and dignity of ordinary people.</p><p>His pictures captured the shift from a more innocent, rural life, in a style that mirrored the neorealism movement in Italian film, as embodied in the shot of three boys on a bucolic hill looking towards the sprawl of Rome. His keen eye recorded the societal tension between the haves and have-nots, but his humanist approach highlighted the elegance of every person, regardless of circumstance. He said: “You might not know the subject but you understand the situation. In every image there is a story to tell … that is my law.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/04/paolo-di-paolo-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Underfunding and a lack of planning have undermined the health service, but the public is still behind it </p><p>The rhetoric and the reality of the UK’s National Health Service have rarely been further apart. On Wednesday the health secretary, Steve Barclay, will read prayers at a celebratory service at Westminster Abbey, while NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, will join a procession. Given the NHS’s status as a beloved national institution – the closest thing the English have to a religion, Nigel Lawson famously claimed – it is not unexpected that its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/04/tories-nhs-75th-birthday-underfunding-britain" title="">75th birthday</a> should be marked this way. But it is jarring to see the state staging such a spectacle while the health and care system increasingly feels broken to staff and patients in clinics, hospitals and therapy rooms around the country.</p><p>It didn’t, and doesn’t, have to be this way. Polling carried out for the Health Foundation shows that <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/nhs-remains-our-biggest-source-of-national-pride-but-public-are-worried-about-its-future#:~:text=Nearly%203%20in%204%20of,its%20current%20form%20%E2%80%93%2026%25)." title="">72% of the public</a> believe the NHS is crucial to British society and should remain free at the point of use, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/02/seven-in-10-people-believe-charges-for-nhs-care-are-on-the-way" title="">80%</a> think it needs increased funding. At the same time, 71% expect new charges to be introduced over the next 10 years. This combination of loyalty and pessimism indicates how seriously successive Conservative governments have let the public down. Their systematic underfunding of health, above all when David Cameron was prime minister and budgets were frozen, has led to the NHS struggling more and more to meet people’s needs. The failure to resolve longstanding issues in the social care sector, and refusal to regulate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/27/uk-to-tighten-rules-on-online-gambling-after-long-awaited-review" title="">industries that profit</a> by worsening public health, compound the problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-at-75-pride-mixed-with-disappointment">Continue reading...</a>

## Pure petrofiction: why writers will keep drilling for stories about oil

<p>From tales of ‘hissing’ oilmen to ‘crying’ trees, novels about petroleum and its devastating effect on communities and the environment are powerful fiction for our times – with the potential for prophecy</p><p>Whatever our misgivings, oil has been driving the world for well over a century. Its multiple derivatives serve our consumption habits and so oil pervades all human relations. For as long as we have been wedded to petroleum and its byproducts, writers have been trying to fictionalise our predicament, through a genre formally identified – back in 1992, by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/amitav-ghosh">Amitav Ghosh</a> – as “petrofiction”.</p><p>Since oil is transnational, pipelines and tankers taking it across the globe, so too is petrofiction. Loaded perforce with large themes, it is also coloured by a distinctive image-repertoire. Petrofiction’s primal scene is “the gusher”: that calamitous moment in the early days of explorative drilling when crude would simply erupt from its high-pressure confinement. “The inside of the Earth seemed to burst out through that hole; a roaring and rushing, as Niagara, and a black column shot up into the air...”, reads a line from the first big petro-novel, Oil! (1927) by Upton Sinclair, a writer who was tirelessly concerned with exposing the material basis of society.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/04/pure-petrofiction-why-writers-will-keep-drilling-for-stories-about-oil">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For <strong>Margaret McNally</strong>, a chance encounter helped spark her realisation that during bereavement there is joy – and a life to live</p><p>It had been many years since a man offered to buy me a drink in a late-night lounge bar. I wouldn’t ordinarily be found in such a place and the only man to have bought my drinks for 25 years was my husband. But when a long, lean gentleman took me by surprise with his invitation, I surprised myself by saying yes. Moments earlier, in a brief exchange, I had told him my husband had died 19 months ago.</p><p>Seated at the bar, this stranger beside me asked if I was “emerging”. I don’t recall my grief counsellor or clinical psychologist ever asking this. Mostly, people ask the perfunctory “how are you? ”– a question often predicated on an “I’m OK” response, even when you’re not. People mean well but most don’t know what to say to the bereaved. Many say nothing. People want us to be OK. They fear knowing the ugly reality of how we truly are, lest grief is contagious. Grief is uncomfortable, for everyone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/05/almost-two-years-after-my-husbands-death-im-still-grieving-but-im-also-living-in-his-honour">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We’re contemporary, we’re traditional, we’re unique’: the African photographers rewriting the rules

<p>From female bikers decked out in pink to dreamy desert tableaux, a new exhibition replaces two centuries of western influence with Africans’ own liberated visions</p><p>At first glance, Congolese photographer Kiripi Katembo’s images look like playful sci-fi montages: shaky Kinshasa streetscapes in which giant rocks seem to be falling out of the sky, like a lo-fi apocalypse. On closer inspection there are no special effects: the images are actually reflections in puddles, turned upside down, each capturing a fleeting moment of street life in a shimmering, suitably surreal fashion that’s arguably closer to the sensory experience of being there. It’s a testament to ingenuity: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/13/kiripi-katembos-best-photograph-the-heroic-women-of-kinshasa">Katembo</a>, who tragically died of malaria aged 36 in 2015, had little access to professional photography equipment, so he found his own way of using the camera. There was also an element of necessity. Most Congolese people do not want to have their picture taken, he once explained, so he had to seek less obtrusive ways of documenting his community.</p><p>Many Africans would have good reason to be suspicious of a camera pointed at them. The histories of photography and colonialism go hand in hand, especially in Africa. As Zimbabwean novelist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/27/guardianobituaries.books">Yvonne Vera</a> once wrote: “In Africa … the camera arrives as part of the colonial paraphernalia, together with the gun and the bible.” Even as European powers were carving up the continent in the 19th century, explorers were returning the first photographic images of Africa, which inevitably reflected the mindset of the people creating them: “untamed” landscapes filtered through fantasies of “the dark continent”; quasi-scientific portraits of “subjects”, or even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/nov/19/the-anthropologists-africa-in-pictures-faces-voices">“specimens”</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/04/african-photography-world-in-common-tate-modern-exhibition">Continue reading...</a>

While working as a pundit on Channel 4’s coverage of England’s recent Euros qualifier against North Macedonia, the perma-furrowed former Rangers and Aston Villa boss said he had “been analysing that over the last couple of days, but as we stand right now, I won’t be taking that offer up”. $tevie’s stance has seemingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/03/steven-gerrard-makes-u-turn-to-become-new-al-ettifaq-head-coach">shifted in the intervening fortnight</a>, prompting cynics to speculate over what, or more specifically by how much, the size of his mooted salary might have changed to sign a two-year deal, managing an unspeakably wealthy club in a league hosing obscene amounts of petro-dollars at assorted players in a bid to raise its standard and profile.</p><p>Dominik Szoboszlai had indeed better check that supposed Steven Gerrard tattoo quote (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition), in case it actually translates as: ‘Talent is a blessing from God, but if you can’t keep a decent Villa squad off the foot of the table, you’d better think twice about taking that Saudi coin.’ It’s better than ‘just knock it Mamadou, I’m thinking about launching a Hollywood over Demba Ba’, to be fair” – Jon Millard.</p><p>Never mind Sam Leitch’s ‘dancing in the streets of Raith’ comment (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/03/football-daily-email-england-euros-under-21">yesterday’s Football Daily letters</a>). His finest moment came on Grandstand in October 1971, when he said: ‘In Scotland it’s League Cup final day where Celtic take on Partick Thistle who have no chance.’ Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps9iCQgMI5E">a 4-1 Partick win</a>.

The new season really can’t come quickly enough” – John Lawton (or is it?).</p><p>This all reminds me of the time back in the early-90s when I read one letter in a Saturday newspaper’s glossy magazine (not Big Paper) that was quite scathing about an article in the previous week’s magazine, about Gary Lineker’s experience playing in Japan. I was, nonetheless, quite keen to read the article and, fortunately for me, the journalist that had been savaged in the letter lived in the same flats as me, so I popped round to see if he had a copy I could read.

<p><strong>Tom Patterson theatre, Stratford, Ontario<br /></strong>Antoni Cimolino directs a sophisticated and stimulating production of Eduardo De Filippo’s funny yet poignant play</p><p>It starts with a carefree round of cards and has some crowd-pleasing illusions but Eduardo De Filippo’s Grand Magic (1948) is as much about the ways we deceive ourselves as we do others. Staging his third of De Filippo’s plays for Ontario’s Stratford festival, artistic director Antoni Cimolino has conjured up a sophisticated and intellectually stimulating production that balances daft comedy with poignancy. Like the best of tricks, it catches you off guard.</p><p>We are in a seaside hotel whose guests include the mean-spirited Calogero, his neglected wife Marta and her paramour Mariano. Calogero’s own faithfulness is questioned when the magician Otto puts on an entertainment in which he makes Marta disappear. With a playful awareness of theatre’s own artifice, we see her secretly depart in a speedboat with her lover – their feet sticking below the hull as they scamper away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/04/grand-magic-review-stratford-ontario">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As Czechoslovakia embraced democracy in the 1990s, bands such as Ecstasy of St Theresa and Here expressed their liberation in waves of layered guitar noise</p><p>‘Sting would not do that. The guitars are too loud, the voice too drowned.” Jan P Muchow, of Czech shoegaze band the Ecstasy of Saint Theresa, is remembering how sound engineers used to patronise them when they emerged at the dawn of the 1990s. But as Muchow says, “We didn’t want to be three universes close to anything like Sting”.</p><p>The Ecstasy despised guitar solos, used English lyrics and hid behind reverb and distortion. Czech listeners, accustomed largely to folk music or schlager pop, were not ready for it. “Our early tours outside Prague felt like Easy Rider,” Muchow remembers; organisers from the houses of culture, relics of communism across the country that would host concerts, were horrified by overpowered amps catching on fire, and audiences covered their ears when faced with massive walls of guitar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/04/we-didnt-want-to-sound-close-to-anything-like-sting-the-exhilarating-freedom-of-the-czech-shoegaze-scene">Continue reading...</a>

To do so would defeat the object of the interest rate rise – to cool down the economy – and prolong the inflation crisis. Further rate rises look likely as inflation proves <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2023/jun/30/eurozone-inflation-falls-sharp-contrast-to-uk-brexit-energy">more sticky in the UK</a> than many other high-income economies.</p><p>The government is instead opting to get the UK’s major banks to agree to a voluntary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mortgage-charter">“mortgage charter”</a>. This involves offering forms of temporary relief such as short-term switches to interest-only repayments, as well as extending the period between missed payments and forcible home repossession. Labour has proposed a similar response. This is sensible. Banks should be well placed to absorb some reductions in returns, being better capitalised and enjoying high returns on their lending on the back of recent interest rate rises. But if rates stay higher for longer, additional assistance may be needed to avoid repossessions.</p><p>Josh Ryan-Collins is associate professor of economics and finance at the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/04/uk-housing-market-hurting-homeowners-renters">Continue reading...</a>

Catherine Hardwicke is the director of the powerful Thirteen, the first and best <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/19/film-review-twilight-teen-vampire">Twilight</a>, and the tender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/24/miss-you-already-review-drew-barrymore-toni-collette">Miss You Already</a> (2015); her lead actor here is none other than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/22/brian-cox-i-think-the-succession-debate-is-is-he-dead">Brian Cox</a>, whose star could hardly be more starrily in the ascendant after his stunning performance as Murdochian media plutocrat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/05/life-without-logan-roy-was-brian-cox-written-out-of-succession-too-soon">Logan Roy in HBO’s Succession</a>. There is also the estimable Kate Beckinsale. But there is only so much they can do with this material.</p><p>Cox plays Max, an ageing tough guy in jail, given compassionate leave after a terminal cancer diagnosis to spend his remaining months with long-suffering daughter Maxine (Beckinsale). She is a hardworking single mum living in the featureless suburban district around Las Vegas with her teenage son Ezra (Christopher Convery), who is being bullied at school on account of his epileptic seizures. Maxine still resents her grizzled dad for putting crime above family, but the old guy wants to make things right and – like the fierce ex-boxer that he is – shows Ezra how to deal with the bullies. (Train in the gym and beat them up turns out to be the answer to this one.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/prisoners-daughter-review-brian-cox-catherine-hardwicke-kate-beckinsale">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘His music kindled my agency and hunger for self-definition’: why women adore Bruce Springsteen

<p>He’s seen as one of the quintessential writers of male experience, but as a new book explores, his resonance with female listeners is just as complex </p><p>At Bruce Springsteen’s recent show in Edinburgh, a fan managed to hand the 73-year-old rock icon a copy of his dissertation about masculinity. Pondering the masculinity of the Boss is logical: his themes include brotherhood, father-son conflict and the trials of physical labour; his songs are populated with downtrodden blue-collar workers, suicidal firefighters, forgotten soldiers returning from various wars, and economically disempowered men driven to murder. Indeed, he’s seen as one of the quintessential writers of the male experience. So why does he appeal to so many women?</p><p>A new book by Lorraine Mangione and Donna Luff, Mary Climbs In: the Journeys of Bruce Springsteen’s Women Fans, explores the reasons why. Both authors were aware of the stereotypes of female fans, be it the groupie or infatuated screaming teen, and their findings happily upended them: fans found community through concert experiences, and related to Springsteen as a result of loss, suffering, the quest for self-knowledge and for meaning in life. Luff says: “When I talked with other women fans, they were mostly not giddy about Springsteen in terms of sexual attraction. Instead, they spoke about identification with his writing and the emotions, experiences and feelings in his songs and concerts.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/04/his-music-kindled-my-agency-and-hunger-for-self-definition-why-women-adore-bruce-springsteen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So a prime minister soiled by the Rwanda policy offers fair play and ethics lessons to cricketers. Funny old game, isn’t it?</p><p>Cricket banning orders, please, for the Wagner group of MCC blazers who took it upon themselves to enforce “the spirit of the game” by abusing the Australian team as they returned to their dressing room through the members’ pavilion shortly after their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/03/australias-actions-in-ashes-test-not-in-the-spirit-of-cricket-says-rishi-sunak">stumping of Jonny Bairstow</a> on the last day of the Ashes Test at Lord’s. It was in the always-aggressively-hallowed Long Room that TV viewers witnessed confirmation that the spirit of cricket is 40% proof – although <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12257605/New-footage-shows-intense-abuse-Aussie-stars-copped-Lords-Bairstow-dismissal.html">later social media videos</a> confirmed the angry bellowing had happened all the way up the stairs in a display of herd behaviour some might class as lacking in class.

But they never signed him. Four million!” It was 2018, Haaland was playing under Solskjær for Norwegian side Molde and, while he was not quite the renowned goal machine we see today, the young striker was still attracting watchful glances.</p><p>Fast forward to the present day and, as Haaland scores goals for fun at Manchester City, United are looking to firm up their interest in the Danish striker Rasmus Højlund.

<p>Documentary following a group of women dancers over 60 is well made but leaves you wondering if there’s more to know about these spirited performers</p><p>Maria Loohufvud and Love Martinsen, a married couple as well as artistic collaborators, make their feature debut as directors with this affectionate portrait of the Calendar Girls, an amateur dance troupe based in southern Florida. Entirely made up of women over the age of 60, a few considerably older, the dancers perform on flatbed trucks in parades and retirement homes, community centres and private events in order to raise funds for Southeastern Guide Dogs, an organisation that trains guide dogs for veterans and other visually impaired people. Dressed in homemade, leg-revealing spandex and sparkle-festooned outfits that variously suggest unicorns or “patriotic reindeer” at Christmas time, the women perform dance sequences set to an eclectic selection of tunes, from Harry Belafonte’s Jump in the Line (Shake, Señora) and Everybody by the Backstreet Boys, to drone-forward EDM composed by Martinsen himself. There is, in fact, a scene where the women seem to break into a tightly planned routine (choreographed by Loohufvud) in the middle of loading the car, which adds a mild surreality to the proceedings.</p><p>As the film goes along, we get to know some of the women on a more personal level although the film-makers have chosen not to use any identifying subtitles to help track who’s who, as is often the fashion these days with documentaries. Still, it’s not hard to work out that Katherine Hardy Shortlidge is the main motivating troupe leader, a former cop who spent years undercover in the vice squad, who had found a new purpose in marshalling her dancers between rehearsals and performances. Another subject who gets prominent coverage is Nancy Miller, a woman still doing a physically challenging outdoor 9-to-5 job but who finds herself increasingly challenged to keep up due to a serious gastrointestinal condition that drains her health. A third woman bridles against a controlling husband who doesn’t want her diverting her energy away from him and their home; yet another, perhaps the most intriguing of all, is a former prisoner with a twangy southern accent, a massive Rottweiler and a butch fashion sense who works the troupe’s iPod.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/calendar-girls-review-portrait-of-a-seniors-dance-troupe-grooving-it-up-in-florida">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pugilism and personal reflections trade blows in a clear-sighted and adroit debut collection</p><p>Reading poetry, the task of a reader is in part to situate the poet – where they are in a poem is often as telling as who they are. In Declan Ryan’s adroit debut, <em>Crisis Actor</em><em>,</em> he lets us know, from the title itself, that we should not feel certain of his whereabouts.</p><p>A crisis actor (I had to look it up) is someone who “takes part in a supposed conspiracy to manipulate public opinion” and pretends to have survived a disaster. Ryan is, it would seem, mindful of the possibility of being a poetic impostor – someone who falsely reacts to other lives, distorts the voices he impersonates, takes on conflicts not his own. A poet as crisis actor. But he proves himself brilliantly equipped to see off the risks of relating other people’s narratives, alongside his own, in poems of serious-minded, clear-sighted, conversational intelligence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/04/crisis-actor-by-declan-ryan-review-all-the-best-punchlines">Continue reading...</a>

## Name Me Lawand review – empathic and inspiring portrait of deaf Iraqi refugee boy

<p>This heartfelt documentary shows us the world from the point of view of a migrant whose life was revolutionised by a school for the deaf in the UK</p><p>Edward Lovelace’s heartfelt and valuable documentary tells the story of Lawand Hamad Amin, a profoundly deaf Iraqi Kurdish boy who some eight years ago fled his home country with his family, found himself in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/life-death-and-limbo-in-the-calais-jungle-five-years-after-its-demolition">the Calais “jungle”</a>, and was helped across to the UK by a disability charity. Lawand was settled in Derby where he became a star pupil at the Royal School for the Deaf. Equipped with a hi-tech hearing aid and learning British Sign Language, he came to terms with the world for the first time, gaining a new relationship with his family and realising he was not the disruptive underachiever everyone thought but a really intelligent child. But then the Home Office indicated that Lawand’s family could be deported and they had a battle on their hands.</p><p>Lovelace’s film attempts to feel its way inside Lawand’s consciousness, perhaps in the empathic and intuitive spirit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/16/the-reason-i-jump-review-an-empathic-study-of-nonverbal-autism">The Reason I Jump</a>, a documentary about neurodivergence. There are some fascinating, impressionistic, almost free-associative scenes here, although I sometimes wondered if the film was perhaps a bit too dreamy in its imagined otherworldly view, perhaps conflating what it took to be Lawand’s view of the world with its own anxious idealism. I have to say I also thought it relies rather heavily, at times, on some Malick-esque music and golden-hour visuals in this regard, and I would have liked to hear more directly from Lawand’s parents who are almost entirely silent. But there is something inspiring in the scenes showing his lessons with his teacher Sophie Stone, and in the poetry that the film finds, not just in Lawand’s lonely determination but also in that of his brother Rawa, who is striving to be his friend and ally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/name-me-lawand-review-empathic-and-inspiring-portrait-of-deaf-iraqi-refugee-boy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vittorio Emanuele, the Italian throne’s last heir, was apprehended in 1978 after a teen died from a gunshot on an exclusive island. This twisty, restrained documentary follows the fallout</p><p>Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia is the last heir to the throne of Italy. He and his family were exiled in 1946 and could not return for the next 56 years. He has been the centre of many ... unpleasantnesses. The most recent were the charges of criminal association, racketeering, exploitation of prostitution and sundry other delights, on which he was later acquitted. But, in Netflix’s latest contribution to the swelling ranks of true crime documentaries, The King Who Never Was, the makers concentrate on the scandal that really made his name: his arrest in 1978 for the killing of 19-year-old Dirk Hamer and the subsequent 38-year campaign by Hamer’s sister Birgit to get some answers.</p><p>In the summer of 1978, Birgit and her brother joined a group of glamorous young Italian friends on a trip to Cavallo – a French island near Corsica and the playground of the Savoy family. “We were neither few nor quiet,” says one of the friends now, still glamorous in middle-age and still incredulous at how the fateful night unfolded. The Savoy family could, she feels, legitimately have found them annoying. They also “borrowed” the dinghy tied to Emanuele’s boat in the bay where their own three vessels were moored, to get them to a restaurant and back in the evening. Late that night, Emanuele set off to get it back. He took his rifle. “Because in Corsica, danger is always round the corner,” he says now. Two shots were fired. One travelled through the cabin walls of the nearby boat Dirk was asleep on and hit him in the stomach. Emanuele was arrested and a few days later signed a letter admitting civil liability for what would turn out to be a mortal injury. Months later, after 19 surgeries, Dirk died. The day before he did so, Emanuele was bailed and left Corsica for Switzerland.</p><p>The King Who Never Was is on Netflix.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/04/the-king-who-never-was-review-the-gripping-tale-of-the-first-royal-to-be-arrested-since-marie-antoinette">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They’ve spent years toying with journalists, using fake names or sending actors to interviews. Now the ad guy behind the elusive Detroit band lifts the lid on the Armed multiverse</p><p>The Armed are a head-spinning proposition. The anonymous Detroit hardcore collective have spent the past 14 years hiding behind a carefully curated air of mystery and an anarchic sense of irony that has, in tandem with records that fuse grinding chaos with moments of euphoric melody, made them one of the most consistently thrilling propositions in heavy music. It’s been suggested that everyone from Kurt Ballou, guitarist with the influential hardcore band Converge, to party-rocker Andrew WK to pro-skater Tony Hawk has been steering the ship.</p><p>But today, they’re coming clean, something vocalist Tony Wolski seems remarkably chipper about. In the past, he and his bandmates have delighted in toying with journalists, frequently utilising fake names and even sending actors to interviews in their places, making his boyish smile a tad unnerving. “Sorry to disappoint,” he says with a laugh, and it seems that his desire to offer the truth behind the most confusing, exciting punk band on Earth is at least somewhat genuine. “The real story is more confusing than any lie,” he contends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/04/the-armed-tony-wolski-unmasks-the-punk-collective">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Striker has grasped second chance with both hands after the pain of a failed move to England led to a Villarreal goal glut</p><p>They hadn’t expected him but Villarreal awaited Nicolas Jackson with open arms when he landed back in Spain on board the same plane in which he had left. It was late January and the journey, supposed to be one way, hadn’t gone as planned. He had flown to England to join Bournemouth for €25m, their saviour, but a failed medical forced a return, his big opportunity gone. At 21, still on a B team contract six months since he was playing in the third tier, and with just eight first division starts and a hamstring injury that would limit him to a solitary minute until April, he didn’t know if another would come.</p><p>The answer, to their surprise, was: <em>soon</em>. “We will try to cheer him up, to encourage him because it was a great opportunity. We’ll support him, help him overcome this disappointment and strengthen him so that when the summer comes he is worth twice as much,” the Villarreal coach Quique Setién said. And while few imagined it would pan out like that, he wasn’t so far off. Despite what had happened in January, five months later Jackson flew to England again and this time there was no turning back. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/25/chelsea-complete-signing-of-villarreal-striker-nicolas-jackson-for-32m">On Sunday he joined Chelsea for £32m on an eight-year deal</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/04/street-football-to-premier-league-nicolas-jacksons-road-to-chelsea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A singing Greek chorus of Fates tell wild tales in this film of an outdoor production by Cornish theatre group Wildworks</p><p>There are some spine-tingling moments in this film of what looks like a beguiling outdoor production staged last summer by the Cornish theatre group Wildworks (best known for working with Michael Sheen on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/apr/24/the-passion-port-talbot-review">The Passion</a> in Port Talbot in 2011). The extraordinary atmospheric setting here is the beaches of Carlyon Bay near St Austell at dusk – the golden glow of the gloaming over a dark calm sea. Inside a circle of driftwood on the sand, a singing Greek chorus of Fates give us a content warning: they will be telling stories and “some can be hard to swallow, wild like the sea”.</p><p>These stories are framed by a fairytale about a pregnant woman (Hannah McPake) rescued from attackers by the chorus themselves.

(The same thing happened to its 300-year anniversary plans in 1921 in the aftermath of the Spanish flu pandemic and first world war.)

Information leading to the prosecution of a man accused of murder can lead to a reward of HK$300,000 (£30,200). For two men wanted in connection with an arson case that killed 17 people, the incentive goes up to HK$400,000. But the highest prize goes to those who can help capture eight overseas-based pro-democracy activists who are accused of violating Hong Kong’s national security law.

## Charlotte Higgins on The Archers: if you’re going to cause a scene, do it in a Swindon cafe

<p>There were threats, pleas for sympathy and a dramatic collapse from Evil Rob – but it barely got the other patrons’ teacups tinkling</p><p>‘A cafe in Swindon” was the location for the fateful meeting this month between Evil Rob Titchener and Helen Archer – the latter, in 2016, having stabbed the former in the stomach after enduring years of gaslighting and coercive control at his hands. Apparently, Rob has been doing a lot of “work on himself” in his house in Dakota. Maybe the kind that Jerry Lundegaard was doing in the movie Fargo before he hired Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife. At any rate, the beverage-sippers of Wiltshire must be a tolerant lot, because Helen’s increasingly strangulated tones of anguished bravery, let alone Rob’s collapse and seizure, caused nary a tinkling of teacups among the cafe’s other patrons.</p><p>Titchener – one minute as ’umble as Uriah Heep, the next as teeth-baringly threatening as Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter – might well have been faking his Swindonian fit in a bid for Helen’s sympathy and/or guilt. Because, as veteran listeners know, nothing, repeat nothing, is too evil for Evil Rob Titchener. On the other hand, he might well not, given that Lee and Tom, Helen’s partner and brother respectively, had recently paid him a visit. That ill-advised adventure, which may yet end Lee’s career as physiotherapist-in-chief to the Laurels care home, ended with Rob’s head smashed against a paving stone and stitches required. At the time of writing, it is thrillingly impossible to judge whether Helen is now invincible, immune to Rob’s former spell upon her – or whether Rob is now a diminished, weakened creature who has somehow come to Jesus. Obviously I hope not, because Evil Rob is so much fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/04/charlotte-higgins-on-the-archers">Continue reading...</a>

The <a href="https://www.marathondessables.com/en/marathon-des-sables/concept">Marathon des Sables</a> is a notorious foot race – 250km in extreme heat across terrain that ranges from dunes three storeys high to stony outcrops. Prosperi, a former Olympian, was among the fastest competitors. But, as he began to pass through a section of the race that was dominated by small dunes, the sand around him started to lift and swirl. “Small dunes, unlike large ones, walk,” he says. The swirling resembled a dance, rhythmic and mesmerising at first, but the rhythm became insistent and before he knew what was happening, Prosperi faced a yellow wall. “I couldn’t see anything. The wind blew so violently, the sand hurt.”</p><p>At the start, the organisers had given a talk and advised runners to take shelter in the event of a sandstorm. If lost, they should walk towards the clouds that gather at sunset. But, as Prosperi says, “There aren’t many shelters in the desert. In the middle of the dunes, it’s hard to find a place that will defend you.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/04/how-we-survive-mauro-prosperi-lost-desert-raw-bats-urine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukrainians living by the empty Kakhovka reservoir are coping but the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is a constant worry</p><p>Anna Supranova stood in front of what was once a vast artificial sea. Her home – at no 7 Hetman Street – looks on to Kakhovka reservoir in southern Ukraine. Or at least it did. The water has recently vanished. Most of it disappeared in the space of three surreal days last month, after Russian troops <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/kakhovka-dam-collapse-image-apparently-explosive-laden-car-ukraine-russia">blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam farther downstream.</a></p><p>Ever since, Supranova and other residents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/sep/01/the-ukrainians-living-on-a-nuclear-frontline-this-is-inhumanity-video">in the frontline town of Nikopol </a>have been without water. At the bottom of her garden is an unearthly and desolate muddy plain. It stretches as far as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, visible in the near haze. The civilian facility – occupied by Moscow since the beginning of its invasion – is 5km away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion">Continue reading...</a>

## Tedious, pointless, cringe-inducing: why The Idol was a failure from start to finish

<p>Even as it aired, Sam Levinson’s disastrous erotic thriller felt like a pulpy box-office flop rescued from the archives. It was so nothingy it’s hard to even tell what its point was – if anything</p><p>The Idol, the Weeknd and Sam Levinson’s embattled, controversial, woefully received erotic thriller, wrapped up after five weeks last night – not with a bang, nor a whimper, but a profound: <em>huh?</em> What was this show about, if anything? Nothing happened: the plot points covered in this show could make about two tight hours’ worth of television – or one probably-quite-watchable film – and instead were stretched to five, each episode padded out with extended musical numbers, montages of a sun-drenched Los Angeles, and some mightily cringe-inducing sex scenes.</p><p>In its final hour, the show was nothing if not consistent. By my count, about half the episode’s run-time was taken up with an extended showcase in which five characters – Moses Sumney’s Izaak; Troye Sivan’s Xander; Suzanna Son’s Chloe; Ramsey, playing herself; and, of course, Lily-Rose Depp’s Jocelyn – all performed entire solo musical numbers. (It was, at the very least, funny to watch Sumney and Depp grind on a bunch of bewildered label reps in what I have to assume was one of the show’s many improvised scenes.) The show’s main mystery – who, exactly, is Tedros, the mysterious would-be svengali played by the Weeknd? – is wrapped up in a single scene, in which music execs played by Hank Azaria, Jane Adams and Eli Roth laugh cartoonishly as they recount his history as a pimp, a sordid past dredged up by Vanity Fair reporter Talia (Hari Nef) in, apparently, less than a week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/04/tedious-pointless-cringe-inducing-why-the-idol-was-a-failure-from-start-to-finish">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘You reach a point where you can’t live your life’: what is behind extreme hoarding?

<p>Hoarding can be distressing and dangerous. But it’s not just a matter of ‘too much stuff’ – it’s a complex condition that requires careful, targeted help</p><p>At a recent “hoarding panel” meeting in east London, Daniel Pearson, commander for Shadwell and Whitechapel fire stations, played attenders a recording of a 999 call in which a panicked resident reported a fire at their home. A team of firefighters was dispatched immediately, but couldn’t access the property. Pearson displayed photographs from the scene, taken after the event: the doorways and corridors were blocked by heaps of possessions, now charred and unrecognisable. The person who made the call died. Pearson told me they see this kind of case regularly. Last year, the London fire brigade attended 1,036 hoarding-related fires which led to 186 injuries and 10 deaths. It now logs the properties of identified hoarders on a database, so fire stations know to send out extra firefighters if a fire is reported in one of them.</p><p>The hoarding panel, which meets monthly, brings together senior firefighters, mental health workers, landlords of social housing properties, and housing and environmental health council officers. At most meetings, they debate interventions for specific cases: should firefighters visit and offer smoke alarms and flame-retardant bedding? Could the person be referred to a specialist support programme? Or should the landlord consider forcible cleaning or eviction? Underlying these questions is a larger one: what can we do about hoarding? The panel’s very existence is a sign of a shift in the understanding of hoarding: not as a simple matter of too much stuff, but as a complex condition that requires targeted social policies and careful, long-term management.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/04/you-cant-live-your-life-what-is-behind-extreme-hoarding">Continue reading...</a>
