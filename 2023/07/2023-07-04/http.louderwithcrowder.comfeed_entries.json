I'm sure some of you are planning to celebrate America's birthday by blowing things up, as you've been doing since the 1st of July if not mid-June. No doubt you have one of those trendy Pikachu fireworks you plan on igniting. Outside, in an unenclosed space, because fireworks are what we call \"flammable.\" When you light something with a flame, that flame burns a string, and the string sets off an explosive, all three of those things are caused by fire. That's why you light fireworks OUTSIDE! We get each other, right?</p><p>One Twitch streamer was unaware of how fire, incidentally devices, and hot things worked. </p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Speed sets his house on fire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ishowspeed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ishowspeed</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YJF2TTyREm\">pic.twitter.com/YJF2TTyREm</a><br />\u2014 Eragon (@Eragone_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eragone_/status/1544048698728091648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/climate-pikachu-g7\" target=\"_self\">Pikachu was embarrassing enough</a>, but the ensuing reaction gives us an epic fail not seen since <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cat-attacks-owner-for-not-voting-donald-trump-video\" target=\"_self\">some dude's cat attacked him</a> over voting rights. </p><p>His mother was NOT amused. And if the dude shut off his live stream as his mother asked, it would have saved him the embarrassment of being screamed at by her.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">His mother\u2019s reaction \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d <a href=\"https://t.co/6zD1WoXYQN\">pic.twitter.com/6zD1WoXYQN</a><br />\u2014 Eragon (@Eragone_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eragone_/status/1544049366608084994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Or the embarrassment of the fire department needing to show up.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">The firemen are coming <a href=\"https://t.co/U013Gg2YqK\">pic.twitter.com/U013Gg2YqK</a><br />\u2014 Eragon (@Eragone_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eragone_/status/1544050752049537024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The real shame is that had he set off Pikachu outside, it would have looked sick. It's not like they don't make vlogging tripods that allow you to stream outside. They are every third Instagram advertisement. Maybe invest in some mobile equipment instead of setting your bedroom on fire.</p><p>That's at least if the dude is still allowed to live stream after this unfortunate occurrence. If it was my mother, I'd have the internet taken away until I thought about what I did.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Sales down 50% from last year. Giving beer away for free just to unload the merchandise. But Light has gotten work on gone broker than any other company before it. And it is now cheaper than water. At least, in some places.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12258943/Bud-Light-cheaper-WATER-places-20b-Dylan-Mulvaney-disaster.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> spoke to Andy Wagner, manager of Glenn Miller's Beer & Soda Warehouse in Pennsylvania to see how bad things are for the former #1 beer in America. They are this bad.</p><blockquote>It's just not moving like it used to. At this point, it's cheaper than some of the cases of water we're selling in the back.</blockquote><p>Some of you may be saying, \"Hey Brodigan, I thought the Washington Post reported that none of this is Dylan Mulvaney's fault, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-dethroned\" target=\"_blank\">and Americans just don't like beer anymore or something.</a>\" According to Miller, that is fake news. $24.99 cases of Miller Lite still fly off the shelves, while insanely marked-down $8.99 cases of Bud Light sit there.</p><blockquote><span></span>I've seen longtime Bud Light customers trying other beers. If they find something they like, they may not come back. It's not that they stopped drinking beer. They just stopped buying Bud Light.</blockquote><p>In Miller's opinion, Bud Light broke the cardinal bar rule in the beer industry: No politics, no religion. The rub is Bud Light is owned by the global company Anheuser-Busch and follows the cardinal ESG rule in the global corporation industry: Politics is religion.</p><p>Bud Light and AB can't win for losing as of late. Dylan Mulvaney, the controversial titface performer at the center of the worst marketing decision in the history of marketing, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light-response\" target=\"_blank\">has lashed out at the company for not having his back</a>. And former AB president Anson Fredericks has said if AB CEO Brendan Whitworth won't resign, the board needs to remove him.</p><blockquote>Whitworth has clearly shown himself to be incapable of solving the Mulvaney crisis. He\u2019s had multiple chances and he\u2019s failed. ... As such \u2013 and I take no pleasure in passing this judgement \u2013 it's clear to me that it's time for the shareholders and board of Anheuser-Busch to ask Whitworth to step down.<br /><br /></blockquote><p>A simple \"whoops, we f*cked up\" twenty billion dollars ago would have helped, instead, of corporate Mad Libs about \"big social conversations\" and needing to \"deeply understand and appreciate\" what the customer cares about. The customer cares about you not hating them. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market\" target=\"_self\">Once the customer learns how much you hate them in real life</a>, lame marketing campaigns won't fix it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

A figment of her imagination? Or was the other passenger dishonest and not being \"real\" with her? She looks kinda basic. The type of woman who has posted on at least one occasion that if you aren't there for her at her worst, you don't deserve her at her best. Spoiler: Those broads never have a best. And they are the kind who would cause a three-hour delay over an argument.</p><p>However, if I were to guess, I agree with the consensus from the comments. This is what happens when you have one too many edibles.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
