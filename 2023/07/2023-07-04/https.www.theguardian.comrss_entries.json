Banks should be well placed to absorb some reductions in returns, being better capitalised and enjoying high returns on their lending on the back of recent interest rate rises.

Entirely made up of women over the age of 60, a few considerably older, the dancers perform on flatbed trucks in parades and retirement homes, community centres and private events in order to raise funds for Southeastern Guide Dogs, an organisation that trains guide dogs for veterans and other visually impaired people. Dressed in homemade, leg-revealing spandex and sparkle-festooned outfits that variously suggest unicorns or \u201cpatriotic reindeer\u201d at Christmas time, the women perform dance sequences set to an eclectic selection of tunes, from Harry Belafonte\u2019s Jump in the Line (Shake, Se\u00f1ora) and Everybody by the Backstreet Boys, to drone-forward EDM composed by Martinsen himself. There is, in fact, a scene where the women seem to break into a tightly planned routine (choreographed by Loohufvud) in the middle of loading the car, which adds a mild surreality to the proceedings.</p><p>As the film goes along, we get to know some of the women on a more personal level although the film-makers have chosen not to use any identifying subtitles to help track who\u2019s who, as is often the fashion these days with documentaries. Still, it\u2019s not hard to work out that Katherine Hardy Shortlidge is the main motivating troupe leader, a former cop who spent years undercover in the vice squad, who had found a new purpose in marshalling her dancers between rehearsals and performances. Another subject who gets prominent coverage is Nancy Miller, a woman still doing a physically challenging outdoor 9-to-5 job but who finds herself increasingly challenged to keep up due to a serious gastrointestinal condition that drains her health. A third woman bridles against a controlling husband who doesn\u2019t want her diverting her energy away from him and their home; yet another, perhaps the most intriguing of all, is a former prisoner with a twangy southern accent, a massive Rottweiler and a butch fashion sense who works the troupe\u2019s iPod.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/calendar-girls-review-portrait-of-a-seniors-dance-troupe-grooving-it-up-in-florida\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/calendar-girls-review-portrait-of-a-seniors-dance-troupe-grooving-it-up-in-florida", "date_published": "2023-07-04T10:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Fourth of July is a US celebration.

Apparently, Rob has been doing a lot of \u201cwork on himself\u201d in his house in Dakota.

That ill-advised adventure, which may yet end Lee\u2019s career as physiotherapist-in-chief to the Laurels care home, ended with Rob\u2019s head smashed against a paving stone and stitches required. At the time of writing, it is thrillingly impossible to judge whether Helen is now invincible, immune to Rob\u2019s former spell upon her \u2013 or whether Rob is now a diminished, weakened creature who has somehow come to Jesus.

Nothing happened: the plot points covered in this show could make about two tight hours\u2019 worth of television \u2013 or one probably-quite-watchable film \u2013 and instead were stretched to five, each episode padded out with extended musical numbers, montages of a sun-drenched Los Angeles, and some mightily cringe-inducing sex scenes.</p><p>In its final hour, the show was nothing if not consistent.

A team of firefighters was dispatched immediately, but couldn\u2019t access the property. Pearson displayed photographs from the scene, taken after the event: the doorways and corridors were blocked by heaps of possessions, now charred and unrecognisable. The person who made the call died. Pearson told me they see this kind of case regularly. Last year, the London fire brigade attended 1,036 hoarding-related fires which led to 186 injuries and 10 deaths. It now logs the properties of identified hoarders on a database, so fire stations know to send out extra firefighters if a fire is reported in one of them.</p><p>The hoarding panel, which meets monthly, brings together senior firefighters, mental health workers, landlords of social housing properties, and housing and environmental health council officers. At most meetings, they debate interventions for specific cases: should firefighters visit and offer smoke alarms and flame-retardant bedding? Could the person be referred to a specialist support programme? Or should the landlord consider forcible cleaning or eviction? Underlying these questions is a larger one: what can we do about hoarding? The panel\u2019s very existence is a sign of a shift in the understanding of hoarding: not as a simple matter of too much stuff, but as a complex condition that requires targeted social policies and careful, long-term management.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/04/you-cant-live-your-life-what-is-behind-extreme-hoarding\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/04/you-cant-live-your-life-what-is-behind-extreme-hoarding", "date_published": "2023-07-04T04:00:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "China accuses UK of protecting \u2018fugitives\u2019 after bounty put on Hong Kong democracy activists", "description": "<p>Chinese embassy in London tells UK to \u2018stop interfering\u2019 in China\u2019s affairs, as Hong Kong leader says overseas activists will be \u2018pursued for life\u2019</p><p>China has accused the UK of protecting fugitives after the British foreign secretary criticised Hong Kong\u2019s decision to offer HK$1m bounties for the arrest of eight democracy activists based overseas, as the territory\u2019s leader said the group would be \u201cpursued for life\u201d.</p><p>In a statement late on Monday, China\u2019s embassy in London said: \u201cBritish politicians have openly offered protection for fugitives.
