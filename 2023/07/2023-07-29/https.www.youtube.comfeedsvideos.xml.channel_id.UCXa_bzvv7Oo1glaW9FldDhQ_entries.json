But because the year is far from over, we still have plenty of upcoming contenders who are shaping up to some of the biggest games of the year - including but not limited to Fort Solis. \n\nCurrently in development at Fallen Leaf Studios, Fort Solis is all about solving a mystery in a mining facility on Mars. The game is heavily inspired by Quantic Dreams\u2019 works, and the game also does some interesting things with regard to its presentation and progression mechanics - which could help the game cater to a wide audience. The lack of proper marketing does hurt the game\u2019s case, but all it needs is a little course correction and it will be primed to be a big game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2-8XOktqjo", "date_published": "2023-07-29T15:30:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/I2-8XOktqjo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Diablo 4 - WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?", "description": "Despite exceptional revenue and rave reviews from many critics, Blizzard's Diablo 4 is in an odd place. Various problems remained in the lead-up to Season of the Malignant, like respec costs, limited stash space or the constant nerfing of XP farming. The underwhelming state of classes like Sorcerer also didn't help.\n\nThere was hope of things turning around when Season 1 dropped. Unfortunately, the pre-season patch arrived and nerfed every class, XP gain, and more. There were even some inane changes like World Tier 3 and 4 level requirements and two more seconds required to leave a Dungeon.\n\nTo say that players were annoyed would be an understatement. Here's what happened and what the development team has done to address it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAxQuzIff6s", "date_published": "2023-07-29T13:30:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qAxQuzIff6s/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart PC Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, while having been out on the PS5 for a little over 2 years now, has finally made its way onto the PC. Along with its jump to a new platform, the game has also brought with it a hefty list of hardware requirements, including the need for high-speed storage.\n\nThe game mixes 3D platforming with run-and-gun gameplay to offer one of the more unique takes on a genre that some believe peaked during the PS2 generation. Along with its gorgeous visuals and bright, cheerful color palette, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart also brings with it an arsenal of weapons that is as absurd as it is fun.\n\nWith its jump to PC, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart also gets some new features, including improved ambient occlusion with ray-tracing, and even support for DirectStorage 1.2 to make use of your GPU for decompressing the game\u2019s files, leading to faster potential load times, if you have the hardware to support it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE8SaqYalM4", "date_published": "2023-07-29T08:45:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/uE8SaqYalM4/hqdefault.jpg"}]
