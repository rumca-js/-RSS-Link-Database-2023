I colorized, restored and applied face restoration and created a sound design for this video of Street Scenes in Paris 1898, An exceptional look at traffic on the streets of the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es in the 19th century, before the arrival of the automobile in the 20th century, with a scene from the avenue du Bois de Boulogne showing the style of dress of the period.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ” Face Restoration

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
