<p>Tourists pay dearly for belief that if they bowled their normal stuff, a normal England innings would follow</p><p>As the 2023 Ashes moved to within two days of its scheduled close, there was no escaping the reality for Australia that it was happening again. That feeling of being slapped around the chops, too dazed to get the thread of what to do next. England with the bat running the game in their own way, setting the terms that Australia had to respond to. This, above all, has been the idea behind Bazball: not all about hitting sixes or bowling bouncers, but making opponents react rather than act.</p><p>It was there on the first day of the series at Edgbaston, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/16/england-australia-ashes-first-test-day-1-match-report">when England made 393</a> in audacious style before declaring within sight of stumps, but the eight wickets that Australia took that day made it feel like the visitors had just about kept control. It was there on the final day at Lord’s as Ben Stokes hit six after six, but that time felt like Australia had enough of a cushion to withstand a big hundred, and so it proved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/29/australia-out-of-ideas-final-ashes-test-england-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

Audiences first heard her in 2014, as a vocalist for drum’n’bass four-piece Rudimental, with whom she toured for two years before she launched a pop career, which included her 2016 Clean Bandit collaboration and Christmas No 1 Rockabye, and two successful solo albums. Her third, Unhealthy, is out now.</p><p><strong>Aged six and covered in candyfloss, this is me in my element.</strong> My family would stay in Butlin’s, Clacton-on-Sea, when I was growing up.

The well-worn jumper was a gift from a fan “in either Bradford, Barnsley or Bolton; one of them”, who asked for it to be passed on to his late wife, Nora Forster. “It was very sweet. She can’t wear it now, so I wear it. It’s not about the monetary value, it’s the thought – that’s priceless.” His love for his fanbase feels completely genuine. On the wall behind him are a Samurai sword and an Afghan dagger given to him by diehards when his band Public Image Ltd (PiL) played behind the iron curtain decades ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/29/john-lydon-public-image-pil-sex-pistols-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Glasgow flanker with seven caps has been given the armband for World Cup warm-up against the Azzurri</p><p><br />Rory Darge was a surprise choice to captain Scotland in Saturday’s home game against Italy, and on Friday the Glasgow openside admitted he had been blindsided by the decision of Gregor Townsend, the head coach, to give him the honour.</p><p>Jamie Ritchie remains the team’s captain for the Rugby World Cup, so the appointment of Darge, 23, for this first of four warm-up matches has probably been made with an eye to the longer term. However, given that Ritchie is among the senior players who are absent on Saturday afternoon, a less experienced leader was always likely for the national team’s first outing since the retirement of former captain Stuart Hogg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/29/rory-darge-rugby-union-prepares-to-lead-scotland-italy">Continue reading...</a>
