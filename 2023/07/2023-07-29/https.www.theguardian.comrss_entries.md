<p>This new Irish thriller starring Charlene McKenna opens with a Lady Macbeth moment. If you can get past the ludicrous twists and an unfeasibly hairy disguise, it’s enjoyable</p><p>Clean Sweep is a serviceable, perfectly watchable Irish thriller, if you can get past its many credulity-stretching twists and its frequent excursions into the just plain silly. Peaky Blinders’ Charlene McKenna is Shelly Mohan, a busy mother of three whom we first meet as she is frantically scrubbing something red and sticky out of her clothing. As the whole series is bathed in that grey-blue nordic noir light, we can safely assume that she hasn’t just dropped spaghetti bolognese down her front.</p><p>It then steps back in time by a few hours to tell us how Shelly got to the Lady Macbeth stage of her day. She is having trouble sleeping, the family is “a little over-extended financially”, and her husband Jason (Barry Ward), who happens to be a Garda, is a womaniser who is never at home. The three kids have difficulties of their own: the youngest, Niall, has cystic fibrosis; middle child Caitlin is going through puberty; and her eldest, Derek, is a weed-smoking bad boy who lies and tries to steal money out of his mother’s handbag.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/29/clean-sweep-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Orgy of drives, cuts and clips, pulls, ramps and sweeps on day three added up to hosts’ best batting of this Ashes series</p><p>The season’s turned full circle. Eight weeks ago, Australia were here for their press day before the World Test Championship final against India. We asked Mitchell Starc what he had made of England’s aggressive play over the last year, and whether he believed they would really be able to bat like that against Australia’s attack. Starc was too smart to fall into that trap, and said, instead: “I guess we’ll find out over the next six weeks”.</p><p>His grin said everything about what he was really thinking. Fat chance. A 90mph inswinging yorker does wonders for a man’s confidence, not to mention 300 Test wickets, and a 4-0 victory in the last series.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/29/ben-stokes-rapid-fire-england-carnival-of-batting-ashes-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

## From gods to monsters: how did we come to fear the shark?

<p>Sharks have preyed on humans – and vice versa – for millennia. Can we rebalance our relationship with the last of the great living predators before it’s too late?</p><p>The most haunting of our imagined monsters remain hidden as they stalk us, striking when we least suspect it, while we are relaxing, or at play. The now-extinct megalodon roams the ocean unseen and unseeable, except in our imaginations. And it often surfaces in our consciousness when we are at rest or play by the seaside. The reason that the great shark holds such a chilling grip on us must be sought in the very long history of the interaction of sharks with people. Is there anything more spine-chilling than the thought of being eaten alive?</p><p>There is a contentious theory that our species went through an aquatic phase during its evolution, according to which the long periods our ancestors spent in the sea foraging for marine life account for our hairlessness, our thick layer of subcutaneous fat, and our abilities to swim and hold our breath. If the theory is true, then perhaps this primeval foray into the water has something to do with our deep fear of submerged predators.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/30/from-gods-to-monsters-how-did-we-come-to-fear-the-shark">Continue reading...</a>

## The moment I knew: agreeing to marry him was the best 4am decision I’ve ever made

<p>As an observant Muslim, <strong>Zeynab Gamieldien</strong> understood marriage was always the endgame. But when she met Ovi, she was surprised at how quickly it all fell into place</p><p>It was on our second phone call that Ovi asked what I thought about us getting married. It was in the early hours of the morning and we had been talking for so long that it was now almost time for Fajr, the first prayer of the day. I sat up in bed. We had been properly getting to know each other for about a month at this point. Without missing a beat, I said that getting married sounded like a wonderful idea.</p><p>Ovi was one of those people I’d “seen around”. We mixed in similar circles, except there wasn’t a great deal of mixing going on – we were attending the same Islamic classes and events in Sydney. I snuck the occasional glance at him across the room and we spoke once or twice at the refreshments table. Through these minuscule interactions I formed an initial impression of a kind and interesting person, if a little nerdy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/30/the-moment-i-knew-zeynab-gamieldien-ovi-marriage">Continue reading...</a>

The housing secretary is peddling the illusion that development can be kept away from the places where rural and suburban voters live<p>It’s clear that housing will be a major issue at the next election, as it should be. Large sections of the population continue to be excluded from adequate and secure housing by the high costs of owning and renting. Rising interest rates are squeezing mortgage holders, especially those least able to pay the increased costs of borrowing. The rate of new <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/05/housebuilding-falls-fastest-rate-lockdown/" title="">housebuilding is falling</a>.</p><p>Last week the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, announced “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/long-term-plan-for-housing-secretary-of-states-speech" title="">a long-term plan</a>” to “build a better Britain”, one with “many more homes” and “in the right places”. Some of his ideas sound good, but on examination his proposals look less like a serious effort to address the huge and complex issues of housing and planning than an attempt to curry favour with voters worried about new development in their back yards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/observer-view-why-michael-gove-housing-plan-little-to-help-build-better-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The American writer on her debut novel about weight and womanhood set in 90s Harlem, how her mother’s Black feminist books changed her life and writing a work of hip-hop magic realism</p><p>Mecca Jamilah Sullivan is a writer and professor born and raised in Harlem, New York. <a href="http://www.meccajamilahsullivan.com/">She</a> now resides in Washington DC, where she teaches African American poetry and poetics, Black queer and feminist literatures, and creative writing at Georgetown University. In 2015, she published the short story collection <em>Blue Talk </em><em>&amp; Love,</em> which won the Judith Markowitz award for emerging new LGBTQ writers. Her first nonfiction book, <em>The Poetics of Difference</em>, was published in 2021 and explores the writing of Black queer women. Her debut novel,<em> Big Girl,</em> follows the tender, fervent and food-loving Malaya, who comes of age in 1990s Harlem at the height of fad diets, hip-hop and gentrification, and has been shortlisted for the Center for Fiction First Novel prize, the Gotham Book prize and the Lambda award.</p><p><strong>Where did the idea for a story cent</strong><strong>red </strong><strong>on weight and body image begin?<br /></strong>The first draft was my master’s thesis. But the truth is that the core and heart of the story began many years before that, when I was this big Black girl growing up in Harlem, having these experiences and understanding that my body seemed to mean a lot of different things to the people around me. Like all kids, I was coming to recognise that my body was my own to a certain degree and yet it clearly had this effect on others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/29/mecca-jamilah-sullivan-the-culture-of-disordered-eating-and-dieting-is-still-thriving-big-girl-novel">Continue reading...</a>

## Premier League and Fifa helpless against Saudi juggernaut’s relentless progress | Jonathan Wilson

<p>Saudi Pro League’s moves for ageing stars echo other leagues – but there is no reason why stars at their peak should not follow</p><p>Football is far from perfect but it is a thing we love. It has existed in its present form for more than a century and a half. It has its rituals and its routines. It has taken on a cultural significance way beyond what is reasonable. It is a way for parents to commune with children, for exiles to maintain their links to home, a source of pride and identity for areas otherwise left behind. It lubricates the cogs of social interaction. It is everywhere: on televisions, on radios, on phones, in background conversations in offices and pubs and schools.</p><p>And it is under threat – at least in the form in which we recognise it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/29/premier-league-fifa-helpless-against-saudi-pro-league-juggernaut">Continue reading...</a>

## The cost of living crisis can only be beaten by tackling the climate crisis | Ed Miliband

<p>Investing in green jobs and energy is the best long-term way to tackle soaring bills</p><p></p><ul><li>Ed Miliband is the climate change and net zero shadow minister</li></ul><p>This summer has been defined by two crises: the continuing, painful cost of living crisis afflicting millions in our country and the climate crisis, which is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/26/northern-hemisphere-heatwaves-mediterranean-fires-croatia-portugal">playing out in horrifying ways</a> across the world. The Conservative party is saying we can’t tackle both these crises together – and is, in fact, tackling neither. The Conservatives are wrong. Tackling both these crises goes hand in hand. That’s what Labour’s green prosperity plan will do – cutting energy bills, creating good jobs, delivering energy security and providing climate leadership for our country.</p><p>To listen to the Conservatives, you might think the status quo is serving us well. It isn’t. Putin’s strangulation of international fossil fuel markets has sent energy bills soaring, plunged countries like ours into the deepest cost of living crisis in memory and stoked inflation to further pile the pain on to families and businesses. The UK has been the worst affected country in western Europe. We have been so exposed because 13 years of failed Conservative energy policy has left us so dependent on fossil fuel markets.</p><p>Ed Miliband is shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/the-cost-of-living-crisis-can-only-be-beaten-by-tackling-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Drama of National Hubs final day is thrilling, and the community spirit of these groups will have a lasting impact</p><p>It was a perfect captain’s innings, and the Lord’s crowd knew it. There was a standing ovation for Megan Russell as she walked up the pavilion steps and through the Long Room on Saturday, 50 not out. Having anchored her Bolton U-16 side through the tricky opening overs, Russell had accelerated with precision and flair, and when her stylish offside drives brought only ones and twos, she pulled out the hook and the slog sweep.</p><p>But then this wasn’t Russell’s first rodeo. She made her Lord’s debut last year, when she captained this side in their first National Hubs final against the same opposition. In 2022, Guildford lost to Bolton in a tense final over; now Guildford were out for revenge, and Russell was determined to deny them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/29/cricket-national-hubs-finals-day-lords-bolton-guildford">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunday 30 July is the 125th anniversary of artist Henry Moore’s birth. To celebrate, the Henry Moore Archive is unveiling <a href="https://catalogue.henry-moore.org/collections/44285/posters">a digitised collection of more than 400 posters</a> featuring Moore’s many shows through the years. It was a pretty cumbersome job, says archivist Emma Stower: ‘Some of the posters were over 2 metres in length and stored in heavy folders… It’s a unique resource showcasing Moore’s exhibitions and his international reach. It’s also a fascinating look at the evolution of graphic design over the decades.’ Stower likes the fact that the posters show Moore’s drawings, not just the sculptures for which he was renowned. ‘He was an excellent draughtsman with an eye for colour.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jul/29/poster-boy-henry-moore-exhibition-art-through-the-ages-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

Designer Martin Grasser listened to birdsong as he created the cheery, rotund symbol, now unnervingly replaced by an X<p>There was something almost poignant in the Twitter thread last week from one of the original designers of the site’s blue bird logo, soon to be extinct. Martin Grasser recalled how, in 2012, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey had commissioned him, in terms familiar to creatives everywhere: “There was essentially no brief,” Grasser suggested, “other than ‘we want a new bird, and it should be as good as the Apple and Nike logo’. Twitter had made some sort of flying goose – but Jack wanted something simpler.”</p><p>Grasser went away and started sketching different real birds, watching them in flight, listening to birdsong as he worked. His eventual design, after thousands of iterations, was based on a hovering hummingbird with a truncated beak and puffed-up chest. Grasser’s thread showed how he had superimposed <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/twitters-new-logo-the-geometry-and-evolution-of-our-favorite-bird/" title="">15 overlapping circles</a> on the logo to give the bird its optimum “friendly” rotundity (the exact opposite of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-twitters-rebranding-x-marks-an-everything-or-nothing-gamble" title="">unnerving new black X branding</a>, which puts a cross next to just about every feeling of alienation). Grasser’s valedictory thread was a brief masterclass in how graphic design can tap into human emotion. His bird, meanwhile, will inevitably become exhibit A in the various museums of lost logos that can be found in dustier corners of the internet, alongside the blue globe of Pan Am and the torn ticket stub of Blockbuster Video.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/alas-the-twitter-blue-bird-is-no-more-it-is-an-ex-logo">Continue reading...</a>

An abandoned cobbler’s shop in Ragusa has been rebuilt with geometric tiling throughout, and a spectacular roof terrace<p>You’ve heard the adage, go bold or go home, but what happens when the two aren’t mutually exclusive? Take the Sicilian home of Ilenia Pappalardo and Nicola Spata in the popular city of Ragusa. A former abandoned cobbler’s shop that the couple bought in 2018 before gutting and completely restoring, it is an ode to vibrant modernism that doesn’t so much put the humble tile into the spotlight, but makes it the all-singing, all-dancing star of the show.</p><p>It was a “dream come true” to realise, agree Pappalardo, 37, and Spata, 41, a dental hygienist and an accountant. They enlisted local architects Studio Gum, run by husband-and-wife team Valentina Giampiccolo and Giuseppe Minaldi, to mastermind the restoration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/29/life-on-the-tiles-in-a-dream-sicilian-home">Continue reading...</a>

A 14p-a-litre drop in the price he was getting for his milk, within a few months, despite facing continued high bills for electricity, animal feed and fertiliser. “I can’t understand why anyone would want to carry it on,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/29/uk-dairy-farmers-costs-milk-price-energy-feed-bills">Continue reading...</a>

## Will rebranding Twitter give Elon Musk the X factor? I wouldn’t bank on it | John Naughton

<p>Twitter’s owner has given his toy a new name, but any ambition he has to turn it into a WeChat-like financial service is fanciful</p><p>So Elon Musk, the world’s richest manchild, has changed the name of his favourite toy. Henceforth, Twitter is to be known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/24/elon-musk-reveals-the-new-twitter-logo-x">X</a>. Strangely, though, you can still log on to twitter.com and be invited to tweet. This is a missed comic opportunity. Instead of the chancellor being able to say, for example, that he had tweeted his concern about the public sector borrowing requirement to the prime minister, he could be saying that he had “X’d Rishi” on the matter. Sigh.</p><p>So what is it about Musk and X? Well, it goes back quite a way – to 1999, when Musk set up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com">X.com</a> as an early online bank. For “early”, read “weird”. Customers were not charged fees or overdraft penalties. New users got $20 for free just by opening an account and a $10 bonus for every one of their contacts who signed up. As for the venerable banking convention that you should know your customer, Musk demurred. According to Max Chafkin, the <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-contrarian-9781526619570">biographer</a> of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Musk bragged to CBS News that it was easier to get a line of credit at X.com than it was to sign up for an email account. “You can fill out the whole thing, be done in two minutes, be in your account and have it funded already.” Not surprisingly, within two months, X.com had more than 200,000 users, some of whom who had given fake addresses and immediately set to writing cheques that bounced.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/will-rebranding-twitter-give-elon-musk-the-x-factor-i-wouldnt-bank-on-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Village Hut)<br />The Vodou priest, singer and activist draws on ancient wisdom and a wide range of musicians on his long-awaited second album</p><p>Haiti’s Vodou<em> </em>religion has found many musical champions – notably the groups Boukman Eksperyans and Lakou Mizik – but on <em>Pèlerinaj</em>, <a href="https://www.songlines.co.uk/features/erol-josue-interview-i-wanted-to-participate-in-the-reconstruction-of-haiti-s-national-heritage-i-needed-to-be-there">Erol Josué</a> offers full immersion into Vodou’s mysteries. Following in the footsteps of his Port-au-Prince parents, Josué was initiated as a Vodou priest at the age of 17, subsequently spending several years in Paris and New York before returning to his homeland after the island’s devastating 2010 earthquake, and becoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDnIOdiBGZM">director of the National Bureau of Ethnology</a>.</p><p><em><a href="https://eroljosue.bandcamp.com/album/peleri-naj">Pèlerinaj</a></em> (Pilgrimage) comes 16 years after his debut, <em>Régléman</em>, and is a more diverse affair, recorded in New York, Paris, Miami and Haiti and drawing on an eclectic array of musicians, including Scots guitarist Mark Mulholland and the Gotan Project’s Philippe Cohen Solal, as well as intricate percussion and Haitian choirs. At its centre is the tenor voice of Josué, stately and striking, bringing a mix of chants, invocations to the <em>lwa</em><em> </em>(spirits) and homages to Haiti itself. The island’s history is a troubled one, from the horrors of the Duvalier regime to the current ravages of murderous gangs, and Josué asks how a nation that liberated itself from slavery now finds its people “beggars”. A moving call for peace, reconstruction and spiritual rebirth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/29/erol-josue-pelerinaj-review-a-moving-call-for-peace-in-haiti">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zach Galifianakis, Elizabeth Banks and Sarah Snook are wasted in this unquestioning drama about the 90s Beanie Baby craze</p><p>In 1993, the flamboyant businessman H Ty Warner (a role thoroughly chewed by Zach Galifianakis) launched a range of beanbag animals. After an indifferent start, Beanie Babies caught on, and by the late 90s, the US was caught in the grip of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51311368">tulip fever</a>-style mass hysteria that saw understuffed plush toys traded for thousands of dollars apiece. It was the first inkling of the pernicious role that the internet would later play in shaping our tastes, appetites and, ultimately, thoughts.</p><p>With that in mind, it’s a pity that this plodding, dutiful, behind-the-scenes account of the Beanie phenomenon isn’t darker in tone. A touch of corporate chicanery and institutional sexism aside, it’s resolutely fluffy in approach. Geraldine Viswanathan and Elizabeth Banks play the real brains behind the cuddly collectible craze; <em>Succession</em>’s Sarah Snook is underused as Warner’s love interest. But the main problem is that, like <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/09/air-review-ben-affleck-slippery-tale-of-how-nike-signed-michael-jordan-matt-damon">Air</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/02/tetris-review-a-puzzle-of-an-80s-political-thriller-taron-egerton-nintendo">Tetris</a></em>, the film feels like a vapid cheerleader for late-stage capitalism.

## Rebellious, hilarious and oblivious to the power of her presence… my friend Sinéad O’Connor

<p>The Observer writer first met the young Dublin singer before fame struck. Then they started hanging out together off-duty. He recalls her as a fierce outsider and a beguiling free spirit</p><p>On a bright wintry afternoon towards the tail end of 1989, I met <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sinead-o-connor" title="">Sinéad O’Connor</a> in a flat on All Saints Road in west London. I was there to interview the 23-year-old singer for the<em> Face</em> magazine about the making of her imminent second album, <em>I Do Not Want What I Have</em><em>n’t Got</em>. Its title, Sinéad was keen to point out, reflected a newfound calmness and serenity following what had been a turbulent few years following the release of her debut album, <em>The Lion and the Cobra</em>, in 1987.</p><p>She was, she said, no longer “this desperately unhappy and fucked-up person” who had been “bolshy and aggressive to everyone”. Instead, the new songs were “prayerful – not literally, but insofar as they give off a religious feeling – spiritual happiness”. By the time my feature was published as a cover story in February 1990, her second single from that album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/sinead-o-connor-10-best-songs-nothing-compares-2-u" title="">Nothing Compares 2 U,</a> had become a worldwide hit, transforming her life and utterly disrupting that short-lived serenity. The fame it brought in its wake was, for Sinéad, akin to an emotional tidal wave: unmooring and almost capsizing. She fought against it as if fighting for her life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/focus/2023/jul/29/my-friend-sinead-oconnor-tribute">Continue reading...</a>

My mother hated him with a vengeance until the day she died. Years later, I found out he used to come and watch me when I was drinking in Salford. I didn’t know he was there. I only found out he’d died when I had a breakdown after I’d split up with Mrs Merton [first wife Caroline Aherne]. I went to live with Mum, and she said, “Oh, Peter, I’ve got something to tell you. Your dad died three weeks ago…” I thought, “And you’re only telling me now?”</p><p><strong>I’ve had a lot of grief</strong> in my life.

Accompanied by her own accomplished finger-picking, the numinous style of Byrne’s sketches faintly recalled Cat Power. Byrne’s sure grasp of the cloudy poetry of interpersonal relationships, meanwhile, suggested a familiarity with the Leonard Cohen songbook.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, Byrne, now 33, is touring a blockbuster of an album made of love, friendship and grief – <em>The Greater Wings</em>, released earlier this month to <a href="http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/13698/Julie-Byrne-The-Greater-Wings.aspx">constellations of reviewer stars.</a> These are songs full of elegiac ache for her former bandmate and ex-partner, Eric Littmann, who died suddenly in 2021, some way through writing and recording the album.

<p><strong>Opera Holland Park, London; Glyndebourne, East Sussex; Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>Jonathan Dove transforms Simon Mayo’s ripping yarn into an exhilarating instant classic; it’s Thebes by way of Port Talbot in Adele Thomas’s Glyndebourne debut; and all hail the Hallé </p><p>It’s amazing what a bit of holiday reading can achieve. Unwinding in the sun, James Clutton, the enterprising artistic director of Opera Holland Park (OHP), reached for one of Simon Mayo’s adventure yarns and was immediately struck by its operatic potential. Last week, that poolside inspiration burst into sparkling, vivid life with the world premiere of <strong><a href="https://operahollandpark.com/productions/itch/">Itch</a></strong>, an exciting, moving, relevant new opera – and an undoubted hit.</p><p>Composer Jonathan Dove and librettist Alasdair Middleton have devised a compelling piece of music theatre, telling a fast-paced story with power, grace and wit that will surely go into the repertory. Clear direction from Stephen Barlow and stylish design by Frankie Bradshaw add hugely to the whole experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/29/the-week-in-classical-itch-jonathan-dove-opera-holland-park-semele-glyndebourne-adele-thomas-prom-16-halle-mark-elder">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Over crumble and custard on our short break in Yorkshire, Dad wondered if it was worth him getting into Instagram</p><p>I’ve got a bit of a thing for my elders. As a kid I wouldn’t leave my great-aunt alone. In my early 30s, I went on six coach holidays with a load of strangers twice my age for my book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gran-tour-9781785786488?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" title="">The Gran Tour</a>. So it won’t come as a surprise to learn that I recently dragged my old man to Scarborough for a mini-break. When I say dragged, I’m only half-joking. He didn’t fancy the coach ride, for a start. For the first hour of the journey north from Portsmouth, Dad behaved like a hostage, but by the time we’d reached Reading he was leaning across the aisle to help a couple with the crossword.</p><p>It surprised me that he knew the answer to 4 down was “saturnalia”. And the fact that it surprised me showed how relatively little I knew of the man. I knew his outline well enough – born 1952, shipwright in the dockyard, 12 years sober and counting, ever so kind – but not the full picture, not the finer brush strokes. I hoped that Scarborough might fill in some gaps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/29/i-took-my-dad-to-scarborough-and-saw-a-side-of-him-that-i-didnt-expect">Continue reading...</a>

Because of this, the document gets forwarded to someone else who may find it interesting. Who then sends it to another person. And another. Eventually, this unpublished work causes a cascade of small-town mayhem, ending up as a tabloid story with a headline that reads “Media exec’s novel about murder, sex and lies in the moneyed town of Saltaire has sent residents into a spin.”</p><p>Sounds like the plot of a good beach read, right?

<p>When staff in Coventry downed tools, they kickstarted a David v Goliath battle against one of the most powerful companies on Earth. This is what happened next</p><p>It takes a lot to frighten Zee. The 35-year-old father of two rarely gets flustered: not when he first set out on the 4,000-mile journey from his family home in Pakistan to the UK more than a decade ago; not during the years he spent struggling for survival on the fringes of Britain’s formal economy; not when the Home Office threatened to deport him, plunging his young family into uncertainty. But the cold, foggy, final hours of 24 January this year – they felt different. “My heart was pounding,” Zee remembers. “My mind was scared.”</p><p>That was the night Zee and his colleagues at Amazon’s BHX4 warehouse in Coventry decided to make history, abandoning their workstations and launching an unprecedented stoppage to demand higher wages. They had walked out before, in a spontaneous, ad hoc protest. But this was different: a carefully planned and legal effort, the likes of which Amazon UK had never faced. Standing in their way at the exit gates was a line of senior managers who had the power to make or break each worker’s future, staring down anyone who might dare to pass. “As midnight struck, I kept catching other people’s eyes: do we go, or do we stay?” Zee recalls. “We didn’t know what would happen if we crossed that threshold. But we did know that somebody, somewhere had to be the first to try.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/29/to-them-we-are-like-robots-inside-story-of-a-strike-at-amazon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rich and flavourful, and superbly adaptable, the Russian salad has become a Spanish favourite – just use the best mayo you can find, or make it yourself</p><p>Despite its name, and its origins in Moscow circa 1860, Russian salad is now better known as a classic Spanish dish. In its early incarnations, it would have been a very refined affair, featuring ingredients such as caviar, crayfish or grouse, but it has changed dramatically over the years to use simpler and easier-to-find ingredients. A good mayo is the key, and making your own will take it to a new level (though mayo from a jar will also work). Although I’m giving you the classic recipe, it’s adaptable to whatever you have to hand, and a great way to use up leftover potatoes, celeriac, roast chicken, ham or prawns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/29/russian-salad-recipe-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>

He’s not wrong. 2023 marks 50 years since his album Head Hunters, a landmark moment for jazz as another of its acoustic vanguard signalled a shift in sound. More remarkable is Hancock’s journey in that decade: completed in just four years, Hancock’s transition from Mwandishi to Thrust – via Crossings, Sextant and Head Hunters – is surely one of jazz history’s strongest runs of albums.</p><p>Hancock opens with what he calls “hors d’oeuvres” from the 70s and beyond: glutinous textures and effects-laden improvisation from the Mwandishi days, the later funk-infused fusion, the hip-hop hit Rockit and a low-slung take on Wayne Shorter’s Footprints, all twisted towards today.</p><p><a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2023/event/herbie-hancock">At the Barbican Centre</a> on 29 July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/29/herbie-hancock-review-still-seeking-the-new-after-50-years-of-jazz-curiosity">Continue reading...</a>

The figures, from a broad survey of book buyers, showed that sales of translated fiction increased 22% last year, compared to 2021 – and that it is most popular among readers under 35, who account for almost 50% of translated fiction sales. This is much higher than the 31% share of overall fiction sales bought by these readers – and the figures have grown year on year. For translated fiction, the future looks bright. So much so that in some cases books by certain publishers have become a “cultural accessory”. So how did it become cool, and which are the names to watch out for?</p><p>Undoubtedly the International Booker prize itself has boosted the profile of fiction from around the world published in English.

So no more platitudes, no more delays</p><ul><li>Diana Johnson MP is chair of the home affairs select committee</li></ul><p>Rishi Sunak is used to being heckled on Wednesdays.

<p>The women’s competition, which starts on Tuesday, is in rude health while the men’s Hundred is harder to shout about</p><p>Two needed off five, with a record crowd watching on at Lord’s.

<p>Nida Manzoor’s fizzing comedy joins cinema’s long procession of disrupted nuptials, from The Philadelphia Story to Muppets Most Wanted</p><p>I blame the movies for the tense, wilful shiver I feel at every wedding ceremony I’ve ever attended – when the priest or officiator opens the floor for objections, and a few seconds of awkward, semi-amused silence ensues. What a chaotic thrill it must be to speak up in that moment! I never would, of course, and have never seen anyone else do so. But in cinema, nuptials are made to be sabotaged as often as not, and by forces more malicious than the tepid British summer. The “stop the wedding!” film is virtually its own subgenre. Nida Manzoor’s fizzy, raucous comedy <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/polite-society">Polite Society</a></strong> is a pleasingly unusual addition to its ranks.</p><p>The wedding targeted in Manzoor’s film isn’t a victim of romantic discord or envy. Instead, it’s the bride’s sister who simply believes it’s a bad idea all round. Martial arts-obsessed London teenager Ria (a delightful Priya Kansara) looks up to her older sister, art student Lena (Ritu Arya), seeing them both as rebels against cultural and familial convention. When Lena drops out of art school and gets engaged to a seemingly nice, respectable boy, Ria feels positively betrayed. Only one thing for it: to stop the wedding, in increasingly kick-arse fashion. It’s an anarchic but endearing quest, and outlandish wish-fulfilment for any viewer who has wanted to advise a loved one against marrying a total rotter, but didn’t dare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/29/streaming-the-best-stop-the-wedding-films-polite-society">Continue reading...</a>

## The Unfamiliar by Kirsty Logan review – motherhood, queered

<p>Logan’s account of having a baby with her partner is searingly honest and doesn’t shy away from the visceral</p><p>Is queerness the latest publishing trend when it comes to books about motherhood? Have we exhausted all other iterations – yummy, slummy, tiger, helicopter, gentle, conscious, good enough and so on – such that queer people now offer the new take on pregnancy, childbirth and beyond? If this is the case, I’m fully behind it, because unlike those other #mumlife tropes, queerness represents a far more radical undoing of motherhood as we know it and is, of course, not a fad or a technique one can “try out”, but a deeply felt identity and lived experience. There is much that straight people can learn from having this LGBTQ+ lens put on conception, pregnancy and parenting.</p><p>Kirsty Logan’s searingly honest account of becoming a mum with her wife joins a growing number of queer motherhood memoirs. These include Claire Lynch’s Small, Maggie Nelson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/23/the-argonauts-maggie-nelson-review-harry-dodge-transgender">The Argonauts</a> and Michelle Tea’s Knocking Myself Up. So I approached it wondering what else there was to say. What was new about two women having a baby? Why did Logan’s story need to be told? These are questions the writer herself grapples with throughout the book. By the end I was convinced not only that hers was an important story, but that her obvious struggle to tell it was really the point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/29/the-unfamiliar-by-kirsty-logan-review-motherhood-queered">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Parents and adult offspring reveal how going on holiday together gives them the time and space to forge fresh, often deeper, bonds</p><p>For many of us, there comes an age (typically around 16) when holidays with our parents become anathema: “Not a static caravan in Aberystwyth again Dad, I want to stay at home with my mates and drink Monster and play Fortnite!”<em> </em>(or, per your author, listen to the Doors and paint gloomy gothic tableaux)<em>. </em>As we mature into adulthood, Britons most commonly plan holidays with friends and partners and later with our own kids, who will in turn become embarrassed by trailing around beach resorts with their cringey sun visor-sporting parents.</p><p>But a novel travel trend is upending this accepted cycle of holidaymaker life. Bonding holidays (one-on-one intergenerational breaks involving a parent and adult offspring) have emerged since the pandemic, says Tom Barber, co-founder of Original Travel. The tour company recently launched itineraries to cater for these holidaymaker duos, including a five-night biking and food tour to Catalonia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/29/family-holidays-bonding-relationships">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Evil Rob Titchener is looking down at the gates of hell, much like Mozart’s antihero, and many at Bridge Farm can barely conceal their delight</p><p>In my fantasy opera version of The Archers, Gli Arcieri, the action opens as the wicked Don Roberto fights a duel with Il Commendatore, Tonio, whose daughter, the beautiful Donna Elena, he has abducted. She loves him, even when she discovers the corpses of his deceased wives concealed behind various locked doors inside his bleak abode, the Castello della Collina dei Fiori. Indeed, she grasps his real nature only after an indescribably complicated subplot involving Donna Kirsty, who disguises herself as a man and hides in a sack to discover Don Roberto’s true intentions. Act two culminates in a “mad scene” famous for its coloratura demands on the soprano, in which Donna Elena stabs Don Roberto – who, though badly wounded, escapes. In act three, several years on, Donna Elena rejects the now penitent Don Roberto, who has returned from exile abroad. He fights an indecisive duel with Don Leone and Don Tommaso, respectively Donna Elena’s new lover and brother. Stumbling away from this encounter, Don Roberto finds himself confronted by a statue of Il Commendatore, and is dragged down to hell.</p><p>Which is, more or less, what is actually happening, notably the hell part: Evil Rob Titchener’s recent spate of seizures is, it turns out, nothing to do with his having been pushed over by Lee, but rather because he has an inoperable brain tumour. The news that he has months to live has been greeted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by the Bridge Farm Archers. Tom, for one, can barely conceal his delight – though Tony regards fire and brimstone as too good for the man who raped his daughter. Helen, in the meantime, has an intriguing moral dilemma: should evil Rob be allowed to see their son, young Jack? Does Jack have the right to see his father before he dies – or should he be protected from him?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/29/charlotte-higgins-on-the-archers-is-this-the-final-act-for-ambridges-own-don-giovanni">Continue reading...</a>

## Wolf: like watching a very weird, deeply unsettling game of True Detective-themed Cluedo

<p>Slapstick and serial killers? What starts as a stodgy murder mystery soon turns into a twisted farce of dogs, sex, opera and gore. It’s going to be divisive</p><p>Two of the grisly murders that take place in Wolf (Tuesday, 9pm, BBC One) happen in an area called “the donkey pitch”. The murders are not inherently funny but every time a gnarled police officer or suited and booted detective speaks gravely of the donkey pitch murders, or what happened at the donkey pitch, I wondered if they might have been prudent to choose a less asinine location. To me, the word donkey is more goof than oof.</p><p>The donkey pitch turns out to be a harbinger of the sort of tonal dissonance to come from this unusual, theatrical series, which feels far more Channel 4 than it does BBC One, and I still can’t work out if that’s a compliment or an insult. It is based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/02/mo-hayder-obituary-clare-dunkel">Mo Hayder</a>’s Jack Caffery <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/18/crimebooks">novels</a>, about a detective who specialises in the most twisted of cases, so if you’re familiar with that work, its gruesomeness may not come as much of a shock. I was not familiar with it, so I’ll admit that all the viscera added an unexpected internal-organ-ey note.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/29/bbc-one-wolf-like-watching-cluedo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Turn beetroot leaves into a delicious pakora – just coat in chickpea flour batter, fry until golden and crunchy, and serve topped with assorted tasty titbits</p><p>Chaat is one of my favourite Indian street foods. Popular across the whole of south Asia, it normally consists of something fried, such as a poppadom, samosa or pakora, that is usually crushed up and loaded with a variety of flavourful spicy, sweet and salty chutneys and crunchy treats. It’s often finished off with a sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) topping (if you can’t find sev, Bombay mix works fine, too). One of my favourite chaats features spinach fried in chickpea flour batter; this beetroot leaf version makes a tasty, colourful and thrifty replacement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/29/use-up-beetroot-leaves-in-indian-street-snack-chaat-pakora-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
