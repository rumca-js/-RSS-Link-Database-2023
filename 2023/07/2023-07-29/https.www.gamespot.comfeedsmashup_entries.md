<p dir="ltr">Grinding Gear Games announced at this year's ExileCon keynote that Path of Exile 2, initially planned as a replacement for its predecessor, will now become a separate game running on its own client. The decision to split the games came after PoE2 underwent substantial expansion since its initial announcement four years ago, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/path-of-exile-2-standalone-game-announcement-2023">PC Gamer</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding Gear Games co-founder Jonathan Rogers highlighted the extensive additions to PoE2, including six new classes, 36 ascendancy classes, 600 monsters, 100 bosses, 240 active skills, and 1,500 passive skills. Notably, players have embraced the addition of a dodge roll with no cooldown.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Initially, there were concerns about replacing the beloved Path of Exile 1 with the sequel (something we recently saw with Overwatch replacing the first game). Rogers said, "We realized that our plan to replace PoE1 with PoE2 would essentially be getting rid of a game that people love for no real reason. So we made a decision: Path of Exile 1 and 2 will be separate, with their own mechanics, balance, endgames, and leagues."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171360-spider-venom%286%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With just a few months left before the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-villains-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514068/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> on PS5, one of the big mysteries leading into the game is the identity of Venom. One of Spider-Man's most recognizable enemies, Venom's host won't be Eddie Brock, but rather someone who fans aren't expecting.</p><p>Developer Insomniac Games is looking to put a new spin on the classic supervillain, one that further differentiates its Spider-Man from other comic book and big-screen incarnations.</p><p>"It's about power, it's about strength, it's about being slighted, it's about Peter being involved much more in the creation of Venom," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-developers-reveal-how-they-put-a-new-spin-on-venom/1100-6516101/">creative director Bryan Intihar said</a> in an interview regarding Insomniac's take on Venom. "For us, Venom is the host plus the symbiote."</p><p>"Our goal was to tell an original story, something that you haven't seen in the comics or movies yet," Intihar said at Summer Game Fest. "All those things that you love about the character are going to be there."</p><p>To bring Venom to life, Insomniac cast Tony Tood to voice the symbiote, the actor who is best known for his work in the Candyman horror film series. According to Intihar, Todd delivers a killer performance that helps turn Venom into a monster, but one that is also strangely relatable.</p><p>So if Eddie Brock isn't in the symbiote driver's suit, who's lurking underneath that biomatter and has an axe to grind against the Spider-Men? We'll only find out for certain when Spider-Man 2 releases on October 20, but until then, we've got a few theories about who some of the likely suspects could be, as well as some <em>really </em>wild guesses.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Harry Osborn</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171349-spider-venom%282%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The most likely candidate, or someone who is possibly <em>too </em>obvious a choice? Insomniac has mentioned that it wants to create a unique version of Venom, one that truly represents the idea of an anti-Spider-Man. If Harry is indeed the host for the symbiote, it's not as if Insomniac hasn't done plenty of foreshadowing leading up to this reveal. The end of the first Spider-Man game saw the organism attached to Osborn in his stasis tank as he battles with the same terminal illness that killed his mother, Oshtoran Syndrome.</p><p>Miles Morales: Spider-Man built on this reveal with its own end-credits scene, which saw Harry awaken and Dr. Curt Connors--not yet in his Lizard form--ordered to release the younger Osborn. The implication that Harry <em>could </em>become Venom is there, and what could be more emotionally devastating for Peter Parker than to see his best friend succumb to the toxic attraction of power that the Venom symbiote provides?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kraven</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171351-spider-venom%284%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">A classic Spider-Man nemesis, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-trailer-introduces-kraven-the-hunter-symbiote-spider-man/1100-6514451/">Kraven</a> is turning the concrete jungle of Manhattan into his own personal hunting ground in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. While he's a lethal tracker and equipped with an arsenal of deadly weapons, taking on two Spider-Men might be too much for even Kraven to handle, and attaching himself to the Venom symbiote would be a great way to even the odds. Thematically, this is also a great chance for Insomniac to adapt one of the greatest Spider-Man stories of all time, Kraven's Last Hunt, to its video game universe.</p><p>A dark tale centered around Kraven's final attempt to prove himself superior to Spider-Man, that story saw the webhead buried alive, his identity stolen by Kraven, and ended on a <em>grim </em>note as Kraven found the victory that had eluded him all his life. A fantastic character who has seldom shined outside of his comic book appearances, a Kravenom antagonist would be a fresh spin on the villain and an opportunity that Insomniac could use to create an unforgettable villain in its Spider-Man universe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Peter Parker</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171352-spider-venom%285%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Judging by the trailers and interviews, it looks like it won't be long before Parker falls victim to the corrupting influence of the symbiote. Insomniac has likened Peter's bond with the symbiote to that of a deadly and damaging addiction, and with the studio looking to craft a more mature tale, what could be a bigger twist than the original Spider-Man failing to rid himself of Venom?</p><p dir="ltr">The chances of this are likely close to zero, given how one of the key selling points of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is that you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-spider-man-2-lets-you-switch-between-peter-parker-and-miles-morales/1100-6514733/">dual-wield Spider-Men in New York</a>, plus Marvel might have put its foot down on such a radical idea. Still, it looks like the symbiote is going to be a dangerous influence on Parker, at least until it finds a more suitable host.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Miles Morales</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171353-spider-venom%283%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">What makes the symbiote such an insidious foe is that it preys upon hosts who are in an emotionally fragile state. Miles is at a point where the wounds of losing his father and childhood friend are still fresh and raw within his mind, creating a perfect opportunity for the symbiote to infect him. We've already seen that he still bears a major grudge against Martin Li, aka Mr. Negative, and seeing Miles' dark side unleashed would make for fascinating territory to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">It's another scenario that looks unlikely at this point, but the idea of either Spider-Man succumbing to the symbiote and becoming permanently bonded with it would still make for riveting storytelling with major ramifications for the future of the franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dock Ock</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171354-spider-venom%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>By the end of Marvel's Spider-Man, Doc Ock's grand plan was in ruins. Trapped in a dying body, stripped of all of his technology, and sentenced to life in Rikers Island, Otto Octavius has all the motivation he needs to submit to the symbiote and become its next host. In many ways, Insomniacâ€™s version of the supervillain represents the idea of power without responsibility, a dark mirror to Spider-Man, and one of the few individuals who knows that it's Peter Parker under the mask.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Norman Osborn</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171355-spider-venom%287%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man dealt with plenty of villains in his 2018 game, but if there was one big bad most prominently missing from his rogues gallery, it was the Green Goblin. Instead of goblin bombs and gliders, Norman Osborn popped up as a philanthropic businessman and New York mayor who seemingly had the best intentions at heart. Beneath that altruistic exterior, there was a much darker side to Osborn that came to light, and by the time the dust had settled, the Oscorp CEO had a major fall from grace in the public eye.</p><p dir="ltr">Could this version of Osborn be destined to become Venom? The death of his son, public disgrace, and one ill-timed zinger could be just enough to push him over the edge, and with a powerful symbiote bioweapon, he'd be in a prime position to exact his revenge on the Spider-Men as he seeks to settle old scores. It's an interesting scenario, but after having done some subtle foreshadowing in the first Spider-Man game, Insomniac might be saving the older Osborn for an eventual return as the Green Goblin, arguably Spider-Man's most dangerous and personal foe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Yuri Watanabe</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171359-yuri.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Spider-Man's biggest ally on the New York police force, NYPD captain Yuri Watanabe eventually crossed the line in Spider-Man's The City That Never Sleeps DLC. Dedicated to ridding New York of organized crime, Yuri adopting the Venom symbiote could be just the power-up that she needs to take on the supervillains and crime families terrorizing the city. Another dark horse guess, if Yuri does return, it'll likely be as Wraith, a vigilante who uses her access to supervillain technology confiscated by the NYPD to wage her war on crime.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>J. Jonah Jameson</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171357-jolly-jjj.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Spider-Man's <em>greatest </em>nemesis, J. Jonah Jameson wields the power of print and insinuation to terrorize the Spider-Men. As much as we'd love to see him merge with Venom to create a one-two punch of lethal power and constitutionally protected free speech, we're not banking on jolly ol' JJJ going that far in his war against the web-slingers.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aunt May</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171356-spider-venom.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Since when has death stopped anyone from making life hell for Spider-Man? Sure, Aunt May being revived and bonded with Venom so that she can terrorize Spider-Man sounds about as likely as Elon Musk going a single day without making terrible Twitter business decisions, but anything is possible in video games.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tom Hardy</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4171358-tom-hardy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Venom 3 viral marketing has officially gone too far.</p></h3></p><br />
