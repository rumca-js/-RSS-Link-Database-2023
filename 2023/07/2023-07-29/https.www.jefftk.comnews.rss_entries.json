[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Are Guitars Obsolete?", "description": "<p><span>\n\nI got an email from a reader:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nI was wondering, like you said that <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/jam-is-obsolete\">jams\nmake less sense</a> in the world of easy refrigeration, do you think\nguitars make less sense when amazing MIDI keyboards are available now?\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIt's a good question!  In general, if an instrument becomes more\ncapable then, yes, it's going to make more sense for people to play it\nrelative to its closest competitors.  The range of sounds and textures\nit's possible to play on a keyboard is a big advance over what was\npossible on a piano, and they're also far more portable, need less\nmaintenance, are more flexible with volume, and are cheaper.  And you\ncan face other people while you play!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, guitar as an instrument has also gotten better.\nWe've figured out how to make good-sounding acoustic guitars much more\ncheaply over time, low-end acoustics and electrics are much more\nplayable than they used to be, and the range of what you can do with\npedals has expanded.  For example, an octave pedal <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/bass-in-contra-dance\">adds a lot</a> to a dance band where\nthe lowest instrument is a guitar, enough that I'd guess 80% of the\ntop guitar-lowest contra dance bands use one.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother reason we see less substitution than you might expect is that\nthe guitar and piano have very different strengths, and the piano's\nincreased versatility doesn't affect that tradeoff very much.  The\npiano is <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/instrument-complexity-and-automation\">much more\nautomated</a>: you have much less direct control over the production\nof the sound.  On the guitar you touch the strings, and very small\ndifferences change the feeling of your music.  On the piano you give\nthat up, but in exchange you can play many more notes at once over a\nlarger range.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf we could see a chart of how new players, comparing guitar vs piano,\nmy guess is we'd see a long slow decline of piano stretching back to\n~1910, driven by recorded music substituting for playing at home.\nThen we'd see guitar rising starting in the 40s as electric\namplification became mainstream and made the guitar able to hold it's\nown in bands.  Because musicians are very conservative with <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/where-are-the-new-instruments\">instrument choice</a>, it\nwould take decades for the guitar to build up to where it 'should' be\nfor it's strengths.  Then, as good portable electronic keyboards became\nto be available in the late 80s I'd expect to see piano start to\nrecover from its slump, though not pass guitar?  If someone has data\non this I'd love to see it&#8212;quickly searching I didn't find\nsurveys, and sales records are tricky to interpret since pianos\ngenerally last longer than guitars.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is about what people actually do, though, and perhaps you're\nasking what I think they <i>should</i> be doing?  They key benefit of\nthe keyboard to me, relative to the guitar, is how well it works as a\nway to get note-level information into a computer.  This allows\nbuilding new custom automation, and combining the note and timing\ninformation of your fingers with expression information from\ncontinuous controllers (foot pedals, breath controllers).  This is\nminimally popular relative to standard piano (or guitar) playing, but\nI think is a very promising area to explore.\n\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/are-guitars-obsolete", "date_published": "2023-07-29T08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
