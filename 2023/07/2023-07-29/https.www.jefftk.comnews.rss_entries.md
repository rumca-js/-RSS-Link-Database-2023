I got an email from a reader:

I was wondering, like you said that <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/jam-is-obsolete">jams
make less sense</a> in the world of easy refrigeration, do you think
guitars make less sense when amazing MIDI keyboards are available now?

<p>

It's a good question!  In general, if an instrument becomes more
capable then, yes, it's going to make more sense for people to play it
relative to its closest competitors.  The range of sounds and textures
it's possible to play on a keyboard is a big advance over what was
possible on a piano, and they're also far more portable, need less
maintenance, are more flexible with volume, and are cheaper.  And you
can face other people while you play!

</p>

<p>

On the other hand, guitar as an instrument has also gotten better.
We've figured out how to make good-sounding acoustic guitars much more
cheaply over time, low-end acoustics and electrics are much more
playable than they used to be, and the range of what you can do with
pedals has expanded.  For example, an octave pedal <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/bass-in-contra-dance">adds a lot</a> to a dance band where
the lowest instrument is a guitar, enough that I'd guess 80% of the
top guitar-lowest contra dance bands use one.

</p>

<p>

Another reason we see less substitution than you might expect is that
the guitar and piano have very different strengths, and the piano's
increased versatility doesn't affect that tradeoff very much.  The
piano is <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/instrument-complexity-and-automation">much more
automated</a>: you have much less direct control over the production
of the sound.  On the guitar you touch the strings, and very small
differences change the feeling of your music.  On the piano you give
that up, but in exchange you can play many more notes at once over a
larger range.

</p>

<p>

If we could see a chart of how new players, comparing guitar vs piano,
my guess is we'd see a long slow decline of piano stretching back to
~1910, driven by recorded music substituting for playing at home.
Then we'd see guitar rising starting in the 40s as electric
amplification became mainstream and made the guitar able to hold it's
own in bands.  Because musicians are very conservative with <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/where-are-the-new-instruments">instrument choice</a>, it
would take decades for the guitar to build up to where it 'should' be
for it's strengths.  Then, as good portable electronic keyboards became
to be available in the late 80s I'd expect to see piano start to
recover from its slump, though not pass guitar?  If someone has data
on this I'd love to see it&#8212;quickly searching I didn't find
surveys, and sales records are tricky to interpret since pianos
generally last longer than guitars.

</p>

<p>

This is about what people actually do, though, and perhaps you're
asking what I think they <i>should</i> be doing?  They key benefit of
the keyboard to me, relative to the guitar, is how well it works as a
way to get note-level information into a computer.  This allows
building new custom automation, and combining the note and timing
information of your fingers with expression information from
continuous controllers (foot pedals, breath controllers).  This is
minimally popular relative to standard piano (or guitar) playing, but
I think is a very promising area to explore.
