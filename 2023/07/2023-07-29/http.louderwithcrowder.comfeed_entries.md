And I know what many of you are thinking. "Brodigan, June was always last month. We know people like to dress up like dogs." No, no, no. I'm not talking about someone <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/drag-kink-bestiality-biden-administration" target="_blank">who dresses up in fetish gear</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-pride-parade" target="_blank">parades around little children</a>. </p><p>I mean someone paid 20 grand for a lifelike dog costume, so he can live among other dogs.

<blockquote>Toco’s grand debut — which was captured while he was filming a segment for a German TV station — seemed to be well-received by passers-by and other dogs, who appeared curious. It wasn’t clear whether they realised Toco wasn’t a natural-born dog.</blockquote><p>This was Toco's first time in public engaging with other dogs. Where -- Toco -- walked on all fours, rolled around, and sniffed other dogs butts. It is unclear if the other dogs knew Toco was not a real dog or not as they were sniffing each other's buts. Real dogs don't speak people language like Japanese or English. Toco knows how to, but doesn't... since he wants to be a dog.</p><p>The captions in this video are said to have been translated from handwritten notes before Toco went full canine: "I got to fulfill my dream of being a dog and walking outside! Hello, my name is Toco. My dream of being an animal since a little child came true when I became a collie! I'm going to enjoy the doggie life right here in this house!</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>We at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website were hoping to find a pre-transition photo of Toco, but both the man and the dog like to keep their private lives private.<br /></p><blockquote>I don’t want my hobbies to be known, especially by the people I work with. They think it’s weird that I want to be a dog. For the same reason why I can’t show my real face. I rarely tell my friends because I am afraid they will think I am weird.</blockquote><p><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>But you know something? Shout out to Toco's parents. Or, I guess Poco's humans. They made Poco wait until he was an adult before he transformed himself into a dog. There are American parents who would have sent Poco to obedience school when he was five years old. And Democrats who would have taken Poco away from his parents if they didn't. You could get arrested for not using woof/ruff pronouns.</p><p>I find myself left with one question. Okay, a LOT of questions. Many I don't want answers to. But will Toco ever find true love? And if he does... ewwww, gross.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

When an administration has news they don't want people to pay attention to, they release it after 5:00 on a Friday. In yesterday's dump, the White House finally acknowledged that Joe Biden has a seventh granddaughter... which they released via a supermarket tabloid. You can imagine how retched their internal polling numbers were.</p><p>To further illustrate what Joe Biden and his White House think of the topic, here is a dramatic interpretation of "Take Out the Trash Day":</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It SHOULD have been a family issue, and it would have if Biden had welcomed his seventh granddaughter to his family like a decent human being. As opposed to ordering his administration not to acknowledge her existence. Biden turned it into a political issue when they decided <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-grandchildren" target="_blank">what a "great" paw paw Biden was would be a cornerstone of his election campaign</a>.</p><p>This week when MSNBC was dispatched to repeat the "Biden's only crime is loving his son Hunter" talking point, they threw in "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/msnbc-shields-joe-biden" target="_blank">The President always makes a point that he speaks to all of his grandchildren every day</a>." Even though it was complete bullsh*t.</p><p>And you can see Biden's true feelings by the way he lashes out at a reporter who asked about the topic. Of course, it was Doocy.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Joe Biden is as terrible a man and a human as he is a president.</p><p><br /></p><h3>What's the deal with Joe Biden denying he has a granddaughter?</h3><br /><p>​Prior to Friday's tasteless news dump, Joe Biden only acknowledged having six grandkids. <span>He actually has seven grandchildren. But the seventh is from his son Hunter Biden -- yes, </span><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-third-laptop" target="_self">THAT Hunter Biden</a><span> -- knocking up his former assistant. There was a court case where Hunter, the president of the United States' son, r</span><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-granddaughter" target="_self">efused child support and refused to let his daughter be acknowledged as a Biden</a><span>.</span></p><p>It has since been worked out in court where Hunter will pay child support, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-grandchildren" target="_self">but the girl is still forbidden from using Joe Biden's last name</a> even though she is Hunter Biden's kid.</p><p>Reports say the granddaughter, 6, loves playing with her cousins, is learning to ride a bike, and one day wants to learn to hunt like her mom. She also knows her father is Hunter Biden and her grandfather is the president of the United States and speaks about the two of them frequently.</p><p>She only gets to watch alone on TV while her dad and President PawPaw play with their other kids.</p>
