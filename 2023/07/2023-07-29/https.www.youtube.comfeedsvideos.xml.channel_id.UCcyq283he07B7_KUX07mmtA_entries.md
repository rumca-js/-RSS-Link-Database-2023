Hyperrealistic baby dolls can cost upwards of 15,000 euros. Babyclon, a doll producer, uses medical-grade silicone, alpaca hair, and nail resin, which contribute to the high price point. But it's the months of painstaking manual labor required to achieve a lifelike doll that account for most of that price. And with added features such as animatronics and artificial intelligence, the possibilities are endless.
