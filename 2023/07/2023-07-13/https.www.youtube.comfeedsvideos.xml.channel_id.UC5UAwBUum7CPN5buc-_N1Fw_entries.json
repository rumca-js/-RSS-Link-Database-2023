They put the focus on customization of your laptop to your exact specifications, they ship Linux out of the box, and they use coreboot.\n\nThey offer 3 years of warranty, and they guarantee spare parts availability for your device up to 7 years after your purchase. \n\nThey have 14 inches, 15 inches and 17 inches, the cheapest they have is 749\u20ac, and the most expensive goes up to 3900 euros but that's with all the options ticked\n\nOf course, you can change the specs, but you can also add you own logo, you can change the boot logo, you can engrave the palm rest, you can pick between Windows and Linux, or you can ask them to create a dual boot.\n\nYou can choose yo use your own keyboard layout, in ANSI or ISO, change the look of the super key, change keyboard illumination, ask to completely remove the mic and webcam...\n\nFramework goes further, since you can even replace the entire motherboard and keep the whole chassis, keyboard, panel, webcam and ports. They don't have as many models and sizes though, and until the 16 inch model releases, you're not getting any dedicated GPU options, and you're limited to 13 inches.\n\nNovacustom is more about customization, repairability, and allowing users access to their own hardware, where Framework is more about keeping the exact same device, and making it modular, and allowing complete upgrades.\n\nIn terms of price range, Framework will be a little bit more expensive than NovaCustom for the same configurations, but they do have better panels, and newer CPU options, plus Ryzen options that Novacustom don't currently offer.\n\nMy review unit is the NS51 series, their mid range laptop. In terms of build quality, it feels very rigid, the hinge is super solid. The whole thing is pretty heavy, 1.7 kilos, and it's quite sturdy.\n\nThe only real issue I can see is the position of the power button, next to a USB port\n\nAll the spare parts are accessible for up to 7 years after your purchase, and they give you a complete service manual.\n\nMy review unit came with a core i7 1260P. In terms of I/O, on the right, you get gigabit ethernet, the ill placed power button, one USB 2 port, a micro SD card reader, and on the right, you have your barrel charger, an HDMI port, a USB 3.0 port, and 1 thunderbolt 4 and 1 type C 3.1 Gen 2 port. You can charge the laptop using USB C.\n\nThis laptop came with coreboot, with Dasharo firmware.\n\nIn terms of performance, the CPU gets a more than honorable 2498 in single core, and 7450 in multi core. As per battery life, this chip is relatively power efficient, it lasts for about 7 hours at mid brightness, wifi on, watching youtube videos in a loop.\n\nNow let's look at the various things this laptop comes with. The display is 15.6 inches, 1080p, 16:9, 300 nits of brightness. It covers 98% of SRGB.\n\nAs per input, the keyboard feels pretty good to type on. They keys have good travel, they bounce back well, it doesn't feel mushy for a membrane keyboard, and it sounds pretty good. It's a good keyboard.\n\nThe touchpad is decent, it doesn't feel like glass, but it's smooth enough, large enough, and it feels precise. It did wobble a little bit and you can feel that when just using tap to click.\n\nNow, the webcam is the usual potato quality fare, it's 720p.\n\nThe microphone is the same, it will be suitable for short video conferences, but it makes you sound distant.\n\nAnd finally, the speakers, they're your average fare.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQJ_GTLrXs", "date_published": "2023-07-13T16:02:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TUQJ_GTLrXs/hqdefault.jpg"}]
