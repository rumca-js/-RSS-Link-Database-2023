<p>Three famous faces get their fertility checked, and go on a journey to combat the troubling fall in sperm counts. Although they draw the line at kneading their own scrotums …</p><p>In the last 50 years, sperm counts have dropped from an average of 100 million of the little terrors swimming merrily about in every millilitre of ejaculate to an average of just 48 million in today’s ersatz man-brew. Many of those, according to results we are about to receive courtesy of the three volunteers in Celebrity Save Our Sperm, are not swimming too merrily either. At the moment, one in every six couples has trouble conceiving and if sperm counts continue on their current trajectory we will be looking at infertility as the norm within a very few decades.</p><p>Can matters be – uh – taken into one’s own hand and improved on an individual basis, asks this surprisingly sober, but not sombre, celebrity-fronted documentary? And, because deadlines make better telly, can it be done in 10 weeks?</p><p>Celebrity Save Our Sperm is on Channel 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/13/celebrity-save-our-sperm-review-the-horrified-faces-during-the-testicle-massage-scene-are-priceless">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whoever wins the next election will have to spend money to repair the damage done after 13 years of Conservative party rule</p><p>It is unlikely that champagne corks will be popping in government offices, school classrooms and NHS hospitals. But they probably are in the City. While the public sector is offered a below inflation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/13/rishi-sunak-agrees-to-public-sector-pay-rises-of-6-plus-without-raising-budgets" title="">pay hike of 6%</a>, wage growth in finance and business services is <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/july2023" title="">running</a> at 9%. The private sector can raise its prices to pay for higher salaries or just to make more money. The public sector cannot. Instead Rishi Sunak argues that the state’s wage bill must be paid for by cuts to the services that workers deliver. Mr Sunak’s decision means that pupils will have fewer books and patients are left <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/13/doctors-strike-nhs-rishi-sunak-pay-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-64b00f978f080a06e305edb7#block-64b00f978f080a06e305edb7" title="">sicker</a> because teachers and doctors need extra pay. Rising interest rates mean austerity for public services and pain for mortgage-holders, but they make for good business in the Square Mile as UK gilt yields become more <a href="https://archive.ph/OANQl" title="">attractive</a> to investors.</p><p>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,” begins Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, a cautionary story about widening divisions in the run up to the French Revolution. Britain is, thankfully, in a far less feverish moment.

<p>Individuals have been damaged in the handling of the BBC presenter row. But so has British journalism</p><p>By summer’s end, the BBC presenter manhunt will seem an even stranger news storm than it already does. In the wider world, the past few days have in reality been dominated by terrifying global climate crisis incidents, a crunch wartime summit on Ukraine, an international row about cluster munitions, and a host of bad domestic British economic news. Yet throughout that period, most British newspapers, and almost every BBC news bulletin, have been focused on following the Sun’s 8 July <a href="https://enewspaper.thesun.co.uk/app/THESUN" title="">front page story</a> alleging payments by a star BBC presenter to a teen for sexual photos.</p><p>In an echo of the furore over the ITV presenter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/phillip-schofield" title="">Phillip Schofield</a> in May, the BBC story has all but obliterated the normal news values of many outlets. On Wednesday, the pursuit culminated with the naming, by his wife, of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2023/jul/12/bbc-presenter-huw-edwards-the-sun-latest-news" title="">Huw Edwards</a>, the BBC’s senior news presenter. As a result, a lot of air has already quickly gone out of what is suddenly a much less prominent news story.

<p>The latest installment in Tom Cruise’s action series is a reminder of how for over 25 years, the films have been uncommonly good</p><p>Has Ethan Hunt finally met his match? The most indefatigable agent of American intelligence, played as always by Tom Cruise, has a formidable new foe in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh installment in the movie series based on the TV series. It’s not a who but a what: a computer virus with a mind of its own, crunching numbers so efficiently that it can anticipate the good guy’s every move. The deck seems stacked against Ethan. But then, doesn’t it always? Beating unbeatable odds is his whole thing. It’s an average Tuesday for him, and the ultimate appeal of this series, whose very title is a challenge Ethan always rises (and climbs, and runs, and sweats, and nearly plummets to his death) to meet.</p><p>The truly improbable victory in Dead Reckoning belongs not to Hunt, whose skin-of-his-teeth survival is all but guaranteed by the “part one” in the title, but to the Mission: Impossible franchise itself. More than 25 years after Cruise refashioned a small-screen spy story into a big-screen action vehicle for himself, how are these movies still so good? Dead Reckoning may not be the best Mission: Impossible, but that’s only because the bar has been set as high as the various skyscrapers and aircraft cabins from which Hunt inevitably hangs. It’s the best Hollywood franchise we have. And like its sixtysomething star, it’s showing surprisingly few signs of wear and tear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/13/mission-impossible-tom-cruise">Continue reading...</a>

Imagine if a standup could do the same? That’s the promise held out by Richard Eagleton, founder and CEO of Standup Solutions and developer of KENN, the world’s first AI comedian, in this spoof corporate presentation by Conner O’Malley. This US act has cultivated a covetable reputation for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDIJ45Bba6nzrGL5v8b7fMw">his online work</a>, and there’s much to enjoy in this parody of Silicon Valley values and tech utopianism. But it’s not subtle, and its characterisation of O’Malley’s digital guru alter ego is not a surprising one.</p><p>The joke to begin with, and the first seed sewn that Eagleton may be something less than a slick success, is that the revolutionary AI development we’re promised is endlessly withheld. First we get to hear about Eagleton’s childhood in Des Plaines, Illinois. Then all about his beloved car, extensive tech spec very much included.

## Stomping ground: bursts of brilliance at London’s flamenco festival

<p>Two shows at Sadler’s Wells reveal the range of influences and restless experimentation that are key to the ever-progressing art form</p><p>Since the annual flamenco festival was first staged at Sadler’s Wells in 2003 the idea of what flamenco is has been stretched, ruptured and remoulded multiple times. One of its hits last year was Manuel Liñán’s ¡Viva! which saw Liñán and company kitted out in full female costumes, giving expression to their queer identities. (Liñán was nominated for both a National Dance award and an Olivier.)</p><p>Liñán is back this year, in <a href="https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/gala-flamenca/">an all-male gala show</a>, and in a more low-key offering, Amor Amado Amén, which muses on love. It’s the result of a week’s residency at Sadler’s Wells, just five days in the studio with three collaborators: flamenco guitarist Francisco Vinuesa, multi-instrumentalist and psycho-sensory therapist Sabio Janiak and Croatian healer and spiritual coach Ivan Bavcevic. Not all conventional people to share the stage with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/13/stomping-ground-bursts-of-brilliance-at-londons-flamenco-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Here we had one of the Sunaks announcing the very opposite on pay of what had been said previously</p><p>It was a brisk and businesslike Rishi Sunak who raced into the Downing Street media room at lunchtime. The desperation of someone keen to project an air of getting things done. Sooner or later. Usually later. At least, we had to assume it was the prime minister. Though it could have been a doppelganger. It’s a while since Sunak had appeared in person before a UK audience. Still, best to take these things on trust.</p><p>Good news, said Rish!. Of course it was. He wouldn’t have shown his face if he didn’t think he had a positive story to tell. Then it would have been just slipped out in a written ministerial statement. The government had agreed to accept the recommendations of the independent pay review boards and give public sector workers a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/13/rishi-sunak-agrees-to-public-sector-pay-rises-of-6-plus-without-raising-budgets">rise of between 6 and 7%</a>.

<p>From Kylie Minogue to Jorja Smith, Guardian writers have picked the song they will be playing on repeat for the summer</p><p>This summer’s Barbie movie/marketing campaign has been at once fun and sinister. It’s hot pink, tongue-in-cheek frivolity; it’s the tip of a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/after-barbie-mattel-is-raiding-its-entire-toybox">wave of revisionist IP</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxZwCpgxttQ">Speed Drive</a>, the pop chameleon Charli XCX’s contribution to the soundtrack, follows suit. A hyperpop banger “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/charli-xcx-speed-drive-barbie-soundtrack-single-1234781175/">about just being hot</a>” with its foot on the gas for all of one minute, 58 seconds, it feels potentially designed for TikTok virality – short, endlessly loopable, the soundtrack to a hot girl summer. It’s also addictive, playful fun, the sonic equivalent of barreling down the highway with your friends, late-night adrenaline, temporarily impenetrable confidence, uppers. No thoughts, just frenetic vibes on loop, thanks in part to a version of Toni Basil’s Mickey reprocessed for screen-addled brains. Once you’ve rewired to the song’s relentless 174bpm, it’s difficult to come back down. (Do not try to parallel park to this song.) Am I getting steamrolled by the commerce machine? Maybe, but Speed Drive is a high I’ll keep chasing all summer long. <em>Adrian Horton</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/13/songs-of-summer-2023">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He made just four films and was crudely stereotyped, but brought Hong Kong-flavoured action to Hollywood and changed the face of Asian cinema for ever</p><p>It is not certain that Bruce Lee would have seen a kung fu duel involving sex toys as a fitting tribute to his legacy, but the Oscar triumph of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-nothing-nowhere-over-a-long-period-of-time">Everything, Everywhere All At Once</a> earlier this year is a reminder, 50 years after his death, of what a trail he has blazed. Lee smashed down the door for Asian representation pretty much single- (and bare-) handedly, even if he died too soon to be a beneficiary of it.</p><p>Lee is one of those rare stars who is bigger than his movies. Despite leaving a slim body of work – just four complete films – he practically spawned a whole genre, and wrote the book for Hollywood action to this day. Lee runs through the DNA of global culture: video games, hip-hop and mixed martial arts, not to mention the general rise of the super-fit, zero-body-fat masculine physical ideal. The fact that he died young, in perplexingly banal circumstances (a reaction to a painkiller) only burnishes his myth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/13/zero-body-fat-anti-imperialism-and-tom-cruise-bruce-lees-legacy-50-years-after-his-death">Continue reading...</a>

First, David McGoldrick decided to head back to his boyhood club Notts County after leaving Derby and now Aaron Ramsey is set to rejoin Cardiff City, the club he left as a teenager for Arsenal. Theirs is a well-trodden path with mixed results for brave boys coming home. If Ramsey wants to review the history of such transactions, we have had an admittedly minor delve through the archive to see how others have done by going home. From Robbie Fowler to Billy Sharp, completing the journey, however circuitous, can be a appealing notion … but the realities can be different.</p><p>Liverpool charging £75 for a replica shirt (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/12/kit-launches-manchester-city-liverpool-brentford">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>)? Ha, amateurs. Tottenham are charging a princely £125 for an ‘elite home shirt’ and £80 for a ‘stadium home shirt’. I’m sure there’s some subtle difference, but I can’t see it on a quick glance at the club shop. Differences from the previous design? Well. it’s all white, has the badge, Nike logo and ‘AIA’ in red, all very similar to last year, but it has blue cuffs, which I think is a change. The global price of polyester must be astronomical” – Adrian Riley.</p><p>Re: Brentford adapting their kit to have red and white stripes with a stronger presence of black (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/12/kit-launches-manchester-city-liverpool-brentford">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>) could be a nod to De Stijl, a Dutch art movement based around the power colours of black and white plus primary colours such as red. De Stijl was the idea behind the White Stripes, who featured black, white and red on their artwork. There may also be a clever reference to the material of Brentford’s shirts, as De Stijl is also known as Neoplasticism. Anyone know of any other tenuous art references in footie kits?” – Bernard Clark.</p><p>On the subject of kit launches, the new Kilmarnock away strip is <a href="https://kilmarnockfc.co.uk/news/the-chemistry-of-our-away-kit/">inspired by penicillin</a>” – John Brady.</p><p>If Football Daily wants to jump in on the fad that clubs are doing with their traditional-yet-modern kits, it could just republish missives/drivel from its formative days.

<p>The Queen guitarist answers your questions, on regretting never playing with John Lennon, his love of Pink and Avril Lavigne, and his beef with Michael Eavis</p><p><strong>Which guitarists influenced you the most as a young player? </strong><em>Waydgroods<br /></em>The Shadows Hank Marvin was an inspiration for all of us kids. He had an amazing, melodic, fluid sound. At the more rock’n’roll end, there is James Burton, one of the originators of rock guitar playing, who played for Elvis and Ricky Nelson. I was lucky enough to play with him recently. He’s a real inspiration. It’s not just the sound – it’s the fact that he can bend strings, and make the guitar speak.</p><p><strong>If Queen didn’t exist, which band (from any era) would you most want to have been in? </strong><em>Mr_202<br /></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles">The Beatles</a>, probably. I’m sure it wouldn’t have been easy to be a Beatle, but that incredible level of creativity, I would relate to. I watched a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/18/beatles-get-back-rooftop-concert-review-towering-time-capsule">Get Back</a>. I got a bit sad watching the first one, because it reminded me of us – sometimes Queen in the studio would be [inhales nervously], “Here we are, and things aren’t quite fitting”. I felt they were in quite a painful place – but the second one, I felt like they were really finding each other again. It’s a textbook of how to be in a studio. If it wasn’t the Beatles, it could’ve been Led Zeppelin. If they let me in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/13/brian-may-buckingham-palace-queen-reader-interview-micheal-eavis">Continue reading...</a>

## Hindemith: Cardillac review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week

<p><strong>Banse/Eiche/Kerl/Rootering/Munich Radio O/Soltész<br />(BR Klassik, two CDs) <br /></strong>This 2013 Munich rendition of the 1926 work, conducted by the late Stefan Soltész, might be held together by slender narrative threads, but it is still an important historical curiosity</p><p><a href="http://www.hindemith.info/en/paul-hindemith/">Paul Hindemith’s</a> operas, nine of them altogether, have not been well served by posterity. In the 60 years since his death, none of them has come close to establishing itself in the canon, and stagings of even the best known of them, Mathis der Maler, are still notable events. Cardillac, the earliest of the full-length stage works and first performed in 1926, has fared worse than most. Though it was hugely popular immediately after the Dresden premiere, with no less than 13 further productions across Germany in the first year alone, it disappeared from the repertory with the rise of the Nazis, and never regained its former status after the end of the second world war. Hindemith produced a revision in 1952, though nowadays it’s generally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/26/classicalmusicandopera1">the original version of the score that’s performed,</a> as on this recording, which is taken from a concert performance in Munich in 2013 and has been released now as a tribute to the conductor Stefan Soltész, who died a year ago this month.</p><p>Cardillac is based on a novella by ETA Hoffmann; it’s a murder mystery of sorts, though in the libretto the story is radically changed and the central character omitted altogether, to become a portrait of the 17th-century Parisian goldsmith Cardillac who is so obsessed with the beauty of the objects he produces that he kills to get them back. When the opera was conceived, Hindemith’s music was at its most rigorously neoclassical, and it was planned as a fiercely objective series of self-contained scenes, bound together by the slenderest of narrative threads, and driven along by an uncompromisingly dry, motoric score, with all 18 scenes, in three acts, over in a rather breathless 90 minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/13/hindemith-cardillac-review-fine-performance-of-a-hard-opera-to-love">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The AI satire in the most recent season has been used as an example of why the Screen Actors Guild must strike to protect their careers</p><p>With the most recent season of Black Mirror, you sensed that Charlie Brooker was keen to move away from his reputation as a prophet. Time and time again since his series hit the air, it has managed to correctly predict the future in all sorts of horrible ways.

After all, unless a hapless demon destroys Earth – or unless Britney Spears literally turns into a werewolf – then Brooker is probably in much safer territory.</p><p>Reader, it has happened already.

<p><strong>Royal Court theatre, London<br /></strong>Three generations of women in a Merseyside house banter, bicker and disappear into their smartphones in this nuanced play from Michael Wynne</p><p>Cuckoo is a delicately arranged play that basks in inaction. We watch the gentle flow of life from inside the front room of a multi-generational Merseyside family of women as they chat, laugh and row. Even when sulky teenager Megyn (Emma Harrison) goes upstairs and inexplicably locks herself in the bedroom of grandmother Doreen (Sue Jenkins), only then talking through her smartphone, nothing really happens.</p><p>Produced in partnership with Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, the play is driven by springy dialogue. Michael Wynne, who launched his career at the Royal Court with The Knocky in 1994, typically writes in a comic register and Cuckoo’s humour – sometimes ebullient, other times mordant – fires the drama. There are times, though, when the play, directed by Vicky Featherstone, wavers and is in danger of coming to a standstill.</p><p>At the <a href="https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/cuckoo/">Royal Court theatre, London</a>, until 19 August.

<p>Alan from England tells of difficult fighting from the trenches, while Steve from the US hasn’t registered with his embassy</p><p>Standing on a steep grassy hill, a figure in uniform took aim with a rifle. Several shots pinged into a pile of tyres. Nearby, police officers took turns firing from a DShK, or “Dushka”, heavy machine gun, mounted on a green-painted military vehicle. The rounds echoed around a rustic shooting range, scattering swallows. Down a track was a farmstead with cows.</p><p>The sniper was not a Ukrainian soldier but a 58-year-old British former marine called Alan. From Plymouth, in south-west England, Alan is one of a small group of foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine, more than 16 months after Russia’s full-scale invasion. Alan, who declined to give his second name, arrived last September.

## Are Jonah Hill's texts really 'therapy speak'? I asked a therapist | Daisy Jones

<p>Words such as ‘boundaries’ have become common parlance both online and in person – but at what cost to our relationships?</p><p>What sort of words do you think of when I mention the phrase “therapy speak”? Gaslighting? Trauma-dumping? Triggered? Even words like toxic, perhaps. Or, and this is a personal favourite: self-care. In recent years, these terms have started cropping up everywhere: on TikTok, Instagram and sometimes even in our personal lives, especially within romantic scenarios, where we have to balance another person’s “needs” against our own.</p><p>These shiny, businesslike phrases have become catch-all ways to describe the way others treat us, and how we ought to treat ourselves, ostensibly from the mouths of therapists. Words like “boundaries” have dominated headlines this month after alleged messages between the actor Jonah Hill and his ex-partner Sarah Brady were <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2023/07/jonah-hill-accused-of-emotional-abuse-by-ex-girlfriend">published online</a>, in which he says she should not post pictures of herself in a bathing suit, go surfing with men, or have friendships that he doesn’t approve of, among other things, if they are to continue to have a relationship (demands that, to me, seem far-removed from anything a therapist might endorse as reasonable “boundaries”).</p><p>Daisy Jones is a writer and author of All the Things She Said</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/13/jonah-hill-texts-therapy-speak-therapist-boundaries">Continue reading...</a>

## Here comes the next phase of Brexit – and it will be bad for our diet, health and wealth | Jay Rayner

<p>Should we care whether we will have less access to artisan sheep’s milk cheese? When it makes the quality of life worse, then yes</p><p>They keep telling us to move on; to accept that Brexit is done. The problem is, Brexit isn’t done with us. It isn’t a single disabling event. It’s a degenerative disease, and here comes the next stage. On 31 October, after four postponements to get infrastructure in place, the UK will finally introduce checks on fresh and chilled food imports. The EU has already introduced its checks, which come with a vast amount of paperwork and significant costs. The impact on the export of fruit from the UK to the EU has been dramatic, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/uk-fruit-exports-to-eu-have-dropped-by-more-than-half-since-brexit" title="">reducing the value from £248.5m in 2021 to £113.8m by 2023</a>, a drop of more than 50%.</p><p>Now it’s going to work the other way. EU producers of meat products wishing to export to the UK will have to employ a vet to certify their goods, <a href="https://ukandeu.ac.uk/what-do-the-new-border-control-plans-mean-for-uk-food-supply/" title="">which will cost up to €700 a time</a>. All sectors will have to employ agents for data entry compliance which could add another €200. They will have to train themselves on the paperwork. Then, come January, there’s the border inspection charge of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/26/post-brexit-import-checks-risk-further-pushing-up-food-prices-industry-group" title="">up to £43 for each consignment</a> regardless of whether it’s physically inspected or not. Faced by all of this, thousands of small producers from across Europe who have kept this country supplied with a fabulously diverse range of quality products will simply decide it’s not worth the trouble. They’ll sell elsewhere. The quality of our lives will be diminished.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/13/next-phase-brexit-bad-for-diet-health-wealth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This unflinching memoir explores consent, coercion and the lasting impact of a teacher-pupil affair</p><p>In this unflinching memoir, Joe Gibson recounts the affair he had as a schoolboy with his 35-year-old teacher, whom he calls Miss P. The year is 1991 and 17-year-old Gibson, who has chosen to protect his identity by using a pseudonym, has been awarded a bursary to an elite private school to study for his A-levels. Since the school is 150 miles away, his parents arrange for him to stay with friends who allow him use of their spare room, but otherwise leave him to his own devices.</p><p>Gibson initially settles in well, falling in with a clique of boys whose conversations are largely confined to rating the attractiveness of the girls in their year and pondering whether they will go to Oxford or Cambridge. But then he learns that his parents are divorcing, leaving him feeling unmoored. When he bumps into Miss P in a pub near the school, he dissolves into tears and tells her about the problems at home. “I want to hug her, to bury my head in her neck, to be wrapped in her voluminous hair,” he says, ominously.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/13/seventeen-by-joe-gibson-review-an-abuse-of-trust">Continue reading...</a>

The past six weeks have seen the leadership distance itself from key policies. It has already <a href="https://theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/13/labour-rules-out-universal-childcare-for-young-children-in-fiscal-credibility-drive">ruled out universal childcare</a> for young children<strong> </strong>and <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/labour-government-would-have-to-delay-28bn-green-fund-rachel-reeves-says">scaled back plans</a> to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry.

Labour insiders have suggested the party is actively looking to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/labour-government-would-have-to-delay-28bn-green-fund-rachel-reeves-says">make sacrifices</a>” in areas it had previously flagged as important in order to show its “fiscal responsibility”.

<p>This raw, powerful novel is based on the Norwegian woman whose case has been notorious for more than a century</p><p>In the early 1880s, Brynhild Størset, an impoverished young maid-of-all-work, left Norway for America in search of a new life. After a brief spell living with her older sister Nellie in Chicago, she married a Norwegian man, Mads Sørensen, and killed him. Then she married Peder Gunness, another Norwegian, and killed him too. After Peder, she advertised in the lonely hearts pages for other men and killed them as well – possibly as many as 30 – butchering their bodies and burying the dismembered remains in her yard.</p><p>Such are the grisly facts of the life of the woman variously billed as “America’s first female serial killer”, Lady Bluebeard, Hell’s Princess and the black widow of La Porte. Her notoriety has earned her a place in the Guinness World Records and fascinated true crime fans for more than a century. She has inspired ballads and pamphlets and nonfiction books, a couple of films and documentaries, and at least one lengthy novel. Now the Norwegian writer Victoria Kielland has written My Men, a short, sharp shock of a book, and a distinctly fresh take on the story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/13/my-men-by-victoria-kielland-review-inside-the-mind-of-a-female-serial-killer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Prompted to make music after getting some unsparing advice from Charli XCX, Irish musician Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson’s witty country-pop exorcises her youthful rage and heartbreak to rally outcasts like her</p><p></p><p>On a Wednesday night in a basement karaoke bar in east London, Irish singer Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, who performs as CMAT, is kneeling on a small stage performing a dramatic rendition of Shakespears Sister’s gothic ballad Stay. Lying in front of her is a friend pretending to be dead (as in the original music video), while the pianist from her band, Colm, provides backing vocals. It’s a display of brilliant theatricality, exaggerated, camp and chaotic. In other words, it’s pure CMAT.</p><p>Skills like these don’t arrive overnight: Thompson has been a karaoke master since she was 14 and wowed a French holiday camp with a rendition of I Heard It Through the Grapevine. Later, after working shifts in Debenhams, she would head to Tom Kennedy’s in Dublin to belt out Tammy Wynette’s Stand By Your Man. “I always knew I was a pop star but nobody else believed me,” she says when we meet in a pub in Brighton a few weeks later. “I think everyone thought I was fucking insane.

<p>We are in the midst of a Kencore summer – but Barbie’s dream guy is still being overshadowed and overlooked. I set out to change all that, with just a pair of rollerblades and some unbridled Ken-ergy</p><p>Everybody wants to be a Barbie. But who wants to be a Ken? Barbie’s on/off boyfriend has happily remained in the background since 1961, with Barbie hogging the spotlight and glory. He is there to support Barbie, listen to her laugh and cry. But he has clearly drifted into the dreaded “friend zone” and, with a lack of plastic packed down his pants, there is no chance of upgrading their relationship to that of friends with benefits. Imagine the frustration!</p><p>Even the Ken from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRyt3Ov4zz0">forthcoming Barbie </a>film, played by Ryan Gosling, seems dutifully aware of his role in life: making Margot Robbie’s Barbie look good, with no rewards, physical or otherwise. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/barbie-movie-posters-reveal-more-barbies-kens-and-humans">movie’s</a> tagline: “She’s everything. He’s just Ken,” has spawned memes on everyone from Princess Diana and Prince Charles to Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker. The insinuation is: for every alpha Barbie, there is a beta Ken behind them, and even Ken knows it. As he says in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zdyZPrTmnI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zdyZPrTmnI">trailer</a>: “I just don’t know who I am without you.” “You’re Ken,” Barbie replies. “But it’s Barbie and Ken.

## Quantum Leap review – this reboot is cheesier than a brie fondue

<p>From extremely silly dialogue to improbable plot twists, this remake of the 90s time-travel classic has a pointless feel to it. But it’s still a highly entertaining exercise in nostalgia</p><p>The great reboot train chugs on to the next station, picking up the most unlikely passengers on the way. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/gladiators-ready-90s-tv-hit-set-for-a-reboot">Now that Gladiators</a> and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/04/ant-and-dec-announce-reboot-of-byker-grove">Byker Grove</a> are coming, the only show from the 90s that had not yet been remade was, seemingly, Quantum Leap. But here it is, with a new cast and a new-ish premise, although the concept remains the same: time travel is possible; and one man can “leap” into the bodies of other people, tasked with righting a grave wrong before he can jump into the body of someone else.</p><p>The original series, which ran from 1989 to 1993, ended with the first leaper, Dr Sam Beckett (played by Scott Bakula; to my shame, I have only just realised his name must be a nod to Samuel Beckett) going missing in time and space. Now, the original Quantum Leap programme has been abandoned. Yet the brilliant Dr Ben Song (Top Gun: Maverick’s Raymond Lee) has been working away in secret to revive it. Our new intrepid physicist-explorer is, apparently, more of a “punching out code in a T-shirt guy” than an action hero, but this Quantum Leap teases the action side out of him from the off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/13/quantum-leap-review-this-reboot-is-cheesier-than-a-brie-fondue">Continue reading...</a>

For Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter’s difficulties presented an opportunity.</p><p>As <strong>Dan Milmo </strong>tells <strong>Hannah Moore, </strong>Threads has already surpassed 100 million users and is well on course to overtake Twitter. But so far, while Threads is collecting its users’ data, it is not carrying any advertising. So will it be a social media network in it for the long term?
