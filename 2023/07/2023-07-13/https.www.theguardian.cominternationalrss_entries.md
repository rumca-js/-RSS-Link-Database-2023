## Full Circle review – Steven Soderbergh’s hit-and-miss noir series

<p>The film-maker brings a visually distinctive yet narratively muddled thriller to life with help from an on-form Claire Danes and an off-key Zazie Beetz</p><p>The work of film-maker Steven Soderbergh – purveyor of blockbuster heists (Ocean’s Eleven), neon-lit tales of hustling for the American Dream (the Magic Mike series), and daring slice-of-life dramas (The Girlfriend Experience, big and small screen versions) – tends to follow the money. Whether its a small-scale drug operation or a major casino robbery, his multi-player ensembles offer not just a sense of the numbers, but the who and why of a scheme, a sense of purpose along with the pleasures of how.</p><p>Full Circle, the director’s new star-studded, mixed-bag Max limited series (RIP HBO Max), is a bit of an overdose. Sprawling yet often sedate, it disjointedly packs too many of these schemes into an overly complicated, sputtering noir mystery set in present-day New York. Written by Ed Solomon, Soderbergh’s partner for the 2017 choose-your-adventure series Mosaic and the comparatively sleeker and more scintillating film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/02/no-sudden-move-review-steven-soderbergh-hbo-max">No Sudden Move</a>, Full Circle attempts to braid a thicket of secrets, plans, deceptions and exploitations into a grand picture of cascading connections. The result is less artful collage of counterbalanced motivations and complicities than a rubber-band ball of plot and money, money and plot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/13/full-circle-tv-series-review-steven-soderbergh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The line was supposed to offer expert guidance after Mayor Eric Adams expanded police powers to forcibly hospitalize people</p><p>A young man hangs out on a street corner in Midtown Manhattan every day outside the entrance of a big chain restaurant. He shadowboxes and talks to himself, and beneath him are poster boards with scrawled conspiracy theories. The restaurant’s manager worries the man could be scaring off customers and calls 911. Should the responding police officer remove the man to a hospital, forcing him if he refuses?</p><p>This is a scenario from the training materials for a new 24/7 hotline touted by Mayor Eric Adams and run by New York City’s public hospital system, which offers police officers on-demand guidance on whether to involuntarily hospitalize someone who appears mentally ill. Adams, a former transit cop, announced the hotline last November as part of a controversial directive to expand the police’s authority to perform the removals, pledging that the hotline would be staffed by psychiatrists, social workers, and clinicians who “will provide guidance to police officers who encounter individuals in psychiatric crisis”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/13/new-york-police-nypd-mental-illness-hotline">Continue reading...</a>
