  <p id="E7ZdCl">The biggest Reddit community that’s still private as part of the Reddit protest is now encouraging its users to congregate elsewhere: Discord and Substack.</p>
<p id="vGLj2F">If you currently try to visit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice">r/malefashionadvice</a>, which has more than 5 million subscribers, you’ll be greeted with a page that suggests you visit the community’s <a href="https://discord.gg/BhdZUd2BVk">Discord</a> and <a href="https://malefashionadvice.substack.com/">Substack</a> instead. r/malefashionadvice was a great resource for fashion conversation and guides, and the Discord and Substack offer alternative homes for those resources. Specifically, the Discord lets members of the community chat amongst themselves and post about things like fits and inspiration, while the Substack hosts a <em>lot</em> of guides.</p>

  <p id="IxxoI1">Ripple’s XRP token was an investment contract when the company sold it to institutional investors, a judge ruled today. The case, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp">brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, is one of the biggest in determining whether tokens are securities. Though this is an intermediate ruling in a larger case, it’s still significant.</p>
<p id="21Dh19">In the ruling, Judge Analisa Torres found that Ripple’s $728.9 million sales of XRP to institutional investors — hedge funds, etc. — were unregistered securities offerings. However, the programmatic sales and those by Ripple’s CEOs weren’t. The case will go to a jury trial to decide other claims.</p>

  <p id="1sLgQm"><em>The Last of Us Part I</em> arrived on PC this March as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23661352/last-of-us-part-i-pc-launch-bugs-issues">an embarrassing, broken PC port of a game</a>, even on high-end machines. When I tried it on my Steam Deck handheld, the game was utterly unplayable — despite co-creator <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1601694903724953600?lang=en">Neil Druckmann’s assurances</a> that the game would “grace” the Steam Deck. </p>
<p id="r0vb8L">But after 11 patches, I can finally confirm <em>The Last of Us</em> is completely playable on Valve’s portable PC.</p>

<p id="buvXDX">As of last night I’ve completed all 14 hours of the game on my Deck alone, and I haven’t seen a single crash or game-breaking glitch. I rarely saw the frame rate drop below a locked 30 frames per second on default settings, and I’ve comfortably pressed the power button at any time to suspend and...</p>

  <p id="zzRbLe">Google is adding some new features to its Bard AI chatbot, including the ability for Bard to speak its answers to you and for it to respond to prompts that also include images. The chatbot is also now available in much of the world, including the EU.</p>
<p id="0I0yZx">In a blog post, Google is positioning Bard’s spoken responses as a helpful way to “correct pronunciation of a word or listen to a poem or script.” You’ll be able to hear spoken responses by entering a prompt and selecting the sound icon. Spoken responses will be available in more than 40 languages and are live now, according to Google.</p>
<p id="cBKAT2">The feature that lets you add images to prompts is something that Google first showed off at its I/O conference in May. In one example, Google suggested you...</p>

  <p id="LWtQSz">Raising speed limits leads to more frequent car crashes, while lowering them leads to fewer crashes, a new analysis by AAA concludes. It’s the kind of conclusion that seems obvious on the surface but still needs to be highlighted given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/nyregion/new-york-70-mph-speed-limit.html">how many states</a> <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2018/08/07/nj-speed-limits-too-slow-lawmaker-wants-overhaul-system/896152002/">seem convinced</a> <a href="https://landline.media/bills-in-seven-states-call-for-speed-limit-changes/">that raising speed limits</a> can save drivers time, when all it really does is endanger the lives of pedestrians and cyclists. </p>
<p id="Aug8Hh">The report is the latest in a growing body of evidence that finds that changing speed limits can have a big impact on road safety in the US. AAA analyzed a dozen roadways of varying types in the US in which half raised their speed limits while the other half lowered the limit. The group then did a before-and-after assessment to see what kind of impact...</p>
