#SuperEasyBarelyAnInconvenience

Original Description: 

Indiana Jones is one of the most iconic movie characters of all time. Along with his role as Han Solo, playing Indy is one of the defining works of Harrison Ford’s long career. So, in an age of constant reboots and sequels, it was kind of inevitable that Hollywood wanted to bring Indiana Jones back to the big screen. And with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg both on board, this had the makings of something great! Unfortunately yeah no it didn’t work out that way.

The movie definitely raises some questions. Like why are we focusing on aliens? Why do the good guys and the bad guys have the same goal? How did they think the nuke fridge scene was a good idea? How does Shia Laboeuf befriend monkeys so quickly and swing through the jungle faster than speeding vehicles? Why did the FBI decide to stop investigating Doctor Jones despite absolutely nothing changing from their perspective? What’s going on with Cate Blanchett’s voice?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
