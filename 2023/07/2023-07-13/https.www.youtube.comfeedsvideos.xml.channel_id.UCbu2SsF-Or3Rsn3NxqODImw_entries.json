It's the GameSpot show where the people behind the games you love tell the untold stories of how they were made. This week we're joined by CD Projekt Red quest director Pawe\u0142 Sasko to break down perhaps the game's most controversial quest: Sinnerman. \n\nThe quest starts off fairly innocuously, but quickly turns into a question of faith and morals when V is asked to accompany a prisoner to a braindance studio. The prisoner, Joshua Stephenson, has found his faith at the end of his life, and wants his death to be meaningful. V, with some nudging from Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand, has to decide whether to take part in the braindance, or whether to simply walk away. Sasko breaks down how the team came up with and implemented this challenging quest: Balancing encouraging players to follow the storyline, but also giving them the option to back away if they don't want to engage with it. \n\nAudio Logs releases every Thursday on GameSpot. #gaming #cyberpunk2077 #gamespot #audiologs", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-lvFEJtJS4", "date_published": "2023-07-13T15:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/J-lvFEJtJS4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 Is A Massive And Hilarious RPG", "description": "Jake and Dan played roughly five hours of Baldur's Gate 3, and they both walked away impressed.
