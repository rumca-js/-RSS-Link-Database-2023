Cyberpunk 2077's quest director Paweł Sasko describes the process of making the controversial Sinnerman quest. 

Audio Logs is back for a brand new series! It's the GameSpot show where the people behind the games you love tell the untold stories of how they were made. This week we're joined by CD Projekt Red quest director Paweł Sasko to break down perhaps the game's most controversial quest: Sinnerman. 

The quest starts off fairly innocuously, but quickly turns into a question of faith and morals when V is asked to accompany a prisoner to a braindance studio. The prisoner, Joshua Stephenson, has found his faith at the end of his life, and wants his death to be meaningful. V, with some nudging from Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand, has to decide whether to take part in the braindance, or whether to simply walk away. Sasko breaks down how the team came up with and implemented this challenging quest: Balancing encouraging players to follow the storyline, but also giving them the option to back away if they don't want to engage with it. 

Audio Logs releases every Thursday on GameSpot. #gaming #cyberpunk2077 #gamespot #audiologs
