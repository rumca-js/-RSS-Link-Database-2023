<p dir="ltr">Hori, the third-party controller manufacturer behind the popular Split Pad Pro for Nintendo Switch, recently announced a new <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNB6CKS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Zelda-themed version of its Horipad wired controller</a> </span> that's set to release on October 5.</p><figure style="width: 1000px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4165406-gshoripadzeldagoldhero.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4165406-gshoripadzeldagoldhero.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">The controller is officially licensed by Nintendo and features a white and gold color scheme with a black monochrome decal of Link from Twilight Princess on the right handle.

Reportedly, Equity members are prohibited from joining the picket lines with SAG-AFTRA. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollywood-actors-begin-strike-today-oppenheimer-stars-leave-premiere-first-strike-since-1980/1100-6515940/">Hollywood actors officially went on strike today</a>, the group's first on since 1980.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/solidarity-statement-advice-regarding-sag-aftra-industrial-action-2023">Equity issued a statement</a> and advice about the Hollywood actors strike on its website, where it says the union represents 47,000 people. "Equity stands full square behind our sister union in their claim, and the action their board have agreed to take," the UK union statement says. "Equity too is experiencing bullish engagers attempting to undermine its collectively bargained agreements.

<p>Silent Hill: Ascension will explore tried-and-true themes with a community-led, episodic approach. A new behind-the-scenes look at Silent Hill: Ascension clarifies the game's take on serial, interactive storytelling and its exploration of the franchise's mythology and themes.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-ascension-will-let-you-decide-the-series-canonical-story/1100-6514630/">previously revealed</a>, viewers of Silent Hill: Ascension will watch episodes and make decisions simultaneously as part of live "story events." Decisions will be permanent, which means that, unlike other games of this kind, viewers will not be able to go back and see how a different decision would affect the story. Fans can view episodes after live "story events," for an as yet undetermined amount of time, and their decisions will count as part of the "voting process."</p><p>The episodic game will explore Silent Hill's key themes across locations around the globe, involving a diverse ensemble cast. Silent Hill 2 is the clear primary inspiration. In the video, developers discuss wanting to create a horrifying setting and loathsome creatures that reflect the complex traumas of the central cast. Like previous games, the characters will be thrown into mysterious, supernatural circumstances without clear reasoning. As the series progresses, the central mysteries will be begin to resolve and viewers will discover more about who the characters really are.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-ascension-explores-classic-themes-with-a-community-led-episodic-format/1100-6515964/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The writer and showrunner of HBO's The Last of Us TV series has said he expects fans to revolt over what happens in Season 2. Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-last-of-us-showrunner-craig-mazin-preparing-furor-season-2/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Craig Mazin said of Season 2, "Will there be furor? Yeah, probably. I mean, there usually is, starting even with casting."</p><p>This is nothing new. Mazin said people had a lot of negative things to say about Bella Ramsey being cast as Ellie in The Last of Us, as an example. "We knew they were the exact right person to cast and they had to go through quite a few months of people being awful on social media until they saw what we saw," he said.</p><p>For Season 2 of The Last of Us, Mazin said there will be plot points that "shock people." And similar to Season 1, there will be storylines in the show that were not in the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-writer-expecting-furor-over-season-2/1100-6515962/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Christopher Nolan's next movie, Oppenheimer, releases in theaters later this month, but you don't have to wait a minute longer to see some new footage from the World War II drama.</p><p>Universal has released what it's calling an "opening look" at the movie. The video includes five minutes of footage from various parts of the film. As such, if you're planning to watch the movie and want to see it with fresh eyes, it might be best to avoid this particular video.</p><div>          </div><p>The trailer was edited by Oppenheimer editor Jennifer Lame, and it offers the best look yet at the film and its story and scope. It begins in the 1950s with a black-and-white scene where J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is interrogated by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) on behalf of the US government in the aftermath of World War II and the dropping of the atomic bomb he helped create.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-look-yet-at-oppenheimer-debuts-in-five-minute-trailer/1100-6515957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The puzzle game comes to us from developer Graceful Decay and publisher Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>"Maquette is a puzzle game, but not in the sense that Sudoku is a puzzle, more like a story that has puzzles throughout," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/07/01/the-recursive-world-simulation-puzzle-making-process-in-maquette/">said</a> Graceful Day creative director Hanford Lemoore on the PlayStation Blog.

<p>June was a big month on the gaming calendar, with three high-profile releases covering a diverse range of genres. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/13/playstation-store-june-2023s-top-downloads/">Sony has published</a> the top downloads in June for PS5 and PS4, revealing that Diablo IV has taken top spot on both consoles in the US and Canada. Final Fantasy 16 came in second place for the region in the PS5 charts, followed by Street Fighter 6 in third place.</p><p>In Europe, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> was also the most-downloaded game on PS5, followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy 16</a> and F1 2023. Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/street-fighter-6/">Street Fighter 6</a> was only the sixth most-downloaded PS5 game in Europe last month. On PS4 in Europe, first place went to Minecraft, FIFA 23 was in second place, and Diablo IV took third place.</p><p>Fans of Diablo IV have clearly been having a hell of a time, as while there aren't exact sales figures just yet for the game, Blizzard did report that the game <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230612864402/en/Diablo%C2%AE-IV-Crosses-666-Mi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dn-Five-Days-of-Launch-Setting-New-Blizzard-All-Time-Record">broke $666 million in global sales just five days</a> after it launched.

## The Rush To Make Disney Plus Content Hurt Marvel And Pixar's Quality, Disney CEO Admits

<p dir="ltr">In a candid admission, Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledged that Disney's push to fill its streaming service Disney+ with content had a negative impact on the output of the studio, particularly from Marvel Studios and Pixar. Speaking to CNBC's Squawk Box, Iger recognized that the studio's eagerness to increase content output had led to disappointing results both creatively and commercially.</p><p dir="ltr">"Marvel's a great example of that," Iger said (via <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/bob-iger-marvel-pixar-disappointments-disney-plus/">The Wrap</a>). "They had not been in the TV business at any significant level. Not only did they increase their movie output, but they ended up making a number of television series, and frankly, it diluted focus and attention. That is, I think, more of the cause than anything."</p><p dir="ltr">Pixar, too, faced challenges as the expectation grew among audiences that its films would eventually be available for streaming on Disney+. This, Iger said, contributed to the weak box office opening of Elemental last month. Although Elemental received positive reviews and has earned over $250 million worldwide, it had one of the lowest box office openings in Pixar's history. Additionally, Iger said, "I think you’d have to agree that there was some creative misses, as well."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rush-to-make-disney-plus-content-hurt-marvel-and-pixars-quality-disney-ceo-admits/1100-6515955/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney CEO Says Striking Writers And Actors Have Unrealistic Expectations

<p dir="ltr">With actors about to go on an official strike--and writers already months into their own--Disney CEO Bob Iger had some choice words for those unions during a CNBC Squawk Box segment. He basically said both unions are unrealistic about their expectations in contract negotiations with studios.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/bob-iger-writers-actors-strike-disney-ceo-1235669169/">Variety</a> reports Iger was in Idaho when he chatted with David Faber on CNBC. Speaking about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollywood-actors-expected-to-begin-strike-today-first-since-1980/1100-6515940/">possibility that Hollywood actors will strike for the first time since 1980</a>, Iger said: "It's very disturbing to me. We've talked about disruptive forces on this business and all the challenges we're facing, the recovery from COVID which is ongoing, it's not completely back. This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption.</p><p dir="ltr">"I understand any labor organization's desire to work on behalf of its members to get the most compensation and be compensated fairly based on the value that they deliver. We managed, as an industry, to negotiate a very good deal with the directors guild that reflects the value that the directors contribute to this great business. We wanted to do the same thing with the writers, and we'd like to do the same thing with the actors. There's a level of expectation that they have, that is just not realistic."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-ceo-says-striking-writers-and-actors-have-unrealistic-expectations/1100-6515951/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Genshin Impact Voice Actors Say They Haven't Been Paid In Months

<p>Despite the game's massive financial success, several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a> voice actors claim they aren't being paid. According to statements from various voice actors involved with the project, the game's developer, HoYoverse, is allegedly paying its voice actors poorly--and sometimes not paying them at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Two voice actors have come forward publicly to share their experience with the studio on Twitter. Corina Boettger--the voice behind the popular NPC named Paimon--says the studio owes her thousands, and Brandon Winckler (who voices a number of minor roles) has shared a similar story after ultimately deciding to leave the production.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">After a fifth email with no response, This is regarding Genshin Impact.

## Every Mission: Impossible Movie, Ranked

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165201-micover.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Tom Cruise is 61 years old, but you wouldn't know it from watching Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. He moves with the intensity and dexterity of a man half his age--coincidentally, three decades is almost exactly how long he's been making these Mission: Impossible movies.</p><p dir="ltr">The first movie came out in 1996. When Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two--the eighth film--comes out next year, Cruise will have played Ethan Hunt for 28 years. That's 28 years of the actor tossing himself off of cliffs, out of planes, and out of buildings for our entertainment.</p><p dir="ltr">In the new movie, Cruise drives a motorcycle off of a cliff and then performs a mid-air base jump. In the behind-the-scenes footage, we learn that Cruise actually performed this stunt six times, to ensure that the crew captured the best possible footage. It's a testament to his physicality, his preparedness, and his impressive and ridiculous need to do the most dangerous activities in the films himself.</p><p dir="ltr">It also begs the question: what will Cruise do to top this? According to director Christopher McQuarrie, the crew still has to shoot the <a href="https://collider.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-2-how-much-is-left-to-film/">action setpiece</a> that will anchor the eighth movie. He didn't give many details, although he does say that it is "massive" and unprecedented. And while it was reported that the next film would be the last one for the franchise, Tom Cruise might have his own thoughts on the matter. Discussing <a href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-9-franchise-future-tom-cruise-response/">Harrison Ford's longevity</a>, Cruise commented that he would love to make Mission: Impossible movies until he's Ford's age. That sounds promising, and so long as Cruise's body holds up as well as his spirit, we're here for it.</p><p dir="ltr">Here is every movie in the Mission: Impossible series, ranked. Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One, is out in theaters now. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two, its sequel, will release on July 28, 2024.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Mission: Impossible 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165205-mi2.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director: </strong>John Woo</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: </strong>May 24, 2000</p><p dir="ltr">The sequel to the first film was directed by Hong Kong filmmaking legend John Woo, who's famous for his operatic fight sequences, featuring slow-motion gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. But what makes the Mission: Impossible movies so fun are their intrigue and doublespeak--the action is the means to the end, not the end itself. This is a decent movie--easy on the eyes, with sweeping panorama shots that put the other films' camerawork to shame. But the clash of styles makes this more of a John Woo film than a Mission: Impossible film, and that relegates it to last on this list.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Mission: Impossible</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165203-mi1.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director: </strong>Brian De Palma</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: </strong>May 22, 1996</p><p dir="ltr">The first movie in the Mission Impossible series had an impossible task. After the successful 1966 television series and the 1988 sequel series, expectations were sky-high. The filmmakers had to pay homage to its predecessors while also bringing the franchise into the modern day. They had all the ingredients: a decorated director, an A-list leading man, and massive action set pieces, anchored by Cruise's tense wire descent into a high-security vault.</p><p dir="ltr">But the plot, which framed Hunt for the murder of his entire IMF team, is a bit murky and overly complicated. And the movie didn't strike the right tone--it's dark, and it doesn't have the sense of fun and levity that defines the later entries and counterbalances the action.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165207-mi4.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director: </strong>Brad Bird</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: </strong>December 16, 2011</p><p dir="ltr">This movie has it where it counts--the acting, the stakes, the action, and the heart. The plot is by-the-numbers spy stuff. Ethan and his team have to intercept Russian nuclear launch codes, and stop a bomb from striking San Francisco. But the story is told clearly, in a way that is breezy, accessible, and fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Highlights include Cruise scaling the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and then chasing a suspect through a subsequent sandstorm. This is the ideal popcorn flick that doesn't aspire to be more, to its benefit. And it's such a good time that you'll overlook that you've seen much of it before, but rarely executed this well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Mission: Impossible III</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165206-mi3.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director: </strong>J. J. Abrams</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: </strong>May 5, 2006</p><p dir="ltr">It's become fashionable to hate J.J. Abrams, between his handling of the Star Trek franchise and his subsequent handling of the Star Wars franchise. But whatever else he does, one can never take away what he accomplished with the criminally underrated Mission: Impossible III--the rejuvenation of a franchise that was in sore need of a consistent tonal direction.</p><p dir="ltr">III introduced Simon Pegg to the series as technician (and later field agent) Benji, who injected some needed humor and levity into the franchise Benji has appeared in every subsequent film as an indispensable resource and friend to Ethan. And the movie features the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the main villain, a sadistic, smarmy weapons dealer that invades Ethan's personal life and makes the fight personal.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165211-mi7.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director: </strong>Christopher McQuarrie</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date:</strong> July 27, 2018</p><p dir="ltr">Should we consider this the first half of a bigger film, or a complete work in its own right? At the moment, Dead Reckoning ranks in the upper-middle of the pack. It contains a prescient, cautionary message about the dangers of artificial intelligence, and the main villain of the film is an AI that has gained sentience and access to security files from all over the world. How does one stop something that is everywhere and nowhere at once?</p><p dir="ltr">The film ends with an incredible train sequence. The train heist is a classic bit of American storytelling, and it's surprising that the movie franchise has never attempted one until now. But it is well worth the wait, and it concludes with a climb up a train as it's falling off a cliff. Perhaps it is a homage to the classic opening of Uncharted 2. And best of all, there's more to come; we'll be getting the sequel in approximately a year's time.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165208-mi5.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director:</strong> Christopher McQuarrie</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 31, 2015</p><p dir="ltr">Christopher McQuarrie made his franchise directorial debut with Rogue Nation, in which Ethan Hunt and his team have to fight the Syndicate, a collection of rogue agents-turned-terrorists that has infiltrated global intelligence from the inside.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the best things about having the same director for the last three entries of the series is the level of logical and narrative consistency that the films have achieved. This movie gets better after watching Fallout and Dead Reckoning Part One; we can see how the introductions of former MI6 Agents Ilsa Faust and Solomon Lane pay off in spectacular ways. But as a standalone, Rogue Nation gets narrowly beaten by another of McQuarrie's films.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Mission: Impossible - Fallout</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4165209-mi6.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director: </strong>Christopher McQuarrie</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 27, 2018</p><p dir="ltr">The best film in the franchise is Mission: Impossible - Fallout, and it comes down to the final action sequence. Ethan and his team must defuse two nuclear bombs at the same time. They are programmed to be failsafes to one another; disarm one, it will cause the other to explode. Benji finds a single technical loophole; they must arm the bombs and start their countdowns in order to shut them down.</p><p dir="ltr">What follows is a virtuoso bit of filmmaking, which cuts between four different locations as the different members of Ethan's team--not to mention Ethan himself--must work in perfect unity to save the world. Other films in the series have pulled this trick before. But it's rarely cut this close, literally down to the last second. And for the first time, the film feels like a true ensemble piece. Everyone gets a chance to shine and play a crucial role in a successful mission.</p><p dir="ltr">The movie creates interpersonal drama by adding August Walker (Henry Cavill) as a CIA agent who's there to either help or kill Ethan, depending on whether Ethan decides to go rogue on his mission parameters (which of course he does.) Walker helps bridge the gaps between the action scenes, especially while we're still trying to figure out his loyalties--is he a bad guy, or is he just a douchebag? Everything feels fluid: the leadup to the missions, the missions themselves, and then the post-mission debriefings, where everyone reflects and questions what they do next. Nothing feels forced.</p><p dir="ltr">Fallout also brings back the prior movie's villain, which makes this feel like a proper franchise, rather than a collection of loosely stitched together stories with common elements. And it brings back Julia, Ethan's ex-wife, in a way that makes sense for the characters and finally gives Ethan a sense of closure. If the series ended here, the story would feel complete. Thankfully, it didn't. But until we can Dead Reckoning Part Two next year and make a final judgment on the whole, Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible film.</p></h3></p><br />

## How Cyberpunk 2077's Controversial Sinnerman Quest Was Created

<p>Cyberpunk 2077's locale of Night City had no shortage of interesting stories, and in one of the more fascinating tales, players got to experience a strange saga of justice and redemption. Sinnerman starts off with what seems to be a straight-forward revenge plot gone wrong, but as quest director Pawel Sasko explained in a new Audio Logs video, there's an incredible amount of nuanced work happening in this quest that subtly guides the player.</p><p>As Sasko explained, every character movement, line, and even a seemingly stray ray of light serve a purpose in setting up this quest, in which you're introduced to convicted murderer Joshua Stephenson. This entire quest, and its two accompanying missions that end with an actual crucifixion that you can play a part in if you see it through to the end, tie into themes of existentialism that are woven throughout Cyberpunk 2077's world.</p><p>While Stephenson never claims to be a messianic figure, his quests are littered with iconic moments and characters pulled from the Christian Bible. Stephenson has a moment to grab a meal before his execution that's directly inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper painting, and he even has his own Judas accompanying him. Eventually, the quest leads to one of the more empathic moments of Cyberpunk 2077 as you're given a chance to join Stephenson in prayer, and even here, players are given a choice as to how they want to approach a spiritual moment in the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-cyberpunk-2077s-controversial-sinnerman-quest-was-created/1100-6515937/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In a major court victory, developer Bungie has won almost $500,000 in damages against a Destiny 2 player who harassed one of its community managers. This was preceded by defendant James Comer being "incensed" over fan art by a Black community member being given the spotlight. Comer then sent racist and abusive calls to the manager and his wife, and in an effort to intimidate them, arranged for an unsolicited pizza order to be delivered to their home.</p><p>"The choice to highlight work by a fan of color incensed Comer, and on or about June 2, 2022, Comer started his campaign of racist, stochastic terrorism against the Does and Bungie," the court document read. "Comer spent hours that day carpet bombing the Does with racist text and voice messages. Not satisfied, he decided to show the Does that he knew where they lived and could assault them there. Comer used an anonymous number to place a cash-on-delivery order with Domino's Pizza for a virtually inedible, odiferous pizza."</p><p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14s3qU7K78oeSvWW1YL8RD3cofI-7mCaU/view">Washington state court ruled in Bungie's favor</a> and Comer is now expected to pay over $489,000 in damages. This includes expenses related to the case, Bungie's efforts to protect its employees with security measures for the couple, and the fees from Bungie's legal team for prosecuting him. This victory is also an important one for companies in general, as it sets a new legal precedent that will allow for greater protective measures to be taken for victims of cyber-stalking.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-player-who-harassed-employees/1100-6515944/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>San Diego Comic-Con is on its fourth year in a string of very weird years. After shapeshifting to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the convention is now contending with the Writers Guild of America strike and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollywood-actors-expected-to-begin-strike-today-first-since-1980/1100-6515940/">potential strike from the Screen Actors Guild</a> (SAG-AFTRA). If Hollywood actors strike for better pay, shows and films are put on hold, and talent can't promote specific shows or movies. However, a schedule for SDCC has been released. It may very well change in the coming days due to the strikes, but for now, there are some seriously promising panels on the docket.</p><p>We have gathered the most high-profile panels with scheduled guests, but there are literally hundreds more going on throughout the weekend. Even without the presence of Marvel or DC, SDCC is huge and there will still be panels worth checking out. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 19-23.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Thursday, July 20</a><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Max Original Animation</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Thursday__July_20">Thursday, July 20</h2><h3 id="Max_Original_Animation">Max Original Animation</h3><ul><li><strong>Thursday, July 20, 2023 </strong>at<strong> 11:00 AM PT </strong>in Ballroom 20</li></ul><p>Max Original Animation will feature the Adventure Time spin-off Fionna &amp; Cake, new series Young Love, and a preview for Harley Quinn Season 4, as well as surprise panelists.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/san-diego-comic-con-2023-schedule-the-biggest-panels-at-this-years-sdcc/1100-6515871/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Speaking to GQ, Mikkelsen said he and Norman Reedus, who plays the lead character in Death Stranding, didn't exactly understand what Kojima was talking about but trusted him to get it right in the end.</p><p>"He was trying to pitch it to us, more than once, and we're both like, 'I think I got it, but should we just do the scene, and then you can take over from there?'" Mikkelsen said. "It had so many layers, when he was explaining it. Norman and I just did our best to nod at the right time and say, 'I got it, let's move on.'"</p><div>          </div><p>Mikkelsen, Reedus, and other actors who appeared in Death Stranding performed scenes wearing motion capture dots and camera rigs, and Mikkelsen said he looked "kind of ridiculous" during the recording process. He also noted that he had to remind himself that Death Stranding is an animated project, so when he made a mistake on set, it could be fixed later on.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-star-didnt-exactly-understand-kojimas-direction-but-just-went-with-it/1100-6515943/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Unity Technologies has announced a new tool for its developer suite that uses AI to help devs identify toxicity in online games. The new Safe Voice tool is launching in closed beta and is aimed at letting studios isolate and review toxicity reports quickly. Unity says the tool was previously used by Hi-Rez's Rogue Company in early testing.</p><p>Safe Voice is said to analyze aspects like tone, loudness, intonation, emotion, pitch, and context to identify toxic interactions. It activates when a player flags an issue with a behavior, and then starts monitoring and delivers a report to human moderators. That overview dashboard will let moderators review individual incidents as well as see trends over time to help its moderation plans. Unity also says this is the first in a larger suite of toxicity solutions it has coming.</p><p>"It's one of the number one reasons that people leave a game and stop playing because there's some sort of bad situation around toxicity and other elements of abuse," Mark Whitten, Unity president of Create Solutions, told GameSpot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-devs-are-turning-to-ai-to-fight-mean-jerks-in-voice-chat/1100-6515916/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The captain will lead a crew of explorers, advisors, and landers through multiple challenges, including resource collection and rescue missions, all through the original Lunar Lander's precise landing-based gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Atari has tapped indie studio Dreams Uncorporated to lead development on the game, and it will be the studio's first game since the critically acclaimed indie RPG Cris Tales--which was also its debut game--launched in 2021.

<p> Of all the games that could have been announced for a remake this year, Crystal Dynamics' 1995 game about a wise-cracking, TV-obsessed gecko, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gex/">Gex</a>, was not high on my list. But thanks to Limited Run games and its Carbon Engine technology, that's exactly what we're getting.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gex-trilogy/">Gex Trilogy</a> will collect 1995's Gex, 1998's Gex: Enter the Gecko, and 1999's Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko to be released on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. Limited Run Games hasn't yet announced a release window for the remake.</p><p>Though it sunk into relative obscurity in the years after release, Gex has emerged from obscurity in recent years after becoming something of a meme. While the original game and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko were generally well-reviewed by critics, Gex: Enter the Gecko got a mixed reception, performing especially poorly on the Nintendo 64 due to hardware limitations. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gex-64-enter-the-gecko-review/1900-2543663/">original review</a> of the N64 title rated it a 4.7/10, warning players to "stay away from this lizard."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gex-is-back-for-some-reason/1100-6515935/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Valve's promised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-will-receive-a-large-update-this-summer/1100-6511388/">major summer update</a> for 2007 game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-fortress-2/">Team Fortress 2</a> is here, and it's adding 14 new maps, a new game mode, new taunts, effects, and a whole heap of bug fixes and quality-of-life update.</p><p>While most of what's new to the game is community-made content that's been given an official released, it's still a major update for a game that's over 15 years old. The new content will come into play as part of a summer event that will run through to September 15.</p><p>Excitingly, the fan-made Versus Saxton Hale mode has been made official as part of the update, with four new maps released for the asymmetrical multiplayer mode. The mode is a variant on Arena mode where a whole team of players take on one overpowered player who takes the role of Saxton Hale, or another powerful boss.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has 12 playable classes including the brand-new Monk class and even if you're familiar with Dungeons and Dragons classes, it's still going to be a challenge to choose which one to play first. We sat down with some of the developers to get their opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of each class, and find out which are their personal favorites to play.</p><p>GameSpot interviewed Larian Studios game director Swen Vincke, lead writer Adam Smith, and lead systems designer Nick Pechenin to get their opinion on each of Baldur's Gate 3's playable classes. There's a class to suit any play style, and the three devs break that down, class by class.</p><p>For example, the devs pick the Fighter or Warlock as good options for beginner players, as classes that are simpler to play and easier to level up than other options. Players looking for a more complex experience might go for the broader spell list of a Wizard or the versatility of a Cleric, or come up with fun ways to break the game with the Sorcerer's metamagic.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-devs-share-their-thoughts-on-all-12-classes/1100-6515933/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
