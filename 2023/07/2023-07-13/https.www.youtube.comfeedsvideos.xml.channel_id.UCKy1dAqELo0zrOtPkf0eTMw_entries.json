Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning follows the HALO jump of Mission Impossible: Fallout, with Tom Cruise topping his last great action scene again. Was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation the point where the stunts escalated, or was it actually somewhere in Mission Impossible 6? Mission Impossible 7 (Dead Reckoning) takes off after the iconic Mission Impossible Theme, with a flurry of Mission Impossible stunts worth watching.\n\nWe\u2019re going over Mission Impossible, best stunts highlighted to see when things shifted to modern Mission Impossible. Crazy stunts have become synonymous with the franchise, and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 delivers with the Mission Impossible 7 movie. 2023 takes us past the cable hang and Mission Impossible theme song, and keeps in step with the action of the Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation plane scene and has some tonal similarities to the Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation opera scene.\n\nThe Tom Cruise Mission Impossible stunts are infamous for a reason, perhaps emblemized and starting with the Mission Impossible Dubai mission many years ago now.
