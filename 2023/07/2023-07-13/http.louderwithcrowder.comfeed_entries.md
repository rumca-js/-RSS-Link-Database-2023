It still isn't but... ya know? It's 2023. Saying a woman is anyone born with a vagina (while allowing for the occasional hermaphrodite as an outlier) should suffice. To the extent that there was ever a debate over what a woman was, Roseanne Barr murderized it during an interview with Piers Morgan.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote>A woman is me.</blockquote><p>Simple enough... oh wait there's more.</p><blockquote>A woman is somebody whose breasts hang down to her stomach, and who has a prolapsed uterus from giving birth to five ungrateful little bastards who have never had to work for a thing in their goddamn lives. That’s what a woman is.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Works for me!</p><p>It never used to be this hard. Then Democrats decided <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-misgenders-dylan-mulvaney" target="_self">anyone who wants to be a woman</a> and support the Left's radical agenda <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate" target="_blank">can be a woman</a>. Now defining what a woman is can <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/scotus-nominee-unable-define-woman" target="_blank">even stump Supreme Court nominees</a>. When Democrats nominated justices, they had a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/supreme-court-affirmative-action" target="_blank">hard enough time understanding the Constitution</a>. Now they can't understand being a woman without a degree in biology.</p><p>Roseanne showed how to answer the question politically. Biologically, the answer is simple. "Born with a vagina." But politically, you answer the question by mocking that the question even needs to be asked and the premise behind it.</p><p>If there is one unfortunate thing it's that Roseanne <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/roseanne-barr-forgives-castmates" target="_blank">doesn't have a sitcom right now</a>. The internet would have exploded with much aplomb and it would have been glorious.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Did they not read the directions for the quick pour resin? In America, it's in bold letters to not let it touch your skin.</p><p>And let's say they got their wish.

## Comedian destroys NBC News hit-piece calling concern with fitness a far-right thing: "Mein Kampf scribbled into the bar"

Someone on their digital team decided to tweet out a 2022 article that called obsession with fitness a far-right thing. The journalismer claimed "physical fitness has always been central to the far right" and alleged, "various reports have noted the role of combat sports and MMA in radicalizing and promoting far-right violence." </p><p>Not since the video of the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taliban-gym-ice-cream" target="_blank">Taliban using our military gyms after Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal</a> has there been <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gym-pods-are-the-future-of-going-to-the-gym-under-covid-and-oh-hell-no" target="_blank">a more ridiculous piece of political content</a>. Politicians shutting down gyms in the name of "public health" is definitely high in the rankings.</p><p>Though, as a way to strive to hear both sides of an issue, fitness influencer Ryan Long released an informational video to check for warning signs your gym might be an extremist recruiting cell: "Remember not to go all the way up will have excerpts of Mein Kampf scribbled into the bar and you want to make sure you don't want to make eye contact."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>The testimonials agreed:</p><p>"The reason working out is right wing is because the work you put in isn’t taxed. It’s all for you. A guy sleeping on the couch doesn’t get anything from you working out. Thinking the work you put in, is yours is right wing."</p><p>"Everyone should have a six-pack regardless of how much they work out." - Karl Marx</p><p>"I agree with MSNBC.

</p><p>For me, the most ridiculous thing is less the article itself as much as the decision to use the article a year later for clickbait. The title "Pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme — literally" was even changed on the share text to hide the fact it was pandemic related. Setting aside the reason anyone was really into home fitness was because THE GOVERNMENT SHUT OUR GYMS DOWN.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The content creators at NBC News were low on their clickthrough quota, so they shared an article they knew normie-Americans would go bananas over. And you know something, good for NBC News. Because it worked and we fell for it.<br /></p><p>It is an article that epitomizes why so many people hate the media and think the entire industry sucks at life. One that will be remembered the next time there is a poll asking what institution is the least trusted in America. But at least the digital team at NBC "News" will get their monthly bonus. Amirite?</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Ice Cube has only three words for the "s*** ton" of leftist hate coming his way

Sometimes I just can't help myself.</p><p>The rapper/producer/mogul is <a href="https://twitter.com/icecube/status/1672982989393784832" target="_blank">out on a podcast tour to get some things off his chest</a>. Cube saw when he dipped his toe in politics in 2020, a certain club that gets upset when someone with Cube's complexion disagrees with them about anything... got upset. Pssst. I'm talking about progressives. Three years later, he's doing a <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/06/ice-cube-says-hes-not-part-elite-club-promises-podcast-tour-will-shake-things-up-1235424174/" target="_blank">tour of podcasts to tell that club to go f*ck themselves</a>. One that promises to burn some bridges. </p><p>Supporters have told Cube they're praying for him. Anyone who follows politics knows the hate that gets thrown at public figures -- particularly if those public figures check off one or more of the Left's preferred marginalized boxes -- if they hold a single opinion the Left disagrees with. Cube has three words for the haters:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>And then <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-dylan-mulvaney" target="_blank">he went on the Joe Rogan podcast</a> to join the chorus of people mocking Bud Light for getting woke and going broke.</p><p>It's been fun watching Cube's... I guess transformation? While an oldhead who grew up in the 80s and 90s, musically for me if it wasn't metal it was crap. It wasn't until my mid-thirties that I started to appreciate rap. Ice Cube always came across as the most politically minded of NWA, and NOT in a secret conservative way. </p><p>I don't think he's a secret conservative now either. We have a habit of lumping people in as "right-wing" if they say a single thing we agree with or if they get shunned for saying a single thing the Left disagrees with. But starting in 2020, when Cube had a list of policies for his community he wanted to discuss with the two presidential candidates about, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ice-cube-donald-trump" target="_blank">the Trump campaign was the only one who reached out</a>. Joe Biden saying "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-black-gaffe-blame" target="_blank">you ain't black</a>" if you don't vote for him no questions asked turned out to be a Democrat campaign platform.</p><p>Then after getting continued attacks <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ice-cube-trending-black-america" target="_blank">for not falling in line with the Democrat party</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ice-cube-nine-million" target="_blank">having his personal medical decisions made public for not complying</a> with the Democrat narrative, Ice Cube's got a little somethin' somethin' he wants to say. </p><p>Now the gatekeepers are Jerry Heller and Cube's podcast tour is a "No Vaseline" remake. It's going to be fun.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Joe Biden confuses Ukraine for Russia, Zelenskyy for Putin in another derptastic appearance on the world stage
