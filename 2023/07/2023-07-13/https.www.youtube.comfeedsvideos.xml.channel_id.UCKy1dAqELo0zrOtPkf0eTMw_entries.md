## How Mission: Impossible Stunts Went from Dangerous to Deadly

Mission Impossible is known for its big stunts, and with the erstwhile Mission Impossible 7 ready to come out, we’re talking about the escalation of Tom Cruise laughing in death’s face to achieve these jaw-dropping stunts. Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning follows the HALO jump of Mission Impossible: Fallout, with Tom Cruise topping his last great action scene again. Was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation the point where the stunts escalated, or was it actually somewhere in Mission Impossible 6? Mission Impossible 7 (Dead Reckoning) takes off after the iconic Mission Impossible Theme, with a flurry of Mission Impossible stunts worth watching.

We’re going over Mission Impossible, best stunts highlighted to see when things shifted to modern Mission Impossible. Crazy stunts have become synonymous with the franchise, and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 delivers with the Mission Impossible 7 movie. 2023 takes us past the cable hang and Mission Impossible theme song, and keeps in step with the action of the Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation plane scene and has some tonal similarities to the Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation opera scene.

The Tom Cruise Mission Impossible stunts are infamous for a reason, perhaps emblemized and starting with the Mission Impossible Dubai mission many years ago now. What do you think were the best Mission Impossible stunts with  Ethan Hunt? Or is the best still to come?

Rose (Marin Ireland) is a pathologist who prefers working with corpses over social interaction. She also has an obsession — the reanimation of the dead. Celie (Judy Reyes) is a maternity nurse who has built her life around her bouncy, chatterbox six-year-old daughter, Lila (A.J. Lister). When one tragic night, Lila suddenly falls ill and dies, the two women's worlds crash into each other. They embark on a dark path of no return where they will be forced to confront how far they are willing to go to protect what they hold most dear.

This directorial debut from Laura Moss reimagines Mary Shelley’s classic horror myth Frankenstein with such a contemporary understanding that it becomes something exciting, terrifying, and singularly new.

IFC Films and Shudder will release birth/rebirth in theaters on August 18, 2023.

The Last of Us co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann talk about adapting what they consider the game's most famous scene -- where Ellie bares her soul and fears to Joel -- for HBO's live-action series starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey. The Last of Us: The Complete First Season comes to 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on July 18, 2023.

The Last of Us takes place 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel, a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie, a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal and heartbreaking journey as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.

Season one stars Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, Anna Torv as Tess, Nico Parker as Sarah, Murray Bartlett as Frank, Nick Offerman as Bill, Melanie Lynskey as Kathleen, Storm Reid as Riley, Merle Dandridge as Marlene, Jeffrey Pierce as Perry, Lamar Johnson as Henry, Keivonn Woodard as Sam, Graham Greene as Marlon, and Elaine Miles as Florence. Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker also star.

The Last of Us, based on the critically acclaimed video game of the same name developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation platforms, is written and executive produced by Craig Mazin (Emmy Award-winning creator of HBO’s Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann (creator and writer of the award-winning The Last of Us franchise and Naughty Dog Co-President).

Testament: The Order of High Human reviewed by Travis Northup on PC.

"Testament: The Order of High Human answers the question: “What would the phrase ‘quantity over quality’ look like if it were turned into a game?” The result is a tedious, frustrating, and cringe-inducing fantasy adventure RPG that goes on so agonizingly long with its bland and confusing story and god-awful combat that it turns its bad ideas into atrocious ones by sheer volume. Throw in an all-star roster of technical issues, and you’ve got the ultimate “Elder Scrolls, but make it hurt” tour de force that will haunt me for even longer than the dozens of hours it already has."

Jagged Alliance 3 reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

"Jagged Alliance 3 is a smartly-built, action-packed throwback tactical extravaganza that I enjoyed the whole way through. Its madcap sense of humor is very hit or miss – for me, it's usually miss. But for the most part, that doesn't hurt its ability to tell a story with just enough intrigue to keep you guessing, while not overcomplicating things too much. The huge variety of distinct characters, hand-built tactical maps, and objectives assure that a long campaign never goes stale, with limited but meaningful merc progression that let me build my dream squad and play almost exactly how I wanted to, with the added tension of trying to keep them alive through each combat encounter. If you know your way around a squad management game you may want to turn the campaign difficulty up a notch for your first playthrough, but even when you're rolling in cash, this lead-slinging blow-out is a hell of a good time."

Look out for Godzilla coming at us here in the U.S. in December with Godzilla Minus One. The upcoming film takes place in a post-war Japan, with #Godzilla terrorizing the denizens of the city by knocking over buildings and completely devastating the already war-torn country. #GodzillaMinusOne takes place after the devastating events of World War 2, which unfortunately set Japan back as a civilization - which could be why the film is titled ‘Minus One, as it can be surmised that Japan was put in the negative following World War 2. It’s surprising we’re getting Godzilla Minus One just a year after it was announced last year on Godzilla Day (November 3rd). November 3rd, 1954 was the date the original Godzilla film made its way onto the screen.  We discuss and break down the first trailer for Godzilla Minus One, the potential of a shared Kaiju universe coming from TOHO, Guy Gardner is coming to the Superman Legacy movie, and so much more in today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.

A LinkedIn post may have revealed when we'll see the Japan-set Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. The post mentions 2024, and it could very well be legit as the post was edited sometime later and all references to 2024 were removed. Interesting. In PlayStation news, the PS Plus lineup for July has been revealed, and award-winning multiplayer game It Takes Two leads the pack. If you're looking for something more, well, violent, Sniper Elite 5 is also coming. And in just in time for the Twisted Metal series on Peacock is Twisted Metal 1 and 2 in the PlayStation Classics category. And there's more! For the full list, head over to  IGN.com. And finally, Evan Wells, co-president of Naughty Dog, is retiring. He bids farewell to the acclaimed game development studio after more than 20 years with the company. The other co-president, Neil Druckmann, will continue on as sole president of the company.
