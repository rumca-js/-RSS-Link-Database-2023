Headsets have come a long way since the launch of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive six years ago. The Meta Quest 2 has already been around for two years, and it\u2019s proven to be a very capable portable VR experience. And if you\u2019re looking for a more hands-on, immersive experience, high-end PC headsets are getting cheaper and becoming more widely available at major retailers. While the overall VR market hasn\u2019t really changed much since last year (aside from the somewhat disappointing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html\">Meta Quest Pro</a>), at least there are plenty of VR experiences to dive into.</p><h2><br />So what makes a good VR headset?</h2><p>I tend to judge virtual reality headsets on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It's not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes skill to craft something that's well balanced and doesn't feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so the visuals are sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a low field of view makes it feel like you\u2019re looking through a pair of binoculars, which limits your sense of \u201cpresence.\u201d The best VR headsets have a wide field of view that can make it seem like you\u2019re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth.</p><p>And when it comes to controllers, the best options fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta\u2019s excellent touch controllers, but we're also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve's finger tracking gamepads.</p><h2>Best VR headset for most people: Meta Quest 2</h2><p></p><p>Over two years since its release, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PY3VsdXMtUXVlc3QtQWR2YW5jZWQtQWxsLU9uZS1WaXJ0dWFsL2RwL0IwOTlWTVQ4Vlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1ZmYzNGJmLWY2ZjctNDg3OC04MGMxLTVmMTU1ZTdhZjE0YiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQFeq6Fas1jV9ohaGomag8_kstKpjjQIA8yViHmVHwnB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual%2Fdp%2FB099VMT8VZ\">Meta Quest 2</a> remains the best VR headset for the vast majority of consumers. It's completely cordless, and it's comfortable to wear for long sessions. Unfortunately, due to supply chain pressures and a worsening economic climate, Meta ended up increasing the Quest 2\u2019s price by $100 this year, making it a $400 headset. It\u2019s still a great device, but it\u2019s also in the strange position of being a worse deal than it was last year.</p><p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s still good, though: there's a huge library of virtual reality titles that you can experience anywhere, and it's bundled with Meta\u2019s great motion controllers. You can also connect the Quest 2 to a gaming PC to stream more complex VR experiences.</p><p>The Quest 2 features fast-switching LCDs with a resolution 1832x1920 per eye, the highest we've seen from Meta. It also has a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which is impressive for something running entirely on mobile hardware. The Quest 2's field of view isn't the best \u2014 it's been measured at just around 90 degrees \u2014 but it's still enough to enjoy most VR experiences. You can also <a href=\"https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/i-boosted-my-quest-2s-field-of-view-halfway-to-a-valve-index-vrcover-foam-pads-fov-rated/\">use different face pads</a> to increase its field of view a bit.

It offers dual 2K OLED HDR screens, effectively giving you 4K quality and an immersive VR experience. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html\">one of the most comfortable headsets</a> around. And it has some genuinely refreshing new features, like eye tracking and headset haptics. (Yes, it can literally rock your noggin.) And best of all, the PS VR2 delivers high-quality virtual reality without the need for a $1,000+ gaming PC \u2013 all you need is a PlayStation 5.</p><p>Now, our recommendation comes with a few caveats. At $550, the PS VR2 is more expensive than the PS5 itself. And it\u2019s unclear how quickly its game library will fill up (the initial run has only a few exclusives, like <em>Horizon VR</em> and <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>). But it\u2019s the easiest way to experience high-end VR, and it\u2019s a major upgrade over the original PS VR.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html\"><strong>Read our Full Review of the PlayStation VR2 Headset</strong></a></p><p></p><h2>Best PC VR headset under $600: HP Reverb G2</h2><p></p><p>If you don't care about wireless VR, and you want to invest a bit more in a high-quality PC virtual reality headset, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IZWFkc2V0LUNvbnRyb2xsZXItQWRqdXN0YWJsZS1TcGVha2Vycy1Fcmdvbm9taWMtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDhUQjVKN0tZP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NWZmMzRiZi1mNmY3LTQ4NzgtODBjMS01ZjE1NWU3YWYxNGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU8yuwb4LPkC9aq-FwtzTfc5m5cydhv9-Jh3N1rWGM-5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHeadset-Controller-Adjustable-Speakers-Ergonomic-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08TB5J7KY\">HP's $599 Reverb G2</a> is meant for you. It was developed in cooperation with Valve and has some of the best features from the pricier Index headset, like near-field speakers. The Reverb G2 also has sharp screens, offering 2,160 by 2,160 pixels per eye, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a relatively wide 114-degree field of view.</p><p>It's also the first Windows Mixed Reality headset to include four sensors, which helps to ensure more accurate VR tracking, especially during fast-paced games. I also give HP credit for making a tethered VR headset that\u2019s extremely comfortable thanks to its luxurious cushioning around the eye-piece and rear strap.</p><p>The Reverb G2's motion controllers aren't my favorite, but they're still a big step up from HP's previous model. You could also upgrade it to use Valve's finger-tracking controllers, but that involves snagging SteamVR sensors and a lot more setup.

For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve's finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we've seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it's still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I'd gladly lose a few pixels to get a smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond any other consumer headset.</p><p>As a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it's wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it's not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you'll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR gaming experience.</p><p>Valve's finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> feel like a dream. It's unfortunate that other VR games haven't fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html\"><strong>Read our Full Review of Valve Index VR Kit </strong></a></p><p></p><h2>Best VR quality, no matter the cost: HTC Vive Pro 2</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlGUENUM0g4Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODVmZjM0YmYtZjZmNy00ODc4LTgwYzEtNWYxNTVlN2FmMTRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbIfFJwh94FAXF8dh3EuNAtYS0hhu_zdCTW83DVKM95B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09FPCT3H8%2F\">HTC's Vive Pro 2</a> is the best-looking PC VR I've seen.

For a wired headset, the actual work of rendering a game is done on either a PC or game console. For completely wireless devices, like the Meta Quest 2, that work is handled right on the headset. They rely on either external sensors, or sensors built into the headsets, to map your physical space. While you can use a traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse in VR, they typically use motion tracking controllers to immerse you in their 3D environments.</p><h3>What VR headset is best for full body tracking?</h3><p>While we\u2019re still waiting for a truly great haptic VR bodysuit to arrive, you can still achieve accurate body tracking with most Steam VR-compatible PC headsets. The Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro 2 both rely on room-tracking sensors that can map your body more effectively than the built-in sensors on competitors. You can also add HTC Vive Trackers to wrist and leg straps, as well as belts, for even better coverage. The Meta Quest 2 doesn\u2019t have any easy body tracking solutions, but you can <a href=\"https://www.vr-wave.store/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/get-full-body-tracking-on-your-quest-2\">add Vive trackers when it\u2019s plugged into your PC</a> to mimic a Steam VR headset.</p><p>Only a few experiences, like VRChat, take advantage of full body tracking at the moment. Currently there aren\u2019t any body tracking solutions for the PlayStation VR and VR2, but we\u2019re intrigued by the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vr-wave.store/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/get-full-body-tracking-on-your-quest-2\">Mocopi body trackers</a>, which were really announced in Japan.</p><h3>What VR headsets are better than Oculus?</h3><p>Oculus is the previous name for Meta\u2019s VR hardware. Currently, Meta only supports the Quest 2 and Quest Pro, both of which are wireless headsets. As we explain above, PC VR headsets can generally achieve better quality virtual reality, since they rely on more powerful graphics hardware.</p><h3>What VR headsets work with Xbox?</h3><p>Currently, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox consoles don\u2019t support any VR headsets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T16:35:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony's $90 PS5 accessibility controller arrives on December 6th", "description": "<p>Sony has revealed when <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation-5/\">PlayStation 5</a> players will be able to snap up its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonys-project-leonardo-ps5-peripheral-is-now-the-access-controller-105010859.html\">new accessibility-focused controller</a> and just how much the peripheral will cost.

Small enough to fit in a day pack and sturdy enough to live at the bottom of your carry on, battery packs can charge your smartphone, tablet, laptop or even all three at once, depending on the size of the battery. What size you\u2019ll need, and any extra features you may find useful, will largely depend on the devices you plan on charging up. With so many options on the market right now, we tested out a bunch of models to determine the best portable power banks you can get right now.</p><h2>What to look for in a portable battery pack</h2><h3><strong>Battery type</strong></h3><p>Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries\">increased</a> in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.cei.washington.edu/education/science-of-solar/battery-technology/\">suffer</a> from a memory effect (where battery life deteriorates due to partial charges).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>One drawback you may have heard is the possibility of lithium ion batteries <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lithium-ion-battery-salt-fireproofing-213055538.html\">catching fire</a>. To limit the danger, battery packs require internal mechanisms to limit things like voltage and pressure. While you should still make sure a battery isn\u2019t exposed to unnecessary stress like excessive heat, damage from drops or operating in freezing weather, battery packs are considered safe enough to bring on an airplane. According to the <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-100-watt-hours-or-less-device\">TSA</a>, external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) can fly with you \u2013 just make sure you stash them in your carry on as they aren\u2019t allowed in checked baggage.</p><h3><strong>Capacity</strong></h3><p>Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery\u2019s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries, say those that can charge a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent, tend to have a 5,000mAh capacity. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh. Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.</p><p>You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that\u2019s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That\u2019s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.</p><h3><strong>Ports</strong></h3><p>While the tech world is (thankfully) moving towards USB-C as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eu-usb-c-port-charging-requirement-approved-141546579.html\">standard</a>, it\u2019s still a mixed bag in the power bank world. All of our picks have at least one USB-C port and a few also have a USB-A port or two. Newer Android smartphones charge via USB-C, iPhones <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-mac-accessories-usb-c-report-170406614.html\">still use the</a> Lightning port, but the latest tablets (including current generation iPads) and newer laptops are typically powered up via USB-C.</p><p>When a battery pack has more than one charging port, they usually serve different functions. You\u2019ll typically see at least one port labeled \u201cin/out,\u201d which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your device. While USB-A ports can power up smartphones and other small devices, they can\u2019t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren\u2019t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That\u2019s something to keep in mind when you\u2019re deciding which ports and cables to use to connect your phone to the pack.</p><p>There\u2019s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank\u2019s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it\u2019ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to consider your cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you\u2019ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivered from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you\u2019ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don\u2019t, we\u2019ve tried and liked <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFBWUUM1QzYvP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taXItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR_xsREa_And-v6ZXl_ejxtt2D4oWXYQ-2zL5SSYmK0M&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08PVQC5C6%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Anker\u2019s 100W USB-C cable</a>.

For around $20, higher-capacity cables will make sure you\u2019re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer.</p><h3><strong>Design</strong></h3><p>For the most part, battery packs have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn\u2019t affect how they perform, it\u2019s a consideration for something you\u2019ll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the largest banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating a percentage for the remaining battery, which can be helpful if you\u2019re relying on a pack in a mobile office setting or something similar.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><figure><img alt=\"Overhead view of the devices used for battery testing arranged on a table, including an iPhone, Galaxy phone and iPad, all face down. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/e1df8930-9d93-11ed-9b57-3ff203a0d41e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><p>Before we even put our hands on a battery pack, we did extensive research.

And while it performed admirably, charging a dead 14 Plus to about 43 percent in an hour and 45 minutes, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlnZW4tQXJjSHlicmlkLU1hZ25ldGljLUNoYXJnaW5nLVdpcmVsZXNzL2RwL0IwOU1KVlhZTUY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taXItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUruMmwuSUt4ihTwVIV44mrhkTgzr7MzPY9r2tp8L9Us&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-ArcHybrid-Magnetic-Charging-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB09MJVXYMF\">Spigen\u2019s ArcHybrid</a> delivered a 56 percent charge in nearly the same amount of time. The ArcHybrid firmly attaches to the MagSafe ring and it\u2019s flush enough that you can easily hold your phone and use it while charging up. Unlike the Apple battery, it includes four indicator lights to help you gauge how much juice the pack itself has left. Considering Spigen\u2019s battery is $30 cheaper than Apple\u2019s, it\u2019s easy to recommend.</p><p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOU5SRzRHSzM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taXItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWuPZ_3RYcYEmx3XFQgziyupe0FJjwyWL4AmrRy1usQD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09NRG4GK3\">Anker\u2019s 633 Magnetic</a> battery delivered a larger charge thanks to its 10,000mAh capacity, boosting the iPhone to 100 percent in three hours with enough left over for an additional 29 percent charge. And while the kickstand feature felt mildly useful, the battery itself was bulky \u2013 but that\u2019s understandable for a power bank that\u2019s twice as large as Spigen\u2019s. Ultimately, the ArcHybrid performed better as a quick and convenient way to give a partial charge to your iPhone on the go.</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than wired. Our tests showed wired battery banks deliver a device charge at around 60 percent efficiency. With the wireless chargers, that rate dropped to an average of 46 percent. Something to keep in mind when weighing the costs, both ecological and monetary, of wasted energy.</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>: 5000mAh, 7.5W max <br /><strong>Ports</strong>: One USB-C in/out<br /><strong>Cable</strong>: USB-C to USB-C<br /><strong>Number of charges iPhone</strong>: 0.56<br /><strong>Charge time iPhone</strong>: 0 to 56% in 1h 43m</p><h2>Best battery for a partial charge on an Android: Anker 511 Power Bank</h2><p></p><p>Until Android phones get <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qi-2-charging-borrowed-from-apple-is-coming-to-android-phones-in-2023-114738401.html\">something like</a> MagSafe, a wired connection makes the most sense for on-the-go charges.

The battery has enough capacity to charge a depleted Galaxy S22 Ultra to 75 percent in a little over an hour, so you\u2019ll be covered if you don\u2019t have long between flights to give your phone a bit more juice. It also has a built-in plug and allows for pass-through charging, which means it can act as a wall adapter if you\u2019re ever stuck with both a dead battery bank and phone, but happen to be near an outlet. It doesn\u2019t come with a cable, though, so you\u2019ll need to provide one that can go from the bank\u2019s single USB-C port to your device.</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>: 5,000 mAh, 10W max<br /><strong>Ports</strong>: One USB-C and wall outlet prongs<br /><strong>Cable</strong>: None<br /><strong>Number of charges Galaxy S22 Ultra</strong>: 0.75<br /><strong>Charge time Galaxy</strong>: 0 to 75% in 1h 7m</p><h2>Best low capacity battery: BioLite Charge 40 PD</h2><p></p><p>BioLite is probably better known in the outdoor community than the tech world, and it\u2019s fair to say that the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c7108adf-28cd-4cee-8929-a1014adc3d98&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BioLite&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzEwOGFkZi0yOGNkLTRjZWUtODkyOS1hMTAxNGFkYzNkOTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlvbGl0ZWVuZXJneS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvY2hhcmdlLTQwLVBEIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASr_WKmfS5i4ZbGXbyABmsC4zYdjdQOP5QM6d1hBdp7a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bioliteenergy.com%2Fproducts%2Fcharge-40-PD\">Charge 40 PD</a> is geared more towards camping trips than urban commutes. But this battery simply outperformed the others in its category. The rugged, yellow-accented exterior is a refreshing change from the standard shiny black of many tech accessories. It also has a rubberized finish and feels solid enough to handle the bumps and jolts of riding around in a purse or messenger bag all day. It gave both the iPhone and the Galaxy one and a half charges, which means it\u2019s plenty capable of reviving a dead phone a couple of times when you\u2019re out and about.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb25pbWJsZS5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvcG9ydGFibGUtYmF0dGVyeS1jaGFyZ2Vycy9wcm9kdWN0cy9jaGFtcC1wb3J0YWJsZS1jaGFyZ2VyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd6EcGyu1V9q1xaUOKOdyi6jJKW4FoemqVdb-iB1Q3x9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gonimble.com%2Fcollections%2Fportable-battery-chargers%2Fproducts%2Fchamp-portable-charger\">Nimble Champ</a> gets an honorary mention here because it\u2019ll also deliver a few reliable fill-ups and comes in a rugged package. It delivered a full charge to the iPhone in two hours plus a 22 percent charge in 16 minutes. It gave the Galaxy a full charge in an hour and 44 minutes, then got the phone from dead to 41 percent in 50 minutes. At the same $60 price point as the BioLite, Nimble gets extra points for being one of the few <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/nimble\">B-Corp-certified</a> personal tech manufacturers out there, meaning they\u2019ve committed themselves to higher environmental and social standards, and took the time to prove it through B Lab\u2019s certification process.</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>: 10,000mAh, 18W max<br /><strong>Ports</strong>: One in/out USB-C, two USB-A out only<br /><strong>Cable</strong>: USB-C to USB-A<br /><strong>Number of charges iPhone 14 Plus</strong>: 1.36<br /><strong>Charge time iPhone</strong>: 0 to 100% in 1h 50m, 0 to 50% in 36m<br /><strong>Number of charges Galaxy S22 Ultra</strong>: 1.33<br /><strong>Charge time Galaxy</strong>: 0 to 100% in 1h 33m, 0 to 50% in 45m</p><h2>Best medium capacity battery: Otterbox Fast Charge</h2><p></p><p>At the medium-capacity level, you can charge multiple devices at once or power up something larger than a phone.

Over the month and a half I spent testing battery packs, this was the unit I grabbed the most when my own devices needed a charge. It has a stylish exterior with a gray faux leather finish and copper detailing. A little bigger than a deck of cards and weighing just over 11 ounces, it\u2019s a nice looking accessory that feels solid.</p><p>It filled up both smartphones twice, then gave an additional third of a charge each. I introduced the iPad to the mix here and got a full charge plus an extra third. The Otterbox also lost very little battery power while sitting dormant, which means if you carry it around on the off chance that you\u2019ll need it, it should have plenty of power when the time comes.</p><p>This category may have been the closest to call, as <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLmFua2VyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9hMTM2Nj9jdXJyZW5jeT1VU0QmdmFyaWFudD00MjA4OTUzNjE5MjY2MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTE0OWQxOGEtMzY2ZC00MWU3LTljZmEtN2NlNGQwZmQ2ODM1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaUSEmF8lrX3T3t5IBIMVFKUmVNhtIvyF37aAoMY98Od&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1366%3Fcurrency%3DUSD%26variant%3D42089536192662\">Anker\u2019s 535 Power Core</a> performed slightly better than the Otterbox, but Anker\u2019s price point is higher. That said, if you want a screaming quick charge for your Galaxy phone, grab the 535. It got the Galaxy up to 100 percent three times, taking about an hour each time. It had enough left over for a small nine-percent charge before it finally gave up. While the battery did get pretty warm, it never felt overly hot. That one-hour fill up is the fastest any power bank was able to deliver a charge to the Galaxy, other than <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=aac3354f-048f-410b-ae8a-eb1da43ee6cf&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anker&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhYWMzMzU0Zi0wNDhmLTQxMGItYWU4YS1lYjFkYTQzZWU2Y2YiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW5rZXIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2IxMjkwP3ZhcmlhbnQ9Mzc0Mzg2MzY5MTY4ODYmcmVmPXNlcmllc0J1eSZkaXNjb3VudD1XUzdERkk4RVdBIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfYkv2qSYLDrbxiNXSN3lCG3S3wLrGDuMr0Xh41bvk5n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fb1290%3Fvariant%3D37438636916886%26ref%3DseriesBuy%26discount%3DWS7DFI8EWA\">Anker\u2019s 737</a>, which shaved off a few minutes, but costs $90 more.

The 737 fully charged our S22 Ultra three times, with enough power left over for another 93 percent charge \u2013 and those full charges completed in under an hour on average. That\u2019s on par with wall charging. The numbers for the iPhone were slightly less staggering, but still impressive, going from zero to full in about an hour and a half. The iPad charged completely twice, and did so in just over two hours, which is also close to that device\u2019s wall-connected charge speeds.</p><p>While it\u2019s great for multiple full charges on a given smartphone, I should point out that the 737 has three ports, but only one of those is USB-C.

It\u2019s capable of charging three gadgets at once, with a different wattage rating for each port: 100W, 45W and 20W. In practice, that means you could use the ports to charge a laptop, a tablet and a phone simultaneously. To keep the numbers comparable across our testing, I charged one device at a time. Both smartphones juiced up fully three times, with around a third of an additional charge left over. I got about two full charges from the battery on the iPad Air.</p><p>The Powerstation XL has the look and feel of a fancy pocketbook with a marled gray fabric exterior that feels nice in the hand and, incidentally, hides stains well. It weighs the same as the Anker 737 (one pound and three ounces) and also has lighted pips to indicate charge levels. There are only four lights, however, which doesn\u2019t give you the most precise insight as to how much charge it's carrying.</p><p>Another option, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9aZW5kdXJlLVBvcnRhYmxlLTI2ODAwbUFoLVN1cGVyVGFuay1FeHRlcm5hbC9kcC9CMDlENzhLTEsxP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdNrxMrCjZ_KjkQWuqjgDj3L7K6bq5g9vhkb6qV7rWac&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FZendure-Portable-26800mAh-SuperTank-External%2Fdp%2FB09D78KLK1\">Zendure Supertank Pro</a>, almost won this category in part because it handles its charge indication with a lighted LED display that shows exactly how much charge remains, expressed as a percentage. With four variable-wattage USB-C ports, a tough exterior and included semi-hard case, it seems tailor made to act as a power source for mobile photoshoots or nomadic offices. The charge speeds were a little slower than the Mophie, but it did manage to give a few more percentage points of charge to the iPad and the Galaxy phone, filing the latter four times. In the end, it came down to price: for $50 more than the Mophie, the Supertank Pro\u2019s speeds and capacity just didn\u2019t edge it out. But if you happen to see the Supertank on sale, snap it up.</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>:  25,000mAh, 120W max<br /><strong>Ports</strong>: One USB-C in/out, two USB-C out only<br /><strong>Cable</strong>: USB-C to USB-C<br /><strong>Number of charges iPhone 14 Plus</strong>: 3.23<br /><strong>Charge time iPhone</strong>: 0 to 100% in 1h 45m average and 23% in 18m<br /><strong>Number of charges Galaxy S22 Ultra</strong>: 3.85<br /><strong>Charge time Galaxy</strong>: 0 to 100% in 1h 36m and 85% in 1h 12m<br /><strong>Number of charges iPad Air</strong>: 2.02<br /><strong>Charge time iPad</strong>: 0 to 100% in 2h 16m and 2% in 7m</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T14:48:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "One week in, Threads has become Twitter\u2019s biggest threat", "description": "<p>Meta\u2019s Twitter rival, Threads, has unquestionably had the best first-week imaginable.

In just five days, it grew to more than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-races-to-100-million-users-in-under-a-week-070740016.html\">100 million</a> users, beating out chatGPT and TikTok which both previously held the record.</p><p>That\u2019s even more impressive considering the app <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-twitter-rival-threads-wont-initially-launch-in-the-eu-090314803.html\">isn\u2019t</a> available in the European Union, one of Meta\u2019s most important markets. And while Threads clearly borrowed some moves from Meta\u2019s growth-hacking playbook, like sending would-be users notifications on Instagram and pre-populating their feeds with content and followers, Mark Zuckerberg called most of the early growth \u201corganic.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u201cThat's mostly organic demand and we haven't even turned on many promotions yet,\u201d he wrote in a celebratory <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/t/CuhOXGmr74R\">post</a> on Threads. However you spin it, it's clearly bad news for Twitter.</p><p>While it\u2019s too soon to know if Threads\u2019 early success will translate in the long term, it has succeeded in utterly dominating Twitter in its first week. Every available metric suggests that Threads is not just a viral hit in its own right, but is doing so at the direct expense of Twitter.</p><p>Just days after Threads launched, Matthew Prince, CEO of DNS service Cloudflare, said that Twitter\u2019s traffic was \u201ctanking.\u201d He shared a graph showing that visits to twitter.com had sharply dipped since the end of June, around the time Elon Musk began <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532\">restricting</a> how many tweets users could view, and a few days later when Threads launched.</p><div id=\"703ee0eb9fd846f4be38f1fdb47b66cc\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Twitter traffic tanking. <a href=\"https://t.co/KSIXqNsu40\">https://t.co/KSIXqNsu40</a><a href=\"https://t.co/mLlbuXVR6r\">pic.twitter.com/mLlbuXVR6r</a></p>\u2014 Matthew Prince \ud83c\udf25 (@eastdakota) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Data from analytics firm SimilarWeb suggests the same pattern. According to the company, traffic to twitter.com dipped <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/social-media-news/threads/\">5 percent</a> in the two days following Threads' launch, compared with the same period the previous week. The firm notes that this is in addition to an \u201coverall decline\u201d in traffic that predates Threads.</p><p>There are other signs that Threads may be succeeding in luring away current Twitter users.  A recent poll <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/over-half-americans-twitter-account-say-they-are-likely-try-threads-next-few-weeks\">from Ipsos</a> found that 58% of American Twitter users said they were likely to try, or have already tried, Threads.. And 46% of American Twitter users said they were \u201clikely to move or have already moved the activity they used to do on Twitter to Threads.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that these are all very early metrics. Early virality for an app doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to long-term success or sustained growth. Google+ was once praised <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-google-is-growing-much-faster-than-facebook-did-in-the-early-days-2012-2\">for \u201cmeteoric\u201d</a> growth when it hit 100 million users less than a year after its launch more than a decade ago. In the more recent past, social audio app Clubhouse was heralded as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html\">a sensation</a> when it grew to a few million users in its first months of existence. Both eventually fizzled out.&nbsp;</p><p>And there are signs that Twitter does have a core group of dedicated, blue-checkmark-buying users. The same Ipsos poll found that more than half of American Twitter users were uninterested in migrating to Threads, at least in the near term. And data recently released by app analytics firm Sensor Tower suggests that Twitter\u2019s engagement held steady in the days following Threads\u2019 launch, while average time spent in Threads actually dipped.</p><div id=\"a812cd5a32324c169c31a5111d5b79c1\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Despite Threads strong sign-ups/DAUs, ST data shows engagement remains low.

The two touted their own \u2014 somewhat dubious \u2014 metric following Threads' launch, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1678508114339848194\">claiming</a> that the same week saw the \u201clargest usage day since February\u201d on the platform. \u201cCumulative user-seconds per day of phone screentime, as reported by iOS &amp; Android, is hardest to game,\u201d Musk wrote. (It\u2019s unclear how he was measuring \u201ccumulative user-seconds\u201d of screen time as neither Apple or Google report screen time metrics to app developers.)</p><p>Twitter\u2019s leadership has more than enough reason to be rattled by Threads\u2019 overnight success. While a wave of Twitter alternatives has cropped up in the wake of Musk\u2019s chaotic takeover of Twitter, none have come even close to 100 million. Mastodon, its most entrenched rival, reports <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/about\">2 million</a> monthly users. Bluesky, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html\">much-hyped</a> invite-only service, has about 300,000 sign-ups.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more importantly, Threads has succeeded in nabbing a key demographic many of its predecessors haven\u2019t: brands. Threads has been an all-out brands <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/brands-use-humor-to-find-their-voice-and-followers-on-threads/\">bonanza.</a> And as much as that\u2019s made for cringey, milquetoast content on the app, it\u2019s very, very good for Meta. For now, brands are getting the kind of organic engagement most social media managers only dream about. As Website Plant recently pointed out in a report, big brands are attracting significantly more engagement on Threads, compared with Twitter. This is true even for brands that have far more followers on Twitter than on Threads.</p><p>According to the report, 87% of brands got more likes on Threads posts than on Twitter. \u201cThe vast majority of the posts we went through generated significantly higher engagement on the new platform \u2014 no matter if the content itself was the same as on Twitter,\u201d the company <a href=\"https://www.websiteplanet.com/news/twitter-threads-research/\">wrote</a>.</p><p>Again, these are early stats. It\u2019s entirely possible that users on Threads are engaging more with brands simply because that what was shoved into their feeds, not because Meta somehow made the content more appealing. But that kind of early engagement will certainly make brands more willing to give Meta ad dollars whenever they do open advertising on the platform.</p><p>Zuckerberg has said the company won\u2019t introduce ads to Threads until there\u2019s a \u201cclear path to 1 billion people\u201d on the app. But that doesn\u2019t mean Threads will be ad-free for long. According to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/07/11/threads-instagram-branded-content-tools\"><em>Axios</em></a>, the company has already begun to work on branded content tools for the service, and \u201cis working to quickly make them available.\u201d It should come as no surprise, then, that Wall Street analysts are also enthused about Threads\u2019 prospects. The week-old platform could add up to $8 billion in revenue for Meta by 2025, according to an estimate from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/meta-s-threads-to-earn-8-billion-annual-revenue-by-2025-analyst-says#xj4y7vzkg\">one analyst</a>, reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>All this is especially bleak for Musk and Twitter, which is facing a financial outlook so dire the company has stopped paying <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8yNC9tdXNrcy10d2l0dGVyLWhhcy1iZWVuLXN1ZWQtYnktYXQtbGVhc3Qtc2l4LWNvbXBhbmllcy1mb3ItdW5wYWlkLWJpbGxzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiMjNlMjA5LTljMzAtNDU1Zi1hMTc1LTFhZjNhZWJmNDg5NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfnnKnHEatuFUDyqvMMloHymDHhL0-i005Up8EIBhLlS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F02%2F24%2Fmusks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html\">numerous bills</a>. According to a report from <em>The New York Times</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/twitter-ad-sales-musk.html\">last month</a>, Twitter\u2019s ad sales \u2014 its primary source of revenue \u2014 have plummeted 59% compared with last year, with performance \u201cunlikely to improve anytime soon.\u201d And, now, Meta has swooped in, pretty much overnight, with a huge new platform poised to gobble up Twitter\u2019s missing ad dollars and then some.</p><p>While this likely brings some satisfaction to Musk and Twitter\u2019s biggest critics, it\u2019s worth noting that there are significant implications to an online ecosystem where yet another Meta-owned platform dominates its closest rivals. Meta, and Instagram specifically, has very different norms and standards about what kind of speech is acceptable on its service. And there are still more questions than answers about Meta\u2019s plans to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/all-the-questions-we-still-have-about-threads-153059430.html\">integrate Threads</a> into the broader Fediverse.</p><p>But it\u2019s impossible to ignore just how much momentum Threads has gained in its first week, and how much of it has come at the direct expense of Twitter.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T14:00:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "UK launches in-depth investigation into Adobe's $20 billion Figma purchase", "description": "<p>Adobe is now facing tighter scrutiny of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/adobe-figma-acquisition-130937415.html\">$20 billion Figma acquisition</a>.

While a full-on passkey revolution may be a bit away, you may be asked to set one up for your accounts soon.</p><p>The username and password approach to logins dates <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/01/computer-password/\">back to the 1960s</a>. Ever since then, it's been hackable. Passwords are guessable or phishable, especially if you fail to meet <a href=\"https://www.auditboard.com/blog/nist-password-guidelines/\">industry standards</a> for a complex, strong password. For a while, the solution seemed to be multi-factor authentication, or a way to verify your identity at login via text message, app, hardware key or other methods. But passkey proponents are saying that solving login security problems means reinventing the first step, not adding on additional processes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u201cIt's the closest to something that can be scaled to get rid of passwords that we've ever seen,\u201d said Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at industry association FIDO Alliance. A passkey is a digital authentication credential that is securely stored on your device. Instead of what Shamas called a \u201cshared secret\u201d method of passwords, passkeys are a unique key pair for every online service you use bound to the domain. So, if you create one for your online banking account, and a spoofed website prompts you to sign in, the passkey won\u2019t work.</p><p>It also prevents phishing attacks because you can\u2019t give away your passkey like you can with a password or MFA phrase. We can\u2019t call it \u201cunphishable,\u201d said Derek Hanson, vice president of solutions architecture and alliances at security authentication company Yubico, but it certainly thwarts the common attack vectors used today. At the very least, it makes it much more costly and difficult for a hacker to get in, making the hackers likely to move on to weaker targets.</p><p>For the user, they\u2019re meant to be easier, too. Instead of trying to keep track of <a href=\"https://www.rackspace.com/blog/world-password-day-security-tips-2022\">nearly 100 passwords or more</a>, the passkey is stored on your device and connects automatically to the service. Similar to unlocking your phone, you\u2019ll need to enter a pin, fingerprint, face scan or other simple authentication to log in. It seems too good to be true, and it sort of is, because it's still a fragmented space. While the big names have made passkeys trend recently, they could also be holding back widespread use.</p><p>Currently, using a passkey locks you into a certain service provider, according to Sayonnha Mandal, Ph.D.,  lecturer at University of Nebraska Omaha. You can\u2019t, for example, log in to websites on an Android phone with a passkey stored on a MacBook. It\u2019s the kind of lock-in these companies tend to favor because it keeps customers loyal to their brand. So, it\u2019ll take cooperation and \u201cin the absence of a government industrial standard that everybody mandatorily has to adhere to, I don't think by themselves, the companies would.\u201d</p><p>But Shamas says that cross-platform accessibility is coming, as companies sign on to <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/\">FIDO\u2019s industry standards</a> for passkey development. \u201cThe deep investment across the industry (including Apple, Google, and Microsoft) to develop and evangelize the passkey technology speaks to the broad belief in its promise,\u201d said a Google spokesperson. At the time of publication, Google Chrome on Mac and Windows <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/supported-environments#:~:text=As%20of%20May%202023%2C%20Chrome,on%20the%20local%20device%20only.\">only stores passkeys on the local device</a>.</p><p>For now, if a website offers you a passkey login option, you should probably sign up. At least for your most sensitive accounts like online banking, make the switch to passkeys as soon as it's offered for an added layer of protection on those accounts, Mandal said. But, if passkeys do take over, it will be a slow transition. Services will likely still offer password options because it\u2019s what consumers are used to, and passkeys still don\u2019t have wide enough support.</p><p>In the meantime, it\u2019s a good reminder to stay on top of your security settings. If passkeys aren\u2019t available, make sure MFA is set up and your password is strong instead of just avoiding the security reminder pop-ups at log in.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T13:30:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best budget TVs and streaming gadgets for students", "description": "<p>Watching movies and TV shows on your laptop is the easiest way to binge watch media when you\u2019re an overworked student \u2013 but we think you deserve better.

Despite the tsunami of advancements generative AI systems have enjoyed in recent months, the synthetic assistants on our mobile devices <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-24-racial-bias-speech-recognition-siri-alexa-ai.html\">remain nearly as hard of hearing</a> as they were in 2011. A newly developed dataset from Meta AI, however, promises to improve the performance of such automatic speech recognition (ASR) tools by clustering speech at the \u201cutterance level.\u201d</p><p>Meta has long sought to improve its ASRs\u2019 performance, teaching them to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-speech-transcriptions-130005002.html\">train without the aid of transcripts</a>, recognize <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-open-source-speech-ai-recognizes-over-4000-spoken-languages-161508200.html\">more than 4,000 spoken languages</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai-is-already-better-at-lip-reading-that-we-are-183016968.html\">even read lips at a higher proficiency than human experts</a>. However, many of the datasets used to train ASR models are organized by demographic \u2014 age group, gender, nationality, English accent \u2014 which limit the variation of pronunciations that models are trained on,  ultimately hindering their function in understanding a broad cross section of users.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To get around this, Meta AI has developed a dataset that instead relies on an utterance clustering method. \u201cInstead of dividing a dataset based on speakers\u2019 demographic information \u2026 our proposed algorithm clusters speech at the utterance level,\u201d the Meta AI team explained in Wednesday\u2019s blog post. \u201cA single cluster will contain similar utterances from a diverse group of speakers. We can then train our model using the various clusters and use fairness datasets to measure how the model impacts outcomes across different demographic groups.\u201d</p><p>Meta\u2019s resulting dataset includes just over 27,000 command utterances collected from 595 paid US volunteers. Their utterances revolve around seven main themes \u2014 music, capture, utilities, notification control, messaging, calling and dictation \u2014 that other researchers can then use to train their own models and digital assistants on. Prompts included asking the speakers how they\u2019d voice search for a song or make plans with friends and deciding where to meet up.</p><p>To evaluate this new system, Meta first trained a model on publicly-available, English-language Facebook videos. Researchers then evaluated that model using two other datasets: Casual Conversations v1, which Meta released in 2021, and a \u201cde-identified dataset collected from a data supplier for ASR,\u201d which includes 48,000 spoken utterances from 867 individuals.</p><p>The initial results proved promising, with model performance improvements \u201con all demographic groups in our evaluation datasets, though by far the largest gains are with respect to more inclusivity of accents,\u201d per the blog. Overall, ASR performance increased by 10 percent using the clustering method, with large gains coming from the age 66-85 crowd as well, a traditionally underrepresented demographic in the voice command space.</p><p>\u201cOur proposed algorithm is part of Meta\u2019s long-term focus on responsible AI and just one part of our holistic approach to address fairness issues,\u201d the researchers wrote. Looking ahead, the team is exploring adapting the system to other languages.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-new-dataset-train-speech-recognition-engine-clusters-speaker-130012841.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/meta-new-dataset-train-speech-recognition-engine-clusters-speaker-130012841.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T13:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Calm is bringing sleep, meditation and relaxation shows to Spotify", "description": "<p>Calm is making a play for some of your time spent listening to songs and podcasts.

However, the Ally is a touch more expensive and there\u2019s a trade-off for all that extra performance, so is it really better than the device that reinvigorated the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html\">gaming handheld</a> category back in early 2022?</p><h2>Price</h2><p>At $700, the Ally appears to be way more expensive than the Steam Deck, which goes for as little as $400 (or even less during a sale). But because the Ally comes with a 512GB SSD, it\u2019s not really fair to compare it to Valve\u2019s $400 base model, which only has 64GB of onboard storage. I should also mention that a cheaper version of the Ally with a non-extreme version of the Z1 chip is due out sometime later this year, but that wasn\u2019t available for review.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>For now, a better comparison is a fully loaded Deck, which features the same amount of storage along with Valve\u2019s upgraded anti-glare etched screen, which is what I used for all my comparisons. Still, even at its most expensive, the Steam Deck costs $650, which is $50 cheaper than the Ally. For people on a budget, Valve\u2019s machine is the better option.</p><p>Another thing to consider is that unlike the Steam Deck, the Ally doesn\u2019t come with a case \u2013 which will run you an extra $40 from ASUS. And after lugging this thing around for a few weeks, I can definitely say you\u2019ll want some form of protection to prevent scratching the screen or putting too much pressure on the joysticks.</p><h2>Design and display</h2><figure><img alt=\"While both systems sport 7-inch displays, the ROG Ally lacks the Steam Deck's front-mounted touchpads. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3ede9bd0-20c0-11ee-bbff-9a926bf9e5dc\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Measuring 11 inches wide and weighing 1.34 pounds, the Ally has dimensions that appear quite similar to the Steam Deck. But those figures don\u2019t fully encapsulate how much smaller the ROG really is, because at 0.83 inches, it\u2019s half as thick as the Steam Deck. You also only get two rear paddles instead of four, and ASUS doesn't include little touchpads in front like Valve does, which may be a bit of a downer for anyone hoping to play traditional mouse-and-keyboard games.</p><p>That leaves you with a very familiar Xbox-style layout with two joysticks, a standard assortment of face buttons and shoulder triggers, as well as some extra shortcuts for quick settings and ASUS\u2019 Armoury Crate app. There\u2019s also a handy fingerprint sensor built into the power button, a volume rocker and a single USB-C port, which you can use on its own for data and charging, but also for hooking up <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnE5Cxr877ONhRH2QMPC3m4V5DcmzsxKiPG4RgtE2sE/edit\">ASUS\u2019 XG Mobile dock</a>. And just like the Steam Deck, the Ally has a microSD card slot for expandable storage, which is nice.</p><figure><img alt=\"Around back, the ROG Ally only has a single pair of rear paddles instead of two like you get on the Steam Deck. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/12a738f0-20c1-11ee-bf57-f205058946e8\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Overall, it\u2019s a very functional setup. All the controls are easy to reach and I haven\u2019t run into any issues with buttons getting stuck like I\u2019ve heard about from other users. I also appreciate how the Ally\u2019s smaller bezels make the device feel more compact, even if its 7-inch display is the same size as the Steam Deck\u2019s. The one thing I miss though is bigger grips in the back, because while I know ASUS was going for a slimmer frame, holding the Ally just doesn\u2019t feel quite as secure or comfortable.</p><p>As for its display, the Ally\u2019s screen is one of its best features. Not only is it a 120Hz panel, its 1080p resolution is also sharper than the Steam Deck\u2019s 800p. On top of that, the Ally is way more colorful and a touch brighter at around 475 nits versus closer to 400 nits on Valve\u2019s handheld. When viewed side by side, there\u2019s no competition \u2014 the Ally\u2019s screen pops with rich hues and sharper details, which really helps when you\u2019re trying to read small tooltips on a tiny screen.</p><figure><img alt=\"Thanks to its higher 1080p resolution, 120Hz refresh rate and brighter colors, the ROG Ally's screen is one of its best features. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3d08ade0-20c1-11ee-8fbf-109488627d09\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Without getting into a protracted debate about how much resolution you really need on a portable PC, the Steam Deck\u2019s lower-res and more washed-out-looking display has been one of my biggest complaints about the system since its launch so I\u2019m really happy with the Ally\u2019s panel, even if you can\u2019t always take full advantage of its 120Hz refresh rate in more demanding games.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>As for performance, the Ally has a significant leg up over the Steam Deck, as it sports AMD\u2019s new Z1 Extreme APU and 16GB of RAM. Unfortunately, out of the gate, the Ally\u2019s performance is pretty underwhelming. With both the Ally and the Steam Deck set to 15 watts, framerates were very similar. In <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 720p and high settings, the Ally averaged 43 fps while the Steam Deck hit 42 fps, so they were basically neck and neck. It was a nearly identical situation in <em>Cyberpunk 2077, </em>where both systems hit 44 fps at 720p on medium. Frankly, that\u2019s not very impressive for fancy new silicon and really far off some of the claims ASUS made the Ally pre-launch.</p><figure><img alt=\"The ROG Ally's AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU offers a significant advantage in performance compared to the STeam Deck's older silicon.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/72bdea90-20c1-11ee-affe-70028578c415\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But then I updated the system to install the new drivers and firmware ASUS released two weeks after launch (which took more than a couple of install and restart cycles) and that\u2019s when the Ally started to distinguish itself. With the system fully updated, framerates jumped by 15 to 25 percent, and the Ally started to hit 54 fps in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> and 50 fps in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at the same settings.</p><p>That\u2019s a noticeable improvement, but it gets even better. While the Steam Deck tops out at 15 watts, the Ally has a Turbo mode that boosts total power draw to 25 watts, or 30 watts if you\u2019re plugged in. With the 25-watt Turbo mode activated, I was able to get 60 fps in <em>Tomb Raider</em> and 67 fps in <em>Cyberpunk</em>, which is impressive for a handheld PC. So even though the Ally doesn\u2019t even come close to offering double the performance of the Steam Deck like ASUS initially boasted, for people who want big power in a portable device, the Ally is the easy pick.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><figure><img alt=\"THe ROG Ally's USB-C port can be used on its own for data and charging, but it also functions as part of ASUS' XG Mobile connector which can be used to attach an external dock/GPU. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/f94db360-20c1-11ee-9f5c-da73438651b2\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, with all that oomph comes diminished endurance. In general, I found that the Ally typically only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours depending on the title. Meanwhile, the Steam Deck often gives you two and a half to four hours, or even longer for less demanding fare. To put that into perspective, I played <em>Diablo IV</em> on both machines at medium settings, starting at 100 percent and I didn\u2019t stop until they died. The Ally conked out at one hour and 31 minutes compared to 2:07 for the Steam Deck. And let\u2019s not forget, <em>Diablo IV</em> doesn\u2019t have native Linux support, so the Steam Deck runs it in an emulation layer which uses some extra power. In short, if you really care about getting the longest-lasting handheld PC, the Steam Deck is it.</p><h2>Sound</h2><p>As for audio, the Ally has some rather punchy front-firing stereo speakers, which sound a lot better than what you\u2019d typically get on a similarly priced laptop. But to me the more impressive thing is what you don\u2019t hear: fans blaring in the background. I\u2019m not entirely sure what kind of voodoo ASUS did, but the Ally is surprisingly quiet. It barely registers above a whisper while running benchmarks, and when compared to the whiny whir that\u2019s almost always coming out of my Steam Deck, the Ally is definitely the more family-friendly device. I can game on it while watching TV with my wife without her needing to turn up the volume (or worse, taking the console from me) and that\u2019s a small but important way to maintain a happy home.</p><h2>Software</h2><figure><img alt=\"ASUS' Armoury Crate app serves as a both a game launcher and a place to tweak various settings and features. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2d3ed1e0-20c2-11ee-9ccf-d781f35b0886\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The last major difference between the Ally and the Steam Deck is their software. Instead of going with something like Valve\u2019s Linux-based OS, ASUS went with Windows 11. The idea was to ensure that the system works with all the major online game stores like Steam, Battle.net, Epic and more, which it does. On top of that, ASUS tweaked its Armoury Crate app to serve as a game launcher, while also letting you adjust various settings or RGB lighting. One tap on the dedicated button lets you see all of your installed titles at a glance, while a push of ASUS\u2019s other shortcut key brings up a menu for quick settings like operating modes, game profiles, and more.</p><p>The issue is that when you\u2019re not using Armoury Crate, Windows 11 still feels clunky. Microsoft\u2019s OS simply isn\u2019t designed for smaller devices without keyboards that often have to rely on touch controls. ASUS has included a desktop mode toggle that lets you use the right joystick to move your mouse and the right shoulder buttons to click. But that feels more like a band-aid than a real solution, which would probably be a purpose-built gaming UI.</p><figure><img alt=\"Because of the Ally's sleeker design, its rear grips aren't quite as prominent or easy to hold as the Steam Deck's. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/966cc8c0-20c2-11ee-af6b-5d68f1f57b3d\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>More importantly, even though the Ally can run basically every Windows game ever made, the experience isn\u2019t always smooth. For example, when I tried to play <em>Street Fighter 6, </em>the<em>&nbsp;</em>game booted up in Windowed mode and cut off the bottom of the UI, so I couldn\u2019t see the navigation menu. But even after I sorted that out, the game still ran poorly. At medium settings, I was getting just 20 fps which made the game run in slow-mo. I had to spend the next 10 minutes fiddling with graphics settings. Meanwhile, on the Steam Deck, I got a consistent 60 fps from the jump, which was a big surprise since I was not expecting a game that has only been out for a month to be this well-optimized on Linux.</p><p>There\u2019s a flipside to this, though. While you <em>can</em> install games like <em>Diablo IV</em> that aren\u2019t available on Steam and aren\u2019t Deck Verified, it can be a real chore to get them up and running. You have to install the Battle.net launcher, manually change the Steam Deck\u2019s compatibility mode and then add it as a non-Steam Game. <em>Then </em>you have to install <em>Diablo IV</em> itself, change its compatibility mode and manually add that to Steam\u2019s library too. And that\u2019s skipping a lot of the more complicated steps in between. Granted, there are a ton of how-to\u2019s online to guide you through the process. But if this is your first time trying this on Linux, you\u2019re looking at spending 10 to 15 minutes at least. There\u2019s no just sitting down and hitting play. In contrast, getting <em>D4</em> to run on the Ally is a breeze and even though the game runs relatively well on both systems, there are fewer hitches and stutters on ASUS\u2019 machine.</p><p>Overall, Steam OS is generally easier to use \u2014 until you run into a game that isn\u2019t Deck Verified or just doesn\u2019t run on Linux, which is where the Ally has the advantage.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"Thankfully, I never ran into any issues with sticky buttons as I heard about from other users. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/5fbe10e0-20c2-11ee-be7d-a2f7ee1081df\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>After testing both devices side-by-side, I\u2019ve got a few takeaways. The first is that I\u2019m even more impressed with the Steam Deck now than I was at launch. Over the past year and change, Valve has put a ton of work into polishing and optimizing it. I don\u2019t think any gadget in recent memory has gotten as many updates as this thing. And now that there are over 10,000 Steam Deck-verified games, its library ain\u2019t shabby. We\u2019re at the point where you can play new AAA titles like <em>Street Fighter 6</em> on day one, while other games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are getting custom graphics settings specifically for the Deck so you don\u2019t need to spend a ton of time tweaking performance. But most importantly, with a starting price of $400, the Steam Deck is the easy pick if you\u2019re on a budget.</p><p>As for the ROG Ally, simply calling it a more powerful Steam Deck doesn\u2019t feel quite right. Thanks to its AMD Z1 Extreme chip, it definitely has an edge in performance. But for all that speed, there\u2019s a big trade-off in battery life. Even with both systems running at 15 watts, the Steam Deck lasted longer every time, which means the Ally isn\u2019t always the best companion on longer trips. You also don\u2019t get built-in touchpads or as many rear paddles. And while you can run basically any game ever made on it, Windows 11 just isn\u2019t as well-optimized for handheld systems as Steam OS. Valve has a big advantage thanks to being in charge of both software and hardware design for its device. However, while I like and appreciate the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally\u2019s gorgeous screen and super quiet fans would always have me looking over my shoulder like the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/distracted-boyfriend\">distracted boyfriend meme</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"The ROG Ally comes with an included power adapter and a somewhat flimsy but still useful stand. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/76453200-20c0-11ee-bef7-3089c8fb16b0\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So which one should you get? To answer that, you need to decide what kind of gamer you are. Thanks to Steam OS, the Steam Deck offers a simpler, more console-like experience, so long as your games have been verified to play nicely on Valve\u2019s software. Meanwhile, if you like to tinker with settings and want higher framerates and a sharper display, the Ally might be the machine for you. It\u2019s also the more portable of the two, and ASUS\u2019 XG Mobile dock lets you plug it into a monitor and other accessories so you can use it as a desktop when you want. But with prices for those starting north of $1,000, it\u2019ll cost you.</p><p>The biggest unknown is how well ASUS is going to support the Ally, because as we\u2019ve seen with the Steam Deck, hardware can only take you so far without regular updates. Unfortunately, there just isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all handheld PC gaming console right now, so picking the right device depends on your preferences for OS, performance, battery life and more. But regardless of which one you pick, there\u2019s a lot to like about the latest generation of handheld PCs, and I hope this is only the beginning of a long line of compelling devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-review-the-steam-decks-most-powerful-rival-specs-price-080029032.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-review-the-steam-decks-most-powerful-rival-specs-price-080029032.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T12:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "iOS 17 preview: FaceTime, everywhere", "description": "<p>Apple just launched its iOS 17 public beta, meaning you can test out the latest iPhone software if you\u2019re willing to live with a bug or two. I\u2019ve been using iPhone 14 Pro with the developer beta for the last few weeks and there are plenty of features and upgrades to dig into. While some of the more exciting features weren\u2019t available until mere days ago, some nice quality-of-life improvements are here from the get-go. If you\u2019re intrigued by Apple\u2019s new Journal app, though, I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t arrive until later in the year.</p><p>But if you want machine learning to transcribe your friends' voice notes, or turn your iPhone into a smart display, then you might be willing to dip your toe into the public beta. You can access the iOS preview by <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2JldGEuYXBwbGUuY29tL3NwL2JldGFwcm9ncmFtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMGE1YjFiYy1kYmI1LTRjZDEtYmYxNS1jMjgzN2JjNzAzNmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbXzld8GWvyGCvsmdueXj1gH84aEG1UsUmVauRCX7Cyi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbeta.apple.com%2Fsp%2Fbetaprogram&amp;uuid=jGs4N9TQxRnRARsR0122\">enrolling on Apple\u2019s website</a>, which will nudge the beta to your iPhone\u2019s Software Update section.

(iOS 17 will work on 2018\u2019s iPhone XS and newer devices.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2><strong>A note on Developer betas</strong></h2><p>This year, instead of releasing the iOS 17 public beta in July, Apple released its developer beta for iOS, iPadOS and macOS Sonoma for anyone with free developer accounts. Normally, to access betas right after the WWDC keynote you\u2019d have to pay $100 a year for a paid developer account. This means anyone (yes, even you) could have dabbled with this early build starting in early June. Not that we\u2019d advise doing that. Early releases of iOS, including its public beta that\u2019s out now, are often rough around the edges, while apps are prone to restarting or not working as they should on Apple\u2019s very latest mobile OS. The developer version is that, times five.</p><h2><strong>Messages and FaceTime</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/9583b2f0-215f-11ee-bbdd-b1195c4900c8\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo taken by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple continues tugging me toward Messages, yet I\u2019m stuck with WhatsApp because all of my friends and family are on it \u2014 even those with iPhones. iOS continues to make being a WhatsApp user a challenging decision to stick with.</p><p>I\u2019m already in love with audio message transcription. The next time that certain friend leaves a lengthy 12-minute monologue, the iPhone\u2019s machine learning tricks will auto-transcribe the contents of that voice note, audio quality (and accent) permitting. In my experience, it was accurate with both my British voice and my colleague Cherlynn\u2019s  American accent.</p><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/65635610-2160-11ee-addd-117c0dce433e\" style=\"height: 1868px; width: 3321px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Most of Messages\u2019 biggest upgrades are siloed away behind the plus button, which helps keep the interface tidy. Check-In is Apple\u2019s take on automating the \u201ctext me when you get home,\u201d doing half the work once your iPhone detects you\u2019ve returned. If your phone detects that you\u2019re not headed in the right direction, Check In will even notify you that you might have made a mistake.</p><p>Apple has integrated a lot of settings to make Check In work how you want it to. You can use it when your destination isn\u2019t your home, or even set it up for a timed period when perhaps you\u2019re home alone, but are expecting visitors. More information from your phone can be shared when you're delayed, including battery levels and signal levels.</p><p>Apple has now consolidated its stickers into one drawer, encompassing live stickers, memoji, emoji and third-party stickers. Live Stickers, which you can make by tapping to \u2018lift\u2019 subjects out of photos (it can still be a person, a pet or an object, as long as it\u2019s visually distinct enough), get archived in their own sticker drawer. With iOS 17, you can also apply some sticker effects, like \u201cshiny\u201d and \u201cpuffy\u201d that undulate when you move your phone, taking us back to pencil cases of the \u201890s. Or maybe that\u2019s just me. Beyond Messages, stickers can be applied directly from the sticker drawer to your photos and documents.</p><p>FaceTime has received a few updates this year, but the most notable one is video voicemail. While you could send videos on Messages, you can now leave spontaneous video (or voice) messages in FaceTime when someone doesn\u2019t pick up your call. In iOS 17, thanks to further refinement of Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-continuity-webcam-iphone-mac-facetime-184540330.html\">Continuity Camera</a>, across Apple devices. You can now display your FaceTime video calls on Apple TV, tapping into the cameras already in your iPhones, iPads or MacBooks. Any recorded messages you receive will be stored in FaceTime\u2019s Recent tab, along with your missed calls. You can even take FaceTime calls \u2014 audio-only \u2014 on your Apple Watch.</p><p>You can record FaceTime video messages through both the front and rear cameras and amp up the visual pizazz with Portrait mode and Studio Light. Apple has opened up these video effects to Zoom, Microsoft Teams and more. Gesture-based AR effects are along for the ride too, including fireworks (two thumbs up), confetti cannons (double peace signs) and when you make a devil horn sign? Laser beams. Of\u2026 course. I soon learned you\u2019ll have to hold these poses for a little too long in order for your iPhone to recognize and trigger the AR effect. It\u2019s a delight when they happen, though.</p><h2><strong>StandBy</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/21b50292-215d-11ee-bfff-03d0bf6ea3eb\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple hasn\u2019t launched a smart display (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-smart-home-devices-report-155130684.html\">yet</a>), so it\u2019s making your iPhone into one. With StandBy, you'll get a different view when your phone is horizontal and charging. This consists of widgets, calendar info, music, your photos, news, sports scores and more. If you have an iPhone 14 Pro, it\u2019ll always be visible due to the always-on display. You\u2019ll have to tap to wake it on other devices.</p><p>Itl even transitions into a low-light smart display later at night so you can use it as an alarm clock. Given the strides Apple has made with its widgets on iPhones and Apple Watch, I\u2019m intrigued to see whether this is a useful new feature for when I\u2019m not actively using my iPhone. I\u2019ve loved seeing my photos on my Nest Hub, but let\u2019s be honest \u2013 I\u2019m looking at, and nearer to, my phone, pretty much most of the day. The iPhone will automatically separate your photos into places (and its own photography) and people recognized in your own contacts. You\u2019ll also get music and podcast controls for audio playback, which looks a lot like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-reveals-plans-to-allow-users-to-pay-for-gas-directly-in-carplay-161550082.html\">CarPlay</a>.</p><p>Apple has folded its Smart Stacks into these StandBy widgets, so you can swipe between smart home controls, calendars, weather and more, customizing what information is a swipe away. Incoming calls will also feature a nice landscape version of iOS 17\u2019s new Contact Posters.</p><h2><strong>Contact Posters</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/21b4db80-215d-11ee-bf9f-df4de77ce6f1\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Contact Posters are the most significant visual upgrade to iOS 17. It\u2019s a new way to show your contact\u2019s incoming calls, contact profiles, FaceTime and Messages. You can edit your profile from the top left corner of most of those native apps, mixing together different fonts, photos, and color options \u2013 I like the monochrome photo filter paired with a pop of color, like it\u2019s a fictional magazine profile headshot. There are almost infinite options here, and it does help to make calls from your favorite people seem, somehow, more glamorous. You don\u2019t have to have taken photos in portrait mode either to make the cutout outline of your head and name; as long as the iPhone detects the object, like stickers, it\u2019ll do the rest.</p><h2><strong>NameDrop</strong></h2><p>This has been a long-time coming, right? NameDrop, using the same AirDrop transferring tech, can share your contact details (and your gorgeous new Contact Poster) just by bringing two devices close together. You can fine-tune what contact details are shared, like your work or personal email, or even choose to receive only. Photos and even links on Safari can also be shared through this method, and AirDrop will even continue transferring content even if you step away, through the internet. This is all done through the usual share button on both native and compatible third-party apps.</p><h2><strong>Everything else</strong></h2><p>If you recall from Apple\u2019s WWDC keynote last month, these are just some of the major highlights of what iOS 17 has to offer. Apple says its enhanced keyboard language model ushers in an improved Autocorrect, while any corrections should also be easier to fix. Any autocorrected words are temporarily underlined so you know what was changed. If you tap on an autocorrected word, you\u2019ll see the original version pop up and you can tap it to put it back. Duck yes.</p><p>Regarding voice assistant Siri, it can now handle back-to-back commands if you want to both set a timer and turn off a smart light. Siri can also be summoned even while you\u2019re on a call with someone.</p><p>The Fitness app now has a trophy case to show off your best workout runs, custom workout plans if you pay for Fitness+ and the ability to adjust the sound mix of workouts, prioritizing either music or trainers\u2019 voices. Meanwhile, News+ subscribers will now be able to tackle crosswords, while News+ audio stories will now also be available in the podcast app.</p><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/95838be0-215f-11ee-b7fd-96b1055c77ac\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo taken by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Inline predictive text, a la Gmail, is also built in, so iOS will occasionally nudge your messages along with predictive single- and multi-word additions before you even type them. Thankfully, it\u2019s a very light touch so far. Then again, maybe it\u2019s just learning how I type \u2013 I\u2019ll circle back once the OS officially launches in the fall. And you can turn it off in settings if it\u2019s not working for you.</p><h2><strong>What\u2019s still to come</strong></h2><p>The iOS 17 beta gives you a taste of what\u2019s coming to your iPhone later this year. There are a few tempting features not available to test just yet. That includes the third-party journaling app killer, Apple\u2019s own Journal app,. Where you can \u201cwrite about and reflect on everyday moments and special events in your life.\u201d The company says it\u2019ll tap into on-device machine learning to personalize what you might like to write about, including photos, locations, music and even workout data. I\u2019m waiting to see how it all works in practice. And if you\u2019re going to be writing about your deepest, darkest thoughts and feelings, you will be able to lock your Journal from prying eyes.</p><p>There are other features I\u2019m still waiting to try, including new auto-generated song suggestions for your own existing playlists and Conversation Awareness, which is coming to second-generation AirPods Pro. When you start talking to someone while still wearing your buds, the device will lower playback volume and enhance the voice of people in front of you, while still minimizing background noise.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/21b50290-215d-11ee-b7f3-bb2475abb87e\" style=\"height: 2400px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Yes, there are still a few mysteries to iOS 17 ahead of its full launch, but plenty to test out in the beta. I\u2019m still getting to grips with StandBy. It might not be a smart display killer, but it\u2019s possibly a free alternative. Other highlights include a revitalized FaceTime experience, a streamlined Messages app and a long-overdue solution for sharing contact details. But some of the most exciting parts are still to come, making this a less essential beta than some recent years. Most of us can wait for the fully-formed public release, arriving later this summer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ios-17-preview-public-beta-facetime-standby-iphone-120025938.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ios-17-preview-public-beta-facetime-standby-iphone-120025938.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-13T12:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta could soon make its AI model available for commercial projects", "description": "<p>One question is constant in the race to create AI: Should code be held privately or made available to everyone as &quot;open-source&quot;?

In April, the website started <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-putting-labels-on-tweets-with-restricted-reach-201509292.html\">limiting the reach of tweets</a> violating its hateful conduct policy and applying a label to them that reads: &quot;Visibility limited: this tweet may violate Twitter's rules against hateful conduct.&quot; Apparently, Twitter has applied the label to more than 700,000 posts since then and has proactively prevented ads from appearing adjacent to those content.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also said that the label reduces the reach of a post by 81 percent, thereby effectively limiting the visibility of posts that potentially exhibit hateful conduct. In addition, Twitter revealed in its update that more than one-third of users choose to delete labeled tweets themselves once they've been notified that they have violated the website's policy and only four percent of authors have appealed labels.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html\">charging for API access</a> means most researchers studying hate speech can't independently verify these claims. But Twitter is clearly claiming that its approach has been effective so far. In fact, the website is pushing through with its plan to expand its labels and include more types of policy violations. According to its announcement, it will now also label and downrank posts that violate its <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior\">Abusive Behavior</a> and <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech\">Violent Speech</a> policies. Tweets that will be labeled in the coming weeks include posts with malicious content targeting individuals, those that encourage others to harass an individual or group of people, those that threaten to inflict physical harm on others, and tweets that encourage others to commit acts of violence or harm.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"9742a37097354979adcbe1f3de680263\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We remain committed to maintaining free speech on Twitter, while equally maintaining the health of our platform.
