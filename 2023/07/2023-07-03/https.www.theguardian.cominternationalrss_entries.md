<p>The Wimbledon champion switched from Russia to represent their ambitious neighbours and inspire a new generation</p><p>As the final days of high school beckoned for Elena Rybakina five years ago, she found herself at a crossroads in her life. Rybakina had enjoyed a strong junior career that saw her reach No 3 in the world, but she still had to decide whether to throw herself into the meat grinder of professional tennis or take up one of the countless scholarship offers she received from universities across the United States.</p><p>Despite her junior pedigree, Rybakina had received no financial support from her home country – Russia – and her parents did not have the funds to finance the prohibitively expensive lifestyle of an aspiring professional tennis player. Her elders were naturally more set on the least risky option.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/03/elena-rybakina-kazakhstan-tennis-wimbledon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The culture of English cricket is but one concept of morality – no person, and certainly no country, has a monopoly on virtue</p><p>So let’s talk about Nepal v Ireland in the Oman Quadrangular Twenty20 series last year. Ireland are 114 for eight in the 19th over when the ball is hit towards mid-on. The Oman bowler Kamal Singh lunges at it in his follow-through. At the same time the Ireland non-striker, Andy McBrine, tries to scamper through for a single. The pair collide. McBrine falls over. Singh keeps his balance, and tosses the ball to the wicketkeeper Aasif Sheikh, with the batter still sprawled on the turf, miles out of his ground.</p><p>The laws of cricket have nothing to say on situations such as this. Neither player is deliberately obstructing the other; neither player can avoid the collision without giving up a significant sporting advantage. Sheikh is perfectly at liberty to complete the run-out. But he does not. He holds on to the ball and lets McBrine complete the single, an act of sporting goodwill that will later earn him the International Cricket Council’s Spirit of Cricket award.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/03/cricket-ashes-england-australia-jonny-bairstow">Continue reading...</a>

## Shabu review – vivid, magical celebration of an irrepressible teen hustler

<p>This documentary channels its titular character’s jubilant vitality as we watch him spend a summer raising the cash to pay back his grandmother after he pranged her car</p><p>Documentary maker Shamira Raphaëla was on the eve of shooting a film about four teenagers on <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Peperklip">Rotterdam’s De Peperklip estate</a> (so-named for its distinctive shape like an opened-out paperclip) when one of her subjects asked to drop out. This is Sharonio “Shabu” Abisoina, a larger-than-life 14-year-old Dutch-Surinamese wannabe rapper, who was in the doghouse after crashing his grandmother’s car. Rather than let him go, Raphaëla used this incident as the launch-pad for a celebration of Shabu that is every bit as jubilant and irrepressible as he is. Largely favouring low angles, the better to gaze up with awe at him and his cohort, Raphaëla follows him through the summer as he struggles to raise €1,200 to pay for the damage before his grandmother, first seen scolding him on Skype, returns from Suriname. After hawking popsicles to neighbours, he hits on the idea of charging two euros a head for a block party, complete with dancers and DJs.</p><p>Shabu may be joyous but he is easily distracted, drumming restlessly on any surface he can find, messing up the simplest errands (sent out for toilet rolls, he comes back with steak) or announcing, “I’m going to be famous!” to anyone who’ll listen. Most of his life is spent juggling time with his bestie, Jahnoa, and his “wifey”, Stephany, as he tries to balance their competing demands. Without ever labouring the point, the film shows this overgrown kid, who raps about being “a little boy from Peperklip”, learning how to be an adult.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/03/shabu-review-vivid-magical-celebration-of-an-irrepressible-teen-hustler">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Locked in a death spiral’: the state of the NHS at 75

<p>Doctors and senior hospital figures – as well as the official statistics – paint a bleak picture. But is there cause for hope?</p><p>Dr Nick Scriven can pinpoint the exact day he realised the NHS could no longer cope. “I first noticed it when I was on call on New Year’s Day 2012. We ran out of beds in our hospital. As a result medical patients had to occupy the beds in a surgical ward meant for people with broken bones waiting to have planned orthopaedic surgery.</p><p>“We’d always had ‘outliers’, the occasional medical patient who’d ended up in a surgical bed. But this was the first time cases like that had ended up taking over almost all the 30 beds on the orthopaedic ward. This went on for a month and was a massive stress for everyone as we’d never had to cope with this amount of patients being looked after elsewhere before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/03/locked-in-a-death-spiral-state-of-the-nhs-at-75">Continue reading...</a>
