Peterson discusses the new film \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d with star Jim Caviezel and real life inspiration Tim Ballard. The film details Ballard\u2019s work as a Special Agent to fight against sex trafficking and the child sex trade. They go into depth on the psychology of pedophilia, the nature of good and evil, and how a steady faith in God has guided all three.\n\nTim Ballard is the founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.), which locates and rescues endangered children victimized by sex trafficking rings.  Previously, he accrued a decade of experience as a Special Agent in the Dept. of Homeland Security, working as an undercover op for the U.S. Child Sex Tourism Jump Team.\n\nJim Caviezel is a prominent American actor and household name in no small part for his portrayal of Jesus Christ in \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d (sequel coming in 2024). He has had a decades long career both on and off screen, and is an advocate for faith in the modern world.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Hallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor \"Sound of Freedom\"\n\nWebsite & Showtimes https://www.angel.com/tickets/sound-of-freedom?variation=july_3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw44mlBhAQEiwAqP3eVnIIADwWMUdV6MjV99Y3Zw2oyCtO0W8OFgNZM7-M6SYBGjxqo7ABqhoCXlAQAvD_BwE&amp;zip=49090&amp;date=2023-07-03 \n\n\nFor Tim Ballard: \n\nO.U.R Website https://ourrescue.org/about-us?gad=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw44mlBhAQEiwAqP3eVqV_6rYPxwLItz-4eRgxqml0g6rQo_nxKsMRxsU_nLFlaGJlnzLQIBoC-WYQAvD_BwE \n\nTwitter @TimBallard https://twitter.com/TimBallard \n\n\nFor Jim Caviezel:\n\nTwitter @JimmyCaviezel https://twitter.com/jimmycaviezel?lang=ar\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:34) Intro\n(2:43) The magnitude of the modern slave trade\n(6:31) Addressing criticism\n(9:23) Organ and blood trade\n(12:17) Slate and dishonest journalism\n(15:36) Why Jim Caviezel joined \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d cast\n(18:33) Schindler\u2019s List, making the film now instead of 50 years too late\n(21:49) Particularizing the problem\n(22:45) The real story they based the film on\n(26:45) How Tim Ballard became a Special Agent\n(30:00) What you deal with when assigned to a child sex crimes unit\n(33:17) Tragedy and malevolence, the need for a moral narrative\n(37:33) Cain and Able, the two pathways to adaptation\n(40:10) Psychology of pedophilia, progressing the fantasy\n(44:21) The face of evil is not always obvious\n(49:07) How the monsters justify themselves\n(51:01) How Jim studied for the role, the Unabomber\n(54:50) You don\u2019t go to the devil to play the devil\n(56:04) Milton\u2019s Satan, characterizing evil\n(58:35) Truth and good through scripture\n(59:43) The Shroud of Turin\n(1:00:33) The black holes that actors enter for their work\n(1:02:03) More people are afraid of the Devil then they are of God\n(1:04:40) To become as a child, innocence in the face of evil\n(1:08:17) The Passion is an archetypal story, decent and rebirth\n(1:10:38) When you face your maker, the paths you choose to take\n(1:14:03) The reason people lie, and what happens when you tell the truth\n(1:16:40) The price for truth, sacrificing security\n(1:19:21) When the new path clears, opportunity and reward\n(1:23:45) Tony Robbins, connections that change the world\n(1:25:12) Why Tim Ballard won\u2019t be silenced, spiritual warfare\n(1:27:22) Chloe Cole\n(1:29:04) The next chapter, sequels in the works\n(1:30:00) Fighting for theaters\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTBGNEliczc", "date_published": "2023-07-03T15:00:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
