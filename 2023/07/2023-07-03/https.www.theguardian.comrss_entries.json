We have a knack for making civil unrest sound completely massive yet utterly trivial, a threat to civilisation and yet, at the same time, entirely powered by TikTok. The Foreign Office never went so far as to advise against travel to France, merely noting that there were riots, and that you should stay away from rioters. But even if it had, I would just have assumed the civil servants had spent too much time listening to Radio 4.</p><p>Mr Z and I have just had a few days in France. The first night in Paris, we saw nothing except some broken glass. A barmaid described in granular detail where the riots had been the night before, but it didn\u2019t sound at all like a warning, more like a tour guide disappointed that you\u2019d missed the northern lights. On the second day, we unintentionally passed through Marseille, having missed a train going elsewhere. The superiority of French trains is so pronounced it has become unmentionable, like having a sibling who is much more intelligent than you. Don\u2019t think about it \u2013 it\u2019ll just make you sad. But seriously, the train we missed was going a distance equivalent to London to Inverness. If we\u2019d missed that at home, we wouldn\u2019t have arrived for another four days. \u201cTo get the most out of this experience, I need to miss more trains,\u201d was my take-home, and I did take it home because we also missed the train back.

Voices and instruments cautiously creep outwards from a low B-flat, nervously circling around a few notes. The music gropes its way along, spreading, bifurcating and expanding to fill the sonic space. In no time, it has grown into a complex, teeming mass of sound. This music is the Kyrie from Hungarian composer Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqrJmxy4q3A\">1965 Requiem</a>, a Latin mass for the dead written by a Jew whose father and brother were murdered in Hitler\u2019s death camps.

Each admired the other\u2019s work and, perhaps, recognised their shared brand of near pathological perfectionism.

There are the texts between various Trump underlings and Walt Nauta, the Trump body man who has also been indicted, showing the president directing his employees to move the boxes containing classified information back and forth to various locations around his properties in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey. There is the annoyed missive from Trump\u2019s wife Melania, trying to make sure the boxes don\u2019t crowd out room for her luggage on a private plane. There is the claim from Trump\u2019s former attorney, compelled to testify against him in an unusual arrangement, that the former president suggested, with a Grinch-like pinching gesture, that the lawyer destroy confidential documents to prevent them from being produced in a subpoena. There is a text message Nauta sent to another Trump underling, showing a box having fallen over in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago, secret documents spilling on to the floor \u2013 whoops.</p><p>What there is not, conspicuously, is a motive. Over the course of more than a year following his departure from office, it appears that Trump spent considerable effort and resources in transporting the documents with him and keeping them near at hand \u2013 and that later, as the federal government began to demand the boxes back, that he then went out of his way to keep and conceal them, going to great length, sparing no expense, and ultimately breaking the law so much that he incurred himself a series of felony charges. Anyone can tell you how this behavior is typical of Trump: how it reflects his pettiness, his contempt for the law, his willingness to sacrifice and endanger others.

Since your wife has been \u201cindulging\u201d you in that for many years, it is far more likely that this shift in her behaviour is due to some other problem or problems. These could be relational in nature \u2013 such as a growing underlying anger or resentment about something she feels is unfair \u2013 or perhaps she is going through something physical, such as hormonal changes. Going back to counselling is essential because you have clearly reached an impasse that is not going to be resolved without help. You need to begin talking to each other again in a useful manner, and you may still have some work to do on the self-hatred you feel regarding your relatively common fetish. Some partners who join in fetishistic behaviour simply to please their partner can understandably start to feel resentment if they are not able to experience their preferred vanilla style at least part of the time, so it is possible there may be a need for renegotiations about that.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

Nature is wild, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Founded in 1994, Tinkers Bubble is England\u2019s leading off-grid woodland community: an experiment in rural living that provides low-impact dwellings and a land-based livelihood to a changing roster of 16 residents. In April, it was granted permanent planning permission by South Somerset council, an achievement heralded as a landmark in off-grid communities\u2019 long attempts to be accepted by mainstream Britain (and its planning department mandarins). They celebrated this success in May with song and home-brewed cider. \u201cThough we\u2019re not big drinkers,\u201d Willoughby says, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re usually back in our cabins with a book by 8pm.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/03/the-rise-of-woodland-off-gridders-it-makes-more-sense-than-a-nine-to-five\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/03/the-rise-of-woodland-off-gridders-it-makes-more-sense-than-a-nine-to-five", "date_published": "2023-07-03T09:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018They found ways to do the impossible\u2019: Hipgnosis, the designers who changed the record sleeve for ever", "description": "<p>Control director Anton Corbijn\u2019s new film tells the chaotic, tragic story of the creative duo behind some of the most recognisable covers of all time</p><p>Only at the end of our interview does it dawn on both of us that Anton Corbijn has been sitting in front of his huge vinyl record collection at his home in Amsterdam the whole time.

The Indian economy has quadrupled in size in a generation. Its ancient reputation as a centre for mathematics and scientific skills remains intact, and Indian software engineers increasingly dominate Silicon Valley. India now has the largest population in the world and is clearly on its way to becoming the third economic superpower. Its economy overtook the UK last autumn and will overtake Germany and Japan within the next decade. The only questions are whether it is the US, China or India that will dominate the world by the end of this century, and what sort of India that will be.</p><p>Little of this would have surprised our ancestors who first sailed to India with the East India Company at the time of Shakespeare.

So why is the final building a modest potting shed? </p><p>A stubbly thatched roof pokes up above a hedge in a field on the outskirts of a small town in south-west Germany, the latest arrival to an unlikely scene of experimental structures dotted around the landscape. Nearby the futuristic profile of a geodesic dome rises, along with the folded aluminium shell of a modernist petrol station and the pitched wooden roof of a 1960s Japanese house. Across another field, there is a gigantic helter-skelter, a jagged concrete fire station and what looks like a teetering stack of supersized Monopoly houses, as well as a number of large industrial sheds that jiggle and jive with their own distinctive architectural ambitions.<br /><br />Welcome to the <a href=\"https://www.vitra.com/en-gb/about-vitra/campus\">Vitra Campus</a>, a fun-filled home to a furniture factory on the edge of Weil am Rhein, at the southern tip of the Black Forest, which has evolved into a curious petting zoo of Pritzker prize-winning architects over the last 40 years. It is where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-gehry\">Frank Gehry</a> built his first building outside the US, where Tadao Ando realised his first project outside Japan, and where the late Zaha Hadid completed her first ever building at all, when it looked like her gravity-defying visions might never leave the canvas. Among them stand works by \u00c1lvaro Siza, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/renzo-piano\">Renzo Piano</a>, Nicholas Grimshaw, Buckminster Fuller, Jean Prouv\u00e9, Herzog &amp; de Meuron, Sanaa and more, forming a who\u2019s who of starchitects against the foothills of the Alps.<br /><br />The man with the architectural addiction, who took a chance on these sometimes untested names, is Vitra chairman emeritus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/jun/06/features.magazine37\">Rolf Fehlbaum</a>. A softly spoken 82-year-old with a low-key, unassuming manner and thick black spectacles, he cuts an improbable figure as a Medici of 21st-century design. After decades of daring commissions, he has just completed what looks to be his final building on the site \u2013 and it couldn\u2019t be further from what has come before.</p><p>\u201cWe are now on a completely different trip,\u201d he tells me, looking out at the Tane Garden House, an enigmatic thatched hut raised on little stone legs, designed by the 43-year-old Paris-based Japanese architect <a href=\"https://at-ta.fr/\">Tsuyoshi Tane</a>. \u201cIt is the first building we have made with full awareness of the climate crisis. Over the years we knew, of course, but we didn\u2019t really care. We destroyed this natural landscape by building an industrial site. Now I want to let nature take it back.\u201d<br /><br />Fehlbaum and his brother, Raymond, inherited the Vitra company from their mother and father, Erika and Willi, in 1977. Their parents had established the business in the 1950s, as the European manufacturer of glamorous designs by Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson, who Willi had discovered on a trip to the US in 1953, and built a small factory in the bucolic outskirts of Weil am Rhein. A big fire in 1981 destroyed half the campus, and Fehlbaum brought in Grimshaw to build a new modular factory at speed, triggering his lust for working with architects.<br /><br />\u201cThere was never any guiding plan,\u201d Fehlbaum admits. \u201cWe never held competitions or did research. It was more intuition. For example, I saw Zaha in Blueprint magazine and asked her to design a chair for us, but it wasn\u2019t very good.
