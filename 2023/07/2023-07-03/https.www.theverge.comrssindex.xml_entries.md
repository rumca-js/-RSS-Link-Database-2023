  <p id="2NRvf0">Google can’t display tweets and pages from Twitter in search results as effectively as it usually does because of changes at Twitter, according to a statement given to <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re aware that our ability to crawl <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> has been limited, affecting our ability to display tweets and pages from the site in search results,” spokesperson Lara Levin said. “Websites have control over whether crawlers can access their content.”</p>
<p id="AyNzFv">Over the past few days, Twitter has made some major changes to the visibility of tweets on the site. On Friday, it started blocking unregistered users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779764/twitter-blocks-unregistered-users-account-tweets">from being able to browse tweets</a>, and on Saturday, it introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/1/23781198/twitter-daily-reading-limit-elon-musk-verified-paywall">“temporary” limits</a> for the number of tweets people can read in a day.

## Twitter is going to force TweetDeck users to switch over to the ‘new’ version

  <p id="t9Vyei">Twitter is going to force everyone who uses TweetDeck to switch over to the “new” version to help mitigate some of the issues TweetDeck has been experiencing lately. I used quotes around “new” because the experience has been in preview <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585249/tweetdeck-redesign-twitter-column-deck">for nearly two years</a>, but according to <a href="https://twitter.com/ayroblu/status/1675790004470132742">a Twitter employee</a>, “recent changes” have broken the legacy version of the app and will mean that the company will migrate everyone to the updated experience.</p>
<p id="8BgWxo">Twitter employees have also shared some slight clarifications about what’s going on with TweetDeck at the moment. For many on the old interface, TweetDeck is largely useless right now; all of my columns are just spinning with a “Loading...” message, and my colleagues saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/3/23782585/tweetdeck-broken-twitter-rate-limits-scraping-elon-musk">something similar as well</a>.</p>

## Suicide Squad is getting an anime adaptation

  <p id="XTTjGp"><em>Suicide Squad</em> is the next franchise to get an anime adaptation — and it looks pretty good. The new series, <em>Suicide Squad Isekai</em>, was revealed at Anime Expo 2023, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-isekai-anime-series-announced-by-warner-bros-japan-and-wit-studio">according to <em>IGN</em></a>, and you can watch a trailer for the new anime <a href="https://youtu.be/XSaBR58f7I0">right now</a>.</p>
<p id="QWBjFw">The trailer is brief, and it prominently features anime-styled versions of Harley Quinn and the Joker. It also hints at how the series will live up to its <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/07/15/beginners-guide-isekai-manga">Isekai</a> name and transport the characters to another world: one shot features a close-up shot of a flying dragon, for example, and there are some brief glimpses of floating islands throughout. (The series seems like it <em>could</em> be a new entry in James Gunn’s “<a href="https://collider.com/dcu-elseworlds-strategy-the-batman-joker/">Elseworlds” strategy for DC movies and shows</a> that aren’t directly tied to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2023/1/31/23579837/dc-studios-james-gunn-batman-superman-legacy-supergirl-the-authority-paradise-lost">mainline DC Universe</a>,...</p>

  <p id="CPDHOv">Pornhub is now blocking people in Mississippi and Virginia from visiting its website over laws that would require the service to verify their age. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/Pornhub/status/1674774396773318658">says</a> it’s blocking users to protest unfair enforcement of these new laws, claiming that sites enforcing the new rules will lose traffic to “irresponsible platforms” that “don’t follow the law, that don’t take user safety seriously, and that often don’t even moderate content.”</p>
<p id="2YLYch">Traffic dropped by 80 percent for Pornhub after it began enforcing age verification in Louisiana <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537226/louisiana-pornhub-age-">earlier this year</a>, the company writes. After that experience, it decided to start taking its sites offline instead of enforcing an age gate. In May, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23707861/pornhub-utah-age-verification-law-protest">blocked access to users in Utah</a> over a similar law. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/30/here-hold-my-lube-pornhub-blocks-virginia-and-mississippi/"><em>Techdirt...</em></a></p>

  <p id="VFm4k1">Some big HBO titles are heading to Netflix — just not the absolute biggest.</p>
<p id="BNiArA">Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery have reached a deal to start streaming select HBO series on Netflix’s platform. All five seasons of <em>Insecure</em>, which ran on HBO between 2016 and 2021, are now available, and others are on the way.</p>

The shows will all remain available on Max, as well. The list includes some classic HBO series — but notably not the network’s big recent titles, like <em>Game of Thrones </em>and <em>Succession</em>,<em> </em>or some of the biggest titles from its past, like <em>The Sopranos </em>or <em>The Wire</em>.</p>

  <p id="dF6j6v">It’s always nice when the end of the world can have some levity. <em>Biosphere</em>, from director Mel Eslyn, manages to mash up a post-apocalyptic story with a buddy comedy for a movie about two best pals who just so happen to be the last remaining people on the planet. It’s a high concept told at a small scale, with the entirety of the film taking place inside of an apartment-size biosphere home to lifelong friends Billy (Mark Duplass) and Ray (Sterling K. Brown). Their incredible chemistry propels the film forward, but it’s a major twist mid-way through that makes this strange, funny, and at times uncomfortable movie worth checking out.</p>
