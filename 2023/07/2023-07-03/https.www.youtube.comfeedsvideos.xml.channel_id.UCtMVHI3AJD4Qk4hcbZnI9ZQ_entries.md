Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at a new bill known as the "Online News Act" or Bill C-18. Canada's overregulation on the Interrnet in regards to the largest search engines has rendered the people unable to get their news from the easiest sources all in the name of keeping the legacy media alive. Instead of making the Internet free and open as it should this is the first wave of regulations that aims to control the last digital frontier we have. Thanks for watching!
