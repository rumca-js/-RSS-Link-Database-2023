These included attempts to stifle game sharing between friends and used titles from being sold on, and most controversially the requirement for users to routinely establish an internet connection else face being locked out of their own content, whether it featured an online component or not. Understandably, the backlash was rife. \n\nThis video discusses the reasons for this backlash in detail and Microsoft\u2019s eventual U-turn, plus it outlines some of the other questionable strategic decisions Microsoft took during the development of the Xbox One, principally with every system being equipped with an upgraded Kinect motion sensor system having the obvious knock-on effect of a higher price tag compared to the competition.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qGb1Qt2V4k", "date_published": "2023-07-03T15:30:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "GYLT PS5 Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Tequila Works\u2019 narrative adventure GYLT was originally released on Google Stadia back in 2019, and the game has now made its way over to consoles and PC.

GYLT\u2019s gameplay revolves around solving mostly linear environmental puzzles and sneaking around shadow monsters with basic AI, which fortunately remains engaging enough for its short runtime of around 6 hours. \n\nGYLT might be worth checking out if its gameplay sounds interesting to you, but also know that you aren\u2019t missing out on much if you choose to pass on this one.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfg6BkpBbTE", "date_published": "2023-07-03T15:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 AMAZING SINGLE PLAYER Games Still Coming Out In 2023", "description": "Despite what some may think, single-player games continue to be a thriving market - and some of the biggest games of recent memory are single-player releases.
