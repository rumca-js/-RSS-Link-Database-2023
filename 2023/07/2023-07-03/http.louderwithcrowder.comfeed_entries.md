Because while Democrats are begging for a rematch with Trump, Newsom -- who critics say is counting the days until Biden says the words "due to health reasons" -- has decided Ron DeSantis is the most likely nominee. And when leftists claim book "bans" <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/banned-books-democrat" target="_blank">are castrating our children</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/the-view-book-banning" target="_blank">a literal paper genocide</a>, DeSantis is the boogeyman. </p><p>So here is Newsom shopping at a "banned" bookstore in Idaho. Yes. A book store where you can buy books that are banned from you buying.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Using this logic, you too can shop at a banned bookstore today. It's called Amazon.com.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/poltifact-book-ban-desantis" target="_blank">Using the "independent" "fact" checker definition</a> where a book ban also means when a book ISN'T banned but you don't have immediate access to it, Amazon only providing OVERNIGHT delivery and not SAME-DAY delivery means they are banning this book from you.</p><h3>Why all this talk about book banning?</h3><br /><p>Democrats need a cheap talking point. Liberals know when they lie about a conservative policy, they can count on corporate journalismers to swear by it. Here are three examples of what's considered "banning."</p><p>1. A poem from Amanda Gorman was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/poltifact-book-ban-desantis" target="_self">moved from the middle school area of a Florida library to the high school area of the library</a>. It is considered a "book ban" by the left because middle school students have to go to a different area of the library.</p><p>2. Gov. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_self">opposes a single AP African-American History curriculum</a> because he feels history should teach kids about history and not Marxist indoctrination or who is banging who.</p><p>3. There are conservatives who feel that books about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning" target="_self">kids tasting their vagina slime, teaching them how to give a handy to make someone cum, and graphic novels about two dudes f*cking</a> are inappropriate to be available in schools.</p><h3>Did Republican's seize on Gavin Newsom visiting a banned booked store?</h3><br /><p>
	You're goddamned right we did.
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">“Wow look at all these banned books I can buy in broad daylight in a store with no interference whatsoever” <a href="https://t.co/EUw3MtsZyK">https://t.co/EUw3MtsZyK</a><br />— Oilfield Rando (@Oilfield_Rando) <a href="https://twitter.com/Oilfield_Rando/status/1675906667995705368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The people behind these “bans” of books you can walk into a store and buy are about as effective as the “vote suppressors” whose voter suppression resulted in record high turnout.<br /><br />Or maybe performative empty suits like Gavin Newsom are just full of crap. <a href="https://t.co/z9caNjafLa">https://t.co/z9caNjafLa</a><br />— Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdizwhitlock/status/1675867125767081987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>
	Funny how when the Left cries that the Right is banning books, they never give specific titles.
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Periodic reminder that when they accuse us of “banning books” they’re referring to pornographic books which are offered to kids in schools across the country. <br /><br />Why does Gavin Newsom want kids to read porn in school? <a href="https://t.co/gbk7xsUf4X">https://t.co/gbk7xsUf4X</a> <a href="https://t.co/GsXA3RHxjF">pic.twitter.com/GsXA3RHxjF</a><br />— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1675902690650365953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>
	Dean Cain, former California resident and the greatest Superman this generation has ever known, has a new name for Newsom.
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Gaslighter-in-Chief <a href="https://t.co/nzIkckPM09">https://t.co/nzIkckPM09</a><br />— Dean Cain (@RealDeanCain) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealDeanCain/status/1675636123362803713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>
	Oh, and you may notice corporate media claiming Gavin Newsom is campaigning for Joe Biden... in Idaho. More like IdahLOL.
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What’s funny about this, is gavvy was on his way to or from a vacation at some billionaire resort . But he had to stop and send a commie message to his mindless constituents. <a href="https://t.co/15L9ckDkRK">https://t.co/15L9ckDkRK</a><br />— Josh__Seattle (@Josh__Seattle) <a href="https://twitter.com/Josh__Seattle/status/1675914539358126080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>Newsom even has a catchphrase: "Stick it to the ban." See, he took the colloquialism "stick it to the man," only he replaced "man" with "ban." Get it?</p><p>I would love to see the internal polling that shows Democrats this is a winning issue for them when every other culture war poll is going in the opposite direction. Unless there is a silent majority of voters who WANT their kids exposed to porn in schools.</p><p>I kinda doubt that.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Man shouts slurs at Asian pedestrians, discovers he should #StopAsianHate as he hits the pavement

That was a thing. Then the media realized a lot of the hate was NOT coming from Trump supporters like they were hoping. People aren't hashtag virtual signaling it as much. Nevertheless, Asian hate persists. Notably, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/asian-cop-nyc-hate-slur" target="_blank">in places like New York City</a>. At least when they aren't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-jewish-palestinian-hate-crime" target="_blank">also hating on the Jews</a>.

<p>It will never not be satisfying to see a loudmouth get his piehole to shut physically.  That counts double when it's someone from New York City. People run their mouths all the time without expecting consequences. My favorite part of the video is how the Asian guy with the pugilistic skills shut him up mid-sentence. He dropped the dude with one punch! The other punches were all just for fun. He must train MMA. You keep punching until the ref tells you to stop. No one told the guy to stop, so the beatdown continued.</p><p>Let this be a lesson for any would-be haters. Hate all you want. Just do it with an empty stomach because knuckle sandwiches are filling.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## YouTube removes Theo Von podcast for "hate speech," even after it's clear a leftist douche took Roseanne Barr out of context

Or, I think it was those twenty seconds. As someone who is familiar with violating YouTube's stoonad policies, the company is never specific. I'm cribbing off of <a href="https://ew.com/celebrity/roseanne-barr-podcast-episode-violates-hate-speech-policy/" target="_blank">an Entertainment Weekly article</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-colin-kaepernick-netflix" target="_blank">Theo Von</a> saying his video was removed.</p><h3>A Timeline of Roseanne Barr's "Holocaust" Comments</h3><br /><p>
<strong>June 14, 2023 -</strong> Theo Von, a comedian, uploads an episode of his <em><u>This Past<u></u> Weekend</u></em> podcast with Roseanne Barr, another comedian. The two spoke for just under two hours and thirty-five minutes.
</p><p>
<strong>June 27, 2023 -</strong> Progressive sh*tc*nt Brian Krassenstein, who critics say willfully takes non-progressives out of context because he knows people who work in media will uncritically believe anything they see on Twitter about people they already don't like, tweeted sixteen out-of-context seconds of that over two-and-a-half hour podcast.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <p>
	After the clip went viral, Theo Von tweeted the IN CONTEXT CLIP. But as the saying goes, a lie travels faster than the truth.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <p>
<strong>June 28, 2023 -</strong> Roseanne <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/roseanne-barr-holocaust-joke" target="_blank">appeared on Louder with Crowder</a> and if it wasn't already clear, explained, "That was a joke. This was a bit that I have done on stage. I'm a comedian. [Leftists] take my joke and what they did was they left out the premise."
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <h3>Why was Theo Von removed from YouTube?</h3><br /><p>​The comedian, half a month after his podcast was uploaded on YouTube and a few days after it was clear Roseanne was the victim of a left-wing smear campaign, announced via Twitter, "My podcast with Roseanne was removed from another platform so I want it to be able to live somewhere" <a href="https://twitter.com/TheoVon/status/1675248238226706432" target="_blank">and uploaded it to Twitter</a>.</p><p>Entertainment Weekly confirmed Von was talking about YouTube. They said of the controversy:</p><blockquote>After condemning claims that the 2022 election was rigged, the former <em>Roseanne</em> star attempted a sarcastic antisemitic rant to make her point.</blockquote><p>That is of course fake news and misinformation. As the in-context video shows, Roseanne didn't attempt to do anything. She nailed that sh*t.</p><p>Comedians Danny Polishuk and Tim Dillion have both commented that YouTube is no longer the place for comedy podcasts. This is of course true. Rumble is the perfect home. </p><p>But YouTube? The people who review videos and decide policies are both humorous twats and make all their decisions based on their radical progressive worldview. In this case with Theo Von, a podcast that was "so full of hate" it sat on YouTube unnoticed until someone on Twitter took something out of context was removed. It was removed days after it was clear it was taken out of context.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
