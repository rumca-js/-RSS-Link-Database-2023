Ten years ago, in the run up to E3 2013 Microsoft announced a slew of unwelcome features for its upcoming next-gen console, the Xbox One. These included attempts to stifle game sharing between friends and used titles from being sold on, and most controversially the requirement for users to routinely establish an internet connection else face being locked out of their own content, whether it featured an online component or not. Understandably, the backlash was rife. 

This video discusses the reasons for this backlash in detail and Microsoft’s eventual U-turn, plus it outlines some of the other questionable strategic decisions Microsoft took during the development of the Xbox One, principally with every system being equipped with an upgraded Kinect motion sensor system having the obvious knock-on effect of a higher price tag compared to the competition.

Tequila Works’ narrative adventure GYLT was originally released on Google Stadia back in 2019, and the game has now made its way over to consoles and PC. You take on the role of Sally who embarks on a quest to find her cousin Emily, but the path ahead is wrought with all sorts of dangerous monsters and shadowy beings.

The story occasionally shows signs of promise, but it ends up being a disappointing tale since large chunks of it are pretty uneventful. GYLT’s gameplay revolves around solving mostly linear environmental puzzles and sneaking around shadow monsters with basic AI, which fortunately remains engaging enough for its short runtime of around 6 hours. 

GYLT might be worth checking out if its gameplay sounds interesting to you, but also know that you aren’t missing out on much if you choose to pass on this one.
