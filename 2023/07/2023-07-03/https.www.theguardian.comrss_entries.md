## The Idol finale review – one of the worst programmes ever made

<p>We were promised the year’s most shocking show. Instead we get a painfully tedious TV non-event, featuring a performance from The Weeknd that should be tried at The Hague</p><p>Getting rid of sex scenes is a debate that rears its ugly head among film and TV fans time and time again. The arguments against on-screen sex and nudity are a many-headed hydra of puritanism: they are unnecessary, they rarely serve the plot and making acting co-workers recreate intimacy is fundamentally icky. My position has always been that sex is part of life – and art should be able to depict all of life’s foibles. Until, that is, I started watching The Idol, which makes it hard not to join the ranks of this new wave of prudes. After all, if sex on screen can facilitate a show this terrible, maybe it’s worth embracing televisual celibacy.</p><p>It is not just that The Idol is one of the worst programmes ever made – it’s also possibly the most squandered opportunity ever. Giant budget aside, post-Britney Spears, Kesha and Amy Winehouse, it’s high time to satirise pop starlet tragedies – and with this production featuring Hank Azaria, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Hari Nef and Rachel Sennott, it had more than enough talent to do so. Instead, we get the limp, glazed-over, chain-smoking nothingness of Lily-Rose Depp and a performance from Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye that should be tried at The Hague. After all the sex, nudity, swearing and scandal surrounding The Idol, we were braced to be shocked. We were braced to be appalled. But nothing can prepare you to be so incredibly bored.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/03/the-idol-finale-review-one-of-the-worst-programmes-ever-made">Continue reading...</a>

On day one of the tournament there was not much enthusiasm on anyone’s part to engage with the issue but Andrey Rublev, the men’s No 7 seed, did offer his thoughts. The Russian said: “I think obviously there was better options. Not just to ban. Because in the end, there was no difference. [Wimbledon] did only worse to themselves.” Rublev beat the Australian Max Purcell in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4, to progress to the second round.

## The Guardian view on Labour’s crackdown on free thinkers: it’s bad for the party and politics | Editorial

<p>The move against Neal Lawson illuminates a wider strategy to march Labour ever rightwards under the cover of big poll leads</p><p>The Labour party’s decision to threaten to expel one of its leading thinkers after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/30/labour-expelling-mp-activist-neal-lawson" title="">44 years of membership</a> is a political miscalculation. Neal Lawson is the director of the progressive thinktank Compass, who previously worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson. Mr Lawson is no leftwinger, some of whom are being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/25/labour-left-is-marginalised-as-starmer-supporters-dominate" title="">purged</a> by Sir Keir Starmer on ideological grounds. Instead he championed the liberal tradition of political and democratic pluralism and was a prime mover in making sure such ideas gained currency in the party. For his efforts, Mr Lawson is being shown the door – and there are determined efforts to bundle him through it.</p><p>The charges of disloyalty against Mr Lawson should be dropped. They, unfortunately, illuminate a wider strategy to march Labour ever rightwards under the cover of big <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/labours-poll-lead-falls-cost-of-living-crisis-2448872" title="">poll leads</a>. Mr Lawson’s argument for a progressive alliance – either a formal pact or a tacit one – to save the country from Conservative domination, is a good one. But Sir Keir wants the progressive tent to be big enough only for Labour and the Lib Dems, who face off against the Tories – not each other – in almost every English seat. To defeat a common enemy doesn’t need <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/14/lib-dems-will-not-be-sucked-into-formal-labour-pact-says-vince-cable" title="">an explicit pact</a> between these parties when their voters lending support will do. Crucially, Sir Keir seemingly wants to win through bland policies, and paint his opponents on the left – the <a href="https://labourlist.org/2023/05/the-greens-should-worry-labour-but-brighton-shows-how-to-fight-back/" title="">Greens</a> and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-65534230" title="">SNP</a> – as equally radical and as bad as those to his right.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/03/the-guardian-view-on-labours-crackdown-on-free-thinkers-its-bad-for-the-party-and-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Levels of denial were terrifying at New Conservatives’ first event, which just highlighted more divisions within party</p><p>They came not to bury Rishi, but to praise him. Of course they did. There’s been no end of Tories queueing up to profess their support for the prime minister in recent days, only to then point out where he was going badly wrong. They’ve even created their own death rattle. The sound of rats leaving a sinking ship. Lashing out even as they face extinction.</p><p>On Monday, the newly minted New Conservatives group of 25 MPs elected since the Brexit referendum went public for the first time at an event taking place in the Unherd Club – the Westminster establishment location for anyone who wants to be considered anti-establishment. They claimed to be just like-minded MPs. Men and women merely interested in ensuring their own survival.

## How did I spend the weekend? In France, remembering when Britain burned

<p>In Paris and Marseille, I was never far from the riots – or thoughts of the UK in 2011</p><p>If you followed the French riots via much of the British media, you’d think the entire country was on fire, but also that the riots weren’t <em>about </em>anything. We have a knack for making civil unrest sound completely massive yet utterly trivial, a threat to civilisation and yet, at the same time, entirely powered by TikTok. The Foreign Office never went so far as to advise against travel to France, merely noting that there were riots, and that you should stay away from rioters. But even if it had, I would just have assumed the civil servants had spent too much time listening to Radio 4.</p><p>Mr Z and I have just had a few days in France. The first night in Paris, we saw nothing except some broken glass. A barmaid described in granular detail where the riots had been the night before, but it didn’t sound at all like a warning, more like a tour guide disappointed that you’d missed the northern lights. On the second day, we unintentionally passed through Marseille, having missed a train going elsewhere. The superiority of French trains is so pronounced it has become unmentionable, like having a sibling who is much more intelligent than you. Don’t think about it – it’ll just make you sad. But seriously, the train we missed was going a distance equivalent to London to Inverness. If we’d missed that at home, we wouldn’t have arrived for another four days. “To get the most out of this experience, I need to miss more trains,” was my take-home, and I did take it home because we also missed the train back. Anyway, Marseille: no riots, but it was daytime.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/03/how-did-i-spend-the-weekend-in-france-remembering-when-britain-burned">Continue reading...</a>

When a Russian rocket exploded in Kramatorsk on 27 June, the poet and novelist was just 37 years old. The rocket caused injuries from which she would not recover.</p><p>Yet in her short life, Amelina still managed to achieve a great deal. She emigrated to Canada with her family at the age of 14, but decided to return to Ukraine, to her native city of Lviv, soon after. She graduated from the Lviv Polytechnic Institute and became a computer programmer. She seemed to have a bright future in that field, but in 2015 decided to exchange it for the life of a full-time writer. An extremely active and vivacious person, Victoria also got involved in public life and the struggle for human rights – especially the rights of political prisoners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/03/novelist-andrey-kurkov-on-victoria-amelina">Continue reading...</a>

## How György Ligeti soundtracked 2001, inspired Radiohead and composed music like ‘a knife through Stalin’s heart’

<p>The Hungarian escaped two murderous regimes, wrote pieces to be played on metronomes and car horns, and depicted inner and outer space to Stanley Kubrick. Now, in his centenary year, the Proms will celebrate Ligeti’s genius</p><p>In Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, the appearance of the big black monolith is intensified by strange, ominous music. Voices and instruments cautiously creep outwards from a low B-flat, nervously circling around a few notes. The music gropes its way along, spreading, bifurcating and expanding to fill the sonic space. In no time, it has grown into a complex, teeming mass of sound. This music is the Kyrie from Hungarian composer György Ligeti’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqrJmxy4q3A">1965 Requiem</a>, a Latin mass for the dead written by a Jew whose father and brother were murdered in Hitler’s death camps. This Requiem is far from consoling. It is a fierce confrontation with the terrors of the 20th century. A rare performance of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ep6wxj">the complete work will take place at this year’s BBC Proms</a>, part of the celebrations for the centenary of this shapeshifting musical genius.</p><p>Kubrick famously didn’t get Ligeti’s permission to use his music as extensively as he would have liked in 2001. After initial rancour and threats of litigation, composer and film director eventually reached an uneasy accommodation. Each admired the other’s work and, perhaps, recognised their shared brand of near pathological perfectionism. As well as the Requiem, Kubrick also uses Ligeti’s cloudy orchestral masterpiece Atmosphères as the overture to 2001 and in the trippy Stargate sequence, the ethereal<em> </em>a cappella choral textures of Lux Aeterna to portray the emptiness of space, and an electronically altered version of his mini-opera Aventures/Nouvelles Aventures in the final scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/03/how-gyorgy-ligeti-soundtracked-2001-inspired-radiohead-and-composed-music-like-a-knife-through-stalins-heart">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester</strong><br />Dürer worked half a millennium ago but his meticulous images are strangely modern</p><p>The art of Albrecht Dürer is ancient and modern simultaneously. This printmaker and painter, who was born in Nuremberg in 1471 and died there in 1528, made art that’s full of medieval saints and monsters, wild men of the woods and hilltop castles – but his images tremble with an unease we find all too recognisable.</p><p>The Whitworth’s excellent assembly of his printed images wants to set him firmly in his time and place. It invites you to consider his “material world”, the stuff of German life half a millennium ago. Shoes, for instance: Dürer designed his own. There’s a paper pattern here, cut out to the shape of his foot, on which he’s written precise instructions to the cobbler and drawn exactly how it should look. He pays the same exacting attention to the design of a perfect work space in his engraving Saint Jerome in His Study: the church father who translated the Bible into Latin works intently at a designer bookstand with an ink bottle neatly stowed in a wall niche, an hourglass next to the hook where his hat hangs, a bench with books and cushions and two big windows letting in plenty of light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/03/albrecht-durer-review-whitworth-art-gallery-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

After all, it is scientifically impossible to maintain any sort of discourse whatsoever about a show as shapeless and mediocre as And Just Like That …, so of course people are going to latch on to the fact that arguably the most iconic Sex and the City character of all is set to make a triumphant comeback.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/03/the-mandalorian-and-just-like-that-tv-stars-scenes-alone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s value in online communities – but how do we walk the line between commiseration and doxxing?</p><p>For those suspicious that their partner might be doing the dirty, there are hundreds of “Do We Have The Same Boyfriend” Facebook groups across Australia and New Zealand. The premise is this: people – mostly women – can request to join to post details about the person they’re dating to check if they’re simultaneously dating anyone else in the group.</p><p>Once inside, you can find a mix of bad dating stories (can relate), memes, and screenshots of cringeworthy dating app conversations. In the comments, things often get spicy. Across TikTok, users laugh about how the pages are more entertaining than reality TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/04/do-we-have-the-same-boyfriend-head-to-social-media-and-you-might-find-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thomas shot to fame as Elliott in Steven Spielberg’s 1981 hit. Now a father himself, he talks about why he almost quit acting, being recognised and whether he’d let his kids act</p><p>If you’re ever in need of wonder or a cathartic cry, or perhaps want to feel a little humbled, go watch Henry Thomas’s audition for ET. Just nine years old, he sits attentively, his little mousey face keen as an adult explains the improvised scene. “They’ve come with a search warrant and they want to take the creature away,” the man rattles off at a breakneck speed, and then <em>action</em>! In less than a minute, hot tears are rolling down Thomas’ face, for an alien puppet he hasn’t even seen. (Later, he’d reveal he was thinking of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2012/10/e-t-audition-video-for-star-henry-thomas-how-the-sci-fi-classic-got-its-elliott.html">his dead dog</a>.) “You can’t take him away, he’s mine,” Thomas says, bottom lip wobbling. “I don’t care what the president says, he’s my best friend and you can’t take him away.”</p><p>The people in the room at the time have said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N51nFdt623M">they all began to cry too</a>; you can hear a tinge of genuine alarm, and awe, in Steven Spielberg’s voice when he says, off-camera, “OK kid, you got the job.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/03/henry-thomas-on-life-after-et-we-got-a-lot-of-weird-visitors-some-people-were-fanatical">Continue reading...</a>

## Why was Trump hoarding classified government documents? | Moira Donegan

<p>We don’t know the motive for the president’s retention of files at Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster, but let’s not rule out stupidity</p><p>There are many surreal revelations in Jack Smith’s federal indictment of Donald Trump. There are the texts between various Trump underlings and Walt Nauta, the Trump body man who has also been indicted, showing the president directing his employees to move the boxes containing classified information back and forth to various locations around his properties in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey. There is the annoyed missive from Trump’s wife Melania, trying to make sure the boxes don’t crowd out room for her luggage on a private plane. There is the claim from Trump’s former attorney, compelled to testify against him in an unusual arrangement, that the former president suggested, with a Grinch-like pinching gesture, that the lawyer destroy confidential documents to prevent them from being produced in a subpoena. There is a text message Nauta sent to another Trump underling, showing a box having fallen over in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago, secret documents spilling on to the floor – whoops.</p><p>What there is not, conspicuously, is a motive. Over the course of more than a year following his departure from office, it appears that Trump spent considerable effort and resources in transporting the documents with him and keeping them near at hand – and that later, as the federal government began to demand the boxes back, that he then went out of his way to keep and conceal them, going to great length, sparing no expense, and ultimately breaking the law so much that he incurred himself a series of felony charges. Anyone can tell you how this behavior is typical of Trump: how it reflects his pettiness, his contempt for the law, his willingness to sacrifice and endanger others. What no one can tell you is why he did it.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/03/trump-classified-documents-mar-a-lago">Continue reading...</a>

## My wife and I have stopped having sex. Are my fetishes to blame?

<p>She has started sleeping on the couch on our scheduled ‘spicy date’ nights. I feel as though we are falling apart</p><p><strong>My wife and I have come to a barrier in our sex life. In the past, I have struggled with severe pornography addictions. After receiving counselling for my erectile dysfunction, my wife and I went on to have a beautiful </strong><strong>10 years of marriage with</strong><strong> an active sex life. Up until </strong><strong>recently, my wife has been perfectly OK with indulging me in my various fetishes</strong><strong>, such as peeing. Now </strong><strong>though she no longer seems interested in having sex with me, and has even started sleeping on the couch on our scheduled </strong><strong>‘spicy date</strong><strong>’ nights. I feel as though we are falling apart and I’m not sure how to fix it. What should I do? Is it time to go back to counselling?</strong></p><p>It’s not your kink that’s causing the problem. Since your wife has been “indulging” you in that for many years, it is far more likely that this shift in her behaviour is due to some other problem or problems. These could be relational in nature – such as a growing underlying anger or resentment about something she feels is unfair – or perhaps she is going through something physical, such as hormonal changes. Going back to counselling is essential because you have clearly reached an impasse that is not going to be resolved without help. You need to begin talking to each other again in a useful manner, and you may still have some work to do on the self-hatred you feel regarding your relatively common fetish. Some partners who join in fetishistic behaviour simply to please their partner can understandably start to feel resentment if they are not able to experience their preferred vanilla style at least part of the time, so it is possible there may be a need for renegotiations about that.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

## Cabaret legend Justin Vivian Bond: ‘When I sing, you can hear the drinks and cigarettes I’ve had’

<p>From kicking out the teeth of a dead cow onstage to popularising the prefix Mx, the performer has blazed a trail. Now 60, Bond talks about channeling rage into comedy – and nonconformity into revolution</p><p>‘When I was 12 or 13,” says Justin Vivian Bond, “my parents took my sister and me to dinner at Disney World where this performer called Helen O’Connell did a show. She was wearing a beautiful beaded red dress and I thought, ‘That’s what I want to do. I want to wear fancy dresses and sing songs in glamorous places while people are eating.’” <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/10/life-is-a-cabaret">The New Yorker magazine has since crowned Bond</a> “the greatest cabaret artist of [their] generation”. Bond chuckles. “I guess you could say I succeeded.”</p><p>The transgender, trans-genre artist is speaking from their apartment in New York’s East Village, where the air outside is thick with smoke blowing over from Canadian wildfires. It’s morning there and, over the phone, Bond’s voice is luxurious and woody. “I don’t have a beautiful voice that makes people think, ‘That’s magic coming out of that person’s throat.’ That’s not what I’m about. I feel like I need to have a justification for asking people to listen to me. But I think, through the work I’ve done, I’ve earned that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/03/cabaret-legend-justin-vivian-bond-when-i-sing-you-can-hear-the-drinks-and-cigarettes-ive-had">Continue reading...</a>

## A plan to cut carers when the NHS is on its knees – do ‘red wall’ Tory MPs really think this will save them? | Simon Jenkins

<p>The UK’s care sector needs workers from abroad, but rightwing MPs want to slash immigration to save face – whatever the cost</p><p>Britain’s national health service is, by any definition, facing a turning point. It needs help, not hindrance. Of the many stress points, the inability to move mostly older patients between hospitals and care homes is perhaps the most extreme. The principal reason has been the <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-10-11/number-of-care-workers-falls-by-50000-as-165000-roles-are-left-vacant">shortage of 165,000 workers</a> in the care sector, or about 11% of its labour force. Crucial to this service has been the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/24/uk-immigration-rules-to-be-ease-as-shortages-of-care-workers-worsen">temporary visa scheme</a> for care workers and home carers introduced last year, after EU recruitment was crippled by Brexit. <a href="https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2023/05/25/60000-boost-to-care-workforce-from-overseas-staff-in-past-year/">About 58,000 new workers</a> have come in under the scheme. The care sector depends on these workers, which means so do the hospitals dependent on moving patients into care.</p><p>Enter the proposal by a small group of rightwing Tory MPs complaining that the overall level of immigration into the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/02/red-wall-tory-mps-put-pressure-on-sunak-over-net-migration">has eroded public trust</a> in the government. They want to cut the number of care home visas, thereby reducing immigration, so they say, by 82,000 people. It is like preparing for the Battle of the Somme by slashing infantry numbers. The MPs also want to cut the number of overseas students and their dependents, raise the income threshold for visas to other British jobs, and limit incoming refugees. Overall, they say, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/02/red-wall-tory-mps-put-pressure-on-sunak-over-net-migration">this should more than halve immigration</a>, which in turn should make people feel better in “red wall” seats. They do not ask how people would feel in hospitals and care homes.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/03/cutting-carers-nhs-new-conservatives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Being present is a popular life hack – but where does that leave nostalgia, fantasy and rumination?</p><p>When, in 2010, artist Marina Abramović sat in a chair for 716 hours over a span of three months, she locked eyes with 1,545 visitors, one at a time, across a small table. During the first few weeks of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/marina-abramovic-artist-present-review" title="">The Artist Is Present</a>, performed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Abramović wore a blue dress to calm her mind, because her “brain was moving 360,000 miles per hour”. Meanwhile, many people who’d waited in winding lines to stare into her eyes, once seated before her, cried. One visitor described the experience as luminous and uplifting, and that “it always comes back to being present, breathing, maintaining eye contact”.</p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about being present and wondering why I should strive to achieve it. I am a parent. I am a professor. I have a life, and a job, that typically require not just my physical presence but my full emotional attention. This is what I’ve come to understand, via osmosis, at least: to succeed I need to be present. Ostensibly this is for my own wellbeing; but the implication is that I am also responsible for the wellbeing of others. In failing to be present, I might risk harming them too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/03/the-big-idea-why-you-shouldnt-always-try-to-live-in-the-moment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Developer of North Carolina neighborhood for homeowners 55 and older says his brand ‘only the beginning’ of a ‘movement’</p><p>The 17 June groundbreaking of a future suburban neighborhood in Gastonia, North Carolina, had all the trappings of a campaign rally. Brock Fankhauser, the real estate developer of 1776 Gastonia, waved to onlookers from the open top of a sport-utility vehicle; his wife, Nicole, was by his side, wearing a cowboy hat and matching T-shirt with the development’s namesake year, referring to the American Revolution.</p><p>Video footage of the event shows a crane dangling a giant US flag over the site where 43 lots are for sale.

<p>I was prescribed steroid cream for my eczema – but when I stopped using it I ended up in A&amp;E. Much more research is needed into this debilitating condition</p><p>There are 592 photos in the hidden folder on my phone and not one of them is seductive. I’ve been keeping a visual diary of my skin struggles since June 2020. The first selfie shows a few unsightly red blotches dotted on my cheek, brow and forehead. Over the following years, it’s pretty much the same three shots on repeat: face-on, left side, right side, sometimes smiling, often crying. I’ve become hardened to looking at my various states of distress but I rarely have the courage to open this folder of photos.</p><p>I had severe eczema as a child, but by the age of seven it had disappeared almost completely. Around the age of 30, I noticed little patches starting to creep back in. It was a stressful time – work, relationships, life – and it’s not unusual for skin conditions to ebb and flow in this way, but it was unnerving nevertheless. I went to my GP and was prescribed low potency topical steroids. The rash went away briefly, but it always came back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/03/my-topical-steroid-withdrawal-water-felt-like-acid-my-body-was-ablaze-and-i-shed-skin-like-a-snake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was shocking to watch a baying crowd at Lord’s hurl abuse at players for effecting a stumping within the laws of the game</p><p>In most sports, players simply follow the rules laid out for them, which are enforced by umpires or referees. If they break a rule, a consequence is applied and play resumes. There are times, naturally, when athletes are accused of being unsporting, but there is rarely a drawn-out debate over players following the rules exactly as written and being scolded for doing so.</p><p>Cricket is a very different beast in many ways. No more clearly did we see this play out than on day five of the second Ashes Test. Where the two cricketing nations of England and Australia are concerned, history is a living and hotly contested document, one that is constantly being grappled over and argued about. So as soon as Jonny Bairstow was stumped by Alex Carey and the third umpire sent him on his way, battle lines were drawn between Australian fans staking out their ground on the side of a “fair and legal dismissal” and the English abandoning their Sunday lunch plans to fight for “the spirit of cricket”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/03/same-old-aussies-always-cheating-chants-cut-deep-for-a-nation-still-scarred-by-sandpaper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I fed him when I was struggling to look after myself – and he watched as I became a much happier, more liberated person</p><p>I first had goldfish as a child: two lived in a little pond we had made out of a kitchen sink in the garden. But I always worried I had accidentally killed them. I have a vague memory of taking our guinea pig, Stripey, down to meet the fish, holding him over the pond to see them, and his poo landing almost straight in their mouths. They died shortly afterwards. So I never thought I’d have them again as pets, until about 25 years later a friend asked me to look after Squishy, an orange fancy goldfish.</p><p>Squishy looked an awful lot like a stubby penis.

I had never seen black moors before and found their big, blueberry eyes so funny to look at.

## Feathers review – loutish husband turns into a chicken in elegant, witty parable

<p>Ambiguous, Kafkaesque and with a deadpan wit, Egyptian director Omar El Zohairy’s debut feature explores a woman’s place in a man’s world</p><p>Egyptian film-maker Omar El Zohairy is a brilliant emerging talent with an impressive professional pedigree; he is a former assistant to Yousry Nasrallah (who himself started out as assistant to the celebrated Youssef Chahine) and has won festival prizes with this, his debut feature. It’s a comedy with a little of Woody Allen or Franz Kafka – though with not much of the famous Emily Dickinson quote about what hope is. It is also a social-surrealist parable about a woman’s place in a man’s world. Higher than the animals? Lower than the animals? El Zohairy conjures something elegant and mysterious with a deadpan wit, which coolly encases its compassion. He frames his shots with superb compositional flair – this film actually reminded me of another Egyptian film, Ibrahim El-Batout’s Winter of Discontent. And there’s some excellent child acting and baby acting.</p><p>The scene is a cramped, squalid flat inhabited by a boorish factory worker (Samy Bassiouny), always grandly announcing the things he’ll buy for the family someday. His unsmiling put-upon wife is played by Demyana Nassar, who shows that her character is almost catatonic with the tensions caused by making do for their three kids on the housekeeping money he gives her. And in this film the simple activity of counting out cash is vitally important, a recurring image connected with power. People are always giving money, taking money, or making deals in an atmosphere of shabby secrecy and shame. One day, the father invites all his mates as well as a high-up figure he oleaginously calls “Boss” to the flat for his son’s birthday party. (It appears that his workplace loans cash for this sort of thing.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/03/feathers-review-loutish-husband-turns-into-a-chicken-in-elegant-witty-parable">Continue reading...</a>

Apparently not even the TikTok algorithm team really knows how it works, so there’s no chance for me.</p><p>But if it’s so sophisticated, why do I get such weird content? I check out TikTok semi-regularly, hoping for neatly packaged trends to think about, or for the kind of stuff I like watching on other platforms: videos of birds – especially gulls – doing amusing things, elaborate French patisserie, nice gardens and capybaras. Instead, the default “For You” tab seems determined to baffle and appal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/03/if-tiktok-is-so-clever-why-do-i-only-get-clips-of-beards-leotards-pimples-and-fake-news">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for potato and tomato frittata | A kitchen in Rome

<p>A twist on two 18th-century recipes by ‘The Gallant Cook’ who changed Neapolitan cooking</p><p>“With joyful inventiveness,” is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Riley">food historian Gillian Riley</a> describes the way <a href="https://www.palladianroutes.com/post/the-birth-of-mediterranean-cuisine-vincenzo-corrado#:~:text=Italian%20chef%2C%20philosopher%20and%20man,for%20Prince%20Michael%20IV%20Imperiali.">Vincenzo Corrado</a> wrote about food. She also notes his “fresh flow of ideas”, “subversive and endearingly individual way”, and his ability to “convey a complex recipe in three or four lines”. I admire these same qualities in Riley’s own lively and scholarly writing, and especially in her masterful <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-companion-to-italian-food-9780198606178?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;">The Oxford Companion to Italian Food</a>, which is where I met The Gallant Cook.</p><p>Born in 1738, in Oria in Puglia (then part of the Kingdom of Naples), little is known about Corrado’s childhood except that it was humble, and that, after his parents’ death, he possibly went into the service of an aristocrat. At 17, he entered a Celestine monastery that allowed him an excellent education and, later, to travel all over the Italian peninsula with senior clergy, feeding his curiosity about food and collecting recipes as they went. Monastic life also took Corrado to Naples, which at the time was the densely-populated centre of the Spanish-ruled kingdom and, for the wealthy, the pleasure capital of Europe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/03/potato-and-tomato-frittata-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thinking of purchasing a non-traditional pet?

But less traditional, or so-called “exotic”, pets are also increasing in popularity: the latest <a href="https://www.ukpetfood.org/information-centre/statistics/uk-pet-population.html">UK Pet Food </a>survey estimates that in the UK alone, we own a staggering 1.3 million indoor birds, 900,000 tortoises and turtles, 800,000 lizards and 700,000 snakes.

<p>Fresh pressure on Rishi Sunak as New Conservatives publish policy document calling for tighter controls on immigration</p><p>The <strong>New Conservatives,</strong> the group of “red wall” Tories calling for tighter controls on immigration, have published policy document giving details of their plan. Unusually, it’s a 12-point one, not a 10-point one.</p><p>It does not seem to be available online yet, so here it is.</p><p>1) Close the temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to ‘care workers’ and ‘senior care workers’. This policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000 between those workers and their dependents, leading to a reduction in ‘long-term inward migration’ of 82,000.</p><p>2) Raise the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum. This could reduce LTIM [long-term immigration] by 54,000 migrants per year.</p><p>At Winchester, Oxford, Stanford, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, Sunak was told that if he worked hard and solved problems, he would succeed in life. But political reward is more hard won. One cabinet minister put it this way: “In his mind the deal he struck with the universe is not working out. He’s very clever, but he knows that with cleverness comes responsibility to graft ... But if you work hard and do the right thing, the universe will reward you — and in his mind at the moment the universe is not keeping its side of the bargain.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/03/rishi-sunak-new-conservatives-tory-suella-braverman-migration-nhs-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are self-sufficient rural communities an idea whose time has come? A few years ago, councils and neighbours tended to write them off as hippies. Now attitudes are changing</p><p>In an idyllic corner of the south Somerset countryside, blackbirds chirrup, cart horses swish their tails and a restless wind susurrates through the boughs of a stand of Douglas firs as a cheery band of twenty-to-fiftysomethings pitch in to gather the hay. But for the reusable water bottles and walking boots, they might be characters in an English pastoral, bowed over their rural labours. “When I came here from Brighton I was surprised by how loud it was,” says Meg Willoughby, 28, a resident of Tinkers Bubble. “I had this idea of the peaceful woodland from fairytales, but farm animals are noisy, and when a hill wind blows through firs they make a crazy cracking sound. Nature is wild, isn’t it?”</p><p>Founded in 1994, Tinkers Bubble is England’s leading off-grid woodland community: an experiment in rural living that provides low-impact dwellings and a land-based livelihood to a changing roster of 16 residents. In April, it was granted permanent planning permission by South Somerset council, an achievement heralded as a landmark in off-grid communities’ long attempts to be accepted by mainstream Britain (and its planning department mandarins). They celebrated this success in May with song and home-brewed cider. “Though we’re not big drinkers,” Willoughby says, laughing. “We’re usually back in our cabins with a book by 8pm.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/03/the-rise-of-woodland-off-gridders-it-makes-more-sense-than-a-nine-to-five">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Control director Anton Corbijn’s new film tells the chaotic, tragic story of the creative duo behind some of the most recognisable covers of all time</p><p>Only at the end of our interview does it dawn on both of us that Anton Corbijn has been sitting in front of his huge vinyl record collection at his home in Amsterdam the whole time. It is fitting: not just because Corbijn, now 68, initially made his name by photographing Joy Division and went on to shoot and make music videos for the likes of Depeche Mode, U2, the Killers and REM, but also because he has just directed a documentary, Squaring the Circle (The Story of Hipgnosis), about the celebrated record sleeves of Aubrey “Po” Powell and the late Storm Thorgerson.</p><p>Hipgnosis was one of the trailblazers of album cover design during the golden age of the late 60s and 70s. It conceived the artwork for hundreds of bands and artists including juggernauts such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Peter Gabriel, 10cc and Paul McCartney, all of whom Corbijn has interviewed for this movie. Although they are often more identified with the pre-punk period, their dizzyingly inventive portfolio stretched into 1983, when the partnership ended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/03/anton-corbijn-hipgnosis-film-pink-floyd-led-zeppelin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a searing account of early trauma at the hands of social services and the police, the award-winning writer finds joy and empowerment in his love of music</p><p>Many of the characters in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/alex-wheatle">Alex Wheatle</a>’s novels are sufferahs – those born disadvantaged; outsiders who take on a hostile world and fight against repression and loneliness. His poignant memoir gives us insights into his own suffering: his early life in care, the bullying and abuse he endured, the brutality of the police. Yet <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/sufferah-9781529428421">Sufferah</a></em> also documents his love of reggae, the joy of discovering his paternal family and his journey to become an award-winning writer. Reggae helped define Wheatle, offering him solace during the dark times and inspiring his creativity. As novelist-playwright Vanessa Walters suggests in her introduction: “These anthems provided context and companionship in his struggle.”</p><p>Wheatle was born in south London in 1963. His mother, Almira, briefly resident in the UK without her husband and children, had an affair with his Jamaican-born father, Alfred. After giving birth, Almira returned to her family in Jamaica, entrusting her baby son to Alfred. The pressure of caring for him was too much for the young carpenter and in the summer of 1966 Alex was sent to the Shirley Oaks children’s home in Croydon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/03/sufferah-memoir-of-a-brixton-reggae-head-alex-wheatle-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Studies show abuse of sport officials is getting worse and all of us – fans, parents and media as well as players – are to blame</p><p>A friend’s father holds a Wimbledon record that will surely never be broken: he was the target of the greatest number of f-bombs from John McEnroe on Centre Court. His crime? Calling a Stefan Edberg ace, when it missed the line by a hair’s breadth. In the 1991 quarter-finals. When McEnroe was two sets and a break down. And when his temper was already somewhere between boiling point and nuclear fissure.</p><p>You can guess the rest. “You have got to be kidding me,” McEnroe screamed, wrongly indicating the serve was a foot wide. Then came the usual glares and stares, tuts and head shakes. Before, two points later, he completely lost it. “You effing son of an effing bitch. I’m going to effing do you and, if you report me, I’ll effing do you again.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/03/wimbledon-rant-are-things-better-tennis-mcenroe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Light a candle, wear matching pyjamas, go to bed early. Why has tedium become an aspiration for so many young people?</p><p>In sections of the internet populated by under-30s, one piece of advice has become common: romanticise your life. Take the good things you have and view them more positively – while also, at the same time, making changes to your living situation that will get you closer to the life of your dreams.</p><p>On Instagram, you will find millions of posts from (mostly) young women saying how all their problems were solved by following this guidance. On TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/romanticize-your-life?lang=en">videos on the subject</a> have more than 1.4bn views.

## ‘We exist upon the fringe of the world’: the subversive American poets who fell into obscurity

<p>Jack Spicer and John Wieners both wrote about their homosexuality – and in 50s America, that made them a threat. Forgotten for decades, finally their strange, anguished work has been unearthed</p><p>In mid-century America, avant garde and alternative poetry was considered subversive, dangerous and hostile. To write and publish poems about drugs and sexuality, or poems with anti-nationalist, anti-war sentiment, was to attract suspicion from the authorities. It may have even landed you in prison: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/10/amiri-baraka">Amiri Baraka</a> and Diane Di Prima were among many poets arrested on obscenity charges. Predictably, such subversive writing was often rejected by mainstream publishers – the result being that a lot of great poets and their work fell into obscurity.</p><p>Pilot Press, an imprint founded to “retrieve a philosophy of publishing lost to Aids and capitalism”, is attempting to remedy this with two publications: A Book of Music by Jack Spicer and Solitary Pleasure: Selected Poems, Journals and Ephemera of John Wieners. Spicer and Wieners were mid-century American poets and their work appeared in the groundbreaking The New American Poetry anthology, published in 1960. This collection defined a post-second world war generation of avant garde poets, from John Ashbery to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, who were linked by a shared disillusionment with the hierarchies of the literary establishment. Spicer belonged to the Beat-adjacent San Francisco Renaissance, where he presided over an experimental reading group named The Dharma Committee, which, fuelled by narcotics, attracted the attention of the FBI. Wieners was part of an emergent set of peripatetic poets who vagabonded between different artistic spheres, as comfortable among Spicer’s north California coterie as he was alongside the New York School’s “artworld cocktail ballet scene”, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/allen-ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> described it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/03/jack-spicer-john-wieners-queer-american-poets-madness-and-obscurity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The standup on dressing funny, stealing material from his nan and how a seven-minute set from Omid Djalili led to an obsession with comedy</p><p><strong>How would you describe your style of comedy?<br /></strong>Honest. Too honest. It’s got to the point where my family don’t want to tell me anything. I’ll sit with my nan, she’ll have a drink and tell me stories – and it’s the best stuff I’ve ever heard. I’m almost like a detective, holding a little clipboard. There’s loads of stuff in my family that I still don’t know. Every now and again I find something else out because my nan has had half a bottle of ginger wine. I like people to know where I’m from and what I’m about. I think sometimes people see you on TV shows and think everything is rosy, look at him in his skates [on ITV’s Dancing on Ice], he must be living the life. But that’s just a moment in time, the real me and my life is very different.</p><p><strong>Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?<br /></strong>Here’s a little tip for new comics … When you do audience interaction, don’t touch them. I was quite a new comic and I was doing a gig in the Black Country. There was a guy sitting in the crowd who looked like Jesus. I shook his hand and he pulled me towards him. I think he was trying to be funny. Then I pulled him. I was a 22-year-old man, I was strong. I pulled him and not only did he fall off the chair, he knocked all 17 pints off the table.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/03/darren-harriott-heres-a-tip-when-you-do-audience-interaction-dont-touch-them">Continue reading...</a>

(As of last year, Nehill has left the group.) Every night, Reed ensures their sound shakes the ceiling by playing through two giant guitar stacks and two bass stacks. “If I could play through more,” she admits, “I promise I would.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/03/divide-and-dissolve-doom-band-indigenous-heritage-takiaya-reed">Continue reading...</a>

We were lucky to have been given a large amount of money by our parents, so we had a big deposit of 40% and still had enough left to do a lot of work to the house (which badly needed it). So, when we come to remortgage, we will need a loan of about half the current value of the house.</p><p>Even with a large deposit, we still needed to borrow as much as we could, which was five times our combined salary.

<p>The academic’s discursive, wonderfully enjoyable account of South Asia’s journey from a British colony to three independent nations is a classic</p><p><em><br /></em>The sudden rise of India over the past few years has taken many western observers by surprise. The Indian economy has quadrupled in size in a generation. Its ancient reputation as a centre for mathematics and scientific skills remains intact, and Indian software engineers increasingly dominate Silicon Valley. India now has the largest population in the world and is clearly on its way to becoming the third economic superpower. Its economy overtook the UK last autumn and will overtake Germany and Japan within the next decade. The only questions are whether it is the US, China or India that will dominate the world by the end of this century, and what sort of India that will be.</p><p>Little of this would have surprised our ancestors who first sailed to India with the East India Company at the time of Shakespeare. India then had a population of around 150 million – about a fifth of the world’s total – and was producing about a quarter of global manufacturing; indeed, in many ways it was the world’s industrial powerhouse and the leader in manufactured textiles. The idea that India was ever a poor, famine-struck country is a relatively recent one, dating only from the period of British rule: historically, South Asia was always famous as the richest region of the globe, whose fertile soils gave two harvests a year and whose mines groaned with mineral riches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/03/shadows-at-noon-the-south-asian-twentieth-century-by-joya-chatterji-review-charming-genre-defying-study">Continue reading...</a>

Kramatorsk is the biggest, safest and most accessible town close to the Russian-Ukrainian frontline. Before the full-scale invasion, up to 200,000 people lived there; 80,000 now remain, including military personnel coming for a break, volunteers and journalists. Still, the services on offer are limited, so a central, well-run restaurant with quality wifi, space for meetings and quick meals will always be crowded. I remember Ria’s young waiters always providing perfect service, knowing that everybody was in a rush. Some of them are now <a href="https://www-kramatorskpost-com.translate.goog/error?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true">among the dead</a>.</p><p>The second thought after this new attack was: who was there? One visitor, Victoria Amelina, a famous Ukrainian writer, was taken to hospital in a critical condition. <a href="https://pen.org.ua/ne-stalo-viktoriyi-amelinoyi-ukrayinskoyi-pysmennyci-ta-nashoyi-dorohoyi-kolehy">We learned yesterday</a> that she has died.

Beforehand we prepared together, chatting about how hard it is for us to travel outside Ukraine, and how we drum up the strength and spirit to carry on. We felt defiant.

<p>After retiring from swimming, the Paralympian began researching her origins. This led her to her birth family – and to uncover the shocking difficulties facing other disabled children</p><p>As a child, Ellie Simmonds would fantasise about what her birth mother might be like. In her wildest visions, maybe her birth mother was a rock star, or famous, or extraordinary in some other way. “You never think as a seven-, eight-year-old, that you’re actually going to meet your birth mum,” she says. It turns out that the woman knew exactly who the baby she had given up was – and that the child was the famous and extraordinary one. When Simmonds, then just 13, competed at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, and won two gold medals for swimming, her birth mother put the pieces together: her name, her age, the details of her life that were becoming public. In February this year, they met for the first time.</p><p>Simmonds has made a powerful and very moving documentary – I sobbed throughout – about tracing her birth family, which also highlights the shocking difficulties faced by disabled children waiting to be adopted. Thankfully, this wasn’t the case for Simmonds, who has achondroplasia, or dwarfism – she was adopted within months of being born – but it remains the reality for many other children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/03/ellie-simmonds-paralympic-swimmer-adopted-finding-birth-mother">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘There was never any plan’: inside Germany’s wild architecture theme park

<p>A furniture boss and design enthusiast turned the Vitra Campus into a wonderland of buildings by starchitects from Renzo Piano to Frank Gehry. So why is the final building a modest potting shed? </p><p>A stubbly thatched roof pokes up above a hedge in a field on the outskirts of a small town in south-west Germany, the latest arrival to an unlikely scene of experimental structures dotted around the landscape. Nearby the futuristic profile of a geodesic dome rises, along with the folded aluminium shell of a modernist petrol station and the pitched wooden roof of a 1960s Japanese house. Across another field, there is a gigantic helter-skelter, a jagged concrete fire station and what looks like a teetering stack of supersized Monopoly houses, as well as a number of large industrial sheds that jiggle and jive with their own distinctive architectural ambitions.<br /><br />Welcome to the <a href="https://www.vitra.com/en-gb/about-vitra/campus">Vitra Campus</a>, a fun-filled home to a furniture factory on the edge of Weil am Rhein, at the southern tip of the Black Forest, which has evolved into a curious petting zoo of Pritzker prize-winning architects over the last 40 years. It is where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-gehry">Frank Gehry</a> built his first building outside the US, where Tadao Ando realised his first project outside Japan, and where the late Zaha Hadid completed her first ever building at all, when it looked like her gravity-defying visions might never leave the canvas. Among them stand works by Álvaro Siza, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/renzo-piano">Renzo Piano</a>, Nicholas Grimshaw, Buckminster Fuller, Jean Prouvé, Herzog &amp; de Meuron, Sanaa and more, forming a who’s who of starchitects against the foothills of the Alps.<br /><br />The man with the architectural addiction, who took a chance on these sometimes untested names, is Vitra chairman emeritus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/jun/06/features.magazine37">Rolf Fehlbaum</a>. A softly spoken 82-year-old with a low-key, unassuming manner and thick black spectacles, he cuts an improbable figure as a Medici of 21st-century design. After decades of daring commissions, he has just completed what looks to be his final building on the site – and it couldn’t be further from what has come before.</p><p>“We are now on a completely different trip,” he tells me, looking out at the Tane Garden House, an enigmatic thatched hut raised on little stone legs, designed by the 43-year-old Paris-based Japanese architect <a href="https://at-ta.fr/">Tsuyoshi Tane</a>. “It is the first building we have made with full awareness of the climate crisis. Over the years we knew, of course, but we didn’t really care. We destroyed this natural landscape by building an industrial site. Now I want to let nature take it back.”<br /><br />Fehlbaum and his brother, Raymond, inherited the Vitra company from their mother and father, Erika and Willi, in 1977. Their parents had established the business in the 1950s, as the European manufacturer of glamorous designs by Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson, who Willi had discovered on a trip to the US in 1953, and built a small factory in the bucolic outskirts of Weil am Rhein. A big fire in 1981 destroyed half the campus, and Fehlbaum brought in Grimshaw to build a new modular factory at speed, triggering his lust for working with architects.<br /><br />“There was never any guiding plan,” Fehlbaum admits. “We never held competitions or did research. It was more intuition. For example, I saw Zaha in Blueprint magazine and asked her to design a chair for us, but it wasn’t very good. We didn’t manage a chair, but we managed a building!” His Gehry story is similar: it began with a series of cardboard chairs, before a factory, and then the museum, which <a href="https://www.vitra.com/en-lp/about-vitra/campus/vitra-design-museum">buckles and writhes with chaotic delight</a>, containing the kernel of his later, computer-aided buildings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/03/there-was-never-any-plan-inside-germanys-wild-architecture-theme-park">Continue reading...</a>
