<p>As someone who works in the tech field, I have a lot of gadgets hanging around the house. While I enjoy playing around with my <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520688/i-built-a-theremin-on-a-breadboard-for-the-fun-of-it.html">custom-built theremin</a> (yes it&rsquo;s a real thing) or my embarrassingly decrepit iPhone, there&rsquo;s one gadget that I always seem to reach for: my Kindle. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m a voracious reader, always have been, always will be. Not only does my e-reader hold hundreds of books, but it&rsquo;s also portable and (mostly) distraction-free! It&rsquo;s my most cherished possession, and it&rsquo;s something I use on a day-to-day basis. Just consider&hellip;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oodles-and-oodles-of-books">Oodles and oodles of books</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="El Amazon Kindle (2022) sobre una mesa" class="wp-image-1447605" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Amazon-Kindle-2022_5.webp?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Henry Burrell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Having previously worked in the traditional publishing industry, I know many folks may balk at my positive opinions on electronic books. While I&rsquo;ll always love a physically tangible book made of paper and other materials (nothing will ever replace that experience), I prefer the electronic variety. </p>



<p>I love the convenience of being able to download most books and store them on a single device. I don&rsquo;t have to lug around heavy hardcovers and injure my shoulder in the process. Plus, from wonderfully weird science fiction titles to YA fantasy adventures, I have hundreds of books at my disposal on a device that weighs roughly 6.3 ounces. You can&rsquo;t really get much better than that. </p>



<p>But why would I deliberately choose my Kindle over my iPhone? After all, the iPhone has its own Kindle app. That said, I&rsquo;d rather read my vast library of titles on Kindle&rsquo;s eyeball-friendly e-ink screen. The screen on my iPhone is just too harsh for my tender eyes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="i-can-take-it-anywhere">I can take it anywhere</h2>



<p>My Kindle Voyage weighs approximately 6.3 ounces, which is well under a pound. It&rsquo;s light enough to slip into my purse and take it with me just about anywhere. Whether I&rsquo;m on vacation or in the waiting room at my dentist&rsquo;s office, I enjoy being able to pull it out and dive into whatever novel I&rsquo;m currently reading. It&rsquo;s almost always with me. </p>



<p>The portability factor is why I purchased a Kindle in the first place. Years ago before remote work was more commonplace, I used to take the train to the office. I&rsquo;d pass the time riding Boston&rsquo;s derelict trains by reading my Kindle and escaping reality for a while. </p>



<p>Sure, I can bring my iPhone on the train as well, but the Kindle is featherlight, so I don&rsquo;t mind toting around both devices. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="begone-distractions">Begone, distractions!</h2>



<p>Like most people, I&rsquo;m usually tethered to my iPhone. That said, it can be a massive distraction and there are some days where I want to chuck the thing at a wall. It&rsquo;s where I log into Slack, various social media accounts, browse the web, read the news, and so on. My Kindle is, for the most part, distraction-free because there&rsquo;s no way to access those time-sucking apps. </p>



<p>This lack of access keeps me focused on the book I&rsquo;m reading, which is perfect for my sensibilities. I often deal with racing thoughts and struggle to remain present as a result, so my Kindle helps keep me grounded. This device is truly worth its weight in gold. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-doesnt-give-me-a-headache">It doesn&rsquo;t give me a headache</h2>



<p>Most devices with a screen emit blue light that disrupts your sleep and causes eye strain. Kindle e-readers can emit blue light as well, but my device has a warm light mode and it&rsquo;s a godsend to those who regularly suffer from headaches (hi). </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m very sensitive to blue light, so I have to take regular breaks from looking at my computer screen throughout the day. I also like to play video games and read before bedtime in my free time, so I&rsquo;m more exposed to blue light than most. Thankfully, the warm light mode on my Kindle is much easier on my eyes, as it adds a pleasant yellow-orange tint to the screen. Kindle devices also use Carta screen tech, which is designed to mimic the reading experience of real-world paper and reduce eyestrain. </p>

<p>Listen, your laptop is at risk both on vacation and on business trips. There&rsquo;s always a risk of losing the device or having it stolen, so to help mitigate risk, the laptop tracking experts over at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.absolute.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1974661-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Absolute Software</a> have compiled nine tips for students, professional travelers, and vacationers. We&rsquo;ve also included free tools and download tips. </p>



<p><strong>1.  Watch out:</strong> If the laptop is left unsecured, it should never be left unattended. So keep an eye on it, or lock it away.</p>



<p><strong>2.  Laptop locks:</strong> Although laptop locks can be torn out of their plastic casings and thus cannot rule out theft 100 percent, they are a good visual deterrent. In addition, forcible removal will attract the attention of people in the vicinity. If you&rsquo;re looking for a good laptop lock, check out the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Dell-Cable-Laptops-Wedge/dp/B07SHJ1RC8&amp;xcust=2-1-1974661-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Kensington N17</a>, which is on sale for $19.99 at Amazon.</p>



<p><strong>3.  Camouflage:</strong> Transport laptops as inconspicuously as possible, preferably in a simple carrier bag or backpack. Don&rsquo;t forget, however, that notebooks should still be adequately protected from knocks and falls.</p>



<p><strong>4.  Secure passwords:</strong> High-quality devices should always be protected with a complex password consisting of a combination of numbers. Passwords should also be changed regularly.</p>



<p><strong>5.  Efficient defence:</strong> Virus protection, encryption solutions, firewalls, VPN solutions, and anti-spyware protect against unauthorized access and the theft of personal data. Be sure to check out PCWorld&rsquo;s roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPN services</a>.</p>



<p><strong>6.  Consistent backup:</strong> Often, the data stored on a computer is worth far more than the device itself. A regular backup can significantly minimize the risk of data loss due to theft or a defective system and the appropriate backup tools are available for free. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such a service, check out PCWorld&rsquo;s roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup software</a>.</p>



<p><strong>7.  Only use legally purchased software:</strong> The use of hacked software and the multiple use of licences can not only lead to criminal charges, but also significantly increase your vulnerability to viruses, Trojans, and other malware. </p>



<p><strong>8.  Check insurance policies:</strong> Some insurance policies cover the costs of stolen computers, even if they were stolen outside the home. </p>



<p><strong>9.  Install stolen computer tracking and recovery software:</strong> If a laptop has been stolen, there is software that will track it down. Your options include both commercial software as well as the built-in Windows tracking function: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://account.microsoft.com/devices&amp;xcust=2-1-1974661-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">To do this, log in here with your Microsoft account</a> and then click on &ldquo;Find my device.&rdquo;</p>
