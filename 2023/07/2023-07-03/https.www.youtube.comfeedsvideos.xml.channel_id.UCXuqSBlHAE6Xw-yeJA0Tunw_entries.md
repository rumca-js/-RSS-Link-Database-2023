Are you a sucker for good laptop IO? Do you need every single port? Well turns out there's still devices out there with things like optical drives, full sized SD card readers, and VGA, while also having modern comforts like Thunderbolt 4. But...they're only available in Japan. Why does this market still exist in one place while being completely forgotten everywhere else?
