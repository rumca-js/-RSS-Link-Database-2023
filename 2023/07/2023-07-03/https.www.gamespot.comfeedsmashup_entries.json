href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/\">Steam Deck</a> has emerged as one of the best platforms for gaming on the go, but it's not exactly the most comfortable system to grip your hands around for long sessions. Satisfye is aiming to change that with its new Stylthgrip, an add-on that wraps your steam Deck in a protective shroud that comes with more ergonomic hand grips.</p><p>These are essentially more in line with the shapes that you'd find on an Xbox wireless controller or PlayStation DualSense--grips that can nestle inside of your hand more securely. Satisfye has also developed this add-on with materials that <em>should </em>prevent any unfortunate slips from sweaty palms--we get it, Lego Star Wars is intense--and an ABS backplate adds another layer of security.</p><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4160433-deck-grip-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"The StylthGrip for the Steam Deck.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4160433-deck-grip-2.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>The StylthGrip for the Steam Deck.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.satisfye.com/collections/stylthgrip/products/stylthgrip\">Stylthgrip</a> </span> -- $50 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.satisfye.com/collections/stylthgrip/products/stylthgrip-bundle\">Stylthgrip bundle</a> </span> -- $80 ($<del>90</del>)</li></ul><p>The good news is that even with this thick-yet-flexible shell on your Steam Deck, you can still place it in the official Steam Deck dock for when you need to recharge it. Satisfye says that its design redistributes the weight of the Steam Deck to your palms, and it'll be available in two bundles. The first preorder option, which costs $60, is just for the Stylthgrip, while the $90 bundle throws in a StylthGrip hard cover, RYZE pad wave set of analogue sticks, and RYZE pad rubbers. Both editions come with a screen protector and tin case, and shipping will begin in September.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-steam-deck-accessory-will-help-you-get-a-comfortable-grip-on-the-device/1100-6515647/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-steam-deck-accessory-will-help-you-get-a-comfortable-grip-on-the-device/1100-6515647/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-03T16:51:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "HBO Shows Officially Headed To Netflix, But Not Game Of Thrones Or The Last Of Us", "description": "<p>Confirming <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-content-could-be-coming-to-netflix-report/1100-6515374/\">earlier reports</a>, WB Discovery has revealed that some of its HBO shows are coming to Netflix.

This particular brand of film preservation highlights not only classics and avant-garde movies, but it also extends to Hollywood blockbusters, B-movie horror, and some of the weirder content from bygone eras. Each entry in this library is an exemplary film of its kind according to Criterion, and these editions often include restored film transfers along with commentary tracks and other kinds of supplemental features.</p><p>Criterion has been pioneering this approach since the days of LaserDisc, and Criterion has been working closely with filmmakers and scholars to ensure that each film is presented as its maker would want it seen. Not only do you get a great movie to enjoy, but you also gain insight into how these iconic films were developed.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-50-on-the-criterion-collection-for-a-limited-time/1100-6515634/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-50-on-the-criterion-collection-for-a-limited-time/1100-6515634/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-03T10:40:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
