Final Fantasy 16 is an impressive accomplishment in more ways than one, and from its story and setting to its worldbuilding and more, there’s plenty to love about the latest action RPG. Arguably though, the one aspect of the experience that probably stands above everything else is the combat. 

Turning Final Fantasy 16 into a fully real-time action-based combat system was a big call by its development team, but in doing so they’ve delivered one of the genre's best combat offerings to do. Effectively a character action game in all but name, Final Fantasy 16 arms players with a devastating pool of abilities and moves, a pool that grows deeper the more you play, and allows you to express yourself in combat in endless ways. Here, we’re going to talk about a few of the best abilities in the game that form a huge part of that.

Hi-Fi Rush, Final Fantasy 16 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are a few of the amazing titles released this year. Despite only being six months in, 2023 is already looking to be one for the history books in terms of quality games.

Sadly, not every title is a winner. Some struggle with massive expectations and ultimately falter behind the scenes, releasing in a shoddy unfinished state. Some had promise but ultimately faltered under the weight of their ambitions. Others do little to deliver on the most basic gameplay elements, much less present a coherent story.

Here are 15 of the worst titles released thus far in 2023 and what made them so bad.
