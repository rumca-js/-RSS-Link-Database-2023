But fairplay to this bachelor party taking the piss out of another protest from the eco-clowns with "Just Stop Oil."</p><p>(I know Brits call it a "stag party," but they also call french fries "chips" and soccer "football").</p><p>Taking a break from destroying <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girl-with-a-pearl-earring" target="_blank">priceless works of art</a>, JSO was doing a basic "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uk-activist-carried-away" target="_blank">block traffic and wonder why no one takes us seriously</a>" protest. That's when these blokes on their way to party in Ibiza got involved. The guy dressed like he's going to a pride parade is the bachelor. Referring to the bachelor party as "drunken" is conjecture, but we can smell our own.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The gas faces of the two dames holding the banner are brilliant.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>This protestor is wondering why the men in the protest aren't stepping up to do anything, Then she remembers, "Oh year, they're all a bunch of pussies."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>The groom-to-be is Charlie Pearce. The stag group, who turns out are all "very passionate against how the eco-zealots carry out their demonstrations," were on their way for a weekend of revelry in Ibiza, a Spanish party Island. </p><p>"'It's hard to peak what we've just done in Waterloo. We trekked across London, got on the plane, landed in Ibiza and I was quite happy just to go home! It was just funny as it was."</p><p>The group decided to use the banner as a counter-protest, sarcastically holding it as their debauchery got more debaucherific.</p><p>"Look, apart from their cause, I am against causing disruption to people's lives especially when it's a big event which people save a lot of money for and then people try and disrupt it. It's not fair on people working hard enjoying their lives and people come along and think its OK to jump in and ruin things."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>The bachelor says everyone from their UK suburb has seen the video and is having a good laugh about it. There is even a chance the banners makes a cameo at the wedding. God save the King, mate!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Former Anheuser-Busch president demands CEO step down over Bud Light debacle in scathing letter

Having it come from the former president of AB makes it that much more biting. In an open letter <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12252375/Anheuser-Busch-CEO-failed-fix-Bud-Light-crisis-quit-says-ex-president-sales.html" target="_blank">published in The Daily Mail</a>, former AB president Anson Fredericks said that after $20 billion dollars in losses and ample time to fix the f*ck up, Whitworth has cost shareholders enough money. He gots to go.</p><p>There were two developments that are causing Fredericks to say enough is enough. One was Whitworth breaking his silence about the issue on CBS Morning <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-cbs-mornings" target="_blank">by not addressing the issue or even mentioning Dylan Mulvaney</a> -- the controversial titface performer at the center of the drama -- by name. The other was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light-response" target="_blank">Mulvaney breaking his silence as essentially saying</a>, "Seriously, what the f*ck, dude?"</p><blockquote>Whitworth has clearly shown himself to be incapable of solving the Mulvaney crisis. He’s had multiple chances and he’s failed.</blockquote><p>A simple "whoops, we f*cked up" fifteen billion dollars ago would have helped. Instead, on <em>CBS Mornings</em> Whitworth played corporate Mad Libs talking about "big social conversations" and needing to "deeply understand and appreciate" what the customer cares about. The customer cares about you not hating them. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market" target="_blank">Once the customer learns how much you hate them in real life</a>, lame marketing campaigns won't fix it.</p><p>Fredericks continued, mentioning Mulaveny showing to have a bigger bulge than Whitworth.</p><blockquote>On Thursday, Mulvaney did something Whitworth should have had the wisdom to do weeks ago – cut ties. ... Anheuser-Busch’s response on Friday was predictably weak and indecisive:<br /><br />'As we move forward, we will focus on what we do best – brewing great beer for everyone and earning our place in moments that matter to our consumers.’<br /><br />What does that mean? Absolutely nothing. And it will only deepen the chasm between the brand and its customers.</blockquote><p>Yeah, turns out it was more than "just one can." Bud Light signed Mulvaney to an entire brand ambassadorship to help shed the former #1 beer in America's "fratty and out of touch" customer base. </p><blockquote>As such – and I take no pleasure in passing this judgement – it's clear to me that it's time for the shareholders and board of Anheuser-Busch to ask Whitworth to step down.</blockquote><p>Whitworth's plan is to do nothing and hope that people forget. Now he has managed to piss off both sides. His core base of middle-class Americans who want to drink beer and be left alone. And the woke left who demand companies affirm their every worldview. If it's not Mulvaney, it's getting the MLB All-Star game moved out of Atlanta or demanding every company in America issue a statement anytime the left has a bug up their ass over a piece of legislation.</p><p>Prior to the Bud Light debacle, Whitworth would have made a safe bet. Companies only heard from one side of the argument. Now the other side is speaking out and forcing companies to make a choice BEFORE taking political sides. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
