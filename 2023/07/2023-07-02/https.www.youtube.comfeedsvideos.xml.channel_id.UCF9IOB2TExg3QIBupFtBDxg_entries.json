some are unable to make a determination. \n\nAll IC agencies assess that SARS-CoV-2 was not developed as a biological weapon. \n\nWIV ACTIVITIES PERFORMED WITH OR ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE\u2019S LIBERATION ARMY\n \nWIV personnel have worked with scientists associated with the PLA on public health-related research and collaborated on biosafety and biosecurity projects.\n\nInformation available to the IC indicates that some of the research conducted by the PLA and WIV included work with several viruses, including coronaviruses,\n\nbut no known viruses that could plausibly be a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2. \n\nFor example, PLA researchers have used WIV laboratories for virology and vaccine-related work. \n\nBetween 2017 and 2019, the WIV funded and conducted research projects to enhance China\u2019s knowledge of pathogens and early disease warning capabilities for defensive and biosecurity needs of the military. \n\nWIV collaborated with the PLA on other vaccine and therapeutics relevant to coronaviruses. \n\nCORONAVIRUS RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES PERFORMED AT THE WIV \n\nWe assess WIV scientists conducted extensive research on coronaviruses, which included animal sampling and genetic analysis. \n\nNo any direct evidence that a specific research-related incident occurred involving WIV personnel before the pandemic that could have caused the COVID pandemic.\n\n WIV Coronavirus Research and Holdings \n\nThe WIV probably maintains one of the world\u2019s largest repositories of bat samples, \n\nwhich has enabled its coronavirus research \n\nWIV first possessed SARS-CoV-2 in late December 2019, when WIV researchers isolated and identified the virus from samples from patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown causes. \n\nSince 2019, some WIV researchers analyzed pangolin samples to better understand disease outbreaks in these animals. \n\nBy the end of 2019, the WIV maintained distinct teams focused on MERS and SARS-related coronaviruses. \n\nBoth teams separately used transgenic mouse models to better understand how the viruses infect humans\n\nNot mentioned\n\nOnly one focus of outbreak\n\nNo animal intermediate identified\n\nPoor WHO visits\n\nWIV may have begun developing two Covid vaccines in November 2019\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23780776-mwg-fdr-document-04-16-23\n\n(Prior to 8th December 2018)\n\nU.S. Consulate General in Wuhan\n\nAn increase in adult Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI)\n\nOctober to November 2019\n\n(accompanied by negative results)\n\nstatistically significantly higher than reported in the previous 5 years\n\n\u201cBy mid-October 2019, the dedicated team at the U.S. Consulate General in Wuhan knew that the city had been struck by what was thought to be an unusually vicious flu season. \n\nThe disease worsened in November.\u201d\n\nChina CDC\n\nNone of the samples taken from the 18 animal species found in the market were positive for SARS- CoV-2. \n\nEcoHealth Alliance and NIH funding\n\nEcoHealth Alliance with the WIV, Project DEFUSE: Defusing the Threat of Bat-borne Coronaviruses \n\nMid-October to mid-November 2019\n\nWIV collected 20,000 bat and animal samples by 2019, but did not disclose all of the viruses\n\nBefore 2019, the WIV published sequences in a public database, taken offline in September 2019", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aJhwW44U2c", "date_published": "2023-07-02T13:47:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
