Now we must fight | Rebecca Solnit", "description": "<p>The court is part of a gang of reactionaries clawing back rights we already won, which means we can win them back</p><p>The first thing to remember about the damage done by the US supreme court this June and the June before is that each majority decision overturns a right that we had won. We had won a measure of student debt relief thanks to the heroic efforts of debt activists since 2011. We had won reproductive rights protection 50 years ago with Roe v Wade, and we won wetlands protection with the Clean Water Act around the same time. We had implemented affirmative action, AKA a redress of centuries of institutionalized inequality, step by step, in many ways over the past 60-plus years. We had won rights for same-sex couples and queer people in a series of laws and decisions.</p><p>What this means is that the right wing of the US supreme court is part of a gang of reactionaries engaging in backlash. It also means we can win these things back. It will not be easy, but difficult is not impossible. This does not mean that the decisions are not devastating, and that we should not feel the pain. The old saying \u201cdon\u2019t mourn, organize\u201d has always worked better for me as \u201cmourn, but also organize\u201d. Defeat is no reason to stop. Neither is victory a reason to stop when victory is partial or needs to be defended. You can celebrate victories, mourn defeats and keep going.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/02/us-supreme-court-civil-rights-voting-fight\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/02/us-supreme-court-civil-rights-voting-fight", "date_published": "2023-07-02T08:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Remote working is like a dating app: isolating, joyless and bad for us.
