  <p id="gYi9Y1">Boutique Belgian electric bicycle maker Cowboy just added a new more upright and comfortable commuter e-bike to its portfolio. The so-called Cruiser takes the grips, wide saddle, and more relaxed riding position of the company’s C4ST (step-through) model and adds a top bar and a wider swept-back handlebar. It’s the Dutch-style e-bike you buy if you already liked the C4 but disliked its aggressive forward riding position, skinny saddle, and narrow handlebars.</p>
<p id="dvpoMG">I had a chance to test ride the new 19.3kg Cruiser against the original C4 (now renamed Classic) and step-through C4ST (now known as the Cruiser ST) in Amsterdam at one of Cowboy’s new retail partners — an initiative that launched in May with independent bike shops across Europe. </p>

  <p id="ODREyj">Apple may be planning a new display with a custom Apple silicon chip — similar to the A13-powered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22981744/apple-studio-display-5k-monitor-webcam-speakers-review">Studio Display</a> — that would allow it to be gain behavior that’s completely independent of the Mac, such as the ability to act as a smart display when not in use, said <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in the subscriber-only version of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-02/apple-airpods-plans-hearing-test-body-temperature-cheaper-models-usb-c-ljlfwffu?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.</p>

For instance, the company may be working on a 27-inch mini-LED display and a follow-up to the pricey Apple Pro Display XDR, with the ability to summon Siri built into the displays themselves, possibly.</p>

<p id="twcr7Z">Gurman said that early in the Vision Pro’s development cycle, Apple tested third-party virtual reality controllers from companies like HTC. Later, it looked into the finger-worn device — indeed, in 2015 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9433509/apple-smart-ring-patent-application">a smart ring patent</a> from the company emerged, though at the time seemed more intended as a general wearable device, not something specific to a mixed reality headset. </p>

  <p id="5nYc91">Some AirPods will be gaining a new hearing health feature, supported by iOS 17, that can check yourself for potential hearing issues and may be able to determine your body temperature via your ear canal, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in today’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-02/apple-airpods-plans-hearing-test-body-temperature-cheaper-models-usb-c-ljlfwffu?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Power On </em>newsletter</a>. He also says all of Apple’s new headphones will include USB-C, and that the company is planning new AirPods Pro and AirPods Max models — but he doesn’t think new hardware is coming soon.</p>
<p id="HzsKSq">AirPods already support audiograms — audio profiles that tell the AirPods where your hearing may be weakest so that they can tune themselves to your hearing abilities. Right now, you can generate an audiogram using the app Mimi, which Apple would be Sherlocking — an infamous Apple...</p>
