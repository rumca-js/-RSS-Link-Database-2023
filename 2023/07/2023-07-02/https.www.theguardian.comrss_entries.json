In 1975, he was cutting his teeth as a cub reporter for LBC Radio when he heard rumblings of an incident on Balcombe Street in London. Thanks to his famous love of cycling, he was first on the scene, breathlessly reporting the IRA siege that was unfolding, live, as it happened. \u201cI should have been afraid, yet I was so busy reporting I didn\u2019t get the chance,\u201d he says.</p><p>It made him certain that journalism was indeed the career for him, and this fascinating documentary follows him through his early years as a foreign correspondent for ITN and then his 32-year stint as the anchor for Channel 4 News, a seat he only recently vacated.

It\u2019s an intriguing corrective to the well-worn idea that the Stooges were largely greeted with incomprehension and revulsion: in Cincinnati, at least, the audience seemed to love them.

But with the greatest of respect, his fellow elder statesmen don\u2019t do what Iggy Pop does on stage, which is pretty much what Iggy Pop has always done. He flings himself to the floor, clambers over the speakers, holds his microphone stand above his head then hurls it across the stage midway through I Wanna Be Your Dog. He sings Nightclubbing, punctuating his vocals by sticking the microphone in his mouth and pretending to give it a blowjob.

Come out, lose your phone! Come out, take two days to recover, tell everyone the wrong secrets! Come out, it will cost \u00a3100 and you\u2019ll twist your ankle!

It\u2019s even lower in alcohol, too (5%abv v 7.5% for the spumante), an attribute that is all-the-more important in the heat.
