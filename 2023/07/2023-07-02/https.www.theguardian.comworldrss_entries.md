<p>Australian house prices rose by 1.1% in June, CoreLogic data shows. Follow the day’s news live</p><p>Australian house prices rose by 1.1% in June, with Sydney leading the charge as every capital city except Hobart saw dwelling values go up.</p><p>But the market is still 6% lower than its peak, according to data from CoreLogic’s national home value index.<br /><br />The report says median dwelling value is $45,711 below the $768,777 recorded in April 2022.<br /><br />Sydney house prices increased 1.7% in June, taking the cumulative recovery to 6.7% since January. Median housing prices rose by roughly $4,262 a week in Sydney, CoreLogic’s research director Tim Lawless said.<br /><br />He said lack of supply was keeping prices up, with the new listings in capital cities down 10% below the previous five year average.<br /><br />The flow of new listings of sales is likely to be subdued during winter, and supply will remain tight over the coming months.<br /><br />In terms of rental prices, the national rental index went up a further 0.7% in June, but at a slower rate since January 2023. The annual growth trend for rents across the capital cities was 11.5%. Canberra was the only capital to record a fall in rents in the last year, down 2.8%, with an increase in supply and vacancy rates aiding the drop.<br /><br />Overall rental vacancy rates have gone up a little in the past few months, but remain well below average levels, the report states.</p><p>The first priority is to marry up Indonesian industry with [Australia’s] lithium industry.</p><p>The lithium goals is for Indonesia to become an EV powerhouse, and there is interest to find lithium partners for collaboration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jul/03/australia-news-live-sydney-house-prices-surge-indonesian-leader-joko-visit-inquiry-into-historical-lgbtq-deaths">Continue reading...</a>

The “stick” is being threatened with deportation and related consequences such as a five-year ban on returning to the US, unless they agree to leave – before they go through the interview that screens for a credible fear of going home.
