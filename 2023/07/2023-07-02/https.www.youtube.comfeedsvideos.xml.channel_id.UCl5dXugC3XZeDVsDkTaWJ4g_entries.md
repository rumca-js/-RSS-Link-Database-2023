In the fifth video of this series, I took the Funicular and Cable car from Innsbruck city to Halfelekar top to see the stunning 'Top of Innsbruck.' Afterwards, I visited the Swarovski Museum, also known as Swarovski Kristallwelten. Luckily, I had my Innsbruck card, which cost 53 Euros and included public transport. Visiting both places individually would have been much more expensive. #Austria #TravelVlog #mountaintrekkers

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, I now get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.
