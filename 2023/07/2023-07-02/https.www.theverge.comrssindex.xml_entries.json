The so-called Cruiser takes the grips, wide saddle, and more relaxed riding position of the company\u2019s C4ST (step-through) model and adds a top bar and a wider swept-back handlebar. It\u2019s the Dutch-style e-bike you buy if you already liked the C4 but disliked its aggressive forward riding position, skinny saddle, and narrow handlebars.</p>\n<p id=\"dvpoMG\">I had a chance to test ride the new 19.3kg Cruiser against the original C4 (now renamed Classic) and step-through C4ST (now known as the Cruiser ST) in Amsterdam at one of Cowboy\u2019s new retail partners \u2014 an initiative that launched in May with independent bike shops across Europe. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n...</figure>\n</div>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23781704/cowboy-cruiser-e-bike-price-specs-test-ride\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/23781704/cowboy-cruiser-e-bike-price-specs-test-ride", "date_published": "2023-07-02T22:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "Apple may be planning a new, more independent Mac display", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"The Mac Studio, Mac Studio Display, keyboard, and mouse seen from the front on a wooden table.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4Jx5sSrmm60WunoMlTxcnq0uW0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72420786/bfarsace_171209_5072_0006.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"ODREyj\">Apple may be planning a new display with a custom Apple silicon chip \u2014 similar to the A13-powered <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22981744/apple-studio-display-5k-monitor-webcam-speakers-review\">Studio Display</a> \u2014 that would allow it to be gain behavior that\u2019s completely independent of the Mac, such as the ability to act as a smart display when not in use, said <em>Bloomberg</em>\u2019s Mark Gurman in the subscriber-only version of his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-02/apple-airpods-plans-hearing-test-body-temperature-cheaper-models-usb-c-ljlfwffu?sref=ExbtjcSG\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.</p>\n<p id=\"k1ESMe\">Rumors have swirled about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/18/23515070/apple-monitors-pro-display-xdr-rumors\">Apple\u2019s display plans</a> for a little while.
