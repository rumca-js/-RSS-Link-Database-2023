Some struggle with massive expectations and ultimately falter behind the scenes, releasing in a shoddy unfinished state. Some had promise but ultimately faltered under the weight of their ambitions. Others do little to deliver on the most basic gameplay elements, much less present a coherent story.\n\nHere are 15 of the worst titles released thus far in 2023 and what made them so bad.\n\nThumbnail credit: Kotaku", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29R8fVyswuk", "date_published": "2023-07-02T13:30:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
