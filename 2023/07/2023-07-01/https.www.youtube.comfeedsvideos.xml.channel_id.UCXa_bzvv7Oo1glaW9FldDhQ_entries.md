What the future holds for Reptile remains to be seen. The upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 is once again going to reboot the series and take players to a completely new timeline. Reptile is, of course, something of a series staple, even if he may not be as narrative pivotal to the series at large as many others are- so there’s a good chance that he does end up making in appearance in the upcoming reboot. 

If he does, it should be interesting to see what kind of changes NetherRealm Studios makes to his backstory and his arc in this new and rebooted universe. After all, the primary reason for this timeline was to give everybody a much more peaceful life- so does that mean that in this timeline, the Saurians didn’t suffer the devastating fate they did in the two timelines we’ve seen so far? 

Does that mean Reptile will have a less tragic backstory, and, in turn, much more agency as a character? Rather than just aligning himself with people who make vague promises to him that never actually get realized, is Reptile now going to be a personality who has much more of a meaningful say in the events that unfold in the story? If he does show up, that is.
