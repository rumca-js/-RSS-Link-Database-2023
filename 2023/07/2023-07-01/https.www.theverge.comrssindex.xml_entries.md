  <p id="IyVZ7X">Bluesky, a decentralized <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/29/23701500/bluesky-twitter-replacement">Twitter-like social network</a>, is pausing new signups “temporarily” to try and resolve performance issues it’s been experiencing after Twitter introduced limits on the amount of tweets you can see in a day. Even though you still need an invite code to be able to join Bluesky, it seems that the influx of new users has been a problem.</p>
<p id="C85YIF">“We will temporarily be pausing Bluesky sign-ups while our team continues to resolve the existing performance issues,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3jzihryv25y2m">Bluesky wrote in a post</a>. “We’ll keep you updated when invite codes will resume functionality. We’re excited to welcome more users to our beta soon!”</p>

  <p id="G14Kqu">On Thursday, various outlets reported on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/142j3yt/valve_is_not_willing_to_publish_games_with_ai/">June Reddit post</a> from user potterharry97 saying that Steam would no longer be publishing games with AI-generated content. Later in the month, another game dev penned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/14lybmc/im_depressed_because_i_cant_use_ai_anymore_due_to/">a similar post</a>. Valve says that’s not quite right.</p>
<p id="2yzfdB">In a statement emailed to <em>The Verge,</em> Valve PR representative Kaci Boyle said the company’s goal is “not to discourage the use of [AI] on Steam; instead, we’re working through how to integrate it into our already-existing review policies.” She went on to say that the company’s current review process takes into account current copyright law, and that “while developers can use these AI technologies in their work... they can not infringe on existing copyrights.”</p>

  <p id="5hxVip">The moderators of Reddit’s IAmA community will no longer solicit and coordinate ask me anything (AMA) conversations with celebrities and high-profile individuals, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14nte7z/mod_post_the_future_of_iama/">they wrote in a post on Saturday</a>. </p>
<p id="z04igh">Reddit’s AMAs featuring notable people have become an iconic aspect of the platform, giving regular users the chance to ask questions of people they may otherwise never have a chance to speak with. (Bill Gates <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/109eze3/im_bill_gates_and_im_back_for_my_11th_ama_ask_me/">has done 11 of them</a>.) The AMAs are usually a fascinating mix of interesting perspective and personal anecdotes, even if the person being featured is usually doing some sort of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/">self-promotion</a>.

It appears as though that was a mistake, however, because the app is nowhere to be found now.</p>
<p id="EDImMg">Paluzzi included screenshots that showed off some of the UI elements, including the login screen, which lets users sign in with their Instagram accounts, and another screen with a list of their followed accounts from the image and video site, so they can choose who to follow on Threads.

  <p id="o0whR2">Elon Musk continues to blame Twitter’s new limitations on AI companies scraping “vast amounts of data” as he announced new “temporary” limits on how many posts people can read. </p>
<p id="tNYlff">Now unverified accounts will only be able to see 600 posts per day, and for “new” unverified accounts, just 300 in a day. The limits for verified accounts (presumably whether they’re bought as a part of the Twitter Blue subscription, granted through an organization, or verification Elon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691831/twitter-blue-verified-celebrity-lebron-james-stephen-king">forced on people</a> like Stephen King, LeBron James, and anyone else with more than a million followers) still allow reading only a maximum of 6,000 posts per day.</p>
<p id="q27YEp">Shortly after that, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1675214274627530754">tweeted</a> that the rate limits would “soon” increase to 8,000 tweets for verified users, 800 for...</p>

  <p id="k2XHAH">The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will expand its facial recognition program to around 430 US airports over the next several years following what it calls “extremely promising” results in its pilot program, according to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90918235/tsa-facial-recognition-program-privacy?partner=rss"><em>Fast Company</em></a>. The agency reportedly said its program yielded 97% effective results across all demographics, including those with dark skin. The program is currently in use in 25 airports.</p>
<p id="KeI00d">As pointed out in <em>Fast Company</em>’s story<em>, </em>a 97% effectiveness rate across more than two million airline passengers per day means that, for over 60,000 of those people, the biometrics won’t work properly if it’s used in every airport in the country.</p>
