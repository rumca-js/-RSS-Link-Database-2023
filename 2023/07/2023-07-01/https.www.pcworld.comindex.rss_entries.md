<p>One of the greatest challenges of traveling is getting around your destination without speaking the language. MyManu offers an elegant solution to that problem with the truly wireless <a href="https://shop.pcworld.com/sales/mymanu-clik-s-award-winning-translation-earbuds?utm_source=pcworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mymanu-clik-s-award-winning-translation-earbuds&amp;utm_term=scsf-573839&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004IqMWQA0&amp;scsonar=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CLIK S earbuds</a>.

<p>Rather than <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1917535/learn-a-new-language-before-your-summer-trip-with-babbel-only-199-97.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">learn a new language</a> from scratch, MyManu&rsquo;s dual-sided CLIK buttons let you leisurely switch between enjoying your music in HD sound and translating in real-time whether you&rsquo;re face-to-face with somebody or on the phone. It translates 1-on-1 or group conversation in real-time by speech or text, showing the translation on the app&rsquo;s clipboard so you always understand what&rsquo;s going on. Plus, with the phrasebook, you can save frequently used phrases for quick access later. And, of course, you can still answer calls and read notifications just like you would with other wireless earbuds.</p>
