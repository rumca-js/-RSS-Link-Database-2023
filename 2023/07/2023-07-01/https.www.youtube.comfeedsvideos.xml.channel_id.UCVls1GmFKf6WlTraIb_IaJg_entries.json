This is an OFF-TOPIC live stream.  So let's talk mostly about non-Linux-y stuff: food, music, movies, books, hobbies, work, life, etc.  Ask your questions!  If they are not too asinine, I might answer them.\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n\ud83d\udcb0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n\ud83d\udcb3 Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr...\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n\ud83d\udc55 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nSOCIAL PLATFORMS: \n\ud83d\udde8\ufe0f Mastodon: https://distrotoot.com/@derek\n\ud83d\udc6b Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f LBRY/Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@DistroTu...\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f Website: http://distro.tube\n\ud83d\udcc1 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n\ud83c\udf10 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n\ud83c\udfac Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n\ud83c\udfa8 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n\ud83c\udfb5  Ardour: https://ardour.org/\n\ud83d\udcbb VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Doom Emacs: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.
