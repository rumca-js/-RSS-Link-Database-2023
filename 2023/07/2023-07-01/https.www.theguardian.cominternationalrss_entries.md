<p>A long, bruising day trying to take wickets seemed to take its toll on the hosts, before Australia showed them how it’s done </p><p>Ahh, Bazballs. The old salts around the ground have been complaining for days that England need to learn there’s more than one way to play this game. Saturday turned out to be an object lesson in exactly that. England slogged up the long, hard road to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/01/england-australia-cricket-ashes-second-test-report">taking the wickets they needed</a> and once they finally had them watched Australia canter down the straight, short one.</p><p>They still need six more to win, but then three of those bat below Stuart Broad. England, on the other hand, probably need Ben Stokes to work the same <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/26/ben-stokes-miracle-headingley-test-record-sky" title="">sort of miracle he did at Headingley</a> in 2019 else they will be two-nil down with three games to play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/01/cricket-england-australia-ashes-fielding-self-flagellation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The manager used all of her attacking riches in a bid to break down Portugal before their World Cup adventure begins</p><p>When it comes to foreign travel there are two types of people. The first leaves things late, hits the check-in desk just before closing, takes foreign currency from the airport cash point and forgets to print out the car hire voucher. The second, well, suffice to say that this group would include Sarina Wiegman.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/01/england-women-portugal-international-friendly-match-report" title="">friendly stalemate in the benign surrounds of Milton Keynes</a> is unlikely to offer much in the way of insight as to how the Women’s World Cup will pan out when it kicks off this month. But it did show the England head coach placing an emphasis on match fitness and flexibility before her team step on the plane to the antipodes. It seems inarguable she’d also leave enough time to get through airport security.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/01/meticulous-sarina-wiegman-learns-plenty-for-englands-flight-path">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Australian tennis player revels in defying convention and now returns to the scene of his 2022 final loss – where tradition is everything</p><p>As Nick Kyrgios trained on the Aorangi practice courts at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/30/qualifying-elation-and-despair-at-final-hurdle-before-wimbledon-tennis">Wimbledon</a> on Thursday, a club photographer snapped a moody portrait that seemed to capture the Australian’s essence. Wearing his white peaked hat backwards and sporting a dangling necklace, two earrings in his left lobe and a full beard, Kyrgios’s eyes were narrowed and his brow furrowed. For that split second, with his glance cast towards the camera with suspicion, last year’s finalist appeared as watchful as a toddler about to have their favourite toy taken away.</p><p>Never one completely in love with tennis, the Canberran has additional reason to feel angst heading into the major beginning on Monday after a difficult preparation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/02/nick-kyrgioss-chaos-and-the-contrast-with-wimbledons-demand-for-order">Continue reading...</a>

## Mokoomba: Tusona: Tracings in the Sand review – stirring pan-African sounds from Zimbabwe

<p>(Outhere)<br />The Zimbabwean festival favourites continue their mix of spirituality and exuberance to great effect</p><p>Zimbabwean group <a href="https://mokoomba.band/">Mokoomba</a> have made quite an impression since coming to the fore 10 years back, delivering two fine albums, becoming international festival favourites and reclaiming their country’s musical identity. This third album affirms their savvy mix of spirituality and exuberance; more electric than 2017’s semi-acoustic <em>Luyando</em>, more polished than their debut, <em>Rising Tide</em>.</p><p>While grounded in the traditions of the Luvale people of the Zambezi – the group hail from Victoria Falls – their sound is pan-African. A blend of Zimbabwe’s tumbling chimurenga rhythms and Congo’s soukous guitars underpin uptempo numbers such as Nyansola, where they are joined by a horn section from Ghanaian highlife troupe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/25/santrofi-alewa-review-ghana-highlife-accra-welcome-return">Santrofi</a>. Upfront is the powerful voice of Mathias Muzaza, a charismatic figure able to strut and swing or to soar spectacularly. Especially poignant is Manina, a lament for the lives swept away by the pestilence of Covid (the album was cut during lockdown), where Muzaza is joined by female singer Ulethu, a favourite from Zimbabwe’s thriving house scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/01/mokoomba-tusona-tracings-in-the-sand-review-stirring-pan-african-sounds-flowing-from-the-zambezi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Apricots roasted in vermouth, honey and saffron, soaked in their own syrup and topped with pistachios – they’re just begging for a scoop of ice-cream</p><p>Apricots have a short season, so don’t miss your chance to get creative with them. At the right moment in summer, their velvet skin and sweet-sour flesh makes them taste a bit like a plum crossed with a peach, and they are totally different from any other stone fruit out there. Equally summery is the pistachio: we eat tons of them back home in Spain, especially when they’re in season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/01/vermut-roasted-apricots-with-toasted-pistachios-honey-and-saffron-recipe-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>
