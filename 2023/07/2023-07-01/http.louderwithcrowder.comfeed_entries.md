Krolczyk went viral on TikTok discussing the matter and had filed a complaint with the school.</p><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/01/university-of-cincinnati-professor-formally-reprimanded-over-biological-women-remark" target="_blank">According to the New York Post</a>, Nipper was given a formal reprimand for his actions AND a copy of the letter will go on the professor's permanent record. But the worst indignity? Emphasis mine.</p><blockquote>In addition to <strong>completing training about UC’s free speech policy</strong>, she must also submit her future syllabi for the upcoming school year for approval. </blockquote><p>THEY'RE SENDING THE WOKE PROFESSOR FOR REEDUCATION! </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><h3>You're talking about the video with the blonde, right?</h3><br /><p>
	Olivia Krolczyk went viral for this video discussing her failing grade:
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <blockquote>
	I 100% know this is the most biased grade ever because my project is about transgenders competing in biological women's sports. How am I supposed to do my project if I can't use the phrase "biological women?"
</blockquote><p>That is an excellent question because this is not the first time this has come up. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-sports-university-research" target="_blank">A researcher had his study on if girls who were born biologically male</a> have an unfair advantage over regular girls rejected over the use of the words "male" and "female." <em></em></p><blockquote><em>I submitted a proposal for ethical review at Kings College London which stated that the aim of the research was “to find the views of athletes and volunteers on the question of when males should be allowed to compete in the female category in athletics”. The ethics committee rejected the proposal, on the grounds that using the terms “male” and “female” in this sentence constituted “misgendering”.</em></blockquote><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate" target="_blank">a teammate of mediocre male swimmer turned NCAA champion girl swimmer Lia Thomas</a> was asked to write an OpEd on the topic for the student newspaper. Then she had that OpEd edited to within an inch of its life. Then the newspaper retracted the OpEd when students complained an opposing viewpoint was being expressed.</p><p>So to answer Olivia's question, you are NOT supposed to write on the topic.</p><h3>Golly, this professor seems nice</h3><br /><p>Once Olivia became a popular figure in the pro-woman conservative media, <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/08/olivia-krolczyk-professor-university-cincinnati-assignment-failed-women-studies/70295104007/" target="_blank">corporate media content provider The Cincinnati Inquirer</a> tracked down Melanie Rose Nipper. Nipper, faced with a complaint that Olivia's free speech is being compromised, wanted it known that she supports free speech. Providing, she agrees with the speech.</p><blockquote>Although Nipper said she agrees classrooms should be places for debate and discussion, that ends when "you are, intentionally or unintentionally, participating in a systemic harm of some kind." She cited transphobia and white supremacy as examples.</blockquote><blockquote>Similar incidents had occurred in the past, said Nipper, who has taught at UC since 2021. When a student uses "an outdated terminology," Nipper said she feels it is necessary to correct those mistakes.</blockquote><p>In fairness, Nipper says she will happily regrade the assignment. It would just require Olivia using words that the adjunct professor likes. As of this writing, it is unclear if the student will take her up on the offer.</p><p class="">Nipper will be appealing the decision, saying "The culture war has impacted educators’ ability to teach."</p><p>Whatever you say, Skippy.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Boston University LAW students need counseling, therapy over recent Supreme Court decisions

If three years from now you need a lawyer and one of your options is someone who graduated from Boston University three years earlier, hard pass. They don't have the mental strength, judging from reports current LAW students need counseling and therapy because they are in their feels over Supreme Court decisions. NOT for legal reasons. Because SCOTUS didn't affirm the LAW students' political worldview and these LAW students think that's the role of the highest court in the land. As opposed to, you know, interpreting the US Constitution.</p><p>There were three decisions: Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-walks-away-msnbc" target="_blank">Affirmative Action</a>), 303 Creative LLC. v. Elenis (Free Speech) and Biden v. Nebraska (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-briden-student-loan-unconstitutional" target="_blank">Biden's unconstitutional student loan bailout</a>). Fox News reports the BU Law Student Government Association (SGA) was big mad over all three, but REALLY MAD over college admissions being based on merit.</p><blockquote>[The assenting judges] went so far as to say that the race-based admission system uses race as a negative and operates it as a stereotype. They may couch their opinion in legal jargon, but we all know what this opinion aims to do: advocate for a ‘colorblind’ admission process.</blockquote><p>Correct. There are people in America who still believe in judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin. In the case of SFA v. Harvard, that means not rejecting applicants over their race. The SGA is on the wrong side of history with this one.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It's one thing for the Democrat Party and corporate media (but I repeat myself) to think the Supreme Court is a legislative body. OR, pretend to think that because they know if they lie they can convince enough low-information progressives to wear by it. it is something else when LAW students of what used to be a prestigious LAW school don't understand the role of the Supreme Court. While they sit in their safe space coloring on the Ruth Bader Ginsberg coloring book, you would be better off picking a random attorney out of the phone book.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Father hits school board with receipts when they say there's never an issue letting boys use the girl's bathroom

In that bygone era, you were a pervert for trying to sneak into the girl's locker room and would get in trouble. In modern times, allowing boys to go dicks out in what used to be a girl's safe space while they are captive in school isn't "perverted" as much as it is "equity." Providing, naturally, that the boy says they are trans and identifies as a girl. One father showed up at school board meeting with examples of why this should not be.</p><p>Our latest viral school board video, taking this man at his word, is at a school district where they just passed a law allowing students with make genitalia to use any bathroom or locker room they want. The school board claimed there was no example anywhere from any school on why this might cause a problem and/or a sexual assault. Unlike the elected school board members, this father knows how an internet works.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>A few of his examples are familiar to regulars at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dan-crenshaw-obama-virginia" target="_blank">The Loudon County rape, where Democrats attempted to cover up the rape, made national news</a>. A biological man in California, one who likes whipping his/her junk out, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girls-bathroom-school-board" target="_blank">beat the crap out of a smaller student who didn't want to see it</a>. And a judge ruling that a transwoman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ymca-ohio-trans-not-guilty" target="_blank">was too fat to be showing her penis to children as accused</a>... I believe that falls under gallows humor. </p><p>"Oh please, Brodigan. These are just anecdotal evidence."</p><p>They are five stories to a school board that claimed there were none anywhere before passing a controversial mandate. Also:</p><blockquote>And before you say that these are anecdotal evidence, just note that in a survey of trans inmates in federal prisons, half were convicted of sexual assault and 90% were convicted of violent crimes. </blockquote><p>As it turns out, there are MORE than a single example of a trans student assaulting girls in bathrooms, schools, states, and "anywhere at all." There are way too many examples of school boards putting their radical Marxist political agenda before the safety of our daughters.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
