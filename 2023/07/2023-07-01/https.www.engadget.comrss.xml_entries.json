Moreover, AMD plans to sell the CPU for a modest $229, but there\u2019s a catch. The company will only offer the new processor through <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4387ed04-0e34-4f98-9985-dfc1e1b53079&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Micro+Center&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0Mzg3ZWQwNC0wZTM0LTRmOTgtOTk4NS1kZmMxZTFiNTMwNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9jZW50ZXIuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzQzNTQ0ODAtNjc3YS00MmUxLWE1ODMtMjUzNzc0MDc3MjcxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXub3Iic5I6kA4YihIpiRodd8NCOUleHOtyL-8Cy5-m9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microcenter.com%2F\"><ins>Micro Center</ins></a>, a US retailer that, as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/amd-ryzen-5600x3d-a-micro-center-exclusive-is-one-last-hurrah-for-socket-am4/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social\"><em><ins>Ars Technica</ins></em><ins> notes</ins></a>, doesn\u2019t ship most of what it sells to online shoppers. What\u2019s more, stock of the 5600X3D will be limited, with sales of the CPU to end once Micro Center runs out of supplies.</p><p>All of that is a shame because the 5600X3D could be a great upgrade for those looking to extend the life of their AM4 motherboard and get a bit of extra gaming performance. Like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d-release-date-price-144017796.html\"><ins>5800X3D</ins></a>, the 5600X3D trades slower clock speeds and more power consumption for a 96MB L3 cache. With the 5800X3D, that\u2019s a combination of features that makes for a processor that is slower at some tasks, but generally great for gaming. The expanded L3 cache frequently translates to less bottlenecking in games, meaning you can get the most performance possible from your GPU. Moreover, the fact that it's an AM4 processor means you can save on a new build since you won't need to go buy DDR5 RAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The 5600X3D will go on sale on July 7th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amds-229-ryzen-5-5600x3d-is-a-micro-center-exclusive-220620613.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amds-229-ryzen-5-5600x3d-is-a-micro-center-exclusive-220620613.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-01T22:06:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter puts strict cap on how many tweets users can read each day", "description": "<p>Twitter has begun aggressively limiting how many tweets users can view per day.

Like the usage limit, Musk has claimed the login restriction will only be temporary and was put in place in response to data scrapers. &quot;Several hundred organizations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively, to the point where it was affecting the real user experience,&quot; Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1674887204580073474?s=20\">said Friday</a>.

He also didn't state if viewing ads counts against a user's view limit. Either way, the restrictions severely limit the useability of Twitter, making it difficult, for instance, to verify if a screenshot of a tweet is authentic. A cynical view of the situation would suggest Twitter is trying to find ways to squeeze every bit of money it can from its user base. In March, the company introduced API changes that could cost some organizations as much as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html\">$42,000 a month</a>. However, that move and the introduction of Twitter Blue don't appear to have offset the advertising revenue Twitter has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitters-ad-sales-have-reportedly-dropped-by-59-percent-since-last-year-092543851.html\">lost since Musk's takeover</a>. Limiting how many tweets, and by extension ads, users can see is unlikely to make the company\u2019s remaining clients happy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-01T18:26:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Europe\u2019s Euclid space telescope launches to map the dark universe", "description": "<p>On late Saturday morning, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid spacecraft <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Newsroom/Press_Releases/ESA_s_Euclid_lifts_off_on_quest_to_unravel_the_cosmic_mystery_of_dark_matter_and_dark_energy\"><ins>successfully lifted off Cape Canaveral</ins></a>, Florida.
