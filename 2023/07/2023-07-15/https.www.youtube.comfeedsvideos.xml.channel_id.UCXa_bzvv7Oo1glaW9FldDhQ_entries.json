One minute they're watching your back and being the best. The other, they're running into walls and letting you die. We get it - nobody is perfect.\n\nHowever, sometimes, a companion can commit some rather egregious errors. Sometimes, they'll walk into a trap-filled building and go down, requiring your immediate assistance.
