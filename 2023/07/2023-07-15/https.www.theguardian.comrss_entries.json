His new novel, <em>Crook Manifesto</em>, takes place in the 1970s and rejoins furniture salesman and stolen-goods dealer Ray Carney, first seen in <em>Harlem Shuffle</em>, a crime caper \u201csubversively using the genre against itself\u201d (the<em> Atlantic </em>magazine). Whitehead, born and raised in New York, spoke from his home in Long Island.<br /><br /><strong>Did you always know </strong><em><strong>Harlem Shuffle</strong></em><strong> would be the first in a trilogy?</strong><br />I started off wanting to do a heist novel but I kept coming up with more adventures for Carney. Halfway through writing it, I decided there would be two books \u2013 and if you do two, you might as well do three! But when <em>Harlem Shuffle</em> came out I didn\u2019t say it was the first in a trilogy, because what if I got bored? I wanted to give myself an out. I didn\u2019t want it in my obituary: \u201cHe never finished his trilogy\u201d.<br /><br /><strong>Is that why you\u2019ve seldom previously written the same type of book twice \u2013 because you get bored?</strong><br />Yeah, usually, when I\u2019m done with a book, I\u2019m really done with that style and genre; I like to follow a big book with a smaller book, something that\u2019s funny with something more serious. This is the first time I\u2019ve had a world I want to explore so deeply over time. I\u2019m giving the story room to go in different directions; it\u2019s Carney\u2019s book, but it\u2019s OK if he doesn\u2019t appear for 100 pages in the middle.<br /><br /><strong>What led you to make him a furniture salesman?</strong><br />A lot of real-life fences have a storefront business where they do their illegal stuff in their back. I picked furniture randomly, but it pays off metaphorically and in terms of plot because it\u2019s about family and middle-class aspiration. He could have been a robber or a wheel man but fences in heist stories seemed underutilised to me; they always appear, you know, giving the protagonist 10 cents on the dollar for this million-dollar necklace. I thought, who <em>is</em> that guy? It\u2019s open territory; there\u2019s not a lot of fence novels I know of.</p><p><strong>Violence in these books happens suddenly and you never write about it as a spectacle, only how it feels for those affected. Why?</strong><br />There\u2019s definitely a place for luxuriating [in violence] \u2013 I did that in <em>Zone One</em> [his 2011 zombie novel], but that\u2019s not the point here. I\u2019m not trying to sell it to the reader. It\u2019s just part of the characters\u2019 lives and it is quick and sudden. Partly, I was trying to evoke the randomness of city life, the way a city summons you into its weird drama; growing up in New York in the 70s and 80s, you never knew what was going to happen on the subway or when you turned the corner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/15/colson-whitehead-a-city-summons-you-into-its-weird-drama-crook-manifesto\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/15/colson-whitehead-a-city-summons-you-into-its-weird-drama-crook-manifesto", "date_published": "2023-07-15T17:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Germany\u2019s Lena Oberdorf: \u2018Parents shouted: don\u2019t get run over by a girl\u2019", "description": "<p>Midfield dynamo on captaining boys\u2019 teams growing up and why an improving German side have the spirit to win the World Cup</p><p>\u2018There were the usual words like \u2018Go back in the kitchen\u2019 but the saddest part was when their parents shouted: \u2018Don\u2019t get run over by a girl, don\u2019t get dribbled past by a girl,\u2019\u201d Lena Oberdorf says as she remembers the reaction she faced most weekends.

The data actually suggests that these kinds of partnerships tend to last longer. \u201cNow my cynical colleagues say that\u2019s because you don\u2019t see much of each other.

This was 2012, and Simon Cowell\u2019s primetime star-maker was at the peak of its influence, having produced One Direction and Little Mix in its previous two series. Spraggan became the first contestant to perform her own songs and play an instrument. Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i3qeErUaFo\" title=\"\">audition</a> \u2013 an ode to \u201cbeer fear\u201d called Last Night (\u201cLast night I told ya I loved ya / Woke up, blamed it on the vodka\u201d) \u2013 was the world\u2019s fourth most-watched YouTube video of that year, and she became the UK\u2019s most Googled artist. Lily Allen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lilyallen/status/259757250489499649\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> that Spraggan reminded her of a young version of herself, and she was the bookies\u2019 odds-on favourite to win the show. Viewers voted her through the first three live shows before being told that she had left the competition due to illness. Only, she wasn\u2019t ill.</p><p>Eleven years later, Spraggan, now 31, is finally ready to talk about why she disappeared. We meet in a light-filled attic studio, and though she later admits that she is incredibly nervous, she appears measured and resolute, choosing her words with the care of someone who has spent a great deal of time weighing them. We\u2019re here to discuss her new memoir, in which she reveals that she was raped during the production of The X Factor, and the devastating impact that this had on the subsequent decade of her life. \u201cMy working title for the book was Are You That Girl?,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause for years I was terrified of being known as the girl that that happened to. I was deeply, chronically ashamed. Now I understand that what happened wasn\u2019t my decision, it was out of my hands. And in order for me to rebuild myself and move on, I needed to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/lucy-spraggan-the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-the-x-factor\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/lucy-spraggan-the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-the-x-factor", "date_published": "2023-07-15T06:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Lucy Spraggan reveals she was sexually attacked during X Factor", "description": "<p>Musician says she felt let down by ITV after assault by hotel porter that has had lasting impact</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/lucy-spraggan-the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-the-x-factor\">\u2018I was terrified of being known as the girl who was attacked while on The X Factor\u2019</a></p><p>The former X Factor contestant Lucy Spraggan has revealed she was raped by a hotel porter during the production of the ITV show in 2012.</p><p>In her new memoir, Process: Finding My Way Through, Spraggan details the devastating impact the assault had on the subsequent decade of her life, and how she felt let down by ITV.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/lucy-spraggan-reveals-she-was-sexually-attacked-during-x-factor\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/lucy-spraggan-reveals-she-was-sexually-attacked-during-x-factor", "date_published": "2023-07-15T06:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Torrential rain batters South Korea, triggering landslides and leaving seven dead", "description": "<p>Three people missing, seven injured and more than 1,500 people evacuated, with number set to rise as dam overflows</p><p>Seven people died, three were missing and more than 1,500 evacuated in South Korea on Saturday, officials said, as a third day of torrential rains caused landslides and the overflow of a dam.</p><p>As of 11am local time 1,567 people had been evacuated nationwide, according to the ministry of interior and safety, and the number could rise as water overtopped the dam in North Chungcheong province.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/15/torrential-rain-batters-south-korea-triggering-landslides-and-leaving-seven-dead\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/15/torrential-rain-batters-south-korea-triggering-landslides-and-leaving-seven-dead", "date_published": "2023-07-15T05:27:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Where does it end?\u2019 Far-right\u2019s gains raise fears for LGBTQ+ freedoms in Spain", "description": "<p>Rights groups in region where Vox is in government warn voters in run-up to snap general election</p><p>Pride celebrations have long been a small but raucous affair in the northern Spanish city of Valladolid.
