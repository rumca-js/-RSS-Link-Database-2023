*An edited, illustrated and narrated playthrough of the game Dwarf Fortress. This episode deals with "Legends mode" in particular.*

Today we're peeking into the endless library of the former capital and pulling out some interesting stories that helped to build Athira Etha! So, sit back, relax, learn and be entertained as we gain some context from history itself!
