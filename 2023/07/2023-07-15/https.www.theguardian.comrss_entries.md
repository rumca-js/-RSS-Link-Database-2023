## The moment I knew: she was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, and I fell in love – twice

<p>When she spied a stunning stranger at a dance performance, it was love at first sight for <strong>Roslyn Orlando</strong>. Years later, that woman would reappear – and upend her life</p><p>In 2018 I attended a dance performance called Sinkhole in Melbourne. In the gallery where the performance took place, there were benches along two opposite walls. I took a seat. Shortly after, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the room wearing a white shirt, red pants and brown leather sandals. The whole room seemed to stiffen, and something warm and painful happened in my heart. She sat across from me, engaged in conversation with her friend. I tried very hard not to continue staring at her throughout the performance; I don’t think she looked at me once. Lacking the nerve to approach her to say hello, I left shortly after the performance finished.</p><p>Two years later, I was in a period of my life that can only be described – in retrospect – as chaos. I was working long hours in a stressful yet fulfilling job, spending every spare moment writing emotional essays on excess and aliens (for no readership but my own), taking meandering midnight walks in pursuit of the moon and indiscriminately dating strangers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/16/the-moment-i-knew-she-was-the-most-beautiful-woman-id-ever-seen-and-i-fell-in-love-twice">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘You are not lost’: the infinite attraction of paths and meandering trails

To one side sheep milled nervously, trying to decide what to do about me. On the other side a small noticeboard indicated this was the path used by partisans to guide refugees across the Pyrénées in the second world war . There was an immediate thrill of connection; I was walking in their brave footsteps. I set off up the path as the sheep scattered.</p><p>I’ve never been able to resist a path. As a child I longed to find a proper path – narrow, winding, destination hidden – but there were only broad, flat paddocks with an occasional aimless sheep-trail meandering with impenetrable sheep-logic across the landscape – no chance of hidden pathways. In those days it was a longing for adventure, the possibility that something could happen or be discovered that I didn’t already know about in this wide, open landscape, but the attraction of paths has lasted and is multistranded. What makes me – most of us – feel impelled to walk along it whenever we see a path, even a photograph of one?</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/16/you-are-not-lost-the-infinite-attraction-of-paths-and-meandering-trails">Continue reading...</a>

The government is piling excessive fees on migrants who are keeping Britain’s economy running and has made nastiness its guiding principle<p>The government’s announcement last week that it would award public sector workers wage increases in line with the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies came with a sting in its tail. It was the minimum that teachers, police officers and doctors – who have seen their real pay decline over the past decade – should have been able to expect. But not only have ministers failed to rule out that these pay rises will be paid for with public service cuts elsewhere; they have said they will be partly funded through huge increases in the <a href="https://freemovement.org.uk/massive-increases-to-immigration-fees-announced/" title="">fees levied on migrant workers</a>.</p><p>The immigrant NHS surcharge will now increase by more than £400 to just over £1,000 per person per year. Immigration and nationality fees are also being put up by 15% to 20%. A family of four moving to the UK will now be liable for fees of at least £33,000 over five years in order to permanently settle here; this is <a href="https://freemovement.org.uk/massive-increases-to-immigration-fees-announced/" title="">significantly higher</a> than the equivalent fees and charges in many other European countries and the United States.

<p>While the youngster has the talent to beat the seven-time Wimbledon champion, he will have to win the battle of wills</p><p>An hour after one of the biggest occasions of his career had ended in despair, Carlos Alcaraz was still processing how things had gone so badly wrong during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/09/novak-djokovic-outlasts-cramping-alcaraz-to-race-into-french-open-final" title="">his French Open semi-final </a>against Novak Djokovic. With the match level after two intense but hardly overwhelming sets, Alcaraz’s body began to cramp. In the final two sets, he was uncompetitive until the end.</p><p>After such a disappointing outcome, many other players might have tried to play down the events on the court, trying not to give away too much information to rivals, or might even have been too distraught to offer any kind of explanation. It was striking how frank and honest Alcaraz was. He admitted he had simply been too tense and those nerves had caused his cramps. While he usually tackles the pressure moments with a smile, nerves had been present in the pit of his stomach throughout the day and, eventually, they consumed him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/15/carlos-alcaraz-set-for-another-shot-at-toppling-monumental-novak-djokovic">Continue reading...</a>

## Colson Whitehead: ‘A city summons you into its weird drama’

<p>The double Pulitzer prize-winning author on writing a sequel to Harlem Shuffle, the influence of Stephen King’s Carrie, and why he no longer makes fried chicken</p><p>Colson Whitehead, 53, is the author of 11 books, including a poker memoir, <em>The Noble Hustle</em>, and the Pulitzer-winning novels <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/09/the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead-revie-luminous-furious-wildly-inventive">The Underground Railroad</a></em>, which was televised in 2021, and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/05/the-nickel-boys-by-colson-whitehead-review">The Nickel Boys</a></em>, about an abusive reform school in the Jim Crow era. His new novel, <em>Crook Manifesto</em>, takes place in the 1970s and rejoins furniture salesman and stolen-goods dealer Ray Carney, first seen in <em>Harlem Shuffle</em>, a crime caper “subversively using the genre against itself” (the<em> Atlantic </em>magazine). Whitehead, born and raised in New York, spoke from his home in Long Island.<br /><br /><strong>Did you always know </strong><em><strong>Harlem Shuffle</strong></em><strong> would be the first in a trilogy?</strong><br />I started off wanting to do a heist novel but I kept coming up with more adventures for Carney. Halfway through writing it, I decided there would be two books – and if you do two, you might as well do three! But when <em>Harlem Shuffle</em> came out I didn’t say it was the first in a trilogy, because what if I got bored? I wanted to give myself an out. I didn’t want it in my obituary: “He never finished his trilogy”.<br /><br /><strong>Is that why you’ve seldom previously written the same type of book twice – because you get bored?</strong><br />Yeah, usually, when I’m done with a book, I’m really done with that style and genre; I like to follow a big book with a smaller book, something that’s funny with something more serious. This is the first time I’ve had a world I want to explore so deeply over time. I’m giving the story room to go in different directions; it’s Carney’s book, but it’s OK if he doesn’t appear for 100 pages in the middle.<br /><br /><strong>What led you to make him a furniture salesman?</strong><br />A lot of real-life fences have a storefront business where they do their illegal stuff in their back. I picked furniture randomly, but it pays off metaphorically and in terms of plot because it’s about family and middle-class aspiration. He could have been a robber or a wheel man but fences in heist stories seemed underutilised to me; they always appear, you know, giving the protagonist 10 cents on the dollar for this million-dollar necklace. I thought, who <em>is</em> that guy? It’s open territory; there’s not a lot of fence novels I know of.</p><p><strong>Violence in these books happens suddenly and you never write about it as a spectacle, only how it feels for those affected. Why?</strong><br />There’s definitely a place for luxuriating [in violence] – I did that in <em>Zone One</em> [his 2011 zombie novel], but that’s not the point here. I’m not trying to sell it to the reader. It’s just part of the characters’ lives and it is quick and sudden. Partly, I was trying to evoke the randomness of city life, the way a city summons you into its weird drama; growing up in New York in the 70s and 80s, you never knew what was going to happen on the subway or when you turned the corner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/15/colson-whitehead-a-city-summons-you-into-its-weird-drama-crook-manifesto">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Midfield dynamo on captaining boys’ teams growing up and why an improving German side have the spirit to win the World Cup</p><p>‘There were the usual words like ‘Go back in the kitchen’ but the saddest part was when their parents shouted: ‘Don’t get run over by a girl, don’t get dribbled past by a girl,’” Lena Oberdorf says as she remembers the reaction she faced most weekends. Oberdorf would be the only girl in the German league of youth football she played in, as the captain of her team TSG Sprockhövel, and the boys opposing her became increasingly desperate.</p><p>“They started to attack me hard from behind and I was: ‘OK, this is kind of dangerous now,’” Oberdorf says as she raises an eyebrow at the memory. Germany’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/30/womens-euro-2022-team-guide-germany" title=""> 21-year-old defensive midfielder</a> will begin the World Cup as one of the most impressive female footballers in the world.

## If there’s no GP and you can’t buy a pint of milk, what’s the point of Northstowe? | Rowan Moore

The biggest new town since Milton Keynes is billed as ‘unique’, but provision of even basic services seems to have been forgotten<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/17/infuriating-building-of-cambridgeshire-new-town-threatens-wildlife-habitat" title="">Northstowe</a> is a new town, billed as the largest since Milton Keynes was launched in the 1960s. It is, its developers say, “sustainable”. It “has a strong sense of community and an identity that is entirely unique” – so much so, it turns out, that it has no shop, cafe or GP surgery, which means that anyone who wants to buy a pint of milk has to take the not-very-environmental option of driving. “It has no heart,” one resident told the BBC, “it’s like a home without a kitchen.”</p><p>This place is eight miles from Cambridge, for which Michael Gove <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12279885/Michael-Gove-unleashes-plans-Cambridge-Europes-answer-Silicon-Valley.html" title="">earlier this month promised</a> to unleash a plan for 250,000 new homes, one that would make it the “Silicon Valley of Europe”. You have to wonder what he has been smoking. There are 1,200 occupied homes in Northstowe, which was originally planned in 2007, at which rate of progress it would take 3,333 years to achieve Gove’s dream, although they might have built a cafe by then. Milton Keynes’s growth was far greater, and even included shops and surgeries, but required vigorous state intervention. This is probably a truth too awkward for a free marketeer like Gove to acknowledge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/15/whats-the-point-of-northstowe">Continue reading...</a>

Coincidences are more likely to happen than we think – so we should expect the unexpected and avoid magical thinking<p>When the mathematician Dr Kit Yates sees a weather forecast predicting a 25% chance of rain, he packs an umbrella.

## Cut yourself some slack and stop cooking for an impossible fantasy existence | Rachel Cooke

<p>Wall-to-wall cookery shows and recipe books can undermine our confidence. It’s time to be kind to yourself in the kitchen</p><p>I was tired and a bit overworked, and that’s when it happened: the lid fell off the jar at the wrong moment, and all was lost. Or was it? For a long, despondent minute, I considered the disaster before me. In my best Le Creuset pan on the top of the oven were the sausages I was turning into a pasta sauce for dinner, and about 10 times the amount of chilli flakes I’d intended to add. Oh no! Thoughts of takeaway pizza floated into my mind. But I hated to waste both the sausages and my efforts up to this point, so I decided to plough on regardless. Some like it hot, and we two are among them. How bad could it be, really?</p><p>The answer is: not bad at all. I might not have fed it to guests, but we both ended up having seconds. It was … memorable, I guess, and later on, as I loaded the dishwasher and worried vaguely about what I might cook tomorrow in this, the busiest and craziest of weeks, I got to thinking about kindness in the kitchen – kindness to myself, in this instance. Don’t worry. I’m not about to turn into some gruesome self-help guru. All I mean is that, sometimes, I should give myself a break. In fact, we all should. If perfection is elusive, equally, seeming catastrophe is rarely that. Most dishes can be salvaged. Nearly everything is edible, in extremis. Delia Smith – Delia bloody Smith! – loved the cake I panic-baked for her when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/06/delia-smith-you-matter-the-human-solution-interview" title="">I interviewed her last year</a>. It hadn’t risen properly. As I took it out of my bag, it resembled nothing so much as a house brick wrapped in foil. But as I heard later – she said this to her audience during an event at Conway Hall in London, and some of them were kind enough to email me afterwards – she and Michael, her husband, devoured every last cardamom-scented crumb.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/15/cut-yourself-some-slack-and-stop-cooking-for-an-impossible-fantasy-existence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Time is running out in Port Talbot to decarbonise its operations: at stake is the supply chain for much of Britain’s construction and manufacturing sectors, along with thousands of jobs</p><p>At the Port Talbot steelworks on the south Wales coast, two 90-metre blast furnaces dominate the skyline. The plant has loomed over the town since an integrated steelworks was built there <a href="https://coflein.gov.uk/en/site/91392/images" title="">in the 1950s</a>. It is the economic heart of the area, capable of producing 5m tonnes of steel a year, employing 4,000 people and an <a href="https://business.senedd.wales/documents/s49258/EBC4-07-16%20p6%20Evidence%20from%20Unite.pdf" title="">estimated 10,000</a> in the wider community.</p><p>A mesmerising orange stream of molten iron flows from the furnace at 1,470C.

<p>(Nonesuch)<br />The bluegrass star’s new record picks up where last year’s Crooked Tree left off, with a whirlwind of virtuoso Americana</p><p>At a time when the gap between mainstream country and heavy rock is often just a southern drawl and a cowboy hat, give thanks for acts such as <a href="https://www.mollytuttlemusic.com/">Molly Tuttle</a>, who are keeping alive the spirit and sound of country’s grittier traditions. Renowned in bluegrass circles for her guitar-picking, the 30-year-old made her breakthrough with last year’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/02/crooked-tree-by-molly-tuttle-review-classy-bluegrass-for-modern-america">Crooked Tree</a>, </em>an album that combined dazzling playing with songs celebrating feminism and renegade pot farmers and protesting gentrification.</p><p><em>City of Gold</em> continues seamlessly. Once more its songs are co-written with Ketch Secor from Old Crow Medicine Show and it’s co-produced by dobro star Jerry Douglas, a veteran of the “newgrass” scene of the 1970s. Recorded live in the studio, it’s chiefly a showcase for Tuttle’s stage band and their pyrotechnics on fiddle, mandolin and banjo alongside Tuttle’s virtuoso guitar. Their acrobatic playing sometimes masks the quality of the songwriting, say, on El Dorado, which recounts the deranged days of the California gold rush.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/15/molly-tuttle-and-golden-highway-city-of-gold-review-gritty-country-with-pyrotechnics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From World Emoji Day to being cited in court cases, the language of symbols has come of age</p><p>There have been plenty of, shall we say, unusual or eye-raising legal decisions around technology. Such is the way when a massive industry, if one can reduce “technology” to the singular, which we can’t, utterly changes the way we live (or the way we die, which, according to former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/04/google-nasa-kurzweil">may not actually happen</a>).</p><p>In recent times we’ve had, rather gloriously, the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme debated by a judge in <a href="https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/10/is-this-the-first-time-a-judge-has-used-a-meme-in-a-judgment/">Florida</a>, and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) recognised as <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/04/29/nfts-recognised-as-legal-property-in-landmark-case">legal property</a> in the UK.

But the thing that caught my eye last week was a <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/thumbs-up-emoji-legal-signature-canada/">Canadian court decision</a> that ruled a thumbs-up emoji is legally permissible as contract assent. There are more examples of emojis finding their way before the bench. In 2014, a Michigan court tried a defamation case involving a stuck-out tongue emoticon (rendered as :-p). In Ohio, a judgment in a harassment case queried what, exactly, the rat emoji meant in that context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/15/once-sneered-at-emojis-last-laugh-world-emoji-day-monday-17-july">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tomohisa Taguchi’s elegant love story anchors the far-fetched plot points of Makoto Shinkai’s 2016 hit Your Name</p><p>A pair of Japanese teenagers are flung together thanks to a metaphysical glitch that bends the rules of space and time in this sumptuously romantic YA anime. And if this all sounds suspiciously close to the premise of Makoto Shinkai’s box-office phenomenon <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/your-name-review-makoto-shinkai">Your Name</a></em>, that’s unlikely to be a coincidence. The success of that film – <em>Your Name</em> was the third highest-grossing Japanese film of all time – led to a rash of similarly high concept sci-fi romance animations (most recently Shinkai’s own esoteric fantasy <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/suzume-review-a-painterly-coming-of-age-anime-from-the-director-of-your-name">Suzume</a></em>) hoping to repeat the magic. But of all the movies that followed, Tomohisa Taguchi’s <em>The Tunnel to Summer</em><em>, the Exit of Goodbyes</em> is the one that comes closest to recreating the glistening perfection of <em>Your Name</em>.</p><p>Based on a novel and subsequent manga by Mei Hachimoku, the film follows Kaoru (voiced by Oji Suzuka), a reserved high school student who discovers a mysterious tunnel that, according to local folklore, can grant your dearest wishes, albeit at a considerable cost. Around the same time, a friendship sparks with the new girl at school, Anzu (Marie Iitoyo), who shares his fascination with the tunnel. Anzu is an unrepentant badass, an aspiring manga artist who floors the school mean girl with a punch on her first day in class, and accuses the flustered Kaoru of being a creep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/15/the-tunnel-to-summer-the-exit-of-goodbyes-review-tomohisa-taguchi-sumptuously-romantic-ya-anime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A creative couple decided to paint their whole home one rosy colour (now they are thinking of repainting it blue)</p><p>Chantal Assinck took the decision to paint almost everything in one arresting hue when she and her partner couldn’t have the concrete walls, ceilings and kitchen they’d originally envisioned for their apartment. “I couldn’t find the perfect product at the right price for all the surfaces, so that’s when we decided to paint everything one colour,” explains Chantal as she describes the pink apartment in Arnhem, the Netherlands, that she shares with Tom and their dog, Eddie.</p><p>The home is also decorated with distinctive pieces from local designers, such as <a href="https://erikstehmann.nl/" title="">Studio Erik Stehmann</a> whose decoration piece “Showpik” hangs over the kitchen island; there are family heirlooms and even furniture that she’s built herself. But it hasn’t always been pink – they started with dark green and it will soon change to blue, they’ve decided. “All things are replaceable and changeable,” Chantal says. “I don’t think I’m really attached to most of the things we have, but if I had to sell all our stuff, I would make sure to at least keep the Wiggle chair by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/24/frank-gehry-at-90-still-taking-risks-interview-rowan-moore" title="">Frank Gehry</a>.

Especially not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey">Lana Del Rey</a>. We learn this at Hyde Park, under a sun-dappled sky streaked with clouds shaped like chemtrails. Appropriately, the American balladeer is caressing the final verse of <a href="https://youtu.be/vBHild0PiTE">Chemtrails Over the Country Club</a>, steering its lullaby-like coda to gentle sleep, when she veers suddenly off-road without warning. Squatting, staring inscrutably, she replaces the basic yet romantic line “you’re born in December, I’m born in June” with “he was born in December… <em>and got married when we were still together</em>”.</p><p>Shrieks and wails of affirmation greet Lana’s revelation, as she continues, crooning “sometimes I wonder what his wife would think if she knew” and follows that faux-naif savagery with “he got married when we were in couples therapy together”. As a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/02/lana-del-rey-violet-bent-backwards-over-the-grass-review-poetry-debut-with-mixed-results">published poet</a>, Del Rey knows that (a) this doesn’t scan, and (b) it doesn’t matter. It’s electrifying, and gloriously odd. What just happened? Did she really call out her ex to 60,000 strangers? Is it true? It’s a goosebump moment, four songs into her biggest UK gig, that proves precisely why her audience are so invested in every second of her every performance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/15/lana-del-rey-review-bst-hyde-park-london-five-stars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If club manage to upset the odds and win Super League, it will rival – or even surpass – Leicester’s Premier League triumph</p><p>It was a statement that seems somewhat prophetic now but at the time was certainly easy to criticise. “We’re not going into Super League to make up the numbers,” was how Leigh’s owner, Derek Beaumont, presented the Championship-winning club’s ambitions <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/oct/04/scrapping-promotion-and-relegation-in-super-league-betrays-a-lack-of-ambition">after securing promotion last October</a>.</p><p>After all, this was on the day when Beaumont announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/14/super-league-2023-team-by-team-guide-to-the-new-season">an ambitious rebrand</a> of a club that had been know as the Centurions since 1995. The Leigh Leopards arrived clad in a new leopard-themed kit, which attracted plenty of derision. Throw in that Leigh had previously been promoted to Super League on three occasions and each time were relegated the following season and it was difficult not to imagine history repeating itself.

<p>For 200 years, men have been hopping over infants in a tiny hamlet in the Cantabrian mountains. Why do they do it? </p><p>Not many mornings begin with a man dressed in a yellow devil outfit whipping fleeing teenagers to the sound of a sombre drumbeat. But every year in mid-June, Castrillo de Murcia is far from your average place. The tiny hamlet, nestled at the bottom of the Cantabrian mountains in northern Spain, bursts into life with one of the strangest festivals in the world: El Colacho (“The Devil”)<em>.</em></p><p>No one seems to know precisely when the local people began El Colacho, a traditional ceremony that involves not only the aforementioned running and whipping but, most famously, a section in which the “devils” leap over tiny babies laid out on mattresses in the streets. The stone building under the village’s church proudly bears the date 1621, but this was only the year in which Pope Gregory XV gave the controversial ritual his papal blessing; it’s likely the residents had been doing it for some time already. Because of a two-year Covid hiatus, this year’s is the 400th official ceremony.</p><p>Members of the Brotherhood of the Blessed Sacrament of Minerva escort the devil through the village</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/15/leaps-of-faith-the-spanish-festival-where-men-jump-over-babies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former Republic of Ireland winger is eager to find a new club at the age of 37. ‘I enjoy competing. I know I can still play’</p><p>Aiden McGeady is one of the most talented Scottish footballing exports of a generation but destined never to be regarded as such. His decision to represent the Republic of Ireland had the strange knock-on effect of deleting his name from conversation regarding the finest products of youth systems – in this case Celtic’s – in his homeland.</p><p>It could have been a case of enjoying McGeady while he lasted. Now 37 and after a spell at Hibernian was curtailed by injury, he finds himself at a career crossroads. McGeady has the appetite to keep playing but understands his options may be limited. “I know how it looks,” he says. “At my age it’s a hard sell for a manager. ‘Let’s go and sign a 37-year-old who hasn’t really played for a year.’ I’m totally fit now, I was training right up until expiry of my contract at Hibs on 30 June.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/15/aiden-mcgeady-i-know-a-lot-of-people-who-retired-too-early">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I know about lying, I do it for a living’: How Ben McKenzie went from The OC heartthrob to crypto’s biggest critic

<p>The OC star has made a ‘bizarre career pivot’, embedding himself in the cryptocurrency community, and co-writing a book exposing the truth behind digital currencies</p><p>Around the same time Ben McKenzie got interested in cryptocurrency and the hype surrounding it, he found himself reading his young daughter a bedtime story – The Emperor’s New Clothes. He looks across the table to his daughter, who has been brought along for today’s interview. “Do you remember this?” She looks up from her iPad and smiles. “I’d forgotten that the tailor’s trick is to appeal to ego and status worship,” says McKenzie. This was 2021, and cryptocurrency was everywhere in the US at the time. This encrypted, decentralised digital currency, as the TV ads, social media accounts and celebrity endorsements told everyone, was the way to get rich, and promised to be the future of money. Get in now, was the message, before it was too late.</p><p>He couldn’t avoid seeing parallels with the bedtime story – that it relied on people buying into an idea that, he suspected, may prove to be a mirage. Getting to the part when it was a child who calls out the truth of the emperor’s “clothes”, he had a thought: maybe I’m that child. “I mean, what do I know?” he says now, with a laugh. McKenzie is an actor, a former teen heart-throb known for his role in the mid-2000s drama The OC and who recently starred in the superhero crime TV series Gotham. Even with his 20-plus-year-old economics degree, he seemed an unlikely anti-crypto crusader. “But when in life do you have a chance to have an adventure?” he says. “What did I have to lose?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/ben-mckenzie-interview-oc-cryptocurrency">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Political scientists read the Republican runes and suggest Trump will win the nomination – but how would he fare in a 2020 rematch?</p><p>As it stands, political scientists expect Donald Trump to win the Republican nomination for president. Most GOP candidates are in lockstep with Trumpist policies and culture wars, failing to differentiate in an already scattered field; despite the appearance of a united front, factions within the party cannot agree on when and how to pass hardline legislation. Traditional conservative forces are looking for a less volatile alternative with a more viable path to win the general election, and as that concern mounts, some experts say Biden could be narrowly re-elected if the race is a rematch of 2020.</p><p>“Trump is the mainstream,” said Allan Lichtman, distinguished professor of history at American University, pointing out that “so-called mainstream Republicans” such as Liz Cheney are now out of office.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/15/biden-trump-2024-politics-republicans-experts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From snoring to shift work, Russell Foster explains the myths and misconceptions that get in the way of a well-rested society</p><p>Professor Russell Foster CBE, head of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, has some relationship advice. One of the things he’s asked most often at public talks is what to do if your partner snores. First, check with your doctor if a serious condition like sleep apnoea might be to blame. Second, get some ear plugs. Third: “If you have an alternative sleeping space, then use it. It’s not a reflection of the quality of your relationship. I would say that in many cases, it’s the beginning of a better one. You’ll be more rested, you’ll be less irritated with your partner, you’ll probably have a better sense of humour, you’ll have more empathy. You’ll have more fun.”</p><p>Is he speaking from personal experience? “Perhaps … ” Who’s the snorer in his marriage? “We’ll gloss over that,” he says with a chuckle. And what about so-called chronotypes – whether you’re a lark or an owl. Can a mixed marriage work? Oh yes, he says, again drawing from personal experience (he’s an “evening type”, while his wife, Lizzie, likes to get up early). The data actually suggests that these kinds of partnerships tend to last longer. “Now my cynical colleagues say that’s because you don’t see much of each other. I prefer the explanation that if you can accommodate your partner’s sleep habits, then actually, it shows you have a reasonably flexible disposition. And then all the other crap that is thrown at you in a relationship can be [dealt with] appropriately.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/15/sleep-empathy-russell-foster">Continue reading...</a>

## Food insecurity and eating disorders are linked and rising. Where’s the plan to tackle them? | Dorothy Dunn

<p>New NHS research reveals the direct effect of the cost of living crisis on people’s mental health.

The unbearable lightness of being could be an apt way to describe the precarious nature of many people’s lives across the UK right now: unbearable, treated lightly by those in positions of power, but ultimately still <em>being</em> in the world, if hanging on only by a thread.</p><p>Food insecurity has now been linked by the NHS to the <a href="https://www.nhsconfed.org/long-reads/why-preventing-food-insecurity-will-support-nhs-and-save-lives">rise in eating disorders</a>, and this is interesting for two primary reasons. First, the new research overturns commonly held stereotypes. It had long been assumed that this illness affected affluent, white, middle-class women and girls. The new findings prove this is not the case, with the rise occurring in people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who are disproportionately black and from ethnic minorities. This is striking, and will no doubt have a profound effect on the way we diagnose and treat eating disorders in the future.</p><p>Dorothy Dunn is a freelance journalist</p><p>In the UK, <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat</a> can be contacted on 0808 801 0677.

<p>More and more youngsters are experiencing serious reactions to everyday foods – and even our pets are suffering. We meet one family who lost a son to anaphylaxis and ask what can be done</p><p>When five-year-old Benedict Blythe woke up on the morning of 1 December 2021, he was excited that Christmas was coming. He came downstairs to open the first box in his Advent calendar containing a plastic springy frog and a dairy-free white chocolate (Benedict was allergic to milk, along with many other foods including soy, sesame, eggs and nuts). It was Benedict’s first term at school – Barnack primary in Stamford – and he loved it so much that back in September, he had cried when he learned that there were no classes at the weekend. That morning, he went off cheerfully to school with a small packet of dairy-free McVitie’s Gingerbread Men for snack time. He seemed happy and healthy when he arrived but by the afternoon, he was dead, having collapsed with anaphylaxis.</p><p>I meet Benedict’s mother, Helen Blythe, for coffee one spring morning in a country hotel not far from Stamford where she lives. We sit in a quiet back room and talk for two hours. To start with, there’s another person in the room, but when he hears what we will be talking about, he offers awkward condolences and leaves. The random pity of strangers is just one of the many things Helen has had to endure since the death of her son. She tells me that when she meets someone new she has to decide whether to say that she has one child or two (Benedict’s younger sister, Etta, also has multiple allergies). When our coffee arrives, it comes with a piece of buttery shortbread but Helen says I should take hers. She went vegan in 2020 when she realised she effectively was already as a vegetarian cooking for two children with milk and egg allergies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/15/its-one-of-the-great-mysteries-of-our-time-why-extreme-food-allergies-are-on-the-rise-and-what-we-can-do-about-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Climate breakdown and crop losses threaten our survival, but the ultra-rich find ever more creative ways to maintain the status quo</p><p>According to Google’s news search, the media has run more than 10,000 stories this year about Phillip Schofield, the British television presenter who resigned over an affair with a younger colleague. Google also records a global total of five news stories about a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38906-7">scientific paper</a> published last week, showing that the chances of simultaneous crop losses in the world’s major growing regions, caused by climate breakdown, appear to have been dangerously underestimated. In mediaworld, a place that should never be confused with the real world, celebrity gossip is thousands of times more important than existential risk.</p><p>The new paper explores the impacts on crop production when meanders in the jet stream (Rossby waves) become stuck. Stuck patterns cause extreme weather. To put it crudely, if you live in the northern hemisphere and a kink in the jet stream (the band of strong winds a few miles above the Earth’s surface at mid-latitudes) is stuck to the south of you, your weather is likely to be cold and wet. If it’s stuck to the north of you, you’re likely to suffer escalating heat and drought.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/15/food-systems-collapse-plutocrats-life-on-earth-climate-breakdown">Continue reading...</a>

It is, <a href="https://youngdubliners.com/" title="">the Young Dubliners</a> drummer says, “always busy and wonderfully diverse, packed with people from all over the world, making it a prime street-photography spot”.</p><p>He doesn’t see this particular shot, which he captured back in 2015 on an iPhone 8, as a product of good luck, however. “I had an idea in my mind’s eye of what I wanted, so I positioned myself accordingly and then observed, waited, shot, repeated,” Ingraham says. “Taking a quick shot and then moving on rarely results in anything worthwhile. I couldn’t have got something like this without doing my homework first, studying the work of the masters of the craft, such as Alex Webb and Henri Cartier-Bresson.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/15/david-ingraham-best-phone-picture-handball-hangout">Continue reading...</a>

Even if she had been, she says, why would anyone have been interested? Her band, Lush, were “never that big”. They enjoyed cult alt-rock success in the early 90s, scored three Top 30 singles in the Britpop era, and broke up in 1996. They briefly reformed in 2015, but broke up again after less than a year, keen “to return to our families and homes”. When a publisher approached her with the idea of an autobiography, she says, “I literally laughed in his fucking face – I was like: ‘Why would I want to do that? That sounds ridiculous.’”</p><p>But then Berenyi lost her job as a subeditor when the magazine she worked for folded. “Lockdown was looming, and I thought, ‘Oh shit, actually this isn’t a great time to be looking for a job’, so I kind of … It was a bit more pragmatic than a burning ambition.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/15/shake-rattle-and-write-why-the-music-memoir-is-booming">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Wild’ swimming is often seen as individualistic. But the sea has brought me real community | Laura Snapes

<p>I joined my hometown group in Cornwall simply to have people to swim with. I didn’t expect to find a nurturing support network</p><p>With apologies, I must smash the glass on the case marked: “X days since the Guardian published an article about wild swimming.” Don’t worry: I am not here to extol the life-giving properties of cold water or of being “at one” with nature. If I can find a sympathetic read on the eye-rolls directed at open-water swimming (much of which, to be honest, feels little short of thinly veiled misogyny, given its popularity with women), it’s that so much of it skews painfully individualistic: singular voyages of discovery clad in neoprene. But for me, the loveliest thing about sea swimming is the sense of community it’s created, rooting me in my distant home town.</p><p>I grew up in Cornwall and started swimming in the sea when I was small. (I agree with Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett that when you live somewhere coastal, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/29/swimming-wild-trend-social-media-cliche">it’s just called “swimming”</a>, no faddy branding needed.) Back then, I liked to swim alone, paddling out far enough that I could sing pop songs to myself where no one could hear, and staying in so long that my lips went blue and I had to be forcibly extracted and revived in the shower. But three years ago this month, when I returned home to Falmouth for a spell after lockdown finally lifted, my friend Flo invited me to swim as part of a small group of women who met early each morning at Swanpool beach. Our ages ranged from early 30s to late 60s. Flo soon moved to a different town and stopped coming, but I kept going, pleased to have a regular outdoor appointment and fresh faces to see during the endless months of working from home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/15/wild-swimming-sea-community-cornwall-support">Continue reading...</a>

Take for example the viral Michael Jordan-esque, shoulder-shrug celebration of her goal four minutes into last year’s National Women’s Soccer League Championship. The goal clinched her team, Portland Thorns, a third NWSL title and secured Smith the MVP game trophy to cap off her MVP season.</p><p>“I just did it,” Smith said after the match. “There’s been a lot of people who don’t think that I deserve to win MVP.

<p>In 2012, she was a breakout star of the singing competition. Then she suddenly disappeared from the show. For the first time she speaks about what led her to leave, how she feels she was let down – and the surprising person who held the key to her recovery</p><p>• ‘All four judges had their eyes on me’: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/15/all-four-judges-had-their-eyes-on-me-big-grins-on-their-faces-lucy-spraggan-recalls-her-x-factor-audition">read an extract from Lucy Spraggan’s memoir here</a></p><p>Lucy Spraggan was a 20-year-old gigging musician when she was scouted by producers to compete on The X Factor. This was 2012, and Simon Cowell’s primetime star-maker was at the peak of its influence, having produced One Direction and Little Mix in its previous two series. Spraggan became the first contestant to perform her own songs and play an instrument. Her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i3qeErUaFo" title="">audition</a> – an ode to “beer fear” called Last Night (“Last night I told ya I loved ya / Woke up, blamed it on the vodka”) – was the world’s fourth most-watched YouTube video of that year, and she became the UK’s most Googled artist. Lily Allen <a href="https://twitter.com/lilyallen/status/259757250489499649" title="">tweeted</a> that Spraggan reminded her of a young version of herself, and she was the bookies’ odds-on favourite to win the show. Viewers voted her through the first three live shows before being told that she had left the competition due to illness. Only, she wasn’t ill.</p><p>Eleven years later, Spraggan, now 31, is finally ready to talk about why she disappeared. We meet in a light-filled attic studio, and though she later admits that she is incredibly nervous, she appears measured and resolute, choosing her words with the care of someone who has spent a great deal of time weighing them. We’re here to discuss her new memoir, in which she reveals that she was raped during the production of The X Factor, and the devastating impact that this had on the subsequent decade of her life. “My working title for the book was Are You That Girl?,” she says. “Because for years I was terrified of being known as the girl that that happened to. I was deeply, chronically ashamed. Now I understand that what happened wasn’t my decision, it was out of my hands. And in order for me to rebuild myself and move on, I needed to tell the truth.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/15/lucy-spraggan-the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-the-x-factor">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Lannacombe Beach, south Devon:</strong> They are crustaceans the size of a housefly, and their presence here shows the beach is healthy</p><p>Belly down on the grey-tan sand of a south Devon beach, I am turning out sandcastle after sandcastle from a green bucket with a starfish on it, when I notice that the sand is seething with life. “Grasshopper!” my almost-two-year-old daughter exclaims, and she’s half right. The creatures flicking away from my feet, and from the ruins of the sand turret she has taken such pleasure in demolishing, are in fact not insects, but sand hoppers (<em>Talitrus saltator</em>).</p><p>I scoop one of the housefly-sized crustaceans on to the palm of my hand, and bring it to eye level. Now we are close enough to see the animal’s glistening exoskeleton, its shrimp-like legs, its body the colour of every grain of sand on the beach. For a few seconds the sand hopper lies there, motionless, like a dog half-curled by the fire. Then, with no perceptible movement at all, it vanishes, in a kinetic movement too quick for the human eye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/15/country-diary-a-sand-hopper-vanishes-too-quick-for-the-human-eye">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zelenskiy says Russia doing everything it can to stop Ukrainian troop advance; Putin says he tried and failed to have Prigozhin replaced as Wagner leader in Ukraine</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainians must understand that Russia is deploying all possible resources to stop Kyiv’s forces from advancing in the east and south </strong>of Ukraine. It comes after reports of the counteroffensive advancing slowly. The Ukrainian president said on Friday: “We must all understand very clearly, as clearly as possible, that Russian forces in our southern and eastern lands are doing everything they can in order to stop our soldiers.”</p><p><strong>The head of the Ukrainian president’s office said battles were difficult but that western allies were not putting pressure on Kyiv to advance faster</strong>. Andriy Yermak said: “Today it’s advancing not so quickly. If we are going to see that something is going wrong, we’ll say so. No one is going to embellish.”</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has said he sought and failed to have Yevgeny Prigozhin replaced as the leader of Wagner’s fighters in Ukraine</strong>. Putin’s version of events, which appeared in an interview with the Kommersant newspaper, was a surprise admission that the Russian president was still <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/12/wagner-hands-thousands-of-tonnes-of-weaponry-to-russian-army">negotiating a takeover of the Wagner mercenary group</a>.</p><p><strong>Boris Johnson has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/14/boris-johnson-nato-ukraine-membership">criticised Nato’s “mealy mouthed procrastination”</a></strong> and called for a timetable to be drawn up for Ukraine to join, after this week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/zelenskiy-accuses-nato-of-lack-of-respect-over-ukraine-membership">difficult summit in Lithuania</a>. Writing in the Daily Mail, the former British prime minister said it was “no wonder” that Volodymyr Zelenskiy “found it hard” to conceal his frustration at the joint declaration released on Tuesday that stopped short of outlining a roadmap to Nato membership.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has agreed to extend the Black Sea grain deal, which expires next week, according to the Turkish president.</strong> Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Friday that he had spoken with his Russian counterpart about the crucial deal allowing for the export of Ukrainian grain to ease a global food crisis. Moscow played down Erdoğan’s comments, saying an agreement had not yet been reached.</p><p><strong>A Kyiv court has ordered pre-trial detention for a senior cleric of a branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church with historic links to Moscow</strong> on suspicion of sympathising with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian news reports said a Kyiv district court set bail at more than 33 million hryvnias (about $900,000). The church denies the allegations and says it severed all ties with Moscow last year. Metropolitan Pavlo had been under house arrest since April on suspicion of inflaming religious hatred and justifying the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>An alleged Russian intelligence operative</strong> accused by the US of smuggling American-developed technology and ammunition to Russia to help its war against Ukraine <strong>was</strong> <strong>extradited from Estonia</strong>, federal prosecutors said on Friday.</p><p><strong>Russian air defence systems shot down two UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles</strong> that Ukraine had fired at Melitopol and Berdiansk on Thursday, the Russian-imposed leader of occupied Zaporizhzhia, Yevhen Balitsky, has claimed.</p><p><strong>Mercenary fighters from Russia’s Wagner group are training Belarusian soldiers in Belarus</strong>, the country’s defence ministry has said. “[Wagner] fighters acted as instructors in a number of military disciplines,” it said on Friday.</p><p><strong>A Ukrainian court has jailed a man for 10 years after finding him guilty of plotting with Russia to blow up transport infrastructure</strong> to disrupt foreign arms supplies. Ukraine’s domestic security agency said it detained the man in February before he had been able to carry out his mission.</p><p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy held a meeting with Ukraine’s intelligence chief and said on Telegram that <strong>according to intelligence data, there was no threat of invasion from Belarus</strong>.</p><p><strong>Russia has accused the west of sponsoring “nuclear terrorism” after authorities said a Ukrainian drone struck the western Russian town of Kurchatov</strong>, where a nuclear power station similar to the Chornobyl plant is located. Roman Starovoit, the Kursk oblast governor, said on Telegram that no residents were injured. “Critical facilities were not damaged as a result of the drone crash and its subsequent detonation.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-507-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
