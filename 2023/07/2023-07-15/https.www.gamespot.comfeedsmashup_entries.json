This caps off an eventful week in the related court drama between Microsoft and the FTC as the tech giant sought to close its deal to acquire Activision-Blizzard that was first announced over a year and a half ago.</p><p>The presiding judge's ruling landed on Tuesday, July 11, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wins-court-case-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/1100-6515704/\">denied the FTC an injunction</a>. A day later, the FTC moved to appeal that ruling and find its injunction in appellate court, but that too has now been denied. It's very likely Microsoft will now close on the deal, perhaps as soon as Monday, July 17.</p><p>Xbox's parent company still needs to work things out with the UK's regulatory body, the CMA, as the regulators had concerns over Microsoft's potential for future cloud monopolization specifically.
