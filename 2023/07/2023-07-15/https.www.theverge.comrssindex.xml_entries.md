  <p id="zOIb2s">Bosch is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230714458586/en/Bosch-Unveils-Next-Generation-Dishwasher-Line-With-Industry-Leading-Technology-That-Helps-End-the-Great-Loading-Debate/">claiming its new 800 and Benchmark Series dishwashers</a> could finally lay to rest the debate over the right way to load the dishwasher. </p>
<p id="J334uM">The new thing is a PowerControl spray arm that can find the dirtiest dishes wherever you put them (as long as that place is on the bottom rack):</p>
<blockquote><p id="wIKHGY">The PowerControl™ spray arm provides a targeted intensive wash from anywhere in the bottom rack – no matter where the dishes are loaded.</p></blockquote>
<div id="7chxJ4"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div>
<p id="wb1KJb">Basically, you can target specific quadrants of the lower rack for extra attention. According to the <a href="https://media3.bosch-home.com/Documents/9001635109_A.pdf">manual</a> for one of the new dishwashers, it looks like you’ll need the Bosch Home Connect app to actually set those quadrants; otherwise, your options are to split more intensive cleaning between the front and back half....</p>

  <p id="SLTstM">Reddit users have noticed the site unexpectedly removed everyone’s chat history prior to January 1st of this year. Those asking why have been directed to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/14gb7xy/changelog_chat_and_flair_navigation_updates/">changelog update</a> from June announcing feature updates to chats (via <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-removes-live-chat-archives-messages?taid=64b1a950add63d0001d35feb"><em>Mashable</em></a>). The update’s headline didn’t say anything about data going away, and burying any reference to removal at the bottom with a vague, single line:</p>
<blockquote><p id="JYd9eI"> In an effort to have a smooth and quick transition to this new infrastructure, we will migrate chat messages sent from January 1, 2023 onward.</p></blockquote>
<p id="I27xeq">Assuming anyone read the note and made it all the way to the bottom, they apparently should’ve understood this meant everything before that date would disappear. </p>

## I almost can’t believe it, but Google Tasks is finally kind of good

  <p id="5Yq6fz">Google has spent the last half-decade cruelly teasing me with its to-do list app. Google Tasks first launched as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/27/17286226/google-tasks-review-to-do-list-gmail-calendar-keep">a standalone app in 2018</a>, and Google seemed to have big plans for its task manager tool. And then… nothing. Actually, worse than nothing: Google launched and developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/2/23151662/google-reminders-confusing-system-calendar-keep">so many disconnected reminder-setting products</a> that it became nearly impossible to figure out where your tasks were, what they are, and how you were supposed to get anything done.</p>
<p id="2p7Lp6">But in the last couple of months, something miraculous happened: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23362711/google-tasks-hub-reminders-assistant-calendar-management">Google actually fixed it</a>. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23604463/google-tasks-reminders-keep-migration-schedule">spent this spring combining</a> all its many Tasks and Reminders products into a single tool that is accessible almost everywhere and via almost any Google product.

## Infrared may no longer be a punchline, as IEEE approves 9.6Gbps wireless light

  <p id="I4U4i7">We’ve known <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/28/5038130/internet-of-light-scientists-achieve-10-gigabit-data-speeds-using-leds">for over a decade</a> that blinking light bulbs can transfer <em>substantial</em> quantities of wireless data, not just dumb infrared commands to your TV. Now, the IEEE standards body behind Wi-Fi has decided to formally invite “Li-Fi” to the same table — with speeds of between 10 megabits per second and 9.6 gigabits per second using invisible infrared light.</p>
<p id="hv310g">As of June 2023, the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard now <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11bb/10823/">officially recognizes</a> wireless light communications as a physical layer for wireless local area networks, which is a fancy way of saying that that Li-Fi doesn’t need to compete with Wi-Fi. Light can be just another kind of access point and interface delivering the same networks and/or the same internet to your device. </p>
