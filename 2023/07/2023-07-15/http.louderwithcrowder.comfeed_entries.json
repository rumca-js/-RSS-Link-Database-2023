One is a possible nod to what critics call the REAL schlimate agenda: Leftists using schlimate warming to control the population. The other is that no one in the White House knows how to speak good. Welcome to today's exciting edition of \"Freudian Slip or Embarrassing Gaffe?\"</p><p>Our contestant is a San Francisco woman who rose to success <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-fran-mayor-kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\">by smashing a mayor</a> and checking off not one but TWO boxes on the Democrat Party's most marginalized Bingo card.

It's a common opinion on the Left. Bill Nye, the former children's entertainer the media claims is a schlimate expert, PRAISED Planned Parenthood <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-nye-applauds-planned-parenthood-for-population-control\" target=\"_blank\">for their contributions to the field of population control</a>. People who have too many children -- typically more than one or two -- <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/americans-one-fewer-child-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">are the targets of progressive hate and intolerance</a>. \"Babies are bad for the Earth\" <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/environmentalists-babies-are-bad-for-earth-no-but-sht-talking-tree-huggers-are\" target=\"_blank\">are words that are said out loud</a>. Leftists and the media (but I repeat myself) don't hide their agenda or beliefs. That's on one hand.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kamala-harris-essence-festival\" target=\"_blank\">Kamala Harris is a nincompoop</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/1677004130273853467\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an above-average chance that her brain confused words. It happens. I mean, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-philadelphia-john-fetterman\" target=\"_blank\">have you met her boss</a>?</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CalebHowe/status/1670156068272349187\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After much consideration and careful analysis, I'm chalking this up to an embarrassing gaffe. It's not that I don't believe eco whackadoodles work in the White House and support reducing the population (of people they don't like). But they are entering election season where they go into \"hide what we truly believe\" mode. There is no way they would be discussing population control in front of two people (Harris and Biden) not known for their cunning linguistics.</p><p>Feel free to argue that I'm wrong. It's within the realm of possibilities.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

I doubt Tom Cruise loses sleep over the future of any industry or anything other than how much he's pleasing Xenu. Or <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-think-Tom-Cruise-is-gay\" target=\"_blank\">if certain rumors</a> come out in the press. But if someone pops positive for COVID, the entire production shuts down. If the entire production shuts down, the crew members can't work. Anyone on the set who has a problem with those guidelines should have dealt with that before taking the job. I can understand Cruise's freakout.</p><p>Now, one could argue the reason for these restrictions is the fearmongering in the media, as well as from Cruise's celebrity colleagues with #WeAreAllInThisTogether in their Instagram bios. But Facebook's \"fact\" \"checkers\" have an itchy deplatform finger lately. I'll save that argument for another time.</p><p>Update: Cruise also, allegedly, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tom-cruise-covid-robots\" target=\"_blank\">hired robots to enforce guidelines as well</a>.

It's a breeding ground for web content. Though while the Waffle House tends to be more about <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-grits\" target=\"_blank\">throwing hands</a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-cook-shares-story\" target=\"_blank\">throwing chairs</a>, Walmart is where people go to have psychotic episodes.

What was the thought process or defining incident that led to her making a political statement in the aisle of Walmart?</p><p>For a while, black lives were the only ones that matter. If you said any other lives mattered, you weren't showing equity. And FORGET saying that \"all lives matter.\" That's the most racist thing you can say. It's the hard-R of lives mattering.</p><p>Then trans lives came along, and black lives dropped on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings. Though black lives still rank above women, who on the regular get told <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-university-pittsburgh-speech\" target=\"_blank\">by trans lives</a> they <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out\" target=\"_blank\">don't matter at all</a>.</p><p>This brings us to this lady. Is she saying that black lives DON'T matter? And \"my pussy\" is her version of a deez nuts joke? Or is it that she dreams of a world where her pussy matters at least as much as black lives? We're at a point in the 2020s where it's hard to tell what is woke progressism and what is unhinged lunacy.</p><p>We're just thankful someone had their camera out. Always remember to do it for the content, folks.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Apropos of nothing, the winner of those awards was another black artist. Bobby McFerrin for \"Don't Worry, Be Happy.\"</p><p>On top of all this? Black, queer, and female Tracy Chapman OWNS the publishing writes and songwriting credits so she is getting a lion's share of the royalties on Combs' hit. A point that was made IN the content WaPo created, where they went searching for -isms and -phobias anyway.</p><p>We could celebrate this. We could be happy that Luke Combs -- yes, even though he's a place dude who is attracted to members of the opposite sex -- is introducing Chapman as an artist to an entire NEW generation of music fans. In normie-America, where people are able to listen to music with each other in peace, this is what's happening.</p><p>WaPo needs to create hate by looking for people who are unhappy.
