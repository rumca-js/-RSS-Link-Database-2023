<p>Residents in Sandridge, South Carolina, are up in arms about a proposed highway that would destroy their homes</p><p>For decades, Bobbie Anne Hemingway Jordan lived on the same property, in the house where she was born. Her backyard was often filled with the sound of her two dozen grandkids as they ran to and from the park next door. For generations, Hemingway Jordan’s family lived and farmed on the land, and the 82-year-old believed it would be passed down to future generations as well. “I thought it would be left to my children, and they could leave it to their children,” she said.</p><p>Then, in 2021, appraisers offered to buy the land and her house. The sum she received for her three-bedroom, two-bath house was just enough money to purchase a one-bedroom apartment in a nearby community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/25/sandridge-south-carolina-highway-conway-perimeter-road">Continue reading...</a>

They used weather data up to 18 July and computer models to compare today’s climate, with 1.2C of global heating, with the cooler climate of the late 1800s.</p><p><strong>What did the analysis show?</strong> The study found the heatwaves in Europe and the US were, as an absolute minimum, made 950 and 4,400 times more likely by global heating – making it virtually certain that they were the result of human-caused emissions. In China, the heatwave was made 50 times more likely.</p><p><strong>Was anyone else hurt?</strong> No one else at the hospital was killed, but another staffer was wounded.

This year, they look set to be some of the worst the country has ever seen: firefighters have been trying to control 82 wildfires that have been burning for the last week, 64 of which started on Sunday during the hottest July weekend in 50 years in Greece (the mercury reached <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/greece-wildfires-corfu-evia-rhodes-heatwave-northern-hemisphere-extreme-weather-temperatures-europe">45C in the central region of Thessaly</a>). Recent analysis by scientists has shown that the human-caused climate crisis is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/25/deadly-global-heatwaves-undeniably-result-of-climate-crisis-scientists-attribution">undeniably to blame </a>for the fatal heatwave that has hit Europe and many parts of the world, causing wildfires like the ones we have seen in Greece. And if nothing is done, the problem will only become more acute, with scientists predicting that if the world heats by 2C, these brutal heatwaves will happen every two to five years.</p><p><em><strong>BBC</strong></em> | One of the BBC’s best-known journalists and newsreaders,<em><strong> </strong></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-dies-aged-67">George Alagiah</a>, has died at the age of 67 after being diagnosed with bowel cancer nine years ago, his agent has said.

<p>Passing of key part of Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to reduce power of courts is met with calls for strike action and street protests by thousands</p><p>Doctors across Israel are set to strike on Tuesday in protest against the passing of a key part of Benjamin Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul, after thousands of protesters took to the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Monday night.</p><p>The Israeli Medical Association, which says it represents about 95% of doctors, said it would hold a 24-hour protest, with exemptions for medical care in Jerusalem and emergency care across the country. It held a brief strike last week as a warning, arguing the judicial overhaul would “devastate the healthcare system”. The doctors are set to be joined in strike action on Tuesday by 73% of interns, according to the Intern Doctors Organization. Health minister Moshe Arbel is reportedly seeking an injunction to prevent the doctors’ strike going ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/25/israel-protests-judicial-overhaul-reform-news-doctors-strike">Continue reading...</a>
