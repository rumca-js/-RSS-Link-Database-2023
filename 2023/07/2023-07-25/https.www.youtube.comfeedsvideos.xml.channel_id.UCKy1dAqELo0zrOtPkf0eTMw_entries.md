In today's Fix of Entertainment News:
Director Christopher Nolan still gets asked what the meaning of Inception's ending is. Did DiCaprio make it out? Or is he stuck in the dream world? Nolan gives an answer, and it might be something you don't expect. But even though we have a (mostly) definitive explanation, it'll probably still be debated by cinephiles for years to come. And something else people are talking about: the Barbie movie. It's been a huge success for Warner Bros. and toy company Mattel, who recently inked a new deal to be the official toy make for Warner Bros properties. So in some weird way, Barbie and Batman exist in the same universe. Let's see that crossover, James Gunn!

Check out the trailer for The Exorcist: Believer, an upcoming horror movie starring Leslie Odom, Jr., Lidya Jewett, and Olivia Marcum.

Exactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer. 

Since the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own. 

But when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil. 

For the first time since the 1973 film, Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. 

The film also stars Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend. 

The Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty. 

The film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment. 

The executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures. 

The Exorcist: Believer opens in theaters on October 13, 2023.

In today's Daily Fix:
In honor of the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie coming to theaters, Microsoft is releasing four totally radical controllers themed after each of the four turtles. But they're not just cool slime-green controllers with a ninja turtle's face on them—they smell like pizza, too. The scent comes from a diffuser attached to the controllers that makes them smell like pizza. Now you don't need to be scarfing down pizza rolls to get that authentic scent on your hands. Cowabunga, dudes. In other news, eagle-eyed Starfield fans noticed that the game does not pause when pickpocketing NPC's. Unlike in other Bethesda games like Skyrim or Fallout, where the entire game will be put on hold while you rummage through someone's pockets, you'll be doing it in real-time out in space. Hope you have quick hands. On the business side of things, mega corporation Tencent just acquired another studio, this time it's Techland, the devs behind Dying Light and the original Dead Island. And finally, Modern Warfare 2 players found a way to get a cat that shoots lasers into the game. Yeah, you read that right.
