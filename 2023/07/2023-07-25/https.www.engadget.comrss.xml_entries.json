As long as you don\u2019t have too many other requirements, that is. <a href=\"https://orangeamps.com/\"><ins>Orange</ins></a> has been making guitar amps since the 1960s and it\u2019s apparently not changing the formula to compete against commonplace plastic Bluetooth speakers with all the mod cons. I\u2019ve personally come to enjoy the bohemian design and bright orange exterior, which is a refreshing change from what you\u2019d usually find. You do have to deal with losing some useful features and it\u2019s less rugged than some other portables, but the audio quality is a standout.</p><h2><strong>Hardware</strong></h2><p>The hardware elements and iconography from the company\u2019s long history of amps and speakers have been merged into this portable battery powered version. The orange Tolex (vinyl) exterior, logo badge, speaker mesh, wood framing, knobs, toggle switches, indicator lights and other details are a perfect match with the brand\u2019s existing stable of products. The mechanical \u2018thunk\u2019 of the on/off toggle is satisfying, while the domed orange power light seems pleasantly retro.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"An overhead view of the Orange Amps - Orange Box Bluetooth speaker's control panel on the top.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/aea03380-2af6-11ee-a7b7-cef849bbab45\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are manual volume and EQ dials on the top panel. The bass and treble start out flat in the 12-o\u2019clock position, letting you boost or lower those levels as desired. The dial positions are a little hard to read, though, unless you\u2019re standing directly above them since the position dot on the dial is near the bottom. The Bluetooth control has a blue light that flashes when it\u2019s in pairing mode and does double-duty as a pause/play control. You\u2019ll also find an orange overload indicator light, which could become a common sight if you like to play your music loudly, especially with heavy bass.</p><p>Aside from that, there\u2019s a 3.5mm minijack on the top and an DC charging port on the back. You can charge the 2,600mAh battery for up to around 15-hours of playback or you can just run it while it\u2019s plugged in. Next to the domed power indicator is a battery level light that\u2019s red as it's charging, green when it\u2019s full and flashes red if the battery is at 10 percent or lower, with nothing in between. Like any speaker, if you\u2019re planning a long outing, you should keep the power cable handy. I tested the speaker at a relatively high volume for an hour, plus 10 hours at medium and two overnight stretches powered off. This got me to the 10-percent warning and seems par for the course in regards to battery life.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Orange Amps - Orange Box Bluetooth speaker seen on the stoop of a brownstone, showing the rear panel.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ae6c7950-2af6-11ee-bbec-ebaaaa72a37d\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you plan to travel with your speaker, you may want to consider getting the $60 Gigbag carrying case since there\u2019s no IP rating or waterproofing for the device. You\u2019ll just have to trust Orange Amps\u2019 build quality. Although we haven\u2019t seen the bag in person, I expect it should at least help keep the speaker dry and clean when you\u2019re not using it. There\u2019s a shoulder strap option as well, and while the Orange Box is portable, it\u2019s still over 6.5 pounds. You could always save some money though, since it does fit into a backpack easily enough.</p><h2><strong>Sound</strong></h2><p>The best part about the Orange Box is its warm and bright output. There\u2019s both digital Class D and A/B analog amps that deliver crisp and punchy front-facing sound from the 4-inch sub and dual 2-inch high frequency drivers. There\u2019s a relatively wide frequency range from 35Hz to 20kHz and AptX support is a huge plus, especially if you have access to hi-res streaming. Most styles of music sound good on the Orange Box, but the speaker really shines with songs that have live instrumentation or anything that can benefit from an analog touch. Some types of modern digital music didn't come across quite as well here, so it's worth testing your types of tunes before buying.</p><p>The 50-watt speaker puts out enough volume to work well as a personal boombox in the park or around the house. It\u2019s fairly loud for its size and can handle small outdoor get togethers well if you just need background music. The output has decent bass that does reverberate through its case, especially if you\u2019re near to it. Although when testing on a large windy rooftop area, it didn\u2019t project as much if you\u2019re 15-20 feet away.</p><p>I didn\u2019t notice any distortion when pushing it to the max, but that overload light is a subtle hint to always check your levels. You\u2019ll see the light flashing quite often if you enjoy loud music. It\u2019s only when you have the overload light on constantly that you could get distortion and potentially damage the drivers. If that does happen, you do have the benefit of contacting an authorized repair center instead of having to cut your losses.</p><h2><strong>Features</strong></h2><p>Some features that many have grown used to using aren\u2019t available on the Orange Box and if you just want something to play tunes, it\u2019s not a big deal. However, there\u2019s no app for the speaker and it doesn\u2019t support multipoint or pairing with a second Orange Box for more sound. It won\u2019t go to sleep even if you\u2019ve disconnected Bluetooth, so the battery may slowly drain if you leave it on all night without charging. And if you\u2019re used to watching the battery levels, it will be a bit of a mystery until you\u2019re at 10 percent power. Plus, since there\u2019s no USB charging, you'll want to keep track of the power cable that came with the device.</p><p>On the plus side, there\u2019s obviously the analog amps on board and aptX support sweetens the deal. The Bluetooth 5.0 range is as good or better than some other speakers in this category. Also, if you need a tiny DJ monitor, there\u2019s no processing delay when using the 3.5mm input jack, so you can mix by ear if needed. For eco-conscious consumers, the authorized service centers and replacement parts on offer until 2030 means you can actually repair the speaker if something happens to it. It\u2019s a proper piece of equipment that you should be able to enjoy for a long time.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Orange Amps - Orange Box Bluetooth speaker seen indoors on a round table with a green plant behind it.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ae6f5f80-2af6-11ee-afbb-daf21914773f\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>While I wouldn\u2019t quite call it an audiophile speaker, it\u2019s certainly for analog or Orange Amp enthusiasts. I know the design isn\u2019t new since the Orange Amps style has hardly changed since the \u201860s, but for me it feels like a refreshing change of pace. I can imagine lots of people with those turntables in luggage cases hooking up the speaker (although make sure you have good needles people). Sure, it's a bit chunky, you shouldn\u2019t leave it out on the porch in the rain and you\u2019ll need to keep track of the specific charging cable, but that\u2019s doable.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to say if the sound or style will appeal to everyone, but it\u2019s great to have another option out there, especially one that\u2019s built and sold by a brand with a legacy. At $299 the Orange Box isn\u2019t terribly expensive and it feels less disposable than many of the products out there. The <a href=\"https://orangeamps.com/product/orange-box/\"><ins>Orange Box</ins></a>, its $60 Gigbag carrying case and the slightly larger non-portable sibling the <a href=\"https://orangeamps.com/product/orange-box-l/\">Orange Box-L</a> ($345) are all currently available from the <a href=\"https://orangeamps.com/products/\"><ins>Orange Amps</ins></a> website.

Even more so than the iPhone, the Apple Watch is a device you can truly make your own with the right accessories. It is, after all, a watch, and like traditional timepieces it\u2019s meant to reflect your personal style. While the most obvious way to customize it is with funky bands, there are cases, stands, wireless chargers and other accessories you can buy that can inject a bit of personality. Some are Apple products themselves, while others come from seasoned accessory makers like Spigen, Anker and Belkin. We tested out a bunch of gear to find out which are the best Apple Watch accessories.</p><h2>Spigen Thin Fit case</h2><p></p><p>While plenty of us use cases to protect our smartphones from drops and scrapes, you may not think to use a protective case for your smartwatch.

Chalk it up to me being clumsy, but I\u2019ve knocked my Apple Watch on more door frames than I\u2019d like to admit.

Spigen\u2019s <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlnZW4tVGhpbi1EZXNpZ25lZC1BcHBsZS1XYXRjaC9kcC9CMDlMNEMzNzNWP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWVkLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ODUzMjk0MC1kNTY5LTM0ZjAtYjRjYi0wYTVhNmQxMjc3ZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAam5hhGnPzd73zV8f3RmsZB9zuTeRRnbj_cYB89FcqEK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-Thin-Designed-Apple-Watch%2Fdp%2FB09L4C373V\">Thin Fit series</a> is more my speed: It sits flush against the Watch\u2019s display, but still gives you an extra layer of protection. You can even choose a color that matches your Watch to help it blend in. Two added perks of Spigen\u2019s cases are that they snap on quickly and easily, and they\u2019re quite affordable at around $14 a piece.</p><h2>Zagg InvisibleShield screen protector</h2><p></p><p>If you don\u2019t want the extra bulk that comes with a case, a screen protector will give you at least a bit more of a safeguard than sporting a naked Watch. Zagg\u2019s <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9aQUdHLUludmlzaWJsZVNoaWVsZC1VbHRyYS1DbGVhci1JbmRlc3RydWN0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDlHWVE3SlMyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWVkLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ODUzMjk0MC1kNTY5LTM0ZjAtYjRjYi0wYTVhNmQxMjc3ZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUbl-InKNzwiI2Y0swEpvT96nhHLfBXVKWC7FAbL-yvC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FZAGG-InvisibleShield-Ultra-Clear-Indestructible%2Fdp%2FB09GYQ7JS2\">InvisibleShield line</a> is a reliable one that provides shatter protection, clarity and enhanced touch-sensitivity. When installed properly (Zagg gives you clear instructions and all the tools you need to do so), you\u2019ll probably forget you have a screen protector on your Watch. This accessory blends in almost seamlessly with the Watch\u2019s hardware, and if you do accidentally ding the screen, the protector should take all of  the damage.</p><h2>Anker Nano 3 30W charger</h2><p></p><p>The latest Apple Watches don\u2019t come with power adapters, so you\u2019ll have to dig one out of your drawer or get a new one to charge it up. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1DaGFyZ2VyLUZvbGRhYmxlLWlQaG9uZS1JbmNsdWRlZC9kcC9CMEIyTU1CNExKLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1lZC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDg1MzI5NDAtZDU2OS0zNGYwLWI0Y2ItMGE1YTZkMTI3N2RiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWMXIa90Jilz_46tpR9CxIIz7BXh7UXEM_Pl9uujyk4k&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included%2Fdp%2FB0B2MMB4LJ%2F\">Anker\u2019s 30W Nano 3</a> is a good pick because it\u2019s compact, foldable and has ActiveShield 2.0, an improvement on Anker\u2019s temperature-monitoring technology. In brief, it just means that the charger will keep an eye on its temperature to prevent overheating or damaging your device while it\u2019s powering up. It has more than enough wattage to charge your Apple Watch quickly and efficiently, and enough to fast-charge your iPhone whenever you need to switch off and use it for that.</p><h2>Apple MagSafe Duo charger</h2><p></p><p>Apple makes one of the more elegant solutions to charging your iPhone and Apple Watch while traveling. The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NSFhGM0FNLUEtTWFnU2FmZS1DaGFyZ2VyL2RwL0IwOE1XUjJOWFo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZWQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ4NTMyOTQwLWQ1NjktMzRmMC1iNGNiLTBhNWE2ZDEyNzdkYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYDGt5DvQ6BKfyQLr58RsAYDXwYi9GZvPfdjbS7U_X0v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MHXF3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger%2Fdp%2FB08MWR2NXZ\">MagSafe Duo</a> has spaces to wirelessly charge both devices and folds up into a neat square when not in use. The Apple Watch pad flips upward as well, allowing you to use the power bank in Nighttime mode while it\u2019s charging. While this wireless charger does come with a USB-C to Lightning cable to provide power to the system, it does not come with an AC adapter so you will have to remember to pack your own.</p><h2>Belkin Boost Charge Pro portable fast charger</h2><p></p><p>Apple Watch chargers are a bit different than Lightning cables in the sense that you probably have only one of the former and many of the latter. Those who travel or commute often should consider getting a second Apple Watch charger, that way you\u2019re not stuck if you forget to pack your one and only before a long weekend trip. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CZWxraW4tV2lyZWxlc3MtQ2hhcmdpbmctTmlnaHRzdGFuZC1NaW5pbWFsaXN0L2RwL0IwOU1UODhRNEc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZWQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ4NTMyOTQwLWQ1NjktMzRmMC1iNGNiLTBhNWE2ZDEyNzdkYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQBLakpsrZy2oszBWc_R1rZ1pCvQ_oRthf1w_Vj5u6Gz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBelkin-Wireless-Charging-Nightstand-Minimalist%2Fdp%2FB09MT88Q4G\">Belkin\u2019s Boost Charge Pro portable fast charger</a> is a great option, particularly for those who have an Apple Watch Series 8. The square pad uses Apple\u2019s new fast wireless-charging module, so it\u2019ll be able to power up the Series 8 from 0 to 80 percent in roughly 45 minutes.</p><p>You can simply sit your timepiece on the module to charge, but it also flips up so you can use the Watch in Nightstand mode while it\u2019s powering up on your bedside table. To support different Watch sizes and protective cases, the pad also has a dial on its underside that lets you adjust the height of the charging module. Plus, the attached USB-C cable that tucks away on the bottom of the pad is four feet long, giving you a bit more placement flexibility than other chargers.</p><h2>Incase Bionic organizer</h2><p></p><p>You\u2019ll likely have your Apple Watch strapped to your wrist while traveling, but it\u2019s a good idea to have a pouch or case that can hold the gadget along with any accessories you need when you\u2019re not wearing it. We\u2019ve recommended <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2luY2FzZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYWNjZXNzb3J5LW9yZ2FuaXplci13LWJpb25pYyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDg1MzI5NDAtZDU2OS0zNGYwLWI0Y2ItMGE1YTZkMTI3N2RiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASBliQuF_24UC0-RZyOGMsmWP_TQ_VYDGiynGZjwLqrj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fincase.com%2Fproducts%2Faccessory-organizer-w-bionic\">Incase\u2019s Bionic organizer</a> in the past, and it remains a great option to hold all of your tech essentials while you\u2019re out and about. It\u2019s relatively compact at 9.5 x 6 x 2 inches and it has a number of internal pockets and loops to hold things like extra Watch bands, your charging cable and adapter, and even your AirPods. We also appreciate the semi-hidden external pocket in which you can store things you need quick-access to. And you can feel good about picking up this bag as it\u2019s made out of 100-percent recycled, ripstop fabric.</p><h2>Elago W6 Apple Watch stand</h2><p></p><p>If you want to use the Apple Watch\u2019s handy Nightstand mode while it\u2019s charging, a stand or holder can make that experience much easier. There are tons of options in this space, but <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9lbGFnby1TdGFuZC1XaGl0ZS1Db21wYXRpYmxlLUFwcGxlL2RwL0IwN1NIRDROUUw_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZWQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ4NTMyOTQwLWQ1NjktMzRmMC1iNGNiLTBhNWE2ZDEyNzdkYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbKykfCowxuyWOX0zm3sBkiabSE7yGb2UgDmurWwINcB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Felago-Stand-White-Compatible-Apple%2Fdp%2FB07SHD4NQL\">Elago\u2019s stands</a> have a lot of personality and are pretty affordable to boot. The brand\u2019s W-series comes in a number of fun designs, including that of a retro handheld gaming system, an old Mac and even some Line characters. They\u2019re not the sturdiest stands out there (they\u2019re mostly made of lightweight plastic, making them prone to sliding around if you pull on the charging cord), but they will inject some cuteness into your space \u2013 and for a price tag of only $15, what more could you want?</p><h2>Spigen ArcField MFi-certified charging</h2><p></p><p>Most Apple Watch stands you\u2019ll find have a spot for you to weave in the magnetic charging pad that comes with your Watch. But if you want to keep that in your travel bag, or simply want a second charger, we recommend <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlnZW4tQXJjRmllbGQtQ2VydGlmaWVkLU1hZ25ldGljLVdpcmVsZXNzL2RwL0IwOFI0MzJCSjg_cmVmXz1hc3Rfc3RvX2RwJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWVkLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ODUzMjk0MC1kNTY5LTM0ZjAtYjRjYi0wYTVhNmQxMjc3ZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbKArl0GNA6Ri1e-YzJeSXV-TR5j_KH8v0bqgXsQkHbw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-ArcField-Certified-Magnetic-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB08R432BJ8%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp\">Spigen\u2019s ArcField stand</a>. It has a built-in wireless charger for your Apple Watch, with a weighted, non-slip base that prevents the whole thing from moving around on your nightstand. Attached to the stand is a 6.6-foot USB-C cable, so all you\u2019ll need to provide is an adapter. We also like that it comes with an assortment of rubber strips that you can use to get the right position and viewing angle for your specific Apple Watch. That means this stand works with all Apple Watches, even the beefy Ultra.</p><h2>Apple Watch band multi-packs</h2><p></p><p>One of the easiest ways to make your Apple Watch your own is by picking up a couple of wristbands that suit your style. Like with iPhone cases, you could easily turn to Apple\u2019s first-party options \u2013 but you\u2019ll spend more money in the long run if you do that. It\u2019s easy to find <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFg0M1ZQWkQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZWQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ4NTMyOTQwLWQ1NjktMzRmMC1iNGNiLTBhNWE2ZDEyNzdkYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZYkYdVHpBp5FP_q57c14m-LNsQBRxSPuhMGGwcTA0xa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08X43VPZD%3F\">good Apple Watch bands</a> online from other brands in a variety of styles and materials. When it comes to basic silicone straps or sports brands, you can find packs of three to six bands for less than $20 but the quality may be questionable. Look for brands with many high ratings on Amazon if you insist on getting the best bang for your buck.

Although these devices are often thought of as a distinct niche within the wider headphone market, they're ultimately <em>still headphones</em>. And while it\u2019s certainly not impossible to get a gaming headset that sounds nice, doing so still tends to come at a higher cost than a comparable pair of wired headphones (yes, those still exist).</p><p>A good wired headphone remains your best bet if you want the most detailed sound possible at a given price point and don\u2019t need something especially portable, which is usually the case whether you\u2019re gaming on a console or PC. If you need to chat with friends, you can always buy an external microphone, whether it\u2019s a USB mic, a cheaper <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html\">clip-on mic</a> or a standalone headset mic like the <a href=\"https://antlionaudio.com/collections/microphones/\">Antlion ModMic</a> or <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9WLU1PREEtQm9vbVByby1NaWNyb3Bob25lLUdhbWluZy1Db21tdW5pY2F0aW9uL2RwL0IwMEJKMTdXS0svP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc3eyz3tAa5ZiXqoOSXXUJbQ9_Y1rClL-8LF-6d_J8BW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FV-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication%2Fdp%2FB00BJ17WKK%2F\">V-Moda BoomPro</a>. In many cases, those will make your voice sound clearer and fuller than the ones included with a gaming headset.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But we do recognize that many people just want the convenience of an all-in-one combo, value and aesthetics be damned. So after testing out a few dozen pairs over the past several months, we\u2019ve put together a list of good headphones for gaming and dedicated gaming headsets. We recommend you consider the former first, but all of them should make your play time more enjoyable.</p><h2>What to look for in good gaming headphones</h2><figure><img alt=\"A black gaming headset with a built-in boom microphone, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, rests on a white table in an outdoors setting.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/7a99ecc0-d95c-11ed-b13c-943d83f982b8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Evaluating headphones is a particularly subjective exercise, so calling one pair the absolute \u201cbest\u201d is something of a fool\u2019s errand. At a certain point, whether you're an audiophile or not, everything becomes a matter of taste. For most, a headphone with a wide soundstage and strong imaging performance \u2013 i.e., the ability to position sounds correctly, so you can more precisely tell where footsteps and other game effects are coming from \u2013 will provide the most immersive gaming experience, the kind that makes you feel like your head is <em>within</em> a given scene.</p><p>For that, you want a high-quality pair of headphones with an open-back design. That is to say, an over-ear pair whose earcups do not completely seal off the ear from air and outside noise. The big trade-off is that these are inherently terrible at isolating you from external sound and preventing others from hearing what you\u2019re playing. So if you often play games in a noisy environment, their benefits will be blunted. But in a quiet room, the best open-back pairs sounds significantly wider and more precise than more common closed-back models.</p><p>More up for debate is <em>how</em> a good gaming headphone should sound. If you want something that\u2019ll help you in competitive multiplayer games, you'll likely prefer a headphone with a flatter sound signature, so a game\u2019s mix won\u2019t be overly boosted in one direction and mask the smaller details of what\u2019s happening around you. A slightly brighter sound, one that pushes the upper frequencies a smidge, may also work. Open-back headphones almost never have huge sub-bass, so you rarely have to worry about low-end sounds muddying up the rest of the signature. In this light, the fact that an overwhelming amount of gaming headsets are closed-back and bass-heavy seems counterintuitive.</p><p>Lots of people love bass, though. And if you aren\u2019t just worried about competitive play, some extra low-end can add a touch of excitement to heavy action scenes or a rousing soundtrack. You still don\u2019t want a pair that boosts it too hard \u2013 which many dedicated gaming headsets do \u2013 but the point is that what makes a pair \u201cimmersive\u201d to one person may sound dull to another.</p><h2>Best headphones for gaming: Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUc3NzdWRzcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAftHZ3ObpyTnCGlnlk1QTt5XdsUA6Chr2_wDQQY2PZNc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G777VG7%2F\">Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X</a> should please a wide swath of people willing to pay for a capital-N <em>nice</em> set of headphones for their gaming sessions. This pair has great imaging performance and the kind of spacious soundstage expected from an open-back design. Bass is a little more present here than on many open-back headphones as well. There still isn\u2019t much in the way of deep sub-bass, as expected, but there\u2019s enough warmth to give in-game explosions a bit more juice without muddying up the mid-range frequencies. The mids get the most emphasis overall, but they\u2019re clear and that forwardness isn\u2019t a bad thing when you\u2019re trying to listen for enemy players in a competitive FPS like <em>Counter-Strike</em>. The treble isn\u2019t pushed quite as hard, but it\u2019s neither overly recessed nor harsh.</p><p>All of this means the DT 900 Pro X sounds detailed but not boring, so it should play nice whether you\u2019re trying to win a multiplayer game or taking in a more cinematic single-player experience. And when you\u2019re not gaming, you get an enjoyable sound for music.</p><p>Everything\u2019s built well, too. It\u2019ll clamp down slightly harder than average if you have a large head, but it balances its weight well, and its wonderfully soft velour earpads go a long way toward keeping the pair comfortable over long sessions. It comes with two detachable cables, including a three-meter option that\u2019s convenient if you sit far from your PC. This design can\u2019t fold up, though.</p><p>Like all open-back headphones, the DT 900 Pro X leak game audio and let in lots of noise, so it\u2019s not great on the go. Clearly, if you can afford to upgrade to an ultra-premium pair like <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLWhlYXJpbmcuY29tL2VuLVVTL3AvaGQtODAwLXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAa6x7Onjo7WKOjzbCSxIVnseZmZkmCiglwJ606VhetVN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fhd-800-s%2F\">Sennheiser\u2019s HD 800 S</a>, you\u2019ll get more space and true-to-life detail. But for a relatively attainable $250 to $300, the DT 900 Pro X should satisfy.</p><h2>Best headphones for gaming under $200: Sennheiser HD 560S</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019d rather not spend as much, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEo5TVZCNlcvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWDyYK2qqowd_jCmxamL_U0xsNiUmfFzxSo8Rr1ule3g&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08J9MVB6W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1\">Sennheiser HD 560S</a> is another excellent open-back headphone that\u2019s often available for around $150. Like the DT 900 Pro X, it has a wide soundstage that\u2019ll help you feel immersed in a given game. Its sound is slightly more neutral on the whole, so you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re missing any part of a mix, and it retrieves a lovely amount of detail from the treble and mid-range frequencies. There's less bass power for explosions, though, and the treble, while more present, may sound piercing at times. Imaging isn\u2019t <em>quite</em> as nuanced either, though it\u2019s nowhere near poor.</p><p>Design-wise, the HD 560S are plenty comfortable to wear for extended periods. They don\u2019t clamp down too hard on those with big heads (like yours truly), and the velour earpads hug your ears softly. The included cable is removable, too. The plastic frame doesn\u2019t feel as sturdy or premium as the DT 900 Pro X, however, so you won\u2019t want to chuck them around haphazardly. It won\u2019t block much outside noise either, nor will it prevent those around you from hearing what you're playing. Nevertheless, the HD 560S is a pleasure and a great value.</p><h2>Best headphones for gaming under $50: Koss KSC75</h2><p></p><p>If you can\u2019t spend more than $50, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/koss-ksc75-headphones-irl-143533671.html\">still hard</a> to top the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Lb3NzLUtTQzc1LVBvcnRhYmxlLVN0ZXJlb3Bob25lLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMvZHAvQjAwMDZCNDg2Sz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQfD8I5u9Wr_HH3Mk133wyEZwLmX6ZZSO7f1nbXbLB5n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKoss-KSC75-Portable-Stereophone-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0006B486K%3Fth%3D1\">Koss KSC75</a>. It costs $20, but judging purely on audio quality, it\u2019s better than some headphones priced closer to $100. This pair is very obviously devoid of deep bass, so you won\u2019t get that full-bodied <em>oomph</em> from in-game effects. You also won't hear all the intricate details you'd pick up with the pricier headphones above. But it locates sounds accurately and its open design gives it a real sense of width. It\u2019s a superb value for competitive play.</p><p>The catch is that it\u2019s built like a set of free airline headphones. The KSC75 has an odd clip-on design that, while lightweight, won\u2019t be a comfortable fit for everyone. It certainly looks like it costs $20, though Koss backs it with a <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2tvc3MuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3dhcnJhbnR5LXJlcGFpciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATq3XDDgE-dSvLRyTZM88jDPxijB4fPBTFoX-Vj8QyK1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fkoss.com%2Fpages%2Fwarranty-repair\">lifetime warranty</a> that essentially lets you get endless replacements for $9 each. Even if the KSC75 are pushing 20 years old, its sound remains relatively well-balanced and particularly well-suited for gaming.</p><h2>Best gaming headset: Astro A40 TR</h2><p></p><p>If you must have a dedicated gaming headset with a built-in mic, consider the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdOU1JZREg5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAevIZTvveh8dqiw9CG4f9NRCLh028Al8JIaATGwTlTA3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07NSRYDH9\">Astro A40 TR</a>. Another open-back pair, it has a more spacious soundstage than usual for the category \u2013 though it's not on par with better non-gaming headphones \u2013 and it generally localizes sounds correctly. This profile emphasizes the bass, giving explosions a smooth and satisfying thump, but it doesn\u2019t overdo it like many other headsets marketed toward gaming.</p><p>The sound here is still a step behind the DT 900 Pro X or HD 560S, especially for online shooters, as the pushed upper-bass and lower-mids can blunt finer details a bit more. Footsteps usually won\u2019t sound as clear. But compared to most gaming headsets, the A40\u2019s profile is better balanced, and it does well to envelop you in the sounds of a busy scene.</p><p>Comfort shouldn\u2019t be an issue, either. The A40 is on the bulkier side, but its weight is evenly distributed and doesn\u2019t clamp down overly hard. The fuzzy earpads are soft and breathable, while the earcups are roomy enough to fit larger ears. The headset has the usual open-back shortcomings, though: It leaks a bunch of sound and blocks almost zero outside noise. The design looks \u201cgamer-y,\" too, and there\u2019s no built-in volume control. The whole thing is mostly made of plastic, though it doesn\u2019t come off as flimsy.</p><p>The A40\u2019s mic, meanwhile, is just OK. It picks up background noises while you chat, and voices sound somewhat muffled. It\u2019s serviceable but you\u2019d buy the A40 for its sound quality first. The mic isn\u2019t detachable either, but you can easily flip it up and out of the way.</p><p>The A40 has been around for four years now, but its price has come down from $150 to a more reasonable $130 in that time. Astro sells an optional <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html\">DAC</a> with extra controls for $130, but at that price we\u2019d strongly advise buying a good \u201cnormal\u201d headphone and external mic.</p><h2>Best budget gaming headset: HyperX Cloud Stinger 2</h2><p></p><p>You won\u2019t find a good open-back gaming headset under $50, so if you\u2019re on a tight budget and require a built-in mic, you\u2019ll have to compromise on sound quality. With that in mind, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IeXBlclgtQ2xvdWQtU3Rpbmdlci1Td2l2ZWwtTXV0ZS9kcC9CMEI4UEdETVdLLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfh2E5Ka9uLQvooXb479JP4pK_Z0_40HFg_nNxE4Yv0q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperX-Cloud-Stinger-Swivel-Mute%2Fdp%2FB0B8PGDMWK%2F\">HyperX Cloud Stinger 2</a> is a decent buy at its typical street price of $40. Its mic belies that low price, making voices sound relatively clear and accurate. In fact, it\u2019s a clear step-up from the Astro A40. It\u2019s not detachable but it\u2019s flexible and automatically mutes when you slide it out of the way. This pair also gets the comfort part right, as the pleather earcups don\u2019t clamp down hard and have enough soft padding where it counts.</p><p>The Cloud Stinger 2 has a V-shaped sound profile, which is to say it exaggerates the bass and treble while recessing the mid-range. It\u2019s not bad for what it is, and it\u2019ll definitely give action scenes a heavy sense of impact. But the upper-bass is pushed to the point where it may get tiring over time, and you lose some of the fine details you\u2019d hear on a more natural-sounding set of headphones. Since this is a cheap closed-back headset, the Cloud Stinger 2 also doesn\u2019t sound nearly as wide as the pairs above, nor is it as nuanced about positioning sounds accurately. It\u2019s less than ideal for competitive games as a result, though it can still sound \u201cfun\u201d with many other titles.</p><p>Beyond that, the build-quality and plastic design feels cheap-ish, it doesn\u2019t block much outside noise despite being closed-back and its cable isn\u2019t removable. Nevertheless, you have to pick your battles in this price range. The Cloud Stinger 2 is flawed, but it does enough well enough to be a good headset for a certain type of person.</p><h2>A quick PSA on wireless gaming headsets</h2><p>Most people do not need a wireless gaming headset. PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles have a headphone jack built into their controllers, and one is still readily available on the Nintendo Switch and most gaming PCs. The cost of an OK wireless model is usually higher than the cost of a comparable wired gaming headset, and for the money you often get worse audio quality and a less clear microphone on the wireless versions. You also risk introducing issues with latency. The latter is why non-gaming Bluetooth headphones are a no-go here.</p><h2>Best wireless gaming headset: HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless</h2><p></p><p>If you <em>really</em> want a wireless headset \u2013 say, if your gaming PC is situated at the far end of your desk \u2013 you should look for a pair that makes the \u201cwireless\u201d part of the equation a little less apparent.

HyperX rates it at 300 hours, but we were able to squeeze out a couple dozen more at moderate volumes. iFixit did a <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj01dDBKeXpoMHZlbyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcVsOdohnTocKXz7QzdduiByIInEsqXY_W1NBWb3suhG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5t0Jyzh0veo\">helpful teardown</a> if you\u2019re curious as to how this is possible, but it\u2019s not a stretch to say one charge here could last you <em>months</em> of play time.</p><p>The sound here is typical of many gaming headsets: slightly V-shaped, with overemphasized bass that can make game effects sound exciting but often presents footsteps and finer details with less clarity. As a closed-back headphone, it also won\u2019t sound as spacious or natural as the more open pairs above. (Wireless gaming headsets with an open-back design are virtually nonexistent.) It\u2019s not bad by wireless gaming headset standards, and it generally places sounds in the right place; it\u2019s just not tuned or designed as optimally as a pair like the Astro A40.</p><p>The headset itself is comfortable to wear for hours at a time, with plush padding that doesn\u2019t feel too tight, though the faux leather material on the earpads may make your ears feel mildly warm. Everything is sturdy, and the headband is nicely flexible. The boom mic is also fine, though that\u2019s relative to other wireless headsets. It cancels out background noise well and keeps voices legible, but they won\u2019t sound as crisp or full-bodied as they could be on wired headphones with good mics. It's better than the A40, though.</p><p>A word of warning: Don\u2019t bother with HyperX\u2019s companion software. While you can use the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://hyperx.com/pages/ngenuity\">Ngenuity</a> app to customize the headset's EQ and activate a <a href=\"https://dts.com/dts-headphonex/\">DTS:X</a> surround sound feature, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperX/comments/uaiapq/hyperx_cloud_alpha_wireless_latency/\">several users</a> have reported that this introduces noticeable latency, and HyperX <a href=\"https://xander51.medium.com/hyperxs-hilarious-fix-for-their-headset-driver-latency-issues-e80f39b9faff\">doesn\u2019t look</a> to be fixing it.

Its <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/327846/what-are-planar-magnetic-headphones/\">planar-magnetic</a> drivers do well reproducing smaller intricacies in a given scene, and its default signature is like a more refined version of the common \u201cgaming headset\u201d sound. Bass is smooth and impactful but not bloated, while highs are crisp but not overly sharp. Some effects in the mids can sound thin, and as this is a<em>&nbsp;</em>closed-back headset, it can\u2019t provide the same immersive width and precise imaging as the open-back models above. Ironically, it may be better for music than games. Still, for a wireless headset, it\u2019s unusually pleasant and detailed. Audeze\u2019s app includes several EQ presets as well.</p><p>Similarly, the Maxwell\u2019s detachable boom mic is a standout. It does a phenomenal job of muting background noise, and while voices lose some air, they still sound clearer and fuller than on most wireless headsets we\u2019ve tested.</p><p>The Maxwell is on the bulky side, and its headband uses an odd suspension mechanism that effectively isn\u2019t adjustable without taking the headset off. The squishy padded ear cups will likely make your ears feel warm, but they keep the headset comfortable and isolate a fair amount of outside noise. The high-end design also feels substantial, with the headband made from steel. The essential controls are built into the left earcup, and the device can connect over Bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable in addition to a USB-C wireless dongle. You can even pair with two devices at once, one over the dongle and another over Bluetooth. The headset needs to be powered on in order to play music over a cable, however.</p><p>Audeze rates the Maxwell\u2019s battery life at roughly 80 hours, though you'll get less than that if you play at high volumes or use features like Bluetooth or sidetone heavily. While this can\u2019t touch the Cloud Alpha Wireless, it\u2019s still much better than most wireless headsets.</p><h2>Other notable gaming headsets</h2><figure><img alt=\"Logitech's G535 wireless gaming headset rests on top of a wicker chair on a patio outdoors.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/13435120-d960-11ed-bc67-dccf7cbeb8df\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><h3>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro</h3><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVpXNTJYU1EvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATBDtCTmrhfdzRxzkwm41CS0WjvaetVcz3ro1ne9GIG1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09ZW52XSQ%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1\">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro</a> is overpriced at $250, and it can make higher frequencies sound harsh, but its bass and mids are good, it\u2019s super comfortable and its retractable mic is noticeably clearer than the Astro A40\u2019s.

It\u2019s another bass-forward pair, and its mic is comparable to the one on Cloud Alpha Wireless. Like the other Nova models, it offers multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth and a 3.5mm cable. And while it's marketed for the Xbox, it can also connect to PCs and PS5s. Its 30 or so hours of battery life are well short of the Cloud Alpha Wireless, though, and its sound signature can make the treble sound somewhat wonky.</p><h3>HyperX Cloud Alpha</h3><p></p><p>The wired <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDc0TkJTRjlOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZBXk5cw9Z-Zz-xHLFBiaCe1h-9KKpmO19dQ6jLR-Z-I&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB074NBSF9N\">HyperX Cloud Alpha</a> is often on sale for $80 or less, and at that price it\u2019s a decent middle ground between the Cloud Stinger 2 and Astro A40 if you absolutely need a closed-back gaming headset.

It has a more neutral sound signature than the Cloud Alpha Wireless and Arctis Nova 7X: not flat, but less beholden to big, thumping bass. It can make mid-range details sound thin, and if anything it could use a little <em>more</em> sub-bass, but it\u2019s an agreeable listening experience overall. It can also connect over Bluetooth. However, its mic gives up some fullness compared to the Cloud Alpha Wireless (which already wasn\u2019t superb), and its 30-ish hours of battery life are a massive drop-off. Plus, it doesn\u2019t work with Xbox, and it strangely forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level. But if you don\u2019t want to spend a ton on a wireless headset, it\u2019s the best of the $100-and-under options we tested.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-25T15:05:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "GM says a next-gen Chevy Bolt is on the way", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/gm/\"><ins>General Motors</ins></a> isn\u2019t quite done with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/chevy-bolt/\"><ins>Chevrolet Bolt</ins></a>.

That means the telephoto camera has the same specs as the main camera, rather than being relegated to lesser quality like it was on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-update-hands-on-video-141505594.html\">Mavic 3</a>. That opens up new possibilities for pilots, giving them two ways to create cinematic shots.</p><p>It also has numerous improvements over the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-2s-camera-drone-130053973.html\">Air 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-2s-camera-drone-130053973.html\">Air 2S</a>. It uses DJI\u2019s new O4 transmission system that greatly increases range, while bringing the Waypoint feature to Air drones for the first time. It also has much improved battery life and is considerably quieter. Otherwise, it matches the Mavic 3 Pro feature for feature, with obstacle detection all around, focus tracking, Hyperlapse and more.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>Some buyers might see the 1/1.3-inch sensors as a downgrade compared to the 1-inch sensor on the Air 2S, however. How does it stack up against that model, and how does it fit in with the Mavic 3 Pro and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dji-mini-3-pro-review-130041928.html\">Mini 3 Pro</a> models? I took it flying in France\u2019s Loire valley with my drone pilot friend to find out.</p><h3>Design and performance</h3><div id=\"9e12f20d9e454501997421c517b90560\"></div><p>With a dual-camera module up front and similar design, the Air 3 (no more Mavic in the name) looks more like the Mavic 3 than the Air 2 and Air 2S. It has the same frog-like design, and folds up exactly like the Mavic 3, collapsing into a compact size for travel. The body has omnidirectional sensors all around for obstacle detection. For storage, it comes with the usual microSD storage slot and has 8GB internally that\u2019s really for emergency use only. It\u2019s also considerably heavier than the Air 2S, tipping the scales at 720 grams compared to 595.</p><p>At the same time, it has borrowed some aerodynamic tricks from the Mini 3 Pro, particularly the larger propellers that reduce noise down to 81 decibels \u2014 making it near-inaudible when flying at over 100 feet or so. The body is also more aerodynamic, giving it better range in forward flight and the ability to handle stronger winds than past models.</p><p>Much of the extra weight comes from the new 4,241 mAh batteries that weigh 267 grams more than an entire Mini 3 Pro. They have nearly the capacity of the Mavic 3 Pro\u2019s batteries, greatly boosting the Air 3\u2019s range to 46 minutes, up from 34 minutes on the Air 2S.</p><p>In real-world use, we saw flight times of around 35 minutes before the return-to-home warning went off, depending on flying style and winds. That generally allowed us to fly for a full day with three charged batteries. DJI also introduced a new charging feature with the updated battery hub, letting you transfer power from two weaker batteries to the most charged at the touch of a button. Doing so allows for  longer flights if you\u2019re in a location with no charging available. The one drawback of the higher-capacity batteries is that charging speeds are relatively slow.</p><figure><img alt=\"DJI Air 3 review: A high-quality zoom adds new creative options\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0eda9170-2a41-11ee-bb9b-8ec76c8eaa88\" style=\"height: 1238px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>Another key feature is the next-gen O4 video transmission system that boosts range from 15 to 20 km (9.3 to 12.4 miles). Drone range can be a big problem in Europe, because laws significantly reduce transmission power compared to the US. To help compensate for that, DJI added a new 5.1GHz frequency in Europe that appears to have a large impact on range and transmission dropouts in tricky terrain, from what we saw in our tests in France.</p><p>In terms of maneuverability and speed, the Air 3 offers a good compromise between stability of the Mavic 3 Pro and the agility of the Mini 3 Pro. The latter makes it great for following fast-moving subjects like mountain bikers and vehicles, but it\u2019s also steady in stiff breezes. At the same time, if a subject is moving through trees, obstacle avoidance with APAS 5.0 is outstanding, with less risk of crashing than the Mini 3 Pro thanks to the extra sensors \u2014 particularly from the side and rear.</p><p>All of DJI\u2019s tentpole features like Active Track, Master Shots, Quickshots and Timelapse are available on the Air 3 and work on both cameras. Active Track, used to lock onto and follow subjects, works about the same on both cameras. As with DJI\u2019s other drones, it\u2019s generally reliable, but if you\u2019re chasing a mountain biker through the trees, it can lag a bit and the tracking can switch off without warning.</p><figure><img alt=\"DJI Air 3 review: A high-quality zoom adds new creative options\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0f16d720-2a41-11ee-bfff-a18bab6db8e9\" style=\"height: 1238px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>Quickshots features like Dronie and Rocket are more interesting with the addition of the tele camera that can add extra intimacy and drama. The obstacle detection is handy there as well. Because the drone flies automatically once you hit \u201cgo,\u201d it\u2019s easy to misjudge boundaries, so it\u2019s good to know it\u2019ll abort if it gets too close to something.</p><p>On top of those flight modes, DJI has brought the Mavic 3\u2019s Waypoint flight mode over to the Air series for the first time. It lets you plan flight and camera moves in advance, letting you repeat a flight precisely for multiple takes, Timelapse videos and more. It requires some time to learn and set up, but it delivers consistent results. It also opens up creative possibilities, like doing a Timelapse during the day and at night, then seamlessly blending them together.</p><p>Along with the Air 3, DJI has introduced the new RC-2, DJI\u2019s third screen controller after the RC and the RC Pro. It\u2019s a good compromise between the two, as it\u2019s significantly cheaper than the $1,200 RC Pro. At the same time, it has a brighter screen, more substantial feel and more precise controls than the RC. It\u2019s available either separately or in a bundle with the Air 3 Fly More kit. DJI also announced another new controller, the RC-N2, effectively a refresh of the RC-N1, with the main benefit being the new O4 transmission system.</p><h3>Cameras</h3><p>The big idea with the Air 3 is that the quality of the two cameras is the same. As such, it comes with a 1/1.3-inch 24mm (35mm equivalent) f/1.7 main and 70mm f/2.8 telephoto camera. Those focal lengths match the two primary cameras on the Mavic 3 Pro, with the sensor size being the same as the Mini 3 Pro and the tele camera on the Mavic 3 Pro.</p><p>The 70mm lens is particularly good for action or hero shots, adding excitement and a more natural perspective. With a perfect portrait focal length, it\u2019s great for people shots at weddings, for example. It also lets you stay a greater distance from subjects for safety or other reasons, while compressing the space between them. As usual, the main wide camera can be used for establishing, overhead, follow and other shots. And with identical sensors, it\u2019s easy to match footage from the two cameras while editing.</p><p>The sensors have dual native ISO support for improved light sensitivity, and deliver 4K 60p in HDR or 4K at up to 100 fps with slo-mo only playback. 1080p can be shot at 200 fps with slo-mo playback as well. The camera module can be tilted down 90 degrees and up 60, and it\u2019s the first Air series drone supporting 2.7K vertical 9:16 video.</p><section><img alt=\"DJI Air 3 review: A high-quality zoom adds new creative options\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3dc25c90-2a67-11ee-b4ff-8db71235397d\" style=\"height: 1238px; width: 2200px;\" /></section><p>Both cameras support 10-bit 4:2:0 D-Log M and HLG HDR for improved dynamic range and reduced banding, something that can be an issue when shooting skies. DJI\u2019s regular D-Log mode, which offers even more dynamic range, is not available on the Air 3, though. It also lacks a variable aperture found on the Mavic 3, so the optional ND filter kit (available in the Fly More combo) is desirable for sunny day flying to allow for lower shutter speeds and thus smoother video.</p><p>With the same 1/1.3-inch dual native ISO sensor and resolution as the Mini 3 Pro, image quality is similar \u2014 but there are some improvements on the Air 3. D-Log M offers better dynamic range, particularly in challenging contrasty shooting conditions. It also offers mildly better low-light capability, with less noise in shadows for nighttime cityscapes, for example.</p><p>The Air 3 delivers as good or even better video and photo quality than the larger sensor on the Air 2S, likely because the size difference is slight and the Air 3 has higher resolution. That said, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if DJI releases an Air 3S, possibly with a larger sensor.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img alt=\"DJI Air 3 review: A high-quality zoom adds new creative options\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/7a0c5250-2a67-11ee-9ddd-0efb5000e860\" style=\"height: 1238px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>DJI has another winner with the Air 3 thanks to the dual cameras. By elevating the tele to the same importance as the main camera, it opens up new cinematic shooting options. It should prove popular with event and wedding pros who are willing to pay a few hundred dollars more than the Mini 3 Pro. In return, they get additional creative options, plus a more stable and secure camera drone.</p><p>Image quality might not be good enough for some pros when compared to the $2,200 Mavic 3 Pro, But at $1,100, it\u2019s considerably cheaper, more maneuverable, and offers the same features (including Waypoints) and level of obstacle protection. At the same time, it has a leg up on the Mini 3 Pro in terms of image quality thanks to the D-Log M option.</p><p>At $1,100 with the non-screen RC-N2 controller, the Air 3 is $330 more than the DJI Mini 3 Pro with the same controller. That goes up to $1,550 with the RC 2 Fly More kit, compared to $1,253 for the Mini 3 Pro in a similar kit. At those prices, its main competition is Autel\u2019s similarly priced 6K EVO Lite+ and the Mini 3 Pro itself. In any case, it\u2019s a great new option for drone buyers who might like the idea of two primary cameras and can\u2019t quite afford a Mavic 3 Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-3-review-a-high-quality-zoom-adds-new-creative-options-130020261.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-3-review-a-high-quality-zoom-adds-new-creative-options-130020261.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-25T13:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta adds \u2018quests\u2019 to Horizon Worlds, to keep users returning to the metaverse", "description": "<p>Quests are now available to everyone with a Quest \u2014 a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html\">Meta Quest VR headset</a>, that is.

Indeed, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-raises-iprice-of-premium-plans-115138529.html\">just added $1</a> on top of the old subscription rate, meaning users in the US now have to pay at least $11 a month. Spotify also plans to implement price hikes across markets, including the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. The company anticipates a slowdown in premium subscription signups due to its higher prices for the third quarter of the year. From having 10 million new paying users in the second quarter, it expects to add 4 million Premium subscribers in Q3. Even so, it believes the price increases will \"have a minimal impact on total revenue\" and is still expecting to earn $3.65 billion (\u20ac3.3 billion) this quarter.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-grew-far-more-than-expected-but-is-still-losing-money-121553523.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spotify-grew-far-more-than-expected-but-is-still-losing-money-121553523.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-25T12:15:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The EU Chips Act just received its final approval", "description": "<p>Governing bodies worldwide have taken steps in recent years to boost local chip manufacturing, such as tax incentives and funding.
