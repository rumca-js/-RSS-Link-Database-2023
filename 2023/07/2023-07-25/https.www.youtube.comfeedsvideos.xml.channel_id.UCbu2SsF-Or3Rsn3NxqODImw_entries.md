Dave Klein (DaveControl) had the chance to play FromSoftware's latest entry into the AC series, Armored Core VI: Fires or Rubicon at a hands-on preview event held by Bandai Nacmo. While many might be looking to From for a new Soulslike game, Armored Core VI only takes little inspiration from the Souls titles, and focuses in on bringing the classic Armored Core series to a modern audience with a brand new reboot of the series.

Armored Core first burst onto the scene in 1997, and was FromSoftware's first attempt at branching out after the King's Field series. Afterwards, it became one of From's flagship titles until the release of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. With Hidetaka Miyazaki taking the reins, FromSoftware was taken into a whole new era.

The most recent entry into the series, Armored Core: Verdict Day, released nearly 10 years ago in 2013. So, with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, From has taken the long running series, and added modern elements they've learned throughout the years of creating high quality, franchise defining games.

While Armored Core VI takes elements from multiple previous Armored Core games - including a separate campaign, training mode, and arena - it's movement seems most based on Hidetaka Miyazaki's previous AC titles, Armored Core 4 and For Answer.

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is set to release August 25, 2023.
