<p>TeamKill has revealed that it is canceling the PS4 version of its upcoming game, Quantum Error, stating that it wouldn't be able to stand up to the PS5 version due to hardware limitations. The cosmic horror shooter is now only launching for PC and current-generation consoles.</p><p>"Unfortunately, we are going to have to cancel the PS4 version of QE. Even with the game being made from the beginning for the PS5, we still had hopes we could make a PS4 version happen, but with the level of quality we have achieved with QE with gameplay running at 60fps, we have reach the conclusion that there is no way for us to deliver a version on PS4 that would live up to what the PS5 is going to deliver," TeamKill explained on Twitter.</p><p>The studio continued, "A PS4 version would require too much downgrading and changing of assets, lighting and much more to function, and with the difference in memory and the slower HDD speed, it would be a very different experience that will not compare to the PS5 version and would not be fair to PS4 players."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-cosmic-horror-shooter-ditches-ps4-version-now-only-coming-to-current-gen-consoles/1100-6516298/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New On Peacock In August 2023: The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Killing It Season 2

<p dir="ltr">As August 2023 approaches, Peacock has announced the lineup of TV shows and movies coming to the platform in the upcoming month. And that includes one of the biggest movies of the year thus far.</p><p dir="ltr">On August 3, The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be available to stream via Peacock. The record-breaking box office hit was a major commercial success, but what is the animated movie actually about? The original games were never exactly about their stories in the first place; the movie sees a pair of entrepreneurial brothers whose family plumbing business is struggling, but such mundane concerns are quickly forgotten when they go down the wrong pipe in the sewers, are transported to the Mushroom Kingdom, and must save the princess. GameSpot's Phil Owen wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/">review earlier this year</a> that "more than just another cartoon comedy, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a surprisingly great action flick."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Coming to Peacock on August 17 is Season 2 of Killing It, a sitcom exploring class, capitalism, and a man's quest for the American Dream. In this sitcom revolving around class and capitalism, we follow Craig Foster, a Miami bank security guard struggling to make ends meet. Co-parenting his pre-teen daughter, Vanessa, with his ex-wife, Camille, Craig yearns to fulfill his dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. However, a chance encounter with Jillian, a ride-hailing driver involved in state-sponsored python hunting, alters his course. Determined to achieve the American Dream, Craig embarks on a comedic and wild journey, overcoming challenges from criminals, untamed nature, and corporate America. The show stars Craig Robinson, Claudia O'Doherty, Rell Battle, Scott MacArthur, Stephanie Nogueras, Wyatt Walter, and Jet Miller.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-peacock-in-august-2023-the-super-mario-bros-movie-killing-it-season-2/1100-6516296/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Xbox is always getting new updates that add features and improve performance, but this week's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/24/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-2308-230720-2200/">Alpha update</a> included a feature that might surprise you. Now, certain Xbox users will be able to bind keyboard keys to buttons on your controller.</p><p dir="ltr">First, we should note that this update is only available through the Xbox Insider program, specifically its alpha ring. It also only works with the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and the Xbox Adaptive Controller.</p><p dir="ltr">If you meet these requirements and download the update, you can now map keyboard keys to your controller with the Xbox Accessories app. The process for doing this is similar to any binding, as it requires you to create or edit a new profile, select the button to map, and you should see it as an option. There are a few limits to the functionality: You can only map one controller button to a given key, though you can include modifier keys such as Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and the Windows key. This feature is also game-dependent, so it will vary considerably depending on the games you play.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-update-lets-you-map-keyboard-keys-to-your-controller/1100-6516293/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Everybody likes free games, and today's costless offering from Steam is definitely worth a look. It's a roguelike tower defense game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/249050/Dungeon_of_the_ENDLESS/">Dungeon of the Endless</a>, and it combines the randomized run focus of Hades with the base management of Plants vs. Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Amplitude Studios and published by Sega, Dungeon of the Endless got quite a bit of buzz when it first launched in 2014. Its unique blend of genres make it stand out even today, and given that it usually retails for $12, it's definitely worth the click if you have a Steam library. Based on the game's store page, it's not clear when this promotion will end, so if you're interested at all in Dungeon of the Endless, we recommend getting a move on.</p><p dir="ltr">It currently has a 87% Very Positive rating on Steam, though the recent reviews have a 67% Mixed score. It would be a great game to play on a Steam Deck if you have one, as it's marked as Playable on its page.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-free-game-on-steam-today/1100-6516284/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock has begun recruiting for its next game project, which the studio describes as a mix of FPS and multiplayer, similar to its previous game Back 4 Blood. The studio, which includes several Left 4 Dead veterans, is now looking for a senior combat designer to join the team, according to a job posting on <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/turtlerockstudios/jobs/4284284005">Glassdoor</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/left-4-dead-veterans-are-working-on-a-new-game-that-sounds-like-another-back-4-blood/">GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>According to the listing, Turtle Rock seeks a developer with a love for "specifically FPS, co-op, and multiplayer games," and experience with "developing first-person shooting and melee" gameplay. Additionally, the candidate will also be experienced in developing combat, weapons, class design, skills, and boss encounters.</p><p>The studio first announced that it was working on a new project back in February, and also announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/back-4-blood-development-is-ending-as-dev-shifts-to-a-new-game/1100-6511124/">ending development on Back 4 Blood</a> to focus on its next game. As a "pretty small studio" for the types of games that it makes, Turtle Rock said that it didn't have enough employees to both support Back 4 Blood and work on a new game, even after it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-has-bought-turtle-rock-studios-developer-of-back-4-blood/1100-6499107/">acquired by Tencent in December 2021</a>.

<p dir="ltr">A new Destiny update is now available, and while its version number (7.1.5.1) and relatively short list of patch notes don't suggest anything major, that understates its importance. Deep Dives, one of the major new modes introduced as part of Season of the Deep, has been plagued by an issue that's only gotten worse over time, but it should no longer be an issue as of this patch.</p><p dir="ltr">Specifically, Bungie has <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/patch-notes-update-7-1-5-1">enabled</a> join-in-progress for Deep Dives. That means that, during gameplay sections, players will be able to join and take the place of anyone who might have left--something that has become a frustratingly common occurrence in Deep Dives.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a variety of reasons for that. Some people leave when other players don't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-deep-dives-keys-pressure-trials-and-how-to-get-tier-3-chests/1100-6514508/">opt in to the higher-difficulty Pressure Trials</a> of the mode. Others seemingly leave because the other people in the group don't intend to segue the Deep Dive into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-exotic-fish-broken-blade-new-exotic-quest/1100-6515481/">hidden Exotic mission</a>.

## Cherry's Compact Gaming Keyboard Is One Of The Best Yet - MX-LP 2.1 Review

<p dir="ltr">The hobbyist scene around mechanical keyboards has been wild to witness flourish with an abundance of custom builds, aftermarket keycaps, and non-traditional layouts. And we've seen the usual suspects like Corsair, Logitech, and Razer lean a bit more into that enthusiast space, branching slightly out from the typical gaming-style keyboards (and I'd say most have done away with the extravagant features and gaudy branding of yore). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6VG1KJC?tag=gamespot-productreviews-20">Cherry's new wireless MX-LP 2.1</a> is a reflection of how the keyboard niche has evolved, because out of the box, it feels like the exact kind of compact keyboard I would've outfitted myself.</p><p>Cherry has been a pioneer in mechanical switches with the likes of the linear MX Reds and clicky MX Blues, and everything in between--if you've used a mechanical keyboard, chances are they had Cherry switches in them. The company also has its own line of keyboards, one of which we recently reviewed: the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-a-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard-good-for-gaming-cherry-kw-x-ulp-review/1100-6515627/">wireless Cherry KW X ULP</a>. But while that was an ultra-low-profile and super-thin take on a mechanical keyboard, it didn't exactly fare well for gaming. With the MX-LP 2.1, however, we have a low-profile keyboard that excels in almost every respect whether it be for typing in the workspace or competitive gaming, all packed in the bite-sized 65% form factor.</p><figure style="width: 3981px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4169525-img_3026.jpg"><img alt="The Cherry MX-LP 2.1 mechanical keyboard." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4169525-img_3026.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The Cherry MX-LP 2.1 mechanical keyboard.</figcaption></figure><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6VG1KJC?tag=gamespot-productreviews-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr">The core of what makes the MX-LP 2.1 so great out of the box is the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-original/mx-speed-silver.html">MX Speed Silver switches</a>. These are smooth, linear-style switches similar to the MX Red but with a shorter actuation point and total travel distance--1.2mm and 3.4mm, respectively. This allows the keyboard itself to maintain a thinner profile without sacrificing the precision and feel of a proper mechanical switch. It also gives you that satisfying "thock" sound with each keystroke while also being noticeably quieter than my Keychron K4 and Razer Huntsman, even when hammering away and bottoming out. The buttery smooth feel and responsiveness made me a bit more excited to just type. But if I'm dropping $130 USD on a keyboard, it'll be put to work in gaming.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cherrys-compact-gaming-keyboard-is-one-of-the-best-yet-mx-lp-2-1-review/1100-6516246/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## ESRB Proposes Using Facial Recognition To Verify Your Age

<p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has asked the FTC for approval to use facial recognition technology to help determine how old a user is. Using something called Privacy-Protective Facial Estimation, a person's age would be estimated based on a photo to verify they are old enough to purchase a game.</p><p>According to an ESRB <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Application-for-a-new-VPC-method-ESRB-SuperAwesome-Yoti-06-02-2023.pdf">letter</a> submitted to the FTC (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/esrb-asks-ftc-to-approve-facial-recognition-age-checker">GameIndustry.biz</a>), the ESRB will partner with Yoti, a digital identity firm, and SuperAwesome, an Epic Games subsidiary. The way it'll work is once you buy a game, you'll have to take a photo of yourself, then the system will check if the subject in the frame is human. After that, the image will upload to Yoti's servers, where your age is calculated to ensure you meet the applicable ESRB guidelines.</p><p>One major concern this may have is storing photos--particularly those of minors--but according to the filing, "Images are immediately, permanently deleted, and not used by Yoti for training purposes." As noted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esrb-proposes-facial-recognition-as-new-form-of-age-verification">Game Developer</a>, facial recognition technology has encountered issues identifying people of color in the past, and it's possible we could see similar issues here.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esrb-proposes-using-facial-recognition-to-verify-your-age/1100-6516255/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Take A Closer Look At Apex Legends' New In-Game Event Store, Where Loot Is Free

<p><h2>Apex's Neon Network Collection Event - All Premium And Free Loot</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1752/17528202/4169815-lobastorerewards.jpg" /><br /><em>When it comes to free loot, the new event store offers players something they've never had before: a choice.</em><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>' new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-event-includes-valkyrie-prestige-skin-and-loba-story-mission/1100-6516144/">Neon Network Collection Event</a> just went live, and although the event does feature the standard 24 premium cosmetic items (plus a Mythic-tier legend cosmetic) for players to unlock, it also features something entirely new: an event store full of loot that doesn't require any real-life cash to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, this isn't the first time Apex's events have offered players free loot, but the Neon Network Collection Event store gives players access to more than just loot--it gives them access to choices. Previously, Apex's Collection Events featured free reward tracks, which required players to rack up Event Points by completing challenges, unlocking predetermined cosmetic items each time an Event Point goal was met. The new event shop works a little differently, letting players choose which free loot items they want to unlock, very similar to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-mobile-season-3-all-champions-store-and-faction-store-rewards/2900-4408/">seasonal shops</a> seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-mobile-is-shutting-down-for-good-in-90-days/1100-6511047/">Apex's now-defunct mobile game</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, players will have to put in some effort to earn these rewards. Event shop rewards can only be unlocked by collecting Compute Nodes to trade in for free loot. Compute Nodes are only found in non-Ranked Mode battle royale matches, and can be obtained by using a Node Tracker in a standard Duos or Trios battle royale match.</p><p dir="ltr">The Node Tracker is automatically assigned to the player's Survival Item inventory slot, and will mark the location of nearby Nodes on a player's map. Once players enter the designated area, the Node Tracker will begin uploading data (and racking up Compute Nodes for the event shop). Once the upload is complete, a loot tick will spawn in the area, rewarding the player with high-tier gear.</p><p dir="ltr">But free cosmetics aren't the only thing players can buy--new transition screens, banner badges, and story updates can also be purchased from the store. Story updates elaborate on the events immediately following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-story-is-getting-revamped-in-a-big-way-starting-today/1100-6516025/">the first episode of Apex's new Kill Code animated series</a>, with the second episode set to release on July 31.</p><p dir="ltr">The full contents of the Neon Network Collection Event shop--and how many Compute Nodes are needed to collect them--are listed below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Radiant Raver Loba legend skin (Epic): <strong>7,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Lightbreaker R-301 weapon skin (Epic): <strong>5,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Loba Pack (Rare) and Raving Wolf weapon charm (Epic): <strong>4,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Crypto Pack (Rare) and Arcane Sigil weapon charm (Epic): <strong>4,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Valkyrie Pack (Rare) and Behind The Mask weapon charm (Epic): <strong>4,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Last Shot Loba banner frame (Epic): <strong>3,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Loch N' Load universal holospray (Epic): <strong>3,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Season 17 battle pass level*: <strong>2,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Kill Code: Interlude 1 story chapter, transition screen and Neon Network banner badge: <strong>5,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Kill Code: Interlude 2 story chapter, transition screen, and Targeted banner badge: <strong>10,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Kill Code: Interlude 3 story chapter, transition screen, and The Cutting Edge banner badge: <strong>20,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Neon Network Master banner badge: 3<strong>0,000 Compute Nodes</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>*Note:</strong> Players can re-purchase this item up to seven times, allowing them to quickly shave some levels off their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-season-17-all-arsenal-battle-pass-cosmetics-and-rewards/2900-4741/">Season 17 battle pass</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But if it's premium cosmetics you're looking for, we've listed all Neon Network Collection Event cosmetics below, along with their prices.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Epic-tier items (available for 1,000 Apex Coins or 800 Crafting Metals):</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Urban Glow universal banner frame</li><li dir="ltr">Hi-Flying Hijack universal banner frame</li><li dir="ltr">Spectre Of Death universal holospray</li><li dir="ltr">Cyber-ness sticker</li><li dir="ltr">Blocked Gibraltar banner pose</li><li dir="ltr">Jumping Into Action Ash banner pose</li><li dir="ltr">Enhanced Bangalore legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Thermodynamic Horizon legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Amped Adrenaline Octane legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Glow Flow G7 Scout weapon skin</li><li dir="ltr">Dusk Detail Spitfire legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Fatal Flow CAR SMG weapon skin</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Legendary-tier items (available for 1,800 Apex Coins or 2,400 Crafting Metals):</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Stinger Ash legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Bionic Brink Ballistic legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Toxic Terminator Caustic legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Haunt+Heal Lifeline legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Night Cat Vantage legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Bionic Bodyguard Gibraltar legend skin</li><li dir="ltr">Amplified Impulse Havoc weapon skin</li><li dir="ltr">Transistor Flatline weapon skin</li><li dir="ltr">Jawbreaker P2020 weapon skin</li><li dir="ltr">Death Toll L-STAR weapon skin</li><li dir="ltr">Rules Of Engagement Sentinel weapon skin</li><li dir="ltr">Bee Sting Volt SMG weapon skin</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Players who unlock all 24 Neon Network Collection Event items will also automatically unlock Valkyrie's Apex Interceptor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-prestige-bloodhound-skin-everything-you-need-to-know/1100-6500308/">Prestige skin</a>, a special Mythic-tier skin that evolves as Valkyrie deals damage.

## Ubisoft Cancels Immortals Fenyx Rising Sequel Amid Focus Shift To Major Franchises - Report

<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has reportedly abandoned plans for a sequel to its 2020 mythological adventure game Immortals Fenyx Rising as the company shifts its focus towards its major franchises. According to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-ubisoft-has-cancelled-its-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel/">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Ubisoft Quebec was in early development of the follow-up game, but the project was ultimately scrapped this month due to perceived challenges in establishing the IP.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Immortals game, developed by Ubisoft Quebec, received generally favorable reviews. (Back in 2020, GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/immortals-fenyx-rising-review/1900-6417617/">gave the game a 7/10</a>.) Ubisoft had hoped to transform it into a franchise and explore different mythologies beyond Greece in future installments, such as Hawaiian Polynesian myths. The first game followed players on a quest to save the Greek gods and later introduced a DLC that delved into Chinese mythology with a new hero, martial artist Ku.</p><p dir="ltr">However, doubts surrounding future plans for Immortals arose when Ubisoft decided to shift its attention to its most prominent brands. Earlier this year, the company announced its intention to cancel three unannounced games, alongside a strategic shift towards strengthening its focus on major IPs and live services, following lower-than-expected software sales during the holiday season.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-amid-focus-shift-to-major-franchises-report/1100-6516277/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Armored Core 6 Has Inherited The "Aggressive Combat" Of Sekiro

<p>Development on Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon is being led by game director Masaru Yamamura, who previously served as the main combat designer on Sekiro: Shadows Twice, an infamously aggressive action-RPG in the From Software library. Will Armored Core 6 inherit any of the technical DNA of that game, which has a distinctive feel when compared to games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Elden Ring? According to Yamamura, while some elements of From Software's Souls-like formula are present in the new Armored Core, it's the "highly dynamic and aggressive combat" of Sekiro that lives on in a sequel where corporations and private military companies battle each other in all-out mechanized warfare.</p><p>"Some elements that you might see some indirect comparisons with, not just with Sekiro but with the previous titles, are these elements of going into battle and having to observe your enemies and observe their patterns and respond accordingly," Yamamura told GameSpot. "Use your ingenuity to overcome these challenging situations. And particularly, one element that carries indirectly from Sekiro is this more highly dynamic and aggressive combat setting. So that's something we wanted to incorporate into Armored Core this time as well."</p><p>For Armored Core 6, Yamamura says that development on the game was initially spearheaded by From Software creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki and the studio's core team, and once the initial direction, world-building, and setting for the game had been established, he was handed control of the project to work on. Assembly once again plays a key part in the game--especially if you want to embrace the mercenary lifestyle--and for this game, Yamamura already has a favorite build.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/armored-core-6-has-inherited-the-aggressive-combat-of-sekiro/1100-6516119/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Armored Core 6's Mech Customization Wants To Make You Feel Like An Intergalactic Mercenary

<p>One of the big features of older Armored Core games was the option to customize your mech, and for Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon, developer From Software is once again placing an emphasis on constant fine-tuning, swapping out parts, and building the right machine for the right situation. Compared to previous Armored Core games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">Armored Core 6</a> will take a more relaxed approach to mech assembly between missions, as From Software sought to hit a perfect balance of tinkering with their favorite loadout and pushing forward with a mech that has served them well.</p><p>"This is actually an area we spent quite a bit of time trying to balance and figure out where the sweet spot is," game director Masaru Yamamura told GameSpot. "We do want to put a lot of importance on assembly, but we don't want it all to just be about number crunching and min-maxing. We wanted a big part of it to affect the play feel, for example, when you switch up the leg types, it affects your movement, when you switch up the weapons it affects how you shoot and how you recoil--things like this."</p><p>Yamamura added that the studio wanted to emphasize the mercenary aspect of Armored Core 6, as diving into the nuts and bolts of a mech loadout will allow players to feel like a professional gun-for-hire in the game. At the same time, the studio also drew upon its work in its previous games, as the game will give observant players a fighting chance if they can adapt their tactics on the fly.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/armored-core-6-mech-customization-wants-to-make-you-feel-like-an-intergalactic-mercenary/1100-6516118/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Armored Core 6's Multiplayer Is Designed To Complement The Single-Player Experience

<p>Like the previous games in the series, Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon is a single-player experience at heart. That's not to say that it doesn't have any form of online functionality, as when it launches in August, the game will include a PvP option. However, don't expect a reprisal of Armored Core 5,which placed a heavy emphasis on multiplayer.</p><p>"In Armored Core 6, the main thing we wanted to concentrate on was the single-player campaign, so that's the main meat of the content," game director Masaru Yamamura explained to GameSpot. "We do have an online versus mode available at launch. This is more a place where players can bring the armored cores that they've customized and designed themselves into battle with one another. It's a simple, straight, no bells and whistles online versus mode for the real hardcore fans."</p><p>Yamamura added that Armored Core 6 focuses primarily on its campaign mode, with multiplayer being added to the game as an uncomplicated extra that complements the single-player experience. "We wanted the focus to be on single-player, and that single-player story and campaign style," Yamamura said. "But also have that element of multiplayer brought in just as something simple that players can access easily if they want to try it out. The people who’ve known the online from previous entries can jump straight in, it's just there, and it's not too complicated to get into as an additional element to the single player."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/armored-core-6-multiplayer-is-designed-to-complement-the-single-player-experience/1100-6516120/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>New gameplay for Armored Core 6: Fire of Rubicon has gone live, showcasing several gameplay elements for From Software's upcoming mech assault game. Like previous entries in the series, Armored Core 6 focuses on high-speed third-person action while piloting an agile mech against heavily armed forces.</p><p>Taking place in "a future where interstellar travel is commonplace," Armored Core 6 casts you as an independent mercenary who is contracted to infiltrate the planet of Rubicon 3 in an effort to search for a mysterious substance known as Coral.</p><p>One of the gameplay features highlighted in the video is the Stagger effect, which allows you to temporarily stun tough enemies and inflict extra damage on them. Traversal also takes advantage of the more vertical design of each stage in Armored Core 6, and to get around, you can load your mech into a conveniently placed catapult and launch into the air without needing to burn through your Boost meter first.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-armored-core-6-gameplay-shows-off-action-packed-gameplay/1100-6516271/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>PlayStation Plus Extra and Deluxe subscribers are getting a nostalgic RPG to add to their libraries in August, as Sea of Stars will be available as a day-one release on that service. A love letter to JRPGs of SNES and Sega Genesis era, Sea of Stars will join the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog catalog on August 29, and a demo is now available on PS5 and PS4.</p><p>According to developer Sabotage Studio, Sea of Stars combines retro aesthetics and modern design to create an experience that is nostalgic but isn't held back by some of the more troublesome game design decisions of the past. One of the other big features in the game is its traversal system, which Sabotage says was designed to be more varied and seamless.</p><p>"Too often, we have fought epic monsters only to have then go out of our way to reach the next objective because a fallen tree was blocking the way," Sabotage explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/25/sea-of-stars-available-launch-day-as-a-playstation-plus-game-catalog-title-august-29-demo-out-today/">PS Blog update</a>. "With Sea of Stars, we set out to move as far away from tile-based movement as possible to create something that would feel lighter and more seamless, while allowing for a more varied moveset, and in turn, offer more opportunities for players to interact with the environment during their adventures. We wanted exploration to be as fully fleshed out as combat."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-a-new-day-one-release-in-august/1100-6516266/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
