Whether we call this period the peak of the \u201chype cycle\u201d or simply the moment the curve goes vertical will only be obvious in hindsight, but the cadence of big news in the field has gone from weekly to almost daily. Let\u2019s catch up with what the biggest players in AI \u2013 Meta, Microsoft, Apple and OpenAI \u2013 are doing.</p><p><strong>Apple</strong></p><p><em>The iPhone maker has built its own framework to create large language models \u2014 the AI-based systems at the heart of new offerings like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard \u2013 according to people with knowledge of the efforts. With that foundation, known as \u201cAjax\u201d, Apple also has created a chatbot service that some engineers call \u201cApple GPT\u201d.</em></p><p><em>In recent months, the AI push has become a major effort for Apple, with several teams collaborating on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The work includes trying to address potential privacy concerns related to the technology.</em></p><p><em>We\u2019re now ready to open source the next version of Llama 2 and are making it available free of charge for research and commercial use. We\u2019re including model weights and starting code for the pretrained model and conversational fine-tuned versions too.</em></p><p><em>Starting today, Llama 2 is available in the Azure AI model catalog, enabling developers using Microsoft Azure to build with it and leverage their cloud-native tools for content filtering and safety features. It is also optimized to run locally on Windows, giving developers a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to customers across different platforms</em></p><p><em>In a study titled \u201cHow is ChatGPT\u2019s behavior changing over </em><em>time?\u201d published on arXiv, Lingjiao Chen, Matei Zaharia, and James Zou, cast doubt on the consistent performance of OpenAI\u2019s large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Using API access, they tested the March and June 2023 versions of these models on tasks like math problem-solving, answering sensitive questions, code generation, and visual reasoning. Most notably, GPT-4\u2019s ability to identify prime numbers reportedly plunged dramatically from an accuracy of 97.6 percent in March to just 2.4 percent in June. Strangely, GPT-3.5 showed improved performance in the same period.</em></p><p><em>AI researcher Simon Willison also challenges the paper\u2019s conclusions. \u201cI don\u2019t find it very convincing,\u201d he told Ars. \u201cA decent portion of their criticism involves whether or not code output is wrapped in Markdown backticks or not\u201d\u2026 So far, Willison thinks that any perceived change in GPT-4\u2019s capabilities comes from the novelty of LLMs wearing off. After all, GPT-4 sparked a wave of AGI panic shortly after launch and was once tested to see if it could take over the world. Now that the technology has become more mundane, its faults seem glaring.</em></p><p><em>Willison agrees. \u201cHonestly, the lack of release notes and transparency may be the biggest story here,\u201d he told Ars. \u201cHow are we meant to build dependable software on top of a platform that changes in completely undocumented and mysterious ways every few months?\u201d</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/25/techscape-meta-open-source-large-language-models-llm-ai-twitter-x-apple\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/25/techscape-meta-open-source-large-language-models-llm-ai-twitter-x-apple", "date_published": "2023-07-25T10:39:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Italy wildfires encircle Palermo as temperatures hit 47C", "description": "<p>Sicilian airport shuts temporarily as extreme heatwave forces hundreds to flee homes</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/22/europe-heatwave-temperatures-symptoms-italy-spain-greece\">\u2018It\u2019s brutal\u2019: Europeans tell of sleepless nights and dizzy spells in heatwave</a></li></ul><p>Wildfires driven by an extreme heatwave have encircled Palermo after temperatures in the Sicilian city climbed to 47C (117F) on Monday.</p><p>Local authorities closed the airport temporarily and part of the motorway as more than 55 wildfires were reported on the island.

Such a state, she suggests, leaves us ill-prepared for the realisation, sharp but inevitable, that our parents, too, may have their secrets. At best, we\u2019re unnerved, something solid now made to seem suddenly shaky. At worst, we indulge in an outburst of sententiousness, priggish to a fault. We need our parents to be better than us \u2013 and if they cannot be that, then at least they should be less exciting.</p><p>In her strangely peaceable new novel, <em>Tom Lake</em>, Patchett gives us Lara Nelson and her three adult daughters: Emily, who will one day take over the family cherry farm; Maisie, who is studying to be a vet; and Nell, who hopes to be an actor, as her mother once was. For these girls, however, it is not a failure of imagination that troubles them so much as a surfeit. For most of their lives, they\u2019ve known that Lara once dated Peter Duke, an actor who would later win an Oscar, news that was broken to them ever so casually by their father, Joe, as they watched one of his old films as children. But in the absence of crucial details \u2013 up to now, their mother has been frustratingly sketchy \u2013 the beautiful, charismatic Duke has colonised their minds, clambering over everything like weeds at the edge of the orchard. They\u2019re fixated on him, these young women, and with their own futures now opening out before them, they demand to know everything.
