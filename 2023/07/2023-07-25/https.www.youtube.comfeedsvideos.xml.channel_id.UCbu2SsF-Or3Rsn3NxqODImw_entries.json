While many might be looking to From for a new Soulslike game, Armored Core VI only takes little inspiration from the Souls titles, and focuses in on bringing the classic Armored Core series to a modern audience with a brand new reboot of the series.\n\nArmored Core first burst onto the scene in 1997, and was FromSoftware's first attempt at branching out after the King's Field series. Afterwards, it became one of From's flagship titles until the release of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. With Hidetaka Miyazaki taking the reins, FromSoftware was taken into a whole new era.\n\nThe most recent entry into the series, Armored Core: Verdict Day, released nearly 10 years ago in 2013. So, with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, From has taken the long running series, and added modern elements they've learned throughout the years of creating high quality, franchise defining games.\n\nWhile Armored Core VI takes elements from multiple previous Armored Core games - including a separate campaign, training mode, and arena - it's movement seems most based on Hidetaka Miyazaki's previous AC titles, Armored Core 4 and For Answer.\n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is set to release August 25, 2023.\n\n#armoredcore #firesofrubicon #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pytU9c6ItLc", "date_published": "2023-07-25T15:00:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pytU9c6ItLc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Starfield: The Settled Systems - The Hand that Feeds Animated Trailer", "description": "Watch another Starfield animated story focusing on another major city in the Settled Systems.\n\nTwo Neon street rats, Ada and Harper, are partners in crime eking out a living stealing from the wealthy partygoers that come to the \u201cpleasure city\u201d to let loose.
