<p id="ybF2ei">That’s even faster than what you’d get out of mmWave 5G, which is more heavily touted by Verizon and AT&amp;T as also being capable of extremely high speeds — Ookla recently reported <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/mmwave-spectrum-gigabit-speeds-us-q1-2023#:~:text=5G%20connectivity%20using%20mmWave%20can%20reach%20staggering%20speeds%20of%20up%20to%201.6%20Gbps">download speeds of up to 1.6Gbps</a> in the US. However, it has limited range and device support and is easily hampered by common impediments like trees and buildings.</p>

  <p id="Cr0GmB">If you’re using Safari but you’re not using Tab Groups, well, it’s time to change that. </p>
<p id="TB6lnB">Tab Groups, as the name implies, allows you to group a selection of tabs together and essentially set them aside for future use. For example, if you have a bunch of tabs you use for work and a bunch of tabs you use after work, you can cordon these tabs off into batches so that they don’t get in each other’s way. You can use your work tabs at work and, when you’re finished, swap them for your “after work” tabs with just one click.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="DgKg5d"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="zuxxYQ">You might also have different Tab Groups for different assignments at work or different school projects. Folks who share a computer might have different Tab Groups for each user. The possibilities are endless. </p>

  <p id="sMdUPc"><em>Starfield</em> will be released in just over a month, and on Tuesday, developer Bethesda Game Studios released three animated shorts as part of a new anthology series called <em>Starfield: The Settled Systems</em>.</p>
<p id="nHBfhf">In the shorts, you’ll get a glimpse of three of the game’s big cities. “Follow a delivery pilot in New Atlantis seeking the exciting life of the elite; a stranded orphan looking for a way out of Akila City; and two street rats struggling to survive in the underbelly of Neon,” the studio wrote in a press email.</p>

  <p id="xxYIx0">Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe is fed up with companies exaggerating their environmental credentials. </p>
<p id="xBTgnG">“There’s far too much greenwashing in the system,” he said in a recent interview. For Scaringe, it’s all too easy for a company to obfuscate the source of its power consumption, especially when it doesn’t actually create any new capacity for renewable energy. And consumers aren’t discerning enough to tell the difference. </p>
<p id="FNAZKU">“This is just so conceptually complex,” he said, making a clear distinction between companies that buy renewable energy to cover their own emissions while also creating new capacity and those who want to “pay a teeny little incremental amount more to get the ability to pat ourselves on the back and say we’re using renewable...</p>

  <p id="Fx1k2q">The European Union has approved a €43 billion ($47.5 billion) plan to develop more fabs and increase semiconductor production in the region. The move will aim to double the EU’s global market share from 10 percent to “at least” 20 percent by 2030, according to <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/07/25/chips-act-council-gives-its-final-approval/">a European Council press release</a>.</p>
<p id="tCjBkl">“In the long run, this will also contribute to the renaissance of our industry and the reduction of our foreign dependencies,” Héctor Gómez Hernández, Spanish minister for industry, trade, and tourism, said in a statement. The Chips Act is meant to attract more investment and elevate research in Europe so that the bloc can be ready for future semiconductor shortages and be less reliant on foreign chips.</p>
