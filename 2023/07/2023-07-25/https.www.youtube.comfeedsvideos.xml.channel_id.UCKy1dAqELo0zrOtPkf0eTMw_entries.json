Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer. \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own. \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil. \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Ann Dowd (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela\u2019s neighbor, and Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela\u2019s friend. \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty. \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment. \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Y\u00fccer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures. \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer opens in theaters on October 13, 2023.\n\n#IGN #Movies #TheExorcist", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuVm-D42MqA", "date_published": "2023-07-25T15:36:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/EuVm-D42MqA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon - Official Gameplay Preview Trailer", "description": "Get a deep dive into gameplay in this latest trailer for FromSoftware's Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, including a look at massive levels, weapons, action-packed mech battles, traversal and combat abilities, mech customization, strategies, and more.
