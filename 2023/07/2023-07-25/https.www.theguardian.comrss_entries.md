<p>Five years on, mystery still surrounds the way Gaia Pope died. This devastating three-part documentary finds extraordinary footage related to the case</p><p></p><p>Mostly blond, all beautiful, the family of Gaia Pope look like a host of broken angels. It has been five years since their 19-year-old daughter/sister/cousin’s body was found huddled in undergrowth on a Dorset clifftop two miles from home after 11 days missing – and the grief and anger still pours out of them. The cause of death was determined by the coroner to be hypothermia. The three-part documentary <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0fzy1xm" title="">Gaia: A Death on Dancing Ledge</a> (the name refers to the clifftop where she was found) takes a broader, deeper, and perhaps more humane and meaningful view than a coroner’s job allows. It unpacks all that might have led to that lonely death so close to home.</p><p>The documentary opens with Kim, Gaia’s mother, first contacting the police, followed by more calls asking for further help, reminding them that Gaia had epilepsy but no medication with her and saying how out of character her disappearance was. Text messages among family and friends checking in with each other, racking their brains for more places she might have gone appear and disappear on screen in silent testimony to the love and affection in which she was held. Over 11 days, the police investigation changes from a search for a missing teen to a suspected murder inquiry, before she was eventually found to have died from exposure.</p><p>Gaia: a Death on Dancing Ledge aired on BBC Three and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p><p><em> In the US, </em><em><a href="https://www.rainn.org/" title="">Rainn</a></em><em> offers support on 800-656-4673.

The number of households renting privately in England and Wales has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/05/number-households-renting-more-than-doubled-2001-census-england-wales" title="">risen hugely</a> – from 1.9m in 2001 to 5m in 2021, while the home ownership rate has fallen to 62% from 64% a decade ago. Outright ownership (with no mortgage) is the most common form of housing tenure in England (33%) and Wales (38%). But the ownership rate among younger adults has fallen sharply. Like black and ethnic minority people, they disproportionately inhabit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/15/young-adults-uk-housing" title="">low-quality, privately rented flats.</a></p><p>This damaging situation means that housing is recognised as a key issue by politicians in all parties. On Monday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/tory-mp-anthony-browne-michael-gove-cambridge-housing-development-planning" title="">Michael Gove</a>, the housing secretary, sought to address it with a speech that was stronger on style than substance. Having abandoned an obligatory target of 300,000 new homes a year, after a threatened revolt from backbenchers, Mr Gove is seeking to persuade voters to ignore his party’s record and focus instead on the vibrant city centres that he sketched in the air.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-housebuilding-michael-goves-urban-visions-cant-erase-his-partys-record">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is prepared to undermine the independence of the judiciary to keep his government together – even if divisions in Israel deepen</p><p>When the Knesset <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/israeli-parliament-votes-in-netanyahu-controversial-supreme-court-changes" title="">curtailed</a> the power of Israel’s supreme court this week, it was a pivotal moment in the country’s history.

Yet both major political parties seem fixated instead on the alleged clash between transgender rights and the rights of women. Labour spent the weekend behind closed doors at its national policy forum, and within a day the shadow equalities minister, Anneliese Dodds, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/labour-will-lead-on-reform-of-transgender-rights-and-we-wont-take-lectures-from-the-divisive-tories">wrote a piece</a> laying out the party’s conclusions on the “reform” of transgender rights.</p><p>As Dodds pointed out, the Tories are cynically using this debate as a front in the culture war – a handy distraction from the legacies of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss and their mismanagement of the economy, and one they hope will play well to their key demographics.

He had just been made redundant and wanted to donate part of his severance pay to the shop. “He gave us £50,” remembers Sigrid Nielsen, who ran the bookshop with her business partner Bob Orr. “I still wonder who he was.”</p><p>Lavender Menace bookshop was founded in 1982, two years after homosexuality between men over the age of 21 was legalised in Scotland. Although its physical presence on Forth Street only lasted for five years, the bookshop made a lasting impact on Scotland’s LGBTQ+ population. During its operation in the 1980s, Lavender Menace was one of two gay bookshops in the UK; the other was London’s Gay’s the Word. Orr and Nielsen opened Lavender Menace after Orr found success selling literature from a bookstall in the cloakroom of the gay club Fire Island, and then later from a glass cabinet in Edinburgh’s Gay Centre. “We were scattered and underground,” says Orr about Edinburgh’s LGBTQ+ community in the 1970s and 80s. “None of us came out at work. We didn’t get on with our parents. By the time the bookshop opened in 82, we knew we were taking a risk, not just financially, but socially as well, whether the neighbourhood would put up with it or not.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/25/scotland-lgbtq-bookshop-lavender-menace-queer-books-archive">Continue reading...</a>

## Why is cancer striking earlier? One answer could be a diet of ultra-processed foods | Devi Sridhar

<p>Government action is needed to give children affordable access to healthier foods. We can’t wait another decade for change</p><p>Across high-income countries, from Britain to Denmark to the US, cancers in people under the age of 50 are becoming more common. This is quite an unusual pattern given that, for decades, cancer was seen as an affliction of old age. In fact, the high rates of cancer in high-income countries in much older people – above the age of 80 – was a sign of humans overcoming infectious diseases to live a long life before chronic diseases such as cancer would set in.</p><p>So the increase in cancer rates in younger people has come as a surprise. The numbers are stark. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-022-00672-8">Data from the G20 group</a> of industrialised countries indicates that between 1990 and 2019, cancer rates increased by 22% in the age group 25-29. Rates of cancer in the next age group, 30-34, are at the highest level ever. And given cancer screening classically isn’t routine in younger age groups, these cancers tend to go undiagnosed for longer with the tumours being more aggressive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/25/cancer-striking-earlier-ultra-processed-foods">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The German musician refused to let being born without arms stop him from becoming a horn virtuoso. As he prepares for the Royal Albert Hall concerts, he explains<strong> </strong>why the real disability is imagining that there are limits </p><p>When Felix Klieser was four he made a decision: he was going to learn the french horn. “Nobody knows where I’d even heard about this instrument,” he laughs. “There is nobody musical in my family. We never went to concerts. My parents didn’t even know what a french horn looked like!”</p><p>Göttingen, the small city in the middle of Germany where Klieser grew up, boasts just one music school. A teacher there, conscious of the fact that the horn is a very physical instrument, requiring impressive lung capacity and strong lips, gently suggested some more appropriate first instruments. Would he like to make some sounds on a piano, perhaps, or bang a drum? “I remember becoming a little bit angry,” says Klieser, “because the idea was not to make music. The idea was to play the horn!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/25/my-life-is-beautiful-felix-klieser-who-plays-the-horn-with-his-toes-on-making-his-proms-debut">Continue reading...</a>

## Prince of Persia is back in 2D – but this time he needs rescuing

<p>The Lost Crown honours the adventure series’ classic platform-game roots, but now the powers to manipulate time are in the hands of the villain. The game’s developers reveal more</p><p>Some 34 years after the release of the first game in the series, Prince of Persia is going back to its 2D roots. Jordan Mechner’s 1989 Apple II original was a side-on platformer that dazzled with its fluid, rotoscoped animation, but the series is probably now better known for its groundbreaking 3D entries, in particular The Sands of Time from 2003, which gave the Prince the power to slow, freeze or even rewind time. That game was the work of Ubisoft Montreal, but The Lost Crown is being created by a different Ubisoft studio with a strong 2D heritage.</p><p>“Ubisoft Montpellier has real expertise in 2D platform games, and some 20 members of the team worked directly on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/nov/23/rayman-origins-game-review">Rayman Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/review-rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a> in key positions,” says game director Mounir Radi, who thinks it’s a natural evolution for the studio to try its hand at a more open, less linear game structure. Accordingly, The Lost Crown is a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/oct/11/modern-video-game-genres-explained-metroidvania-dungeon-crawler">Metroidvania</a>”, a style of action game that encourages backtracking across a gradually unfurling world where new abilities unlock new areas to explore.

For this reason, baker Dee Rettali suggests turning up the heat. “Apricots baked with capers is a good one, and really nice with rice or a chopped salad,” says the co-founder of <a href="https://www.fortitudebakehouse.com/">Fortitude Bakehouse</a> in London. It couldn’t be simpler, either: stone and halve the fruit, then pop them in the oven with a little water and oil, and roast until softened. Once they’re cool enough to handle, chop into small pieces, then “get some good gherkins and capers, chop them finely with sea salt and black pepper, and fold through the fruit”.</p><p>Apricots should also find their way into a Moroccan <em>pastilla</em> pie. “Cook them down, then layer with almonds and mint,” Rettali says. “It’s a fantastic dinner party dish.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

His visits to the Proms consistently include something new or unfamiliar, and his latest appearance there was no exception, pairing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/21/tchaikovsky-where-to-start-with-his-music">Tchaikovsky’s</a> Sixth Symphony, the Pathétique, with a world premiere from the US-born, now Berlin-resident composer <a href="https://www.sacredrealism.org/artists/catherine-lamb/">Catherine Lamb</a>.</p><p>Strictly speaking it was a partial premiere: the first section of the three-part work dates back to 2013, the BBC commissioned the remaining two parts to complete the triptych. Lamb’s completed work, titled Portions Transparent/Opaque, lasts just over half an hour. The first section, subtitled skin/shimmer, begins with the strings alone, playing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation">“just” intonation</a> – an ancient tuning system that subtly adjusts the distance between the notes – to create a quietly sustained, ever shifting continuum of sound constantly blurred by microtones. Lamb adds brass instruments in the second part (subtitled bone/saturate) to provide a more clearly defined harmonic core, and finally in the third part (nerve/cluster) introduces the woodwind, which bring in melodic ideas, more complexity and a sense of forward motion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/25/prom-13-bbcsso-volkov-review-catherine-lamb-tchaikovsky">Continue reading...</a>

Whether we call this period the peak of the “hype cycle” or simply the moment the curve goes vertical will only be obvious in hindsight, but the cadence of big news in the field has gone from weekly to almost daily. Let’s catch up with what the biggest players in AI – Meta, Microsoft, Apple and OpenAI – are doing.</p><p><strong>Apple</strong></p><p><em>The iPhone maker has built its own framework to create large language models — the AI-based systems at the heart of new offerings like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard – according to people with knowledge of the efforts. With that foundation, known as “Ajax”, Apple also has created a chatbot service that some engineers call “Apple GPT”.</em></p><p><em>In recent months, the AI push has become a major effort for Apple, with several teams collaborating on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The work includes trying to address potential privacy concerns related to the technology.</em></p><p><em>We’re now ready to open source the next version of Llama 2 and are making it available free of charge for research and commercial use. We’re including model weights and starting code for the pretrained model and conversational fine-tuned versions too.</em></p><p><em>Starting today, Llama 2 is available in the Azure AI model catalog, enabling developers using Microsoft Azure to build with it and leverage their cloud-native tools for content filtering and safety features. It is also optimized to run locally on Windows, giving developers a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to customers across different platforms</em></p><p><em>In a study titled “How is ChatGPT’s behavior changing over </em><em>time?” published on arXiv, Lingjiao Chen, Matei Zaharia, and James Zou, cast doubt on the consistent performance of OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Using API access, they tested the March and June 2023 versions of these models on tasks like math problem-solving, answering sensitive questions, code generation, and visual reasoning. Most notably, GPT-4’s ability to identify prime numbers reportedly plunged dramatically from an accuracy of 97.6 percent in March to just 2.4 percent in June. Strangely, GPT-3.5 showed improved performance in the same period.</em></p><p><em>AI researcher Simon Willison also challenges the paper’s conclusions. “I don’t find it very convincing,” he told Ars. “A decent portion of their criticism involves whether or not code output is wrapped in Markdown backticks or not”… So far, Willison thinks that any perceived change in GPT-4’s capabilities comes from the novelty of LLMs wearing off. After all, GPT-4 sparked a wave of AGI panic shortly after launch and was once tested to see if it could take over the world. Now that the technology has become more mundane, its faults seem glaring.</em></p><p><em>Willison agrees. “Honestly, the lack of release notes and transparency may be the biggest story here,” he told Ars. “How are we meant to build dependable software on top of a platform that changes in completely undocumented and mysterious ways every few months?”</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/25/techscape-meta-open-source-large-language-models-llm-ai-twitter-x-apple">Continue reading...</a>

## Goodreads is right to divide opinions, wrong to boil them down

<p>I don’t choose books based on the aggregate rating as if they are skincare products, nor do I think any critical verdict is the final one</p><p>Emotions run high on Goodreads. In fact, I tell every author navigating their first book launch to stay off it. They’re not going to listen to me, because who doesn’t want to know whether their manuscript – this precious thing they’ve toiled on in solitude for years – has found its readers? And because I’ve been there myself, I anticipate the spiral that follows. The elated high upon reading the first glowing review. The world-ending devastation of the first scathing review (or even the first lukewarm four-star review). The righteous indignation at the first three-star review. <em>No one understands me. Are these people even literate?</em> <em>Am</em> <em>I</em> <em>even</em> <em>literate?</em> It’s all too much; it doesn’t make you a better writer. Block the site and focus on your work.</p><p>Though I find I can’t stay off Goodreads myself. I don’t read reviews of my own work – I have finally reached that improbable, lucky place where I’m no longer very curious about what anyone is saying about me, so long as I get to keep writing. But I love to ramble on about novels I loved, and I love to see what my friends are loving. And when I’m struggling with negative feedback, I find it helpful to reflect on what sorts of reviews compel me to pick up books. It’s rarely about the Goodreads number – 3.2, 4.5, it doesn’t matter. I don’t choose books based on the aggregate rating as if they are skincare products – <em>it’s got at least a four, so it must be good!</em> I’m not looking for unanimous approval, either. Sometimes I scroll past half a dozen critical reviews and decide to buy a book regardless because of a single sentence consisting of, basically, “<em>Ahhhhhh</em>!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/25/goodreads-is-right-to-divide-opinions-wrong-to-boil-them-down">Continue reading...</a>

## Children of the Corn review – juice-free remake of Stephen King’s killer kids classic

<p>The film starts with the interesting idea that kids today might want to slit their parents’ throats for leaving the planet in such a mess, but quickly gets unscary</p><p>Here is a totally unnecessary adaptation of Stephen King’s 1977 short story about killer kids who slaughter all the adults in town as a sacrifice to a pagan corn god. Unbelievably, King’s 10,000-odd word story has now spawned 11 movies, beginning with the 1984 cult classic starring Linda Hamilton. This new one kicks off with the whiff of something interesting: the idea that kids today might want to slit their parents’ throats for leaving the planet in such a mess. But the script is nowhere near clever enough to exploit the juicy potential for social commentary. Instead, it quickly gets silly and unscary.</p><p>This version is set in a place called Rylstone, a rusting farming town in Nebraska where genetically modified corn is to blame for years of bad harvests. At a town hall meeting, desperate farmers vote to call it quits: accept a government payoff, bury the corn, leave town. What they’ve failed to notice is the cold emotionless eyes of their own children who’ve been spending an awful lot of time in the fields lately. The ringleader of these junior bad seeds is Eden, a 12-year-old with butter-wouldn’t-melt pigtails (Kate Moyer, doing some effective creepy-kid acting).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/children-of-the-corn-review-juice-free-remake-of-stephen-kings-killer-kids-classic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When it comes to phone etiquette, I am the worst of both worlds: boomer rules for myself and gen Z rules for everyone else</p><p>I hate getting schooled by my kids in phone etiquette. Not because I especially mind them knowing modern life better than I do, or shuffling quietly into the sidebar of the sitcom while they ascend to main character status; just because their rules are so time-consuming. Basically, you can’t leave any message on read. If it’s a question and you don’t know the answer, you need a holding response. If it’s a meme and you like it, you need to laugh. If it’s an arrangement confirmed, you need a thumbs up, even if you suggested it so your cooperation is implied. If someone calls you, you have to pick up. If you don’t pick up, you have to call them back, but not “in due course”, when you’ve finished whatever you’re doing, but immediately, as if someone might have died.</p><p>I cling idiotically to the 20th century, where my phone works for me, I don’t work for it. It’s not unusual for me to get a message and just nod in assent, and then do my actual, in-real-life reply three days later. I am too old to learn and unlikely ever to change, but I now run a double standard, the worst of all possible worlds: boomer rules for myself and gen Z rules for everyone else. Boomer rules go under the umbrella “your mum’s Nokia corkscrew”. You can text her if you like, but she won’t reply, because she keeps her phone in the cutlery drawer, where it lies, uncharged, for use on special occasions. But when my friends don’t reply to me, I go full Snapchat generation: Why have they broken our streak? Does that previous, timely back-and-forth mean nothing to them? Was there something wrong with the way I phrased it? Do they hate me now?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/25/yes-i-leave-texts-unanswered-but-dont-you-dare-do-the-same-to-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a new book packed with spectacular photography, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanherman15">Ryan Herman</a> profiles more than 60 rugby union venues around the world</p><p><em>Rugby union is a global sport, played from Alaska to Sri Lanka, with the game’s most famous venues dotted around both the northern and southern hemispheres. My book looks at those great cathedrals and more unusual grounds, in heartlands such as the Welsh valleys and historic English institutions. If you were to write a personal bucket list of rugby grounds to visit, you couldn’t go far wrong with this collection – and yet we are certain there are many more hidden gems still to uncover.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/25/rugby-union-remarkable-grounds-around-the-world-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

## Viv Anderson: the phenomenal Black footballer who changed England for ever

<p>In 1978, Anderson made history and faced adversity as the first Black footballer to play for England. It was just one triumph in a career packed full of them</p><p>The last time Viv Anderson played in a football match, he accidentally broke a man’s nose. “I said, ‘That’s me finished,’” he says. “I left very quickly after that.” After this amateur match, five years ago, in which he participated as a favour to a friend, he decided he wouldn’t step on to the field again. In some ways, it was a fitting end to the playing days of one of England’s best full-backs, a man who thinks that today’s football is lacking the rough and tumble of yesteryear. In other ways, it is inconsistent with a player who cites “team bonding” as the thing he misses most about professional football.</p><p>Basking in the sun on a hot summer’s day, 66-year-old Anderson is the picture of serenity. He greets me with a firm handshake. He has a habit of ending sentences abruptly, pursing his lips as if swallowing the depth of his feeling, although when he is animated, he bangs both hands on the table to make his point. “My memory for detail is not the best in the business,” he wrote in his 2010 autobiography, First Among Unequals. But today, the memories he shares are profound. “The easiest part is breaking through,” he says at one point. “The hardest part is staying.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/25/viv-anderson-the-phenomenal-black-footballer-who-changed-england-for-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2020, people of all ages and backgrounds were suddenly stuck at home, with many turning to streaming platforms to connect with their peers – transforming toxic spaces into inclusive environments</p><p>Something weird happened to video game streaming in the early part of 2020. For a long time, platforms such as Twitch, Mixer and YouTube Live were clubhouses crammed with teenage and twentysomething dudes who ruthlessly guarded what they saw as their patch, trolling and hate raiding channels run by creators outside their demographic.</p><p>Sure, Twitch has worked hard to combat old stereotypes and foster a safe, inclusive environment by improving security, adding new stream categories, and rigidly enforcing community guidelines. But talking to streamers at TwitchCon Paris, a huge get-together for fans and creators, it’s clear that if the user-base is more diverse and welcoming now, one key reason has nothing to do with Twitch. It was Covid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/25/weve-created-this-beautiful-community-how-covid-changed-video-game-streaming-forever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Government’s approach to net zero policies has been ambiguous in past few days following Tories’ unexpected win in Uxbridge and South Ruislip </p><p>Good morning. <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the levelling up secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and talking, among other things, about the government’s approach to net zero policies. He was quite specific on a couple of points, but to say that he cleared things up would be going too far. Over the last few days, in government pronouncements on this topic, there has been more ambiguity than in a modernist poem.</p><p>All of this has been quite good for those of us paid to report what the government is saying and explain what it means. But for producers trying to plan on the basis of what government rules will be for cars and boilers etc over the next decade, the uncertainty has been less welcome.</p><p>The Climate Change Committee’s recent 2023 progress report to parliament is unequivocal that mixed signals on the UK’s commitment to serious climate action is undermining this work, damaging our reputation, and risks us permanently surrendering our status as a world leader on climate action.</p><p>Now is a crucial moment for you to demonstrate to the world that the UK is not demoting itself to become a passive observer in international action on climate change, that we remain a trusted partner and committed to delivering on our promises.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/25/michael-gove-petrol-cars-mps-rishi-sunak-climate-policy-uk-politics-live-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>RackaRacka film-makers Michael and Danny Philippou let rip in their feature debut about suburban teens and an occult craze</p><p>The Philippou brothers, Michael and Danny, are young film-makers from Adelaide who started as production runners on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/the-babadook-review-chilling-freudian-thriller">Australian horror classic The Babadook</a> and achieved a cult following for their film spoofs on YouTube under the handle <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_cDc_2arKIb6SlJoqFT0w">RackaRacka</a>; now with their debut feature they’ve let rip with a blast of wild punk energy and gleeful anarchy with this terrific scary movie. The opening party scene on its own has more voltage than a lot of horror movies, or any kind of movie. If the Sex Pistols ever directed a version of The Monkey’s Paw, it might look like this: a chilling adventure under which there is, however, an undertow of pathos, its title an ironic twist on the emotional pain involved in not talking about your feelings.</p><p>Sophie Wilde plays Mia, a young woman whose mum died after an overdose of pills which everyone has assured her was accidental, though her dad Max (Marcus Johnson) is unwilling to talk about it. Now lonely Mia likes hanging out at the house of her friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen), Jade’s kid brother Riley (Joe Bird) and her mum Sue (Miranda Otto), almost like a new member of the family.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/talk-to-me-review-horror-michael-danny-philippou-creepy-hand">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bentley’s, set up in what was then the National Front stronghold of Canning Town, all too briefly became a legendary weekend mecca for soul, hip-hop and reggae</p><p>In 1983, Canning Town in the borough of Newham in east London returned the highest number of votes for the National Front in the country. A year later, the 16-year-old Black boy Eustace Pryce was murdered during a confrontation with racists in the area. By 1986 Newham registered the UK’s highest number of racist attacks. “It was a no-go area for Black people,” says Zak, then manager of London Weekend Radio (LWR). “People in cars would be shouting obscenities and calling you the N-word. It was a hostile environment.”</p><p>Despite this, between 1982 and 86, Black people from all across London drove to Canning Town in their thousands to dance all night in an underground sweatbox to soul, jazz-funk, rare groove, hip-hop and reggae. Bentley’s was a club in an old pub beneath an underpass. Unglamorous perhaps, but for those four years it became a bustling go-to destination. As part of Newham Heritage Month, the <a href="https://www.rendezvousprojects.org.uk/about/">community interest company Rendezvous Projects</a> has been digging into its influential history to produce a new booklet and podcast on the club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/25/pioneering-black-music-club-far-right-east-london-bentley-s">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My Nottingham Forest teammate had blinding pace and a dry sense of humour – but got no special treatment from Cloughie</p><p>Trevor Francis coming to Nottingham Forest in 1979 was a big statement by Brian Clough and Peter Taylor. They had been used to making big statements in the previous couple of years. The year we got promotion, along comes Larry Lloyd; a big player at Liverpool, went to Coventry and we were able to persuade him to drop down a division. Within five or six games of promotion, Peter Shilton becomes a massive signing for us. I think he was the most expensive goalkeeper in the world at the time, £275,000 or thereabouts. So Clough and Taylor had been making statements alright. But then when you go £1m for a player, breaking the British transfer record in such major fashion? A big, big statement.</p><p>So Trevor arrives. I don’t think he is finished signing the contracts and someone asks Trevor: “When do you expect to play?” Brian Clough intercepts: “When I pick him.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/25/trevor-francis-nottingham-forest-brian-clough-martin-oneill">Continue reading...</a>

## Tom Lake by Ann Patchett review – a lesson in how to kiss and tell

<p>Patchett’s new novel, in which a mother tells her daughters about her early romance with a famous actor, is a gentle but revealing meditation on lost love and destiny</p><p>In This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage, an essay from 2011 in which she considers the vicissitudes of contentment, Ann Patchett writes that children have “a real failure of imagination when it comes to thinking of the adults in their lives as having done anything of interest, anything at all, in the time known as<em> before</em>”. Such a state, she suggests, leaves us ill-prepared for the realisation, sharp but inevitable, that our parents, too, may have their secrets. At best, we’re unnerved, something solid now made to seem suddenly shaky. At worst, we indulge in an outburst of sententiousness, priggish to a fault. We need our parents to be better than us – and if they cannot be that, then at least they should be less exciting.</p><p>In her strangely peaceable new novel, <em>Tom Lake</em>, Patchett gives us Lara Nelson and her three adult daughters: Emily, who will one day take over the family cherry farm; Maisie, who is studying to be a vet; and Nell, who hopes to be an actor, as her mother once was. For these girls, however, it is not a failure of imagination that troubles them so much as a surfeit. For most of their lives, they’ve known that Lara once dated Peter Duke, an actor who would later win an Oscar, news that was broken to them ever so casually by their father, Joe, as they watched one of his old films as children. But in the absence of crucial details – up to now, their mother has been frustratingly sketchy – the beautiful, charismatic Duke has colonised their minds, clambering over everything like weeds at the edge of the orchard. They’re fixated on him, these young women, and with their own futures now opening out before them, they demand to know everything. Lara must spill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/25/tom-lake-by-ann-patchett-review-a-lesson-in-how-to-kiss-and-tell">Continue reading...</a>

Despite a record Labour trouncing of a Tory majority in Selby and Ainsty, a 7% swing to Labour in Uxbridge and South Ruislip became a story about Labour in trouble, over a seat not even won in Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide.</p><p>Labour always struggles to make its narrative heard against the wall of sound from the massed foghorns of the Tory media, but the party needs more nimbleness to duck being defined by the enemy.

It’s a full-blooded roar of a show that deserves an immediate watch</p><p>The overwhelming likelihood is that you didn’t watch <a href="https://theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/gregg-wallace-the-british-miracle-meat-review-this-look-at-eating-human-flesh-is-a-total-curveball">Gregg Wallace: The British Miracle Meat</a> on Channel 4 on Monday night. After all, why would you? It was trailed as nothing special; just another identikit food-based filler documentary, the likes of which have propped up pre-watershed TV schedules for years. There was nothing to separate it from, say, The Hidden World of Hospitality With Tom Kerridge (BBC Two, 8pm, Thursday), or The Secret World of Biscuits (Channel 4, 8pm, Friday), or even Supermarket Unwrapped, the show that directly preceded it.</p><p>Even if you did watch, you probably spent the first few minutes letting it wash over you. There was Gregg Wallace, marching through a factory with a hairnet on and hollering like the world’s friendliest asbo recipient, as he’s done countless times before. There was a deluge of statistics, plonked upfront to justify the next 30 minutes. Things were measured in football pitches for relatability. There was a superfluous secondary female presenter for diversity. All the tropes were present and correct. Nothing out of the ordinary at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/25/the-anger-of-it-will-linger-for-years-is-the-british-miracle-meat-the-most-disturbing-tv-satire-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You don’t need to spend much to get into gardening – a little bit of effort and some thoughtful recycling will go far. Here are our top tips for low-cost cultivation</p><p>Visit the average garden centre and you might assume it costs a lot of money to get into gardening, but that isn’t the case. No matter how many products and plants are on offer, or how relentlessly the Instagram ads insist, gardening is not shopping. My focus in the garden has always been the plants, not the paraphernalia.</p><p>Thankfully, the tide is turning towards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/10/ditch-your-spade-forget-fertiliser-listen-to-the-weeds-alys-fowlers-guide-to-laid-back-gardening" title="">low-intervention, nature-centric gardening</a>, which works well for those who don’t have much to spend. You don’t need a traditional garden to start growing, either, as many indoor and outdoor spaces – balconies, porches, windowsills – can be used for pots, as long as the the plants catch the sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/25/the-shoestring-gardener-10-ways-to-grow-gorgeous-plants-for-little-or-no-money">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the concluding part of an investigation into Norton, Simon Goodley reports on a prestigious motorcycle brand that became a vehicle for a multimillion-pound pension fraud</p><p>On Monday, the Guardian told you how vintage British motorcycle brand Norton had become a vehicle for a multimillion-pound pension scam. Today: the investigation continues.</p><p>Investigative reporter <strong>Simon Goodley </strong>tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal </strong>how Stuart Garner’s stewardship of Norton came with huge amounts of publicity. He courted politicians and Hollywood stars. All the while, the business was struggling to do the basics of motorcycle manufacturing. A glimpse at the company’s accounts from 2013 appear to show that the bulk of the company’s cashflow was coming directly from investors in its pension scheme, not motorbike sales. When the business eventually collapsed, it cost those investors their life savings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/25/great-british-motorcycle-scam-norton-part-two-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
