It\u2019s critical because its proper outcome is a machine that boots and runs when that operation is complete, the old drive removed, and the new drive put in its place.</p><h2 class=\"toc\">About disk cloning, a.k.a. drive cloning</h2>\n<p>Disk cloning, now often called drive cloning, means creating a true and faithful copy of one computer storage device on another \u2014 in other words, copying the contents of one storage device onto another storage device. The original name comes from a time when this meant spinning hard disks. But today, with solid-state drives (SSDs) as common as hard disks (HDs), both source and target can be either an HD or an SSD. In fact, it\u2019s often the case when a boot/system disk is being cloned that the source is an HD and the target an SSD because of the improved performance that such a changeover invariably delivers.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3168777/drive-cloning-windows-how-to.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3168777/drive-cloning-windows-how-to.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-07-25T10:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/02/microsoft-drive-cloning_primary-100708053-small.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "It\u2019s time to break the ChatGPT habit", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>ChatGPT is the first artificial intelligence (AI) brand to go mainstream and it was the fastest-growing tech product ever.
