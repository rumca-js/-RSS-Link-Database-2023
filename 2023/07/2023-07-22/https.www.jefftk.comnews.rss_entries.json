[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Replacing the Big Air Purifier", "description": "<p><span>\n\nAround Christmas 2021 I put together a big air purifier on top of </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/built-in-shelves\">our\nbookcase</a>.  Somehow I didn't blog about it or take a picture, but\nhere's it in the background of a birthday:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/birthday-with-big-air-purifier-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/birthday-with-big-air-purifier.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe basic idea was that I didn't have a good place to put a filter\ncube, commercial air purifiers were scarce, and a different\nconfiguration of filters seemed like it could work well.  It's a box\nfan with eleven filters: five along the side, five along the top, and\none at the end.  It glows because I built a regular light bulb into\nit, though without any means of replacing the bulb when it died (which\nit eventually did).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe design relies on a good seal with the wall, but when I initially\nset it up I was worried about peeling the paint off so I used masking\ntape there.  Which eventually pulled away:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/air-purifier-pulling-away-from-wall-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/air-purifier-pulling-away-from-wall.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhich means it's probably been doing about nothing for a while.  I\nconsidered fixing it, but there were other issues with the design: the\nbox fan was pretty loud on \"high\" and the fan didn't point a sensible\ndirection.  And at this point commercial purifiers are much more\nwidely available.  So I ordered three <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LSC9HLS\">AP-1518R</a> purifiers,\nwhich are very similar to (and filter-compatible with!) the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01728NLRG\">AP-1512HH</a> we already\nhad, and replaced the big purifier:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/new-air-purifiers-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/new-air-purifiers.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI've laid the purifiers on their backs, so the fresh air circulates\ntowards people's heads and I can reach the controls from the ground.\nI'm not sure whether this is a good idea&#8212;the internal squirrel\ncage fan would have been engineered expecting loads from a different\ndirection, and this might not be good for it?  Any guesses?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/evaluating-a-corsi-rosenthal-filter-cube\">previously\ntested</a> one of these against a filter cube and estimated a CADR of\n219 CFM on high, 90% of what that filter cube gave on high.  When the\nbig purifier was new and sealed properly it was probably in this range\nor a bit worse: having nearly 3x the filters as a standard filter cube\nshould have given less restriction on the airflow, but there's\nprobably highly diminishing returns and the position of the outflow\nwas bad. If I run the three new purifiers on medium they're far\nquieter than the big purifier while giving more clean air than it did\nbefore it started leaking.  And I have the option to run them on high\nif the room is very crowded, where they're about the same volume as\nthe big purifier while delivering about 3x the clean air.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0gfvGrJFB6pa7EVwh7yncMjbnrvJ9btzZnuujxhk5eVXyQ3EXuqt3X7rGWY2sS1aRl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110757665799371658\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/replacing-the-big-air-purifier", "date_published": "2023-07-22T08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
