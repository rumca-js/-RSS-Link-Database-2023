<p>Despite his chemistry with Alison, Paul Callaghan was reluctant to turn their friendship into something more – but a winter morning commute changed his mind.</p><p>I am a love tragic. Have been since I was a teenager, when I would fall in love with any female that came close to talking to me at high school. The problem was no one was that interested in me. It wasn’t sex that I was after. I just wanted someone to like me.</p><p>But on the morning of the 24 December 1986, my life changed forever. I had no idea it was coming. I went to work looking forward to the highlight of the year, the Christmas Eve party. It began before lunch and transitioned to a bar at the Wentworth Hotel in Sydney. It was early afternoon and spirits were high.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/23/the-moment-i-knew-the-train-station-was-where-i-first-felt-the-magic">Continue reading...</a>

Brazilian Vini Capovilla, head chef for the Matildas, leads a team that prepares multiple meals a day for 50-plus players, coaches and staff. In his fifth World Cup for an Australian national team (Capovilla has cooked for both the Socceroos and the Matildas since 2014), the culinary guru says he brings a holistic perspective to the role.</p><p>“When I joined, I thought it was all about performance, the maximum nutrition to accomplish performance,” says Capovilla. “After a few competitions, I learned that there’s much more to the role. Of course nutrition is key, but the wellbeing of players (and) the wellness that a meal can bring, is key.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/23/avocado-coffee-fajitas-the-food-guru-fuelling-the-matildas-dreams">Continue reading...</a>

With the Hoylake venue rendered defenceless by weather conditions, star attractions arrived to swing at the surprise leader.</p><p>Harman, after a brief wobble, regained his composure. The Open is his to lose, from a position of five shots clear. At the final hole of round three, he offered momentary hope to others by sitting wide of the green in three. Harman duly chipped and putted for a par five. Rounds of 67, 65 and 69 equal 12 under par.

Truly, a new age is upon us.</p><p>After the waves of signings last season, this summer of Todd Boehly’s Great Disruption was always going to be about consolidation and retrenchment.

The Uxbridge byelection has reopened arguments about how far to push a green agenda but global heating calls for a non-partisan approach<p>Nothing feels as good as winning.

In little over three years, he has transformed a defeated and despairing party into a government in waiting. There have been some deeply painful compromises along the way, but finally he can argue that they are starting to pay off.</p><p>Ed Davey is equally entitled to be gleeful about recapturing Somerton and Frome for the Lib Dems, confirming that his party is well and truly back from the wilderness. The scale of tactical voting in both contests suggests that an iron resolve is forming among anti-Tory voters to do whatever it takes. Where they can run as insurgents against an unpopular government, progressives are riding high. But what happened in Uxbridge and South Ruislip suggests limits to that approach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/22/observer-view-climate-crisis-must-not-be-used-political-tool">Continue reading...</a>

## To phub or not to phub? It’s a modern etiquette dilemma | Michael Hogan

Phone snubbing, or interacting with your mobile while ignoring partners and friends, is ‘bad for relationships’, scientists have just discovered. But when is it OK?<p>I witnessed a spectacular row in a beer garden this summer. My fellow voyeurs and I guessed the couple were on a date – not their first but perhaps their second or third – and he’d checked his notifications too often for her liking. “Why don’t you just date your phone instead?” she snapped, standing up to leave. “Hope you’re happy together.”</p><p>I’ve edited out a few F-bombs but that was the gist. Sadly, she drained her drink rather than sloshing it in his face. Reader, I nearly stood up and applauded. “Phubbing” – a portmanteau of “phone snubbing”, or deciding to interact with your mobile rather than a person – is a 21st-century epidemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/22/phubbing-guide-to-modern-dating">Continue reading...</a>

## JO Morgan: ‘I think I do books that may sound strange’

<p>The prize-winning poet and novelist on writing and book binding, his wariness of new technology and why literature is the ultimate immersive experience</p><p>JO Morgan has published book-length poems on subjects as diverse as the 10th-century battle of Maldon and a future Martian returning to his abandoned mother planet, Earth. His book <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/assurances-9781787330856">Assurances</a></em>, about the RAF’s involvement in the cold war, won the 2018 Costa poetry award, while <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/jo-morgan-interference-pattern-review">Interference Pattern</a></em> (2016) was described in the <em>TLS</em> as “a poem that could come to be for the 21st century what <em>The Waste Land</em> was for the 20th”. Morgan’s latest book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/appliance-9781529115949">Appliance</a></em>, is a short novel told in 11 discrete chapters over a period of about 70 years, charting the advance of a new technology, teleportation, that arrives first as a fridge-like contraption and becomes, with each new version, more powerful and pervasive. Among other things the title, which was shortlisted for the 2022 Orwell prize, articulates beautifully current human anxieties about unregulated artificial intelligence. Morgan, 45, lives in a cottage on a farm in the Scottish borders.</p><p><strong>What was the genesis of the book?<br /></strong>Stories stay in my mind over many years. A long time ago I had an idea for a book where the protagonist was this inanimate, unthinking thing and the people around it were a kind of Greek chorus. Then it was working out what sort of technology I wanted it to be. I didn’t want it to be a real technology, but I wanted it to be something [teleportation] that would be familiar to readers.</p><p><em>Appliance</em> by JO Morgan is published in paperback by Vintage (£9.99).

<p>The artist <a href="https://nespoon.art/">NeSpoon</a> creates lace-patterned murals on the side of buildings across Italy, France, Spain and beyond, inspired by local traditions. ‘Lace patterns can be found everywhere around us – in the calyxes of flowers, in the skeletons of sea creatures, in snowflakes,’ she says. As a child, in the 1980s, NeSpoon lived in West Berlin when the wall was still standing, and its graffiti was one of the inspirations for her to start painting walls herself. Each design is unique, inspired by the people she meets and the tales she hears. ‘Wherever I am, I meet and interview members of the local lace guild, and scour museums and historical sources for inspiration,’ she says. ‘I often ask people who live nearby if they have any lace at home. I always find something interesting.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jul/22/lace-inspired-murals-celebrating-european-folk-traditions-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Colour and pattern vie for attention in a cheerful bungalow in Lapua</p><p>Ten years ago, when Laura Annala was house-hunting in her hometown of Lapua, southwest Finland, there was one property that kept resurfacing. “It was a detached, yellow-brick bungalow built in the 1980s,” Annala recalls. “It had low ceilings so it wasn’t very bright inside and the rooms were either painted brown or covered in flowery wallpaper. It was really uninspiring.” For two months, she scrolled past the listing until one day her father decided to get on his bicycle and take a closer look.</p><p>He found the house was surrounded by a mature garden, thick with flowers and trees. The location was also ideal – it was opposite the local school and Annala and her husband, Jussi, were hoping soon to start a family. It was also “really cheap”, which meant they would have enough money left over to renovate the tired interiors. At the time, Annala, a hair stylist, was starting her own business. She had spent the previous decade living in Helsinki, Tampere and the Netherlands, where she had met Jussi. Now, she was hoping to open her own salon in Lapua. A budget-friendly, three-bedroom bungalow started to make sense.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/22/letting-in-the-light-in-the-cheerful-family-home-of-an-artist-in-finland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After her own experience of fertility treatment and pregnancy loss, the embryologist connects with patients on a far more emotional level</p><p>I was 22 weeks pregnant when we saw the foetal medicine cardiac specialist; I could feel the baby moving. She scanned me for 45 minutes, saying nothing. Then she drew a diagram of the baby’s heart and, where the aorta should have been, she put a line through it.</p><p>That picture will stay with me for ever. She drew it beautifully, but I knew what it meant. Dorothy, our daughter, had an interruption of the aortic arch, no left ventricle and a massive hole in her heart.

<p>The advanced large language model’s ability to reason is a feather in the cap for developers of generative AI technology</p><p>In 2017, researchers at the British AI company DeepMind (now Google DeepMind) published an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815">extraordinary paper</a> describing how their new algorithm, AlphaZero, had taught itself to play a number of games to superhuman standards without any instruction. The machine could, they wrote, “achieve, <em>tabula rasa</em>, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.”</p><p>Speaking afterwards at a big machine-learning conference, DeepMind’s chief executive, Demis Hassabis (himself a world-class chess player), observed that the program often made moves that would seem unthinkable to a human chess player. “It doesn’t play like a human,” he said, “and it doesn’t play like a program. It plays in a third, almost alien, way.” It would be an overstatement to say that AlphaZero’s capabilities spooked those who built it, but it clearly surprised some of them. It was, one (privately) noted later, a bit like putting your baby daughter to sleep one evening and finding her solving equations in the morning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/22/caw-blimey-gpt-4-may-be-just-an-ai-language-parrot-but-its-no-birdbrain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, Cillian Murphy is a 20th-century Frankenstein whose catastrophic creation unravels across a tangle of timelines in Nolan’s expansive drama</p><p>It’s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the “father of the atomic bomb”. But “biopic” seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>’s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. <em>Oppenheimer</em> is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, <em>Oppenheimer</em> is the ultimate monster movie. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/08/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-christopher-nolan-florence-pugh">Cillian Murphy</a>’s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer’s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It’s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer’s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy’s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use.</p><p>In fact, Murphy’s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film’s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/mattdamon">Matt Damon</a>’s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he’s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he’s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/22/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-volatile-biopic-is-a-towering-achievement-cillian-murphy">Continue reading...</a>

But it’s easily done. He’s far from the first to run up a number on 18, and he most definitely won’t be the last. He’s +8.</p><p><strong>… but the hottest property on the course right now is the Masters champion Jon Rahm.</strong> He’s just carded <em>four</em> birdies in a row around the turn, at 9, 10, 11 and 12. Throw in the one he made at the 5th, and that’s five under for his round. He’s catapulted himself up the standings into a tie for fourth, and so what better time to update the old leaderboard?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/22/the-open-2023-third-round-updates-live-golf">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Parlophone)<br />Comparing it to a surprise baby, late-life Blur’s ninth album finds them on eloquent, emotional form, casting a wistful eye over past glories while pushing forward musically</p><p>Nine albums in, Blur do not owe anyone any bangers. They are a four-piece very much in the post-urgent stage of their career, reaping the rewards of their long musical life at a pair of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/09/blur-review-glorious-reunion-wembley-stadium-london">ecstatically received Wembley Arena mega-gigs</a> a few weeks ago. These are men who have history of falling out (Damon Albarn and guitarist Graham Coxon, for two), falling back in together, spending time as a band because they want to, as a pleasurable sideshow to their main gigs. Gorillaz, Albarn’s other spectacularly successful vehicle, remain active. In his spare time he’s <a href="https://consequence.net/2023/07/damon-albarn-opera/">writing another opera</a>. Coxon, a longtime solo artist, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba-w1CGSkNw">the Waeve</a>, a rich collaboration with his songwriter partner, Rose Elinor Dougall. Drummer Dave Rowntree recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPaPyeUoDmQ">a respectable debut solo record</a>. Alex James, bass, makes cheese and runs a festival on his farm.</p><p>And yet, eight years on from their satisfying, if less pressing, last reunion album, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/22/blur-the-magic-whip-album-review">The Magic Whip</a></em>, Blur have produced a record that packs no little excitement. This swiftly wrought record, which James has compared to a surprise baby (“<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/blur-new-album-ballad-darren-1234775786/">we didn’t know we were pregnant</a>, and we gave birth in a supermarket car park”) finds late-life Blur on eloquent, emotional form. It’s an album that often looks back, while summoning textures and nuances that only add to their toolkit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/22/blur-the-ballad-of-darren-review-mature-melancholia-spiked-with-adventure-the-narcissist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chicago three-piece signed to Matador draw on the dissonant, melodic sounds of alt-rock heroes but forge their own path</p><p>Last year, influential US indie label Matador brought thrilling teenage three-piece <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/11/one-to-watch-horsegirl-versions-of-modern-performance">Horsegirl</a> to a wider audience. Their latest signing, <a href="https://www.lifeguard.band/">Lifeguard</a>, have much in common: another precocious three-piece from the same thriving Chicago scene, they also feature Horsegirl guitarist-singer Penelope Lowenstein’s brother Isaac on drums. Drawing on alt-rock touchstones such as Mission of Burma and Les Savy Fav, Lifeguard’s sound owes much to the blend of melody and dissonance that characterised Sonic Youth circa <em>Goo</em>, all performed with a youthful brio.</p><p>However, as guitarist-vocalist Kai Slater told <em>So Young</em> magazine: “I believe we’re finding our own path – we do like these old bands, but it’s not about nailing this sound from a different time.” Bassist and vocalist Asher Case, meanwhile, feels that their home city is just as big an influence: “Chicago’s a big part of all of us. There definitely was a historic Chicago scene… but that scene has evolved into this one. It never stopped.”</p><p><em><a href="https://shop.matadorrecords.com/release/383345-lifeguard-dressed-in-trenches">Crowd Can Talk</a></em><a href="https://shop.matadorrecords.com/release/383345-lifeguard-dressed-in-trenches">/ </a><em><a href="https://shop.matadorrecords.com/release/383345-lifeguard-dressed-in-trenches">Dressed in Trenches</a></em> is out on Matador</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/22/one-to-watch-lifeguard-crowd-can-talk-dressed-in-trenches">Continue reading...</a>

## Why aren’t we more scared of the climate crisis? It’s complicated

<p>Despite extreme heat and weather in the US, most Americans aren’t cowering in fear. There’s a psychological reason for it</p><p>This summer in the United States, millions of people have experienced the intense effects of the climate crisis. The “heat dome” that has gripped the south-west for the past three weeks is expanding into the south-eastern states. Catastrophic flooding in the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/flash-flooding-pennsylvania-deaths-c0b3fc0c9c3e40b4cd33c8dc0ad50c14">north-east has claimed lives</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/15/1187978006/northwest-flooding-ruins-crops-dealing-blow-to-farmers-livelihoods">wiped out farmers’ crops</a>. And the worst wildfire season in Canadian history has not only caused <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-we-lost-so-much-worst-wildfire-season-in-canadian-history-wreaking-havoc-on-indigenous-communities">tens of thousands of Indigenous people</a> to be displaced, but the accompanying smoke has also billowed over into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/smoke-maps-canada-fires.html">north-eastern and midwest</a> US, setting records for poor air quality. In many cases, these events have caused irreparable damage and trauma to those directly affected, and can certainly feel like they’re encroaching on those people on the periphery. And yet despite the fact that we’re living through a climate disaster, most Americans aren’t cowering in fear every day about the future of our planet. There’s a psychological reason for that.</p><p>For one, the climate crisis is a much <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/18/for-earth-day-key-facts-about-americans-views-of-climate-change-and-renewable-energy/">lower priority</a> for Americans than other national issues, such as the economy and healthcare costs. That isn’t to say that we aren’t concerned: two-thirds of Americans say they are at least “somewhat worried” about global warming, while 30% are “very worried”, per <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-beliefs-attitudes-spring-2023/toc/2/">a Yale University survey</a>. But because of the nature of the way that many humans experience fear, connecting this emotion to something as vast and complex as the climate crisis is difficult. According to Brian Lickel, a social psychologist who researches human responses to threats, we aren’t designed to remain in a high state of fear for long. “A very fundamental feature of the normal kind of expected emotional processing is hedonic adaptation,” he said. “Our emotion system is designed to be labile, to go up or have certain responses, but then to not stick there.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/22/climate-crisis-fear-psychology">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bastille frontman on being followed around by football – and the terror of playing live</p><p>Born in London in 1986, Dan Smith is the frontman of Bastille. After touring pub gigs and open mic nights, Smith formed the band with Chris Wood, Kyle Simmons and Will Farquarson in 2010. Armed with global hit single Pompeii, debut album All This Bad Blood reached No 1 and became one of the biggest selling records of 2013. With over 1bn Spotify streams, the band have since put out four LPs, and Smith has co-written with the likes of Olly Murs and Rag’n’Bone Man. The band are touring their debut for their 10th anniversary this summer.</p><p><strong>This image frames me as some kind of sporty kid, when I was actually the opposite.</strong> In a horribly gendered way, my school decided that every boy had to get their official photo taken while kicking a ball, and every girl had to get theirs taken while shooting a ball into a netball hoop. Immediately after this shot was taken, I kicked the floor hard and fell over, which was embarrassing. I was so bad at sports and super self-conscious about it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/22/dan-smith-looks-back-bastille-success-was-unexpected-and-i-was-a-nervous-wreck">Continue reading...</a>

She talks about why writing is a lonely calling, and the problem with ‘grandparent-pleasing’ theatre</p><p>Lucy Prebble’s career has come full circle. We are meeting in the slightly anonymous offices of London’s National Theatre, where the writer once worked as an “assistant to an assistant” for then artistic director Nicholas Hytner: opening the post, fielding complaints, fixing dinners. Today she is an integral part of the team behind the cultural behemoth that is HBO’s Succession; a playwright of depth, creativity and playfulness; creator of the almost frighteningly mesmerising Billie Piper TV series I Hate Suzie; with a sparkling guest appearance on Have I Got News for You thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It was while working at the National, in her early 20s, that Prebble found out that her first play, The Sugar Syndrome, was to be staged at Sloane Square’s Royal Court theatre: Upstairs. Enron – her dazzlingly clever telling of the story of the energy company’s infamous rise and fall, which was staged at Chichester, the West End and then Broadway – would follow six years later. (Prebble is not one for churning out work. She obsesses about her plays. Ruminates. Redrafts.

<p>They interrupt narrative and disrupt plot – no wonder novelists have been slow to warm to mobile phones. But a new generation is putting technology at the heart of their work</p><p>What do you call a phone when it rings in a fictional world? “Mobile” and “cell” are old, “smartphone” is almost a tautology and “phone” is so intrusive that the word seems to ring out shrilly from the page the instant you type it. This may be because we read fiction partly to escape our phones, or it may be that phones, even fictional ones, seem to demand too much of our attention. Telephones, of the kind we all keep handy, are so much a part of daily life we touch them as often as our faces. But phones in fiction require a sleight of hand: if characters use them as realism dictates, they will feel as interruptive on the page as they do at the dinner table. How can authors navigate this challenge?</p><p>Like bathrooms and paid employment, it is amazing how often phones are dispensed with by many otherwise realist fiction writers. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jmcoetzee" title="">JM Coetzee</a> famously wrote to Paul Auster (in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/20/here-and-now-paul-auster-jm-coetzee-letters-review" title="">Here and Now</a>, the 2013 selection of their letters) that he was not prepared “to write novels in which people go around with personal electronic devices”. Because, if “everyone has access to more or less everyone else, what becomes of all that plotting?” He also lamented the impact of mobile technology on the “novel of adultery”, though surely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/sally-rooney" title="">Sally Rooney</a> has proved there was nothing to fear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/22/married-to-the-mob-the-rise-of-the-smartphone-in-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former champions Japan romped to a 5-0 victory over Zambia in their Women’s World Cup opener at Waikato Stadium on Saturday, outclassing the debutants with a slick display of pass-and-move football.</p><p>Hinata Miyazawa scored twice and her fellow forward Mina Tanaka found the net in the second half, after having two earlier efforts called back for offside by VAR. The winger Jun Endo added the fourth in the 71st minute, before the substitute Riko Ueki got the fifth from a penalty in stoppage time after the Zambia goalkeeper Catherine Musonda had been dismissed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/22/zambia-japan-womens-world-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The internet has become transfixed with the idea of watching Greta Gerwig’s bubblegum comedy next to Christopher Nolan’s dark drama but it proved to be a nightmarish combo</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/barbie-movie-opening-night-greta-gerwig">‘Unadulterated joy’: Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie brings out the crowds</a></li></ul><p>Few things have caught the public imagination in recent years quite like the concept of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/29/blonde-v-bombshell-get-set-for-the-barbie-oppenheimer-smackdown">Barbenheimer</a>. When Warner Bros scheduled the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/barbie-review-greta-gerwig-delirious-bubblegum-fantasy">Barbie</a> to run in direct opposition to that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/oppenheimer-review-nolans-atom-bomb-epic-is-flawed-but-extraordinary">Oppenheimer</a>, directed by embittered former employee Christopher Nolan, the natural response was to pick a side. Both films were so diametrically opposed, after all, that the competition took on a slightly tribal air. Just who do you stand for? Drama or comedy? Joy or fear? Female empowerment or the death of tens of thousands of Japanese civilians?</p><p>But then something bizarre happened. Instead of picking just one film, people started latching onto the idea of seeing Barbie and Oppenheimer together, on the same day, as part of a wildly incongruous double bill. Tom Cruise said he was going to do it. Greta Gerwig posed with tickets to both. Despite spending the last few weeks looking palpably baffled by having to play 400 tinpot YouTube parlour games just to promote his movie, Christopher Nolan also seemed fairly into the idea as well. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/22/barbie-oppenheimer-double-feature">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With homes almost beyond reach for all but the luckiest, it’s becoming a truth universally acknowledged that a potential partner’s housing situation has once more begun to have an outsized impact on their romantic suitability </p><p>Rosie’s boyfriend Carl is kind and generous – an “amazing person”. He earns more than she does, and often pays for her to come with him on work trips, or lends cash when she needs it. “He’s the kind of person who would pick up the bill in a heartbeat,” she says. Their relationship is happy – he loves her for her. But she knows, deep down, that he also loves her for her flat.</p><p>Rosie’s parents are middle class, and bought her a flat years ago when prices were lower, renting it out to pay off the mortgage. Carl’s family, meanwhile, isn’t well off, and he wouldn’t have been in a position to buy on his own – his income isn’t enough to get a mortgage and he has no savings. Both now live in the flat with a housemate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/22/is-housing-crisis-killing-romance-modern-dating-jane-austen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anxious Democrats say centrist No Labels group – which could back Joe Manchin – would act as spoiler against Joe Biden </p><p>On a small stage in New Hampshire this week, West Virginia senator Joe Manchin and former Republican Governor Jon Huntsman sat together extolling the virtues of bipartisanship and talking very much like running mates. They were there on behalf of the centrist political advocacy organization No Labels, which is considering fielding a third-party ticket in the 2024 presidential election, and had enlisted the two men to debut its 67-page policy manifesto.</p><p>Early on in the evening, the moderator asked the question looming over the event: were Manchin and Huntsman running for president? After a smattering of applause died down, Manchin deflected, saying they were simply there to “explain to you that we need options”. But Manchin’s refusal to announce whether he will seek re-election for the US Senate next year, and his presence at the town hall, has drawn speculation that he and No Labels may combine to upend the 2024 election.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/22/us-third-party-group-no-labels-trump-biden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Nashville author’s essay, These Precious Days, prompted a global outpouring of love, and her new book celebrates the wonder of ordinary life. She talks about running a bookshop, resisting censorship and taking inspiration from Madonna</p><p>It is 8am in Nashville, Tennessee and novelist Ann Patchett is bursting with sprightly enthusiasm. “I washed my face,” she jokes. We’re barely a couple of minutes into our Zoom conversation and she has given me two “super-hot tips” for forthcoming novels that are going to “win everything” next year – <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374610494/absolution" title="">Absolution</a> by Alice McDermott and <a href="https://lithub.com/percival-everett-is-rewriting-huckleberry-finn-from-jims-perspective/" title="">James</a>, a retelling of Huckleberry Finn by Booker-shortlisted Percival Everett – and let slip that Tom Hanks recently popped by for lunch. Her dog, Sparky, star of the weekly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFgJN8Qr7Os" title="">YouTube videos</a> Patchett posts from her independent bookshop, Parnassus Books, sits patiently on the sofa behind her. “I’m a bookseller. That’s what I do,” she says, when I remind her we are supposed to be discussing her own new novel, Tom Lake. “I’m obsessed with other people’s books.”</p><p>To say that Patchett is evangelical about books is no mere cliche. In one of her essays, she compares her zeal to that of a Hare Krishna devotee she met many years ago who spent every day proclaiming his love of God to strangers in Chicago airport. “I would stand in an airport to tell people how much I love books, reading them, writing them, making sure other people felt comfortable reading and writing them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/22/in-a-world-that-is-going-to-hell-there-is-still-so-much-joy-ann-patchett-on-finding-happiness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dmitry Baiduk shared a pitch with Harry Kane as an under-21 but refusing to support Alexander Lukashenko has meant exile</p><p>Dmitry Baiduk scrolls through his phone and stops at a team lineup from June 2015. An under-21s friendly at Oakwell between England and Belarus does not linger in many memories but he can picture it clearly, recalling the moment he came on late in the game to share a pitch with Harry Kane, Danny Ings, Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Nobody can take that away but these days the images prompt a question: “Would Kane be able to imagine what has happened to me since?”</p><p>Probably not. Baiduk’s career was taking off when he took a decision that in effect cut it short. Early in 2021 he was asked by his then employers, Dinamo Brest, to sign a letter in support of Belarus’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko. The government had demanded at least 10 players’ signatures in exchange for continued financial support of the club. Along with his teammate Vitaliy Gaiduchik, Baiduk refused. Upon learning that five teammates had gone ahead and signed the document, the pair asked for their contracts to be terminated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/22/our-consciences-were-clear-belarus-players-taking-stand-against-a-dictator">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What’s really behind the British favouritism towards red squirrels, animals once derided as ‘tree rats’?</p><p>Since the famous mid-20th century experiments on “operant conditioning” by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/01/change-your-life-oliver-burkeman-bf-skinner" title="">BF Skinner</a>, people have been tempted to describe modern humans as a “rats in cages”, forever pressing levers for tiny pellets of pleasure. Before that, however, the dominant metaphor involved a different rodent. In the 19th century, caged squirrels were popular pets, getting their exercise from running on wheels. “The tendency of the entire national energy,” John Ruskin wrote, “is to approximate more and more the state of a squirrel in a cage.”</p><p>The Victorians, indeed, were initially just as fond of the grey squirrel as of the indigenous red. American grey squirrels were first brought to Britain in 1876 by a Victorian banker called Thomas V Brocklehurst, and soon became a fashionable import. But by 1912 they had become the dominant squirrel in Regent’s Park, London, and so began the long backlash, which rumbles on to this day. As Peter Coates’s splendidly rich book demonstrates in deep cultural detail, the long “squirrel wars” of 20th-century Britain are a microcosm of wider arguments about biological belonging and what he nicely terms “the emotional ecology of home”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/22/squirrel-nation-by-peter-coates-review-glad-to-be-grey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guy Martin’s seeming one-man stag do is a hugely entertaining watch, but the Colombian tourist board must be fuming. Could he not at least have gone to one small plates restaurant?</p><p>I realised recently that there is a certain moment in factual TV history that is treated by all millennials my age or thereabouts as a “canon event”, and that is: Jon Tickle walking across a swimming pool full of custard in a 2003 episode of Brainiac. British TV used to be full of these strange, undeletably memorable moments of documentary (another favourite is Danny Dyer taking a short hard slap from Mo Teague in Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men, or the entirety of Richard Madeley Meets the Squatters). We’ve lost a lot of that in recent years – television has gotten too glossy, too high-definition, too reality-shaped, and we miss a lot of what can only be described as “a man wearing an unfashionable jacket while doing something quietly bonkers”, and culturally we have suffered as a result. Watching both episodes of Our Guy in Colombia (Sunday, 9pm, Channel 4) – in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/07/guy-martin-bike-racer-isle-of-man-tt-speed-with-guy-martin-channel-4">Guy Martin</a> gets waterboarded, shot and shown around a cocaine factory in a jungle clearing – felt like being right back in 2006: no iPhones, no social media, no rules.</p><p>There’s no way you can watch Our Guy in Colombia and not be permanently changed by it. There are the scenes of kidnap and torture, obviously (the narrator solemnly intones over footage of Martin being slapped and yelled at in the back of a car while giggling: “The official advice is not to antagonise your kidnappers”), and ones of him being shot at close range to test the effectiveness of a bulletproof coat. He gets waterboarded for a while before he taps out, and we see the shocked footage of him, speechless, afterwards. There’s a scene where he mashes leaves and makes a kilogram block of cocaine while armed police watch on to make sure he doesn’t steal any of it. There’s footage of him downhill racing on a bike with no brakes, and a wonderful scene of him explaining the country’s history with guerrilla warfare while jacked up on coca tea. All you can think while watching is: how on earth did this ever get commissioned, let alone insured?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/22/our-man-in-colombia-cocaine-guns-waterboarding-guy-martin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When he realised the Russians were coming for him, Ukrainian writer Volodymyr Vakulenko buried his journal. Then he was taken away never to return. Now, his chronicle has been unearthed …</p><p>Kapytolivka is a village of low, scattered cottages, just beyond the south-eastern tip of the Ukrainian town of Izium. The last house in the village is a simple white building with a corrugated iron roof, a chimney, and a front garden planted with a vine and roses. On 22 March 2022 it would have been a pretty spot, but for the armoured personnel carrier that the Russians had parked right outside. By then, Kapytolivka had been under occupation for a fortnight. Russian soldiers had taken over the houses of those who had fled; they had looted the shop, and stolen any cars they could find.</p><p>That day, a military car pulled up at the cottage. Earlier, the Russian occupiers had arrested one of the men who lived here and his autistic son: the 49-year-old writer Volodymyr Vakulenko and 13-year-old Vitaliy, who had not spoken a word for weeks. Now, a couple of hours later, the pair were being returned to the home they shared with the author’s father, also called Volodymyr Vakulenko.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/22/a-murdered-writer-his-secret-diary-of-the-invasion-of-ukraine-and-the-war-crimes-investigator-determined-to-find-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He’s 19, lives at home with his mum and dad – and is a megastar thanks to Netflix’s take on the teen gay love story. The actor talks about accusations of ‘queerbaiting’, being outed at 18, and his pal Elton John</p><p>We are walking in Borough Market, Kit Connor and I. It’s his favourite area of London, he says, then worries that might sound like a dumb cliche. No, but it’s cool, he continues, speaking aloud these thoughts as he untangles them, even if it is a cliche. This is the bit of London he knows best in that it’s 30 minutes from Croydon, where he lives. Yes, with his mum and dad. He’s still only 19, after all, even if we’ve been watching him on screen since eight. He likes that Borough is near the South Bank, the National Theatre, the British Film Institute. He’s going through a retro phase with films, incidentally; an exploration of the history of the leading men in cinema. He has gone all the way back to Marlon Brando’s early work. Also, James Dean. He was recently <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/kit-connor-interview" title="">photographed for Vogue</a> in Breton stripes invoking the <a href="https://bamfstyle.com/2021/02/08/james-dean-breton-stripes/" title="">famous Dean shot</a> from the summer of 1955. He likes the brooding, the look. “I’m trying to do it a little bit,” he says. “What do you think?”</p><p>He turns to face me. He’s wearing a white T-shirt and battered Carhartt jacket, which he picked up in a vintage shop on a recent trip to New York. Yes, the hair has a touch of 50s, longish and swept back on top, cropped-ish on the sides. Come to think of it, that complexion does, too – milky, lightly freckled, slight ruddiness creeping up the cheeks. Although I can’t imagine him grimacing through the smoke of a dangling cigarette, or driving faster than the speed limit. Or throwing a punch in a state of existential rage. He’s just too sweet. Nor can I imagine hurting his feelings, so I say, “Yes, very brooding rebel.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/22/heartstoppers-kit-connor-i-wasnt-used-to-the-idea-of-millions-of-people-being-interested-in-my-private-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By marrying Japanese philosophy with cat psychology, Australian author Carla Francis learned to pause, slow down and reflect</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>Ryō, an Egyptian Mau, is languid in a shaft of sunlight on Carla Francis’s couch, head tucked towards front paws, silver spotted fur gleaming, low thrumming purr. This, you see, is the epitome of <em>seijaku</em>, a Japanese word describing the stillness, silence and serenity found amid life’s chaos or, if you’re dedicated to the practice of one form of mediation or another, in your mind. “All of us need <em>seijaku</em> in today’s world and I think we don’t find it,” says Francis.</p><p>Across the incense-fragrant living room of Francis’s inner-Sydney apartment, Backer, a street cat, a rescue, is delicately lapping from a water fountain. Backer eschews the Japanese concept of <em>bimbōshō</em> which translates as “miserly nature” but which more generally describes those who have a pessimistic outlook on life, a glass half-empty approach. For Backer, life is always deliciously half full. Fresh filtered water, a stream of sunshine, a bowl of tuna, a warm lap and a scratch behind the ear. What more could any creature possibly want? “What’s there to be negative about?” Francis says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/22/carla-francis-zen-of-cat-a-z-japanese-feline-philosophy-cats-psychology">Continue reading...</a>
