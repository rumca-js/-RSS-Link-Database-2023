I never thought it would happen to me but it did, I got tricked ðŸ˜³. I was working on a project in Visual Studio, which has the ability to download additional packages you can use from a repository called NuGet. And since I was within Visual Studio, I had my guard down, and didn't realize I downloaded a fake malicious package.  And the thing that saved me was some extreme security policies I had set up with a Windows feature called AppLocker, which blocks all executables and scripts by default, only allowing those with specific rules to do so. The malicious PowerShell script did indeed try to run, but it was not allowed because of AppLocker. So in the video I go over the details of what happened, how you can protect yourself without having to go full-paranoid like me, as well as taking a closer look at the malware.
