  <p id="eLC6b2"><em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> had a pair of surprise announcements at San Diego Comic-Con today. First, the show is stepping out of its weekly release schedule with a new episode tonight — a crossover with <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> will debut on Paramount Plus in a few minutes, at 7PM ET, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-lower-decks-crossover-debut-early-paramount-new-musical-episode-trailer-1235445717/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports. And that’s not all — the series is also getting a musical episode in early August called “Subspace Rhapsody.”</p>
<p id="csq4at"><em>Deadline</em> points out that this is the first musical episode in <em>Star Trek</em> history, and the publication isn’t wrong, but the franchise has boldly gone there before... sort of. There was a <em>Deep Space Nine </em>episode, called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fvideo%2FOnNs2BdfpJvqmIBmb8cws_xQW3z5zccK%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F7%2F22%2F23804339%2Fstar-trek-strange-new-worlds-is-getting-a-musical-episode" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Chrysalis,”</a> where a group of eccentric, genetically-engineered people break out into an a capella song after one...</p>

## A Google Workspace update makes alt text easier to add

  <p id="6PDMJ1">Adding alt text to an image in a Google Workspace project is <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/07/release-notes-07-21-2023.html">getting much easier</a> after an update included the accessibility improvement. Until recently, adding alt text to images was hidden behind a right-click menu. Now, the option will show up in the “Image options” sidebar — not only that, but the option now comes with an explanation for the feature, telling users what the purpose of alt text is.</p>
<p id="FpmMEi">Alt text is used in media and beyond to describe to people who have difficulty seeing what an image is showing, giving them access to important contextual information sighted people may take for granted. But where alt text is available in software, it’s sometimes not explained, and when people who can clearly see and read their screen are...</p>

  <p id="RYD40N">Three directors working on <em>Diablo IV </em>held a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1877944101">campfire chat livestream</a> yesterday saying they will change how they roll out patches, after an incremental <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800872/diablo-4-blizzard-season-malignant-11-patch-nerf-build-player-outcry">verison 1.1.0 patch</a> for the game abruptly nerfed players’ builds (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-admits-it-messed-up-with-diablo-4s-disastrous-nerf-patch-announces-upcoming-sweeping-changes"><em>IGN</em></a>). And they promise updates like that won’t happen in the future — at least, not the way it went down this week. </p>
<p id="uggyHx">In the livestream, associate director Joe Piepiora, game director Joe Shely, and community chief Adam Fletcher acknowledged complaints about the patch, which massively reduced player power for some builds. Fletcher said of the reduction that, “we know it is bad, we know it is not fun,” and added, “we don’t plan on doing a patch like this ever again.”</p>

## The Sony Project Q handheld is running Android in a leaked video

  <p id="lkcsD3">At least one of our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23737403/sony-playstation-portable-project-q-questions">questions about the Sony Project Q handheld</a> game-streaming device has seemingly been answered by a new leaked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23737403/sony-playstation-portable-project-q-questions">video posted by Zuby_Tech on Twitter</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1569y2o/project_q_factory_leaked_images/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sgvKTFk#DkmzRuD">Imgur</a>). In it, a basic version of Android OS running on a plastic-wrapped device shows a simple menu system and a QR code. It’s very doubtful this is what the final version of the handheld’s menu will look like, but it gives us an idea what’s running under the hood, at least.</p>
<p id="fiwLYu">The person making the video quickly taps through the menu, then starts rolling the handheld over to show the top, back, and bottom of it. The low resolution makes it hard to tell much. You can make out what look like a set of four buttons behind the tablet portion of the device on the...</p>

  <p id="WKMn7O">The team over at Capy Games has a real knack for inventive takes on seemingly simple puzzle games. I first realized this when playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/61730/Critter_Crunch/">the colorful <em>Critter Crunch</em></a> way back in 2009, and nowadays, I’m reminded of it whenever I squeeze in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178231/apple-arcade-iphone-ipad-best-games-2020">a few rounds of <em>Grindstone</em> on my phone</a>. Tucked away in between those two releases was <em>Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes</em> — which originally debuted on the Nintendo DS — an often overlooked game that might just be the most engrossing puzzle RPG I’ve ever played. Now it has a new lease on life with a rerelease for modern platforms.</p>
<p id="3f0BPI"><em>Clash of Heroes</em> is a match-three game, but in practice, it’s quite different from something like <em>Candy Crush</em> or even <em>Puzzle Quest</em>. Basically, the things you are matching are soldiers...</p>

  <p id="mQ1qpA">As your console game collection grows, you’re going to need more space to store it — and the internal storage inside your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X / S isn’t going to last forever. That may leave you in a situation where you’re regularly uninstalling and reinstalling games, juggling them around to fit the available space.</p>
<p id="tgM16j">You have options. The PlayStation 5 has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to">an internal slot for expanding the onboard storage</a> that’s pretty easy to access by popping off a couple of panels and turning a single screw. On the Xbox side, you can buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23750797/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card-price-release-date">storage expansion cards</a> that plug into a designated slot on the back of the console for a quick and easy (if often expensive) upgrade.</p>
