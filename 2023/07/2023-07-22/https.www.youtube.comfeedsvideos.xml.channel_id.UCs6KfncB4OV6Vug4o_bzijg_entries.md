Long ago I left Firefox in pursuit of testing out countless browser for my privacy and security journey. Here's my journey which demonstrates why browser wars are silly and what I suggest people do who are looking for the best privacy and security browser(s) for them. Browsers I considered (or used) were Firefox, Tor, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, Edge, Safari, ungoogled-chromium, Arc, and Mullvad Browser.
