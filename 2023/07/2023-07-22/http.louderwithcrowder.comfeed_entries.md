## Jamie Foxx breaks silence after a controversial health scare: "I didn't want you to see me like that"

The actor/comedian broke his silence on his Instagram page to know that he is fine, he is on the mend, and he is ready to get back to work.</p><p>Foxx didn't give specifics about what happened. Other than it was bad, and he's thankful to still be here.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>"I went through something I never thought I would go through. I know a lot of people were waiting or wanting to hear updates but to be honest with you, I didn't want you to see me like that man," says Foxx. "I didn't want you to see me with tubes running out of me and trying to figure out if I was going to make it through."</p><p>Foxx wanted to keep things quiet, which was when fans' imaginations started to run wild. <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/international/jamie-foxx-quashes-claims-of-covid-19-vaccine-causing-his-recent-health-scare-1226792.html" target="_blank">There were rumors he had an adverse effect to the SCHMOID shot</a>, that his family was quick to shoot down. The comedian also demonstrated that, no, he wasn't paralyzed or blind either. Demonstrated, of course, in his Jamie Foxx way.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p><br /></p><p>"I'm here on earth because of some great people. I'm here on Earth because of God, man. ... Thank u a billion to everybody… been a long road but all the prayers great people and God got me through."</p><p>Hopefully, now that he's back to work, one of his movies will be the long overdue release of "All-Star Weekend." It's filmed and gets huge audience reactions. However, it is "anti-woke" and studios are reluctant to put it out. Among other aspects of the movie (of two friends trying to make it to the NBA All-Star weekend), Robert Downey Jr. plays a Mexican. And you know how much <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ben-stiller-tropic-thunder" target="_blank">random losers hate it when Downey plays something other than a white guy</a>.</p><p>(Foxx plays a white, racist cop which I also think sounds hilarious)</p><p>A point Foxx brought up o<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jamie-foxx-all-star-weekend" target="_blank">n a 2017 episode of Joe Rogan's podcast</a> when the movie was still in development.</p><p>"I try to tell people, we never mean anything bad. We poke fun, but we don't mean anything bad. You can't kill us. I've gotta keep doing what I do. It's getting tougher."</p><p>It's great to see Foxx healthy, back to work, and most importantly... ALIVE!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Nothing to see here, other than Hunter Biden's lawyer ripping bong hits while hanging out Hunter

But if I'm I'm the lawyer of America's most infamous drug addict, I would not do drugs while he was hanging out in my house. Though I supposed in Hunter Biden's lawyer's defense, his client has proven to be above the law. And that clicking sound you hear are a thousand journalismers banging away on their keyboards creating "Republicans Seize on Hunter Biden's Lawyer Ripping Bong Hits" content.</p><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12325023/Hunter-Bidens-lawyer-Kevin-Morris-seen-smoking-BONG-balcony-LA-home-clearly-visible-road-visit-presidents-son.html" target="_blank">DailyMail obtained EXCLUSIVE photos</a> of Hunter Biden's lawyer Kevin Morris ripping bong hits Hunter came to chillax at the lawyer's Malibu home. This is the same lawyer who gave Hunter over $2 million to pay off his tax debts after the government his father is in charge of cut him a sweetheart deal.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bong" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a> defines "bong" as "a device used for smoking various substances, but most commonly marijuana." Daily Mail could not confirm the substance that appeared to be smoked out of said bong. Also, recreational marijuana use is legal in California. </p><p>But, you know, OPTICS! Hunter hanging out around drugs after the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-white-house-cocaine" target="_blank">White House cocaine "investigation"</a> is a bad look. Or, it WOULD be a bad look if the Bidens were held to any standards.</p><p>What's funny -- I guess, if funny is the right word -- is that these photos were taken on Thursday. That was the day after "Whistleblower X" testified before Congress that, as someone who worked on the Hunter Biden tax investigation, there were a lot of people in Joe Biden's government <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whistleblower-x-testimony" target="_blank">who didn't want anyone working on the Hunter Biden tax investigation</a>. You could understand why the lawyer may have needed to rip a few hits.</p><p>This was on Thursday. On FRIDAY, a confidential FBI source came forward to say <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/20/joe-biden-hunter-both-told-ukrainian-oligarch-burisma-board/" target="_blank">Joe and Hunter BOTH told the CEO of Burisma to retain the president’s son</a> at the Ukrainian energy company in a "pay to play" scheme.</p><p>Oh, and it turns out <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/jul/20/fbi-told-twitter-hunter-biden-laptop-was-real-soon/" target="_blank">the FBI knew that Hunter's laptop was real the entire time</a>. They even told Twitter, before Twitter started censoring any laptop news as "disinformation."</p><p>IF Hunter's lawyer was hitting the bong hard on Thursday (it could have been flavored tobacco, or maybe a weird-looking inhaler), it makes you wonder if he switched to harder stuff after Friday's news dump.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
