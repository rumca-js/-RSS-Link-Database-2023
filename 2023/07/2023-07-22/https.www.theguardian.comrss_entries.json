His book <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/assurances-9781787330856\">Assurances</a></em>, about the RAF\u2019s involvement in the cold war, won the 2018 Costa poetry award, while <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/jo-morgan-interference-pattern-review\">Interference Pattern</a></em> (2016) was described in the <em>TLS</em> as \u201ca poem that could come to be for the 21st century what <em>The Waste Land</em> was for the 20th\u201d. Morgan\u2019s latest book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/appliance-9781529115949\">Appliance</a></em>, is a short novel told in 11 discrete chapters over a period of about 70 years, charting the advance of a new technology, teleportation, that arrives first as a fridge-like contraption and becomes, with each new version, more powerful and pervasive. Among other things the title, which was shortlisted for the 2022 Orwell prize, articulates beautifully current human anxieties about unregulated artificial intelligence.

There\u2019s a psychological reason for it</p><p>This summer in the United States, millions of people have experienced the intense effects of the climate crisis. The \u201cheat dome\u201d that has gripped the south-west for the past three weeks is expanding into the south-eastern states. Catastrophic flooding in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/flash-flooding-pennsylvania-deaths-c0b3fc0c9c3e40b4cd33c8dc0ad50c14\">north-east has claimed lives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/15/1187978006/northwest-flooding-ruins-crops-dealing-blow-to-farmers-livelihoods\">wiped out farmers\u2019 crops</a>. And the worst wildfire season in Canadian history has not only caused <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-we-lost-so-much-worst-wildfire-season-in-canadian-history-wreaking-havoc-on-indigenous-communities\">tens of thousands of Indigenous people</a> to be displaced, but the accompanying smoke has also billowed over into the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/smoke-maps-canada-fires.html\">north-eastern and midwest</a> US, setting records for poor air quality. In many cases, these events have caused irreparable damage and trauma to those directly affected, and can certainly feel like they\u2019re encroaching on those people on the periphery. And yet despite the fact that we\u2019re living through a climate disaster, most Americans aren\u2019t cowering in fear every day about the future of our planet. There\u2019s a psychological reason for that.</p><p>For one, the climate crisis is a much <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/18/for-earth-day-key-facts-about-americans-views-of-climate-change-and-renewable-energy/\">lower priority</a> for Americans than other national issues, such as the economy and healthcare costs. That isn\u2019t to say that we aren\u2019t concerned: two-thirds of Americans say they are at least \u201csomewhat worried\u201d about global warming, while 30% are \u201cvery worried\u201d, per <a href=\"https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-beliefs-attitudes-spring-2023/toc/2/\">a Yale University survey</a>. But because of the nature of the way that many humans experience fear, connecting this emotion to something as vast and complex as the climate crisis is difficult. According to Brian Lickel, a social psychologist who researches human responses to threats, we aren\u2019t designed to remain in a high state of fear for long. \u201cA very fundamental feature of the normal kind of expected emotional processing is hedonic adaptation,\u201d he said. \u201cOur emotion system is designed to be labile, to go up or have certain responses, but then to not stick there.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/22/climate-crisis-fear-psychology\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/22/climate-crisis-fear-psychology", "date_published": "2023-07-22T13:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018No more cover-up\u2019: Nazi concentration camp on UK soil finally to be officially investigated", "description": "<p>Review could show that thousands more Jews and prisoners of war died on  Channel Island Alderney than previously thought</p><p>The full horrors of the only Nazi concentration camps to exist on British soil will finally be investigated in an official government inquiry, the <em>Observer</em> can reveal.

Also, James Dean. He was recently <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/kit-connor-interview\" title=\"\">photographed for Vogue</a> in Breton stripes invoking the <a href=\"https://bamfstyle.com/2021/02/08/james-dean-breton-stripes/\" title=\"\">famous Dean shot</a> from the summer of 1955. He likes the brooding, the look. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do it a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He turns to face me. He\u2019s wearing a white T-shirt and battered Carhartt jacket, which he picked up in a vintage shop on a recent trip to New York. Yes, the hair has a touch of 50s, longish and swept back on top, cropped-ish on the sides. Come to think of it, that complexion does, too \u2013 milky, lightly freckled, slight ruddiness creeping up the cheeks. Although I can\u2019t imagine him grimacing through the smoke of a dangling cigarette, or driving faster than the speed limit. Or throwing a punch in a state of existential rage. He\u2019s just too sweet. Nor can I imagine hurting his feelings, so I say, \u201cYes, very brooding rebel.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/22/heartstoppers-kit-connor-i-wasnt-used-to-the-idea-of-millions-of-people-being-interested-in-my-private-life\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/22/heartstoppers-kit-connor-i-wasnt-used-to-the-idea-of-millions-of-people-being-interested-in-my-private-life", "date_published": "2023-07-22T06:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Looted artifacts found in Met trustee\u2019s home were bought \u2018in good faith\u2019", "description": "<p>Shelby White, collector and benefactor of the prestigious New York art museum, did not knowingly buy stolen antiquities, lawyer says</p><p>A major collector of antiquities and benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art took a reputational hit this week as efforts by the Manhattan district attorney to return looted artifacts to their countries of origin moved into high gear.</p><p>Shelby White is a Met trustee whose name, with that of her late husband, Leon Levy, hangs over the spectacular <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/greek-and-roman-art\">Greek and Roman Art</a> galleries at the museum on Fifth Avenue.
