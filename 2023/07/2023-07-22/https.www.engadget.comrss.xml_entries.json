It would see Tawny Newsome (Mariner) and Jack Quaid (Boimler) taking their until-now animated characters into live action. Following an early screening at Comic-Con, the episode is now available to watch on Paramount Plus.</p><p><em>The following article contains spoilers for \u201cThose Old Scientists.\u201d</em></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There\u2019s an <em>SNL</em> sketch where William Shatner, as himself, exhorts a room full of Star Trek fans to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqb4V9GxaBo\"><ins>Get a Life!</ins></a>\u201d It\u2019s clearly intended in jest, given Shatner\u2019s barely-suppressed smile and a twist where Phil Hartman\u2019s manager forces him to instantly recant his rant. Depending on who you ask, the sketch was either taken in the <a href=\"https://trekmovie.com/2021/09/06/william-shatner-defends-1986-get-a-life-snl-skit-after-criticism-from-rod-roddenberry/\"><ins>spirit</ins></a> it was intended, or with <a href=\"https://fanlore.org/wiki/Get_a_Life!_(skit)#Fan_Response\"><ins>outrage</ins></a> amongst fans who felt mischaracterized, and misunderstood. But it\u2019s this dichotomy, between the legend and the truth that\u2019s mined for laughs in \u201cThose Old Scientists,\u201d the crossover episode between <em>Strange New Worlds</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em>. Well, that and an affectionate elbow in the ribs suggesting that we could all do with being a bit less obsessive.</p><p>The (animated) beta shift is making a routine survey of a long-dormant time-travel portal, while Boimler and Tendi argue about who discovered it. Boimler brags it was found by Starfleet, but Tendi says it was Orion scientists, once again trying to dispel myths that all Orions are pirates. While messing around Boimler is standing on the portal when Rutherford accidentally sets it running, throwing him back in time. When he arrives on the other side, he\u2019s now in the live action world of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, and is greeted by Spock, Una and La\u2019an. And with that, we\u2019re into an animated version of the title sequence, complete with nacelle-sucking alien.</p><p>On the Enterprise, Boimler can\u2019t help but express his shock, surprise and generally fanboy out in front of his heroes. He gets lectured by La\u2019an about not polluting the timeline and, thanks to her adventure in \u201cTomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow,\u201d not getting attached. But, since this is the Boimler we know and love, he can\u2019t help but throw spoilers out left, right and center. Not to mention his insistence on pointing out the difference between the history as he knows it, and the storylines as they\u2019re presently unfolding on <em>Strange New Worlds</em>. For instance, he\u2019s mightily disturbed by the fact that Spock \u2013 happy in a relationship with Chapel \u2013 is laughing, smiling and generally acting like he\u2019s in love. After all, the Spock he knows \u2013 <em>his</em> Spock \u2013 isn\u2019t this outwardly emotional, because that\u2019s what the legend tells us. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s a stand-in for the sort of obsessive fan who tries to police the borders of what Star Trek is, instead of enjoying the journey.</p><p>At the same time, the Enterprise has to deal with an Orion vessel with undetermined intentions which then steals the time portal. Boimler urges Pike to be diplomatic, but winds up forcing him to trade a supply of much-needed triticale grain to get it back. Pike sees this \u2013 and the forced relocation of a planet-full of starving colonists \u2013 as preferable to having this guy on his ship any longer. When the portal is active and back in position, the Enterprise crew ready to get rid of this purple-haired irritation, Mariner leaps through, bravely declaring that she\u2019s coming to the rescue. Except, the hardware had power enough for just one trip, and there\u2019s not a fuel source available anywhere else in the quadrant. Leaving an eye-rolling Pike with the unwelcome possibility that they\u2019re stuck with the Cerritos\u2019 pair for good.</p><p>Boimler and Mariner wind up spending some time with their heroes, until they eventually realize that the Enterprise itself has a supply of fuel. Thanks to the naval tradition of using a component from the previous vessel in the construction of the next one, they can refine a chunk of NX-01 into fuel which can be used to send the pair home. (But not before the <em>Strange New Worlds</em> crew can reveal that they, too, are secretly as nerdy as a bunch of fans of their predecessors from <em>Enterprise</em> as Boimler is for this era.) They meet with the Orions again, and Pike pledges to claim that the Orions discovered the portal, giving their burgeoning science ship a small chunk of credit. And when Boimler and Mariner leap back to the future, the Enterprise crew drink an Orion cocktail that, in the closer, renders them all as animated characters.</p><p>\u201cThose Old Scientists\u201d is as pure a dose of fan service as Star Trek has ever produced, and I mean that as both a compliment and a criticism. Plenty of the elements, including the animated title sequence, reached straight into the lizard part of my brain and left me grinning like a loon. The screenplay, credited to <em>Lower Decks</em>\u2019 executive story editor Kathryn Lyn and Bill Wolkloff, is crammed full of great gags. It helps, too, that <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has enough comic talent in its ranks to play an episode like this, and Carol Kane steals the show with the best gag in the episode.</p><p>But, and there is a but, the episode is a bit like cotton candy in that once the initial hit of sugar leaves your tongue, there\u2019s little else here. We get a lot of scenes of Boimler and then Mariner telling the Enterprise crew how great they are, or are seen as such, by their successors. Most of these scenes take place sitting around desks, bars or lounges \u2013 telling rather than showing. I know that this is <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, and so the narrative will always belong with this crew rather than its guest stars. But the lower deckers are rendered passive observers in a narrative that could, or should, really have enabled them to demonstrate the dynamism they have in their own show. In the moment where Boimler and Mariner try to solve things on their own, they\u2019re instantly shut down by La\u2019an and Uhura and told to sit back on the bench. The worst served by this is Tawny Newsome, who is absent a major chunk of the episode and has little to do when Mariner does finally arrive in the past.</p><p>That cotton candy metaphor is probably the best way to sum up \u201cThose Old Scientists,\u201d a goofy snack <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-empathy-in-memory-130048301.html\"><ins>between meatier meals</ins></a>, or episodes, either side. The fact it exists at all is a joy, even if it\u2019s not as wonderful as it could have been, and I\u2019d love nothing more than to see more forays into the real world by the<em> Lower Decks</em> crew. At the very least, with <em>Strange New Worlds</em> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-3-episode-10-the-stars-at-night-review-150041363.html\"><em><ins>Lower Decks</ins></em></a> in production at the same time, it\u2019s a great time to be a Star Trek fan.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-drops-its-lower-decks-crossover-early-230033262.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-drops-its-lower-decks-crossover-early-230033262.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-22T23:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Oppenheimer' review: Sympathy for the destroyer of worlds", "description": "<p>At one point Christopher Nolan's <em>Oppenheimer</em>, the father of the atomic bomb dons his iconic uniform \u2014 a fedora cap, a smoking pipe, a slightly over-sized suit \u2014 like Batman wearing his cape and cowl for the first time. It's a look that serves as a sort of armor against mere mortals, who he woos with a peculiar charisma, as well as the military and political bureaucracy he battles while leading the Manhattan Project. It's also a way for Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) to ground himself as he wrestles with the major conflict around his work: Building an atomic bomb could help to the war, but at what cost to humanity?</p><p><em>Oppenheimer</em> may seem like a curious project for Nolan: Since wrapping up his Batman trilogy with <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, he's thrown himself into increasingly complex projects (perhaps to atone for that disappointment). <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-11-interstellar-review.html\"><em>Interstellar</em></a> was ostensibly a story about a man exploring the cosmos to find a new planet for humanity, but it also wrestled with personal sacrifices as his children aged beyond him.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Christopher Nolan's \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3b57f500-2832-11ee-b14f-b02ca6ff83a5\" style=\"height: 1666px; width: 2500px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Universal Pictures</div></figure><p><em>Dunkirk </em>was a purely cinematic, almost dialog-free depiction of a famous wartime evacuation. And <em>Tenet</em> was a bold attempt at mixing another heady sci-fi concept (what if you could go backwards through time?!) with bombastic James Bond-esque set pieces. <em>Oppenheimer</em>, meanwhile, is a mostly talky film set in a variety of meeting rooms, save for one explosive sequence.</p><p>Take a step back, though, and a film about an intelligent and very capable man wrestling with huge moral issues is very much in the Nolan wheelhouse. Oppenheimer's<em>&nbsp;</em>swaggering genius fits right alongside Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman, the dedicated magicians in <em>The Prestige</em> or the expert dream divers/super spies in <em>Inception</em>.</p><p>The film, which is based on the biography <em>American Prometheus</em> by Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird, follows Oppenheimer from his time in Germany as a doctoral student, to his professorship at UC Berkeley. He mingles with notable scientists, including Albert Einstein himself, and makes a name for himself as a quantum physics researcher. We see Oppenheimer as more than just a bookish geek: He sends money to anti-fascists fighting in the Spanish Civil War, he pushes for unionization among lab workers and professors, and he supports local Communists. (Something that will come back to haunt him later.)</p><p>It's not too long before he's recruited to the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb, and the myth-making truly begins. Like a Nolan heist film, he assembles a team of the brightest scientific minds in America and beyond, and he pushes the government to establish a town doubling as a secret research base in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The film is strongest when it focuses on the specificities of the Manhattan Project: the rush to build a bomb before Nazi Germany, the pushback from scientists terrified about the damage &quot;the gadget&quot; could do.</p><figure><img alt=\"Christopher Nolan's \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3b58b850-2832-11ee-ba7f-674c9d1a42bf\" style=\"height: 1748px; width: 2500px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Universal Pictures</div></figure><p>The movie firmly focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view, so much so that we mainly see him as a heroic tortured genius. Only <em>he</em> can put the right scientists together and motivate them to work; only <em>he</em> can solve the riddles of quantum physics to keep America safe. Some colleagues criticize his cavalier attitude about building an atomic bomb \u2014 they think it can lead to untold disaster, while he naively thinks it may be so powerful it may end all war. But, for the most part, we're left feeling that he was a great man who was ultimately betrayed by a country that didn't care for his post-war anti-nuclear activism.</p><p>I wasn't able to see <em>Oppenheimer </em>on an IMAX screen, unfortunately, but sitting front row in a local theater still managed to be a thoroughly immersive experience. That was particularly surp\u2014rising since it's really a movie featuring people (mostly men) talking to each other in a series of unremarkable rooms. Save for one virtuoso set piece \u2014 the build-up and aftermath of a successful atomic bomb test is Nolan at his best \u2014 what's most impressive is how cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema makes those conversations utterly engaging. We've never seen Cillian Murphy's piercing blue eyes do so much work in close-up.</p><figure><img alt=\"Christopher Nolan's \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/3b58df60-2832-11ee-bffe-1e98bff52d9f\" style=\"height: 1748px; width: 2499px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Universal Pictures</div></figure><p>Still, it's an overall disjointed experience. The few featured women \u2014 Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Florence Pugh as the Communist activist Jean Tatlock \u2014 are sketched thin, even by Nolan standards. And the movie would have benefitted from more insight into Oppenheimer's thinking. It's a surprisingly standard biopic, even though it's three hours long and far more technical than any studio film this year.</p><p>At the very least, it would have been interesting to see Oppenheimer reckon more directly with the aftermath of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We see him confront President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) in a vain attempt to stop building nuclear weapons, and the film points to his very public stance against future bombs. But even those scenes feel self-serving.</p><p>At the end of the film, Oppenheimer finally comes to understand something many of his colleagues have been saying from the beginning. Nothing will be the same because of him. There is no peace now, only the undying specter of nuclear annihilation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oppenheimer-review-sympathy-for-the-destroyer-of-worlds-130052032.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/oppenheimer-review-sympathy-for-the-destroyer-of-worlds-130052032.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-22T17:00:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "ExpressVPN review: Our favorite for gaming and streaming", "description": "<p>ExpressVPN has become a household name \u2013 or at least as close to one as a VPN is likely to get \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-influencer-selling-vpns-security-problems-153046206.html\">taking over mainstream advertisements on sites like YouTube</a>.

But, notably, it wasn\u2019t the overall best, falling short on areas like security and user friendliness.</p><p></p><p>There are three main VPN use cases on top of general security: geoblocking, streaming and gaming. That means my tests looked like watching <em>Shrek</em> on the clock, by using a VPN to access Canadian Netflix from my US-based home office, where the ogre movie isn\u2019t currently available.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>ExpressVPN was easy to sign up for, download and use, but compared to the other services, it didn't wow me. Competitors like ProtonVPN, for example, had easier ways to sign in across platforms. But an ExpressVPN subscription does come with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html\">password manager</a> to store and autofill credentials across websites. That\u2019s a plus in a world where complex passwords are crucial to keeping your accounts secure.</p><p>The best VPNs stay out of your way and you'll barely even notice they\u2019re running. But one oddity was that ExpressVPN internet speeds outperformed our baseline internet speed measures. The service is likely circumventing traffic shaping by the internet service provider or a similar anomaly because every other VPN will hurt internet speed in some way. But it did successfully mask the IP address, and pass the DNS and WebRTC leak tests as privacy measures.</p><figure><img alt=\"The ExpressVPN app includes a power button to connect to the VPN and recommended locations to get started\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/a7057800-27c8-11ee-bff3-e06eff9b66e0\" style=\"height: 946px; width: 1200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">ExpressVPN</div></figure><p>It was also easy to access geo-blocked content using ExpressVPN, with little-to-no buffering. There were some loading delays that only lasted a few seconds when I tried to stream the news on YouTube using ExpressVPN, but no lag came up after that. Finally, ExpressVPN passed the gaming test by avoiding lag and maintaining a normal loading time. Although, it was a pretty basic test where I logged into online game Slither.io from a UK-based VPN to play the worm-eating competition with international users. Surfing the web with ExpressVPN was just as easy as being online without it. With ExpressVPN, a ping test measured how long data takes to travel from the computer to the server and back at 100 milliseconds, versus 16 milliseconds with no VPN turned on.</p><p>ExpressVPN\u2019s biggest perk is that it supports up to five devices at once. That means I could conduct all tests simultaneously and still had no slowdown. That\u2019s great for sharing it with a family, or folks that like to game, watch TV and scroll on their phone at the same time.

That\u2019s a win for security transparency. Still, a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/vpn-services/mullvad-ivpn-mozilla-vpn-top-consumer-reports-vpn-testing-a9588707317/\">2021 Consumer Reports study</a> found that ExpressVPN didn\u2019t support multifactor authentication, did not meet brute force mitigation checks and retained some data even after an account was terminated. ExpressVPN did, however, exceed industry standards in protections against unauthorized access, implement a vulnerability disclosure program and said it would not pursue legal action against security researchers. That means when it comes to security standards and practices, ExpressVPN as a company has a few too many misses and not enough hits.</p><p>I recommended ExpressVPN as our top choice for gamers, frequent travelers and heavy users of streaming services because it lets users access a wide range of locations from a variety of devices with high speed connections and no lag. With options to configure directly to routers and gaming consoles, it\u2019s a solid choice for people that put a lot of strain on their ISPs.

Now, Twitter user Keith Dahlenburg has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kdahlenburg/status/1682094746842591232\">posted</a> a screenshot (via <a href=\"https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/1525/tesla-announces-ability-to-transfer-fsd-must-take-delivery-in-q3-full-list-of-requirements\"><em>Not A Tesla App</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23802957/tesla-fsd-transfer-offer-q2\"><em>The Verge</em></a>) of the offer, along with its rules and conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most pertinent condition is that owners can only take advantage of this one-time amnesty if they take delivery of a new Tesla vehicle between July 20th and September 30th, 2023. It can't be applied retroactively, so those who've taken delivery before and after those dates unfortunately have to pay for access again. And FSD doesn't come cheap \u2014 Tesla <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-price-increasing-15000-september-5-153606255.html\">raised its price</a> to $15,000 last year. That's an enormous price jump for early adopters who were able to snag the feature for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-tesla-full-self-driving-price-increase.html\">$5,000 years ago</a>. Now, they can get a new model without having to pay for the feature again.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Owners who choose to take the transfer offer will have to forfeit the capability in their current vehicle. Tesla will remove FSD from their old EV up to a week before their scheduled delivery date, and they can't get it back even if they cancel their purchase for a new car. That said, Tesla also doesn't guarantee delivery by the time the promo is over, so owners could still miss the offer if their deliveries unfortunately get delayed.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"3e1687f21e3c4cf991938f044302d628\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"qme\"><a href=\"https://t.co/gEL60R5YuR\">pic.twitter.com/gEL60R5YuR</a></p>\u2014 Keith Dahlenburg \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Kdahlenburg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kdahlenburg/status/1682094746842591232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-offers-customers-one-time-full-self-driving-transfer-until-september-30th-150004266.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tesla-offers-customers-one-time-full-self-driving-transfer-until-september-30th-150004266.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-22T15:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter is limiting the number of DMs unverified users can send", "description": "<p>Twitter has again made its platform a little less usable for people who choose not to pay for a Blue subscription.

With the feature switched on, the chatbot remembers who the user is across conversations, which the company says can streamline queries. The feature was designed to work across the platform, meaning paying Android users who opt in will likely see continuous memory in their app when it comes out.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"3c30dfc5b5d04344a2cb2180b5da2dd4\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Announcing ChatGPT for Android!
