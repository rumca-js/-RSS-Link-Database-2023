Around Christmas 2021 I put together a big air purifier on top of </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/built-in-shelves">our
bookcase</a>.  Somehow I didn't blog about it or take a picture, but
here's it in the background of a birthday:



<p>

</p>

<p>

The basic idea was that I didn't have a good place to put a filter
cube, commercial air purifiers were scarce, and a different
configuration of filters seemed like it could work well.  It's a box
fan with eleven filters: five along the side, five along the top, and
one at the end.  It glows because I built a regular light bulb into
it, though without any means of replacing the bulb when it died (which
it eventually did).

<p>

The design relies on a good seal with the wall, but when I initially
set it up I was worried about peeling the paint off so I used masking
tape there.  Which eventually pulled away:

</p>

<p>

Which means it's probably been doing about nothing for a while.  I
considered fixing it, but there were other issues with the design: the
box fan was pretty loud on "high" and the fan didn't point a sensible
direction.  And at this point commercial purifiers are much more
widely available.  So I ordered three <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LSC9HLS">AP-1518R</a> purifiers,
which are very similar to (and filter-compatible with!) the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01728NLRG">AP-1512HH</a> we already
had, and replaced the big purifier:

</p>

<p>

I've laid the purifiers on their backs, so the fresh air circulates
towards people's heads and I can reach the controls from the ground.
I'm not sure whether this is a good idea&#8212;the internal squirrel
cage fan would have been engineered expecting loads from a different
direction, and this might not be good for it?  Any guesses?

</p>

<p>

I <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/evaluating-a-corsi-rosenthal-filter-cube">previously
tested</a> one of these against a filter cube and estimated a CADR of
219 CFM on high, 90% of what that filter cube gave on high.  When the
big purifier was new and sealed properly it was probably in this range
or a bit worse: having nearly 3x the filters as a standard filter cube
should have given less restriction on the airflow, but there's
probably highly diminishing returns and the position of the outflow
was bad. If I run the three new purifiers on medium they're far
quieter than the big purifier while giving more clean air than it did
before it started leaking.  And I have the option to run them on high
if the room is very crowded, where they're about the same volume as
the big purifier while delivering about 3x the clean air.
