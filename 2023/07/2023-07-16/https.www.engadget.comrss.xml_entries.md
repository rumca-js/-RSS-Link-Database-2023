<p>When Instagram <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html"><ins>launched Threads on July 5th</ins></a>, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://twitter.com/finkd/status/1676747594460962817?s=20">took to Twitter</a> for the first time in 11 years. The tweet, which did not include any text, saw Zuckerberg reference the Spider-Man pointing meme to take a jab at Elon Musk. It turns out the use of that meme was more apt than the Facebook founder could have imagined.</p><p>As highlighted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/15/threads-a-slack-alternative-completely-unrelated-to-instagram-has-seen-downloads-surge/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, the release of Instagram’s Threads translated into a boon for another app of the same name. Threads, a Slack alternative that has been around since 2019, saw more than 880,000 downloads on iOS between July 6th and July 12th, according to an estimate <a href="https://www.data.ai/en/"><ins>Data.ai</ins></a> shared with the outlet. Where previously it had “few downloads” before that period, Threads became the 52nd most downloaded App Store program globally. In a handful of European Union countries, including Germany, Spain and Italy, it even managed to crack the top 10. That might have something to do with the fact Instagram’s Threads isn’t available in the EU, and Meta has since started blocking people who try to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-blocks-eu-users-from-accessing-threads-through-a-vpn-135306350.html"><ins>access the service through a VPN</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="93828957645e4486b3c2cd6b2e3c9568"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/r6DpBbRWh8">pic.twitter.com/r6DpBbRWh8</a></p>— threads (@Threads) <a href="https://twitter.com/Threads/status/1677385807144058880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>In addition, owing to the fact it owns threads.com, Threads (the Slack alternative) has enjoyed a “significant” increase in traffic to its website. In fact, the company has since added a badge to its frontpage that declares it’s “not associated with Instagram.” Over on Twitter, you’ll find a similar disclaimer. “We have no affiliation with Meta. But you’re welcome to stick around!” the company’s profile states.</p><p>Of course, Meta and Threads aren’t the first companies to employ the same branding. As <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, there are more than a few companies called Lightyear, including a <a href="https://lightyear.one/"><ins>solar electric vehicle startup</ins></a>, an <a href="https://www.lightyear.co/explore-courses"><ins>online course platform</ins></a> and two separate <a href="https://www.lightyear.cloud/"><ins>fintech firms</ins></a>. Still, it’s funny a coincidence when you consider Threads, the workplace chat app, was co-founded by Rousseau Kazi, a former Facebook product manager. Oh, and Meta used to operate an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-threads-shutdown-december-2021-214523820.html"><ins>Instagram companion app</ins></a> also confusingly named Threads. I suppose there’s no originality left in Silicon Valley.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-sent-another-app-named-threads-to-the-top-of-the-app-store-charts-214007131.html?src=rss

## Russia bans state officials from using Apple devices over US spying concerns

<p>Russian authorities have begun to ban government employees from using Apple devices for official state use, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6567e7f2-c5fb-4da4-bd95-bf7ceef54038"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>. As of Monday, the country’s trade ministry will prohibit the use of iPhones for all “work purposes.” Other agencies, including Russia’s telecommunications and mass media ministry, either have similar mandates already in place or plan to begin enforcing ones soon. The <em>Times</em> reports the ban covers all Apple products. In some cases, however, officials can continue using those devices for personal use, provided they don’t open work correspondence on them.</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-apple-pay-google-pay-224811327.html"><ins>cut off access to Apple Pay</ins></a>. It later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-russia-online-store-sales-halt-ukraine-invasion-210748226.html"><ins>halted all product sales in Russia</ins></a>. At the time, Apple made clear the decision was in response to the invasion, noting it stood “with all of the people” hurt by the incursion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ban comes after Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed at the start of June that it had uncovered a “spying operation by US intelligence agencies” involving Apple devices. The FSB said thousands of iPhones, including those in use by the country’s diplomatic missions in NATO countries, had been “infected” with monitoring software. The FSB went on to claim — without showing evidence — that Apple had worked closely with US signal intelligence to provide agents “with a wide range of control tools.” The tech giant denied those allegations, stating it had “never worked with any government to build a backdoor into any Apple product, and never will.”</p><p>More broadly, the move is reflective of a desire by Russia’s government to lessen its dependence on foreign-made technology. As <em>The Times </em>notes, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last year ordering institutions involved in “critical information infrastructure” to migrate to domestically developed software by 2025.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/russia-bans-state-officials-from-using-apple-devices-over-us-spying-concerns-183732151.html?src=rss

<p>The first batch of Apple’s M3-equipped Macs could arrive as early October, according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman. Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-16/apple-creates-new-vision-products-group-vpg-for-future-mixed-reality-headsets-lk5g2ee4?sref=10lNAhZ9"><ins>Power On newsletter</ins></a>, Gurman reports there “should be another launch” after the company’s annual iPhone event in September, with a new slate of Macs likely the focus of whatever Apple has planned. “October is too early for new high-end MacBook Pros or desktops, so the first beneficiaries of the new chip should be the next iMac, 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro,” he notes.</p><p>At the start of March, Gurman <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-could-release-an-m3-powered-imac-as-early-as-the-second-half-of-2023-175959648.html"><ins>reported</ins></a> that Apple was at “a late stage” of development on two new iMac models that would feature its next-generation M3 silicon. The new chipset likely won’t feature many more CPU and GPU cores than Apple’s current M2 SoCs, but it is expected to offer significant performance and power efficiency gains thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-and-apple-expected-to-debut-3-nm-processors-next-year-100632556.html"><ins>TSMC’s 3nm process</ins></a>. At the time, Gurman predicted the new iMac could arrive as early as the second half of 2023, and that it would feature the same colorful design of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html"><ins>2021 model</ins></a>.

However, he notes Apple is working on a new iPad Air with refreshed internals. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html"><ins>current model</ins></a> features the company’s aging M1 chipset.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-m3-macs-could-arrive-in-october-163204526.html?src=rss

<p>The Apollo 11 moon landing was a seminal event in American history, one etched deeply into our nation's collective psyche. The event ushered in an era of unbridled possibilities — the stars were finally coming into reach — and its effects were felt across the culture, from art and fashion to politics and culture. In <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BZnRlci1BcG9sbG8tQ3VsdHVyYWwtTGVnYWNpZXMtUmFjZS9kcC8xNjgzNDAzNTc2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFwcS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTM4ZDA0ZDQtOTk0OS00MDI5LThmMjQtYjdkODRkZmEyZjUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVEMDf-OMXUwUlLFd0pNT0S4z-EGDKOxkNFjqeEU7aLD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAfter-Apollo-Cultural-Legacies-Race%2Fdp%2F1683403576"><em>After Apollo: Cultural Legacies of the Race to the Moon</em></a>, a multidisciplinary collection of historians, researchers and academics explore the myriad ways that putting a man on the moon impacted the American Experience.</p><figure><img alt="the moon landing but the spacesuit is pink" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/df8472c0-2288-11ee-8bea-eeca2f4157bf" style="height: 1200px; width: 1800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">University of Florida Press</div></figure><p>Excerpted from “Scientists Without Borders: Immigrants in NASA and the Apollo Program” by Rosanna Perotti from <a href="https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9781683403579"><em>After Apollo: Cultural Legacies of the Race to the Moon</em></a>, edited by J Bret Bennington and Rodney F.

Reprinted with permission of the University of Florida Press.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr /><h2>Space Travel and the Immigrant Experience</h2><p>From NASA’s very beginnings, immigrant engineers, scientists, and technicians lent their talent, labor, and technical skills to the space program. But space travel itself always represented more than a scientific endeavor. Human spaceflight was one of the “great dreams” of the 1960s, as space historian Valerie Neal reminds us, and as a “big idea,” spaceflight relied heavily on American cultural narratives. The Apollo program (1963–1972) conjured the image of pioneering the frontier in the 1960s—exploration and discovery were indispensable to America’s history and continuing redefinition, and Americans welcomed the frontier as a metaphor for space exploration (Neal 15). The shuttle program (1972–2011) echoed the narrative of Americans “going to work.” As the Apollo missions were replaced by the space shuttle, NASA supporters and commentators depicted the shuttle crews with imagery associated with blue-collar labor: “astronaut repairmen made service calls in a vehicle often called a space truck."</p><p>Both of these narratives — “pioneering the frontier” and “getting the job done” — are closely associated with a third narrative that was becoming deeply ingrained in American national identity in the 1960s: the myth of the United States as a nation of immigrants and of the immigrant as the backbone of America’s egalitarian democracy. This American immigrant myth was not born in the nineteenth or even in the early twentieth century, when immigration was peaking and Congress struggled to impose limitations and quotas. The myth reached wide acceptance only in the early 1960s. It is no coincidence that John F. Kennedy presented the immigrant myth most succinctly in his pamphlet, A Nation of Immigrants, in 1963, as Kennedy was preparing to ask Congress to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws. At the same time, his administration was pressing furiously to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, a central goal of the New Frontier. Interestingly, Kennedy’s space proposals were a far more important policy priority for the administration than immigration reform (the latter was not accomplished until 1965, as we shall see later). But his articulation of the “nation of immigrants” narrative provided powerful imagery in support of the space program he championed from the start of his administration.</p><p>Kennedy’s articulation of the complex immigration myth featured not just a welcoming America, but an idealized immigrant, united with others by little other than a common love of freedom. Ours was “a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers, people eager to build lives for themselves in a spacious society that did not restrict their freedom of choice and action." Citing Tocqueville, Kennedy noted that immigrants’ very poverty made them more inclined toward egalitarian democracy. No arena of American life was untouched by the influence of immigrants, and immigrants themselves were paragons of self-reliance, ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and pioneer spirit. “It was the future and not the past to which he was compelled to address himself,” Kennedy wrote, describing the motivations of the nineteenth-century immigrant.</p><blockquote><p>Except for the Negro slave, he could go anywhere and do anything his talents permitted. A sprawling continent lay before him, and he had only to weld it together by canals, by railroads and by roads . . . This has been the foundation of American inventiveness and ingenuity, of the multiplicity of new enterprises, and of the success in achieving the highest standard of living anywhere in the world.</p></blockquote><p>The space program was the next frontier in the natural progression toward excellence. It evoked not only the immigrant’s capacity for adventure and discovery but also his practicality and capacity to work hard and tame his surroundings. From the time of the English settlers, who “fought a rugged land” in the words of Kennedy, immigrants had to overcome adversity to earn their fortunes and shape their environment. They had worked as artisans, provided cheap labor for American farms, factories, mills, and mines, and climbed the economic ladder to provide succeeding generations with educational opportunities. They had moved forward to get the job done. Launched under the motto “Going to Work in Space,” the space shuttle was a vehicle that could deliver satellites and repair them in orbit, carry commercial payloads, and support a research laboratory. Astronauts would carry out their work all but rolling up their sleeves as builders and repair technicians, wielding robotic arms and power hand tools. Businesses could use the shuttle as a workhorse to launch satellites or develop manufacturing capabilities. All of this economic productivity in space could be expected to resonate with a nation whose increasingly diverse immigrant workforce was transitioning to a new economy. American society was reflected not only symbolically but practically in NASA’s missions. They produced results that appeared almost impossibly ambitious. NASA represented excellence: the best work in the world. Space travel also mirrored some of the risks and hardships of the immigrant experience. As the American public began questioning the nation’s investment in space travel through the 1980s, advocates harked back to this part of the immigrant narrative. In the aftermath of the 1986 Challenger tragedy, the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Future of the US Space Program (1990) reminded Americans that acceptance and resilience in the face of failure were a part of America’s pioneer and immigrant legacies:</p><blockquote><p>In a very real sense, the space program is analogous to the exploration and settlement of the new world. In this view, risk and sacrifice are seen to be constant features of the American experience. There is a national heritage of risk-taking handed down from early explorers, immigrants, settlers, and adventurers. It is this element of our national character that is the wellspring of the U.S. space program.</p></blockquote>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-how-nasa-helped-jfk-build-his-nation-of-immigrants-143027063.html?src=rss

## Microsoft and Sony agree to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation

<p>Following a bitter, months-long feud over the company's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sony have signed a deal to keep the Call of Duty franchise on PlayStation consoles. &quot;We are pleased to announce that Microsoft and PlayStation have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard,&quot; Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1680578783718383616?s=20">tweeted Sunday morning</a>. &quot;We look forward to a future where players globally have more choice to play their favorite games.&quot;&nbsp;</p><div id="7fee4c82073c45338c426275f1b008da"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are pleased to announce that Microsoft and <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlayStation</a> have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to grant the regulator an emergency stay of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-activision-acquisition-moves-ahead-as-judge-rejects-ftc-injunction-request-152845890.html">ruling</a> that allows the deal to proceed in the US. The United Kingdom's Markets and Competition Authority (CMA) is the last remaining regulator of note opposed to the purchase, but the watchdog and Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-uk-regulators-agree-to-pause-legal-fight-to-negotiate-activision-acquisition-165856989.html">recently agreed</a> to put their legal battle over the deal on hold and negotiate a compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spencer did not disclose the terms of Microsoft's deal with Sony, including, most notably, the length of the agreement. At the end of last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-playstation-call-of-duty-ftc-172017050.html">offered Sony a 10-year deal</a> to keep Call of Duty on current and future PlayStation consoles, an olive branch the Japanese electronics giant shot down. In an effort to secure approval from regulators, including the FTC and CMA, Microsoft went on to sign an agreement with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html">Nintendo</a> to bring the series to the company's future consoles. It also came to terms with cloud gaming providers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-putting-xbox-games-on-geforce-now-in-an-attempt-to-win-over-regulators-184818183.html">NVIDIA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before today, Jim Ryan, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, made clear he was strongly opposed to Microsoft's Activision bid. “I don’t want a new Call of Duty deal. I just want to block your merger,” Ryan<a href="https://twitter.com/lulumeservey/status/1633573899400093699?s=20"> told</a> Activision CEO Bobby Kotick. “I told him [Bobby Kotick] that I thought the transaction was anti-competitive, I hoped that the regulators would do their job and block it,” Ryan later said during his testimony at the <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> hearing. But with the purchase all but set to move forward, Sony likely had no choice but to come to terms with its rival.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-sony-agree-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation-142246583.html?src=rss
