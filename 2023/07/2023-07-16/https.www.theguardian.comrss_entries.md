<p>This documentary about pioneering US fighters in the 70s tells its tale brilliantly. The interviewees are so explosively charismatic that the show could last 20 hours and not run out of energy</p><p>Unless you wanted to do it topless in some businessman’s apartment, the opportunities for female boxers in the early 1970s were limited at best. Sky’s new documentary, Right to Fight, written and directed by Georgina Cammalleri – and drawing on the research and archive of the former boxer Sue “Tiger Lilly” Fox – is the story of the women who changed the sport.</p><p>It is not a tale that has been told before. Fox has spent years painstakingly gathering scraps of evidence to form a coherent whole – since male historians of the sport have concentrated entirely on preserving the male record of what is perhaps the sport most dominated by men. Right to Fight tells it brilliantly, helped by the fact that every one of its subjects bursts with the kind of energy and charisma that is a gift to the camera. They have backstories, anecdotes and attitude that could fill a programme 10 times as long without it flagging for a moment.</p><p>Right to Fight aired on Sky Documentaries and is available on Now TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/16/right-to-fight-review-the-hatred-these-female-boxers-faced-is-breathtakingly-awful">Continue reading...</a>

## World on Fire series two review – this epic second world war drama is totally gripping

<p>This hugely ambitious attempt to show the war through the lives of ordinary people has an immaculate grasp of tension and character. To watch is to be fully invested in these peoples’ fate</p><p>World on Fire was supposed to return a little sooner than it did, but the pandemic meant that its second series has arrived four years after the first. The idea that real-world events might intrude on its storytelling is apt, given that much of this sweeping, epic war drama is concerned with how conflict affects everyday life, and how adaptable people can, and must, be when everything is turned upside down.</p><p>Writer and creator Peter Bowker (Blackpool, The A Word) has moved the action forward just slightly to 1941, and translator Harry Chase is temporarily back at home in Cheshire, having brought his new wife, Kasia (Zofia Wichlacz), back from Poland with him. Lesley Manville continues to play Harry’s waspish mother Robina with a hint of the Maggie Smith/Dowager Countess to her; her compassion is not entirely absent, but it is buried deeply in the weeds of propriety and blunt proclamations about the state of things. “I doubt that the Germans are interested in Cheshire,” she says, drily, as bombs rain down on Manchester. She claims to be unafraid of strong emotion: “I just disapprove of it.”</p><p>World on Fire aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/16/world-on-fire-series-two-review-this-epic-second-world-war-drama-is-totally-gripping">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In her collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg, Birkin left a permanent mark on pop – and her underrated solo albums of dark, strange songs are ripe for rediscovery</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-actor-and-singer-dies-aged-76">Jane Birkin, actor and singer, dies aged 76</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-a-life-in-pictures">Jane Birkin: a life in pictures</a></li></ul><p>Serge Gainsbourg frequently had what you might charitably describe as complicated relationships with his female collaborators. There always seemed to be a problem: a joke or a satire on Gainsbourg’s part to which they weren’t entirely party, a level of controversy that Gainsbourg was willing to provoke but they were not. There was the 18-year-old France Gall, who he duped into singing a song that was evidently – to all but the innocent Gall herself – about oral sex, causing her to temporarily retreat from public life in mortification, and furnished with a succession of other songs that appeared to be viciously mocking their singer as she sang them (the Eurovision-winning Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son, depicted her as a hopelessly naive puppet, whose fans didn’t have a clue what they were doing). There was Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a passionate affair, who first recorded the scandalous duet Je T’Aime … Moi Non Plus, then refused to allow it to be released, fearful of precisely how scandalous it was going to be. There was his daughter Charlotte, whom he corralled into recording a duet called Lemon Incest, then cast in a film, Charlotte for Ever, in which he played her father, reducing her to tears on the set during a scene in which he undressed her. And there was Vanessa Paradis, their working relationship so fraught that Gainsbourg took to calling her Vanessa L’Enfer.</p><p>But that never happened with Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. They were a couple for 12 years: their working partnership outlived their separation in 1980, lasting until Gainsbourg’s death in 1991. The standard line is to call her his muse on account of the songs he wrote for her – Jane B, Ma Chérie Jane, La Fille aux Claquettes, Ballade de Johnny-Jane, Lost Song, Dépressive – or the songs she inspired: Birkin performed the role of, and was clearly the model for, the titular heroine in Gainsbourg’s masterpiece, the 1971 concept album Histoire de Melody Nelson. But the word “muse” implies a certain passivity that sells Birkin hopelessly short: she felt far more like Gainsbourg’s co-conspirator. It was Birkin who modelled Gainsbourg’s iconic latterday image. There seemed to be nothing he could come up with that she would baulk at. Singing the song that Bardot had refused to release, and riding out the resultant scandal, which grew far bigger than even Bardot had feared, encompassing not just radio bans, but condemnation from the Vatican. Demonstrating La Décadanse, Gainsbourg’s attempt at instituting a dance craze that involved the male lead grasping his female partner’s breasts. Being photographed naked and chained to a radiator for Lui magazine, complete with accompanying text by Gainsbourg describing her as his “little hermaphrodite”. Starring in the 1976 film that shared Je T’Aime … Moi Non Plus’ title, which explored the doomed relationship between a boyish girl and a homosexual trucker, involved a great deal of anal sex, and effectively scuppered Birkin’s acting career for the next couple of years. Singing the astonishing Vie Mort et Résurrection d’un Amour Passion, a 1978 song that seemed to lay their crumbling relationship bare in the starkest terms imaginable: “We are fucked … I told you ‘kill me, kill me if you’re a man’, but you’re just a mug, because you never could.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-music-career-je-taime-moi-non-plus-serge-gainsbourg">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The South American country is running dry. But it can draw upon a history of social and political organisation to protect access </p><p>Almost two decades ago, Uruguay led the way as the world’s first country to enshrine the <a href="https://www.tni.org/files/wateruruguayrev.pdf" title="">right to clean water</a> in its constitution.

For months they have been eking out tap water supplies by adding brackish estuary water, telling pregnant women and people with serious health conditions not to drink it. Authorities have cut taxes on bottled water and are distributing it for free to the estimated one in seven people for whom it is unaffordable. Others are turning to wells.</p><p>The main culprit is the worst drought in more than 70 years. Though Uruguay is <a href="https://www.guruguay.com/uruguay-water-crisis/" title="">naturally rich in water</a>, rainfall is highly variable due to the impact of <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html" title="">La Niña and El Niño</a> weather patterns.

Actor who appeared as the cold, calculating cabinet secretary Sir Arnold Robinson in the TV satire Yes Minister<p>John Nettleton, who has died aged 94, was a prolific character actor for more than half a century. He was admired for the dozens of classical supporting roles he took on stage, but he gained his greatest recognition on screen. His comic flair was best exploited as the cold, calculating Sir Arnold Robinson in the TV sitcom Yes Minister (1980-84), set in the corridors of Whitehall.</p><p>Although his presence and resonant voice invested authority in the characters he played, Nettleton was shy and totally unstarry. He described himself as a “workman” actor, adding: “I’ve got a pipe-smoking image.

But the question was: how? Clubbing was one thing. We were avid for that, and went dancing in town twice a week in our cliff-top shoulder pads and scratchy white shoes. The bigger drama was the matter of what to do first. No longer would the pub do: that slow eking out of our Cinzano and lemonades, the better that we might not conk out too early later (alas, I usually did conk out too early).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/its-not-just-the-food-we-missed-three-writers-remember-beloved-restaurants-that-closed-down">Continue reading...</a>

## Camera ready: how Agnès Varda turned her photographs into film

<p>Before she picked up a film camera, the revered director was a photographer. The seeds of her groundbreaking cinema lie in her earliest still images, says her daughter, Rosalie</p><p>Agnès Varda, at least in her later years, didn’t make a big deal about being taken seriously. For decades, the film-maker and artist was much respected as the pioneering feminist voice in French cinema and as the “godmother of the <em>Nouvelle Vague</em>” – New Wave – her work beating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeanlucgodard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/francoistruffaut">François Truffaut </a>et al to the big screen by several years. But she was also somewhat sidelined, eclipsed by her male peers, and it took until this century for her to be truly revered: last year, her 1962 classic <em>Cléo </em><em>from 5 to 7</em> was ranked No 14 in the <em><a href="https://bfidatadigipres.github.io/sight%20and%20sound%20greatest%20films%20of%20all%20time%202022%3Cbr%3E14=/2023/03/05/cleo-from-5-to-7/">Sight &amp; Sound</a></em> greatest films poll.</p><p>But by the time she had begun to be deified, Varda was prone to sending herself up. She would appear on her film posters and DVD boxes in cartoon form as a quizzical, rotund Mrs Pepperpot figure; she even appeared at the Venice Biennale dressed as a potato. The latter guise, she once said, was because she loved the circus as a child. “I thought I should do something to get attention.”</p><p>Nude, Paris, 1954.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/16/camera-ready-how-agnes-varda-turned-her-photographs-into-film">Continue reading...</a>

## We live in an anxious world. So why am I so happy? | Rhymer Rigby

<p>Unhappiness calls to unhappiness everywhere, but if your outlook is cheerful, nobody’s interested. Admittedly, this is a good problem to have</p><p>Recently, I was chatting to a friend. She was a bit down and I was trying to cheer her up, being my usual sunny self when, suddenly, she gave me an odd look and said: “You’re never really unhappy, are you, Rhymer?” I had a moment of clarity. She was right. But when I told her this, she responded with bewilderment. Surely nobody can be happy all the time? That’s weird. OK, I conceded, of course I experience occasional frustration, grumpiness and disappointment, but they are fleeting feelings and usually connected to discrete events. Prolonged periods of unhappiness or anxiety? Nope.</p><p>If happiness is a scale of one to 10, I am invariably between a six and an eight. Perhaps the odd, brief dip to four when something genuinely sad happens. But my default resting state is an untroubled 7.5. There is no apparent reason for this. I am lucky enough to live a pretty nice life, but I am not insulated from stress and anxiety. To take an obvious example, my mortgage is about to increase by 50% and I’m certainly not independently wealthy. What’s more, I know plenty of people who are better off than me – and their happiness seems to be normally distributed. There are plenty of unhappy rich people. My sunny disposition seems innate, like being 6ft 2in, which, sadly, I’m not. My wife, who does worry about things and wishes I worried a bit more, has occasionally said that I would probably be exactly the same if I had twice as much money or half as much money.</p><p>Rhymer Rigby is a freelance journalist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/we-live-in-an-anxious-world-so-why-am-i-so-happy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Various venues, Liverpool</strong><br />At the 12th Liverpool Biennial, bold works from Isa do Rosário, Binta Diaw, Torkwase Dyson and more focus on colonialism and the slave trade. But the aim is to spiritually awaken rather than shock</p><p>The bloody legacy of the transatlantic slave trade looms large over Liverpool, which was the slave-trading capital of Britain by 1740. Many of the works featured in the 12th edition of the <a href="https://www.biennial.com/" title="">Liverpool Biennial</a>, mostly by Black, Asian and Indigenous artists, appear to be haunted by the city’s dark past. Take Brazilian artist <a href="https://www.biennial.com/artists/isa-do-rosario/" title="">Isa do Rosário</a>’s bright blue textile work <em>Dance with Death on the Atlantic Sea</em>. The long fabric, suspended from the ceiling, features patches of sketch-like paintings. The visceral brushstrokes evoke a sense of frenzy and close inspection reveals that the black dots and pieces of fabric represent Black people who lost their lives during the slave trade.</p><p>The title and theme of the 12th edition is uMoya: The Sacred Return of Lost Things. The word uMoya in the isiZulu language means spirit, breath, air, climate and wind. Independent Cape Town-based curator <a href="https://www.biennial.com/artists/khanyisile-mbongwa/" title="">Khanyisile Mbongwa</a> has set out to create “a call for ancestral and indigenous forms of knowledge, wisdom and healing”. She headed South Africa’s Stellenbosch Triennale in 2020 and previously worked as a curator for performative practices at the Norval Foundation. Liverpool Biennial director Sam Lackey said Mbongwa’s appointment was down to her “longstanding curatorial concerns around care and repair”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/16/liverpool-biennial-2023-review-khanyisile-mbongwa-horror-and-healing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England midfielder on waves, sunrises and the training game in the run-up to the Women’s World Cup that is amusing the squad</p><p>Ella Toone breaks into a big grin. “No idea, but I absolutely love it,” she says in her thick Lancashire accent. The 23-year-old midfielder has been asked the name of the game England have been playing in training at the Sunshine Coast Stadium. “Four teams, one big ball in the middle and you’ve just got to whack the ball with your football, and it can’t go over to your side basically,” she says. Hilarity ensues when Sarina Wiegman sweeps up the ball, which is almost as big as she is, at the end of the game and comically runs, or waddles, to the side of the pitch with it.</p><p>“This is the first time we’ve played it in Australia and it definitely brings up a lot of laughs,” Toone says. “It’s a fun game to get us going and start the session with.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/16/ella-toone-england-womens-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

The tragic death of her son at 18 changed everything for Luella Bartley. Here, the celebrated designer reveals how art is showing her a way to live<p>Morning light pours into Luella Bartley’s studio on the first floor of her Bloomsbury townhouse. Palms are visible from the garden below and a tower of art books sits in front of the stone fireplace. There’s a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/10/kae-tempest-this-line-is-a-curve-album-review" title="">Kae Tempest</a> poetry collection on the wooden work table, alongside jars of paint brushes and scattered black and white photographic cut-outs of disembodied limbs of varying proportions and naked, headless female bodies marked by lines of red ink. There is scant art on the walls – most of the former fashion designer’s paintings and monochromatic photographs are now on display in her new exhibition.</p><p>The studio was once the children’s playroom, but they hardly used it. Since then there has been great loss in the family, and today Luella and her two younger children, Stevie, 18, and Ned, 16, are drawn to the small room and to the togetherness and talismanic creativity it affords.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/16/now-i-am-a-braver-person-luella-bartley-death-son-intimate-spaces">Continue reading...</a>

He’s always tired. He’s grumpy! He spends all day Sunday sleeping. He stinks when he comes home! Look at his hands!’” The chef himself was more philosophical, bowing to the inevitable. “Cooking is what we Rouxs do.””</p><p>The proof of that particular millefeuille is <a href="https://www.caractererestaurant.com/" title="">Caractère</a>, the smart Notting Hill restaurant in a former corner boozer in which he and I are having lunch.

Emily is too busy at work on her perfect desserts to come out and chat with her dad, but a couple of times she forwards pictures of his grandson, eating birthday cake at nursery, from her phone.

<p>Rishi Sunak used just-go-for-it route in Covid crisis but Treasury and Bank of England now play with straightest of bats</p><p>The England cricket team are winning friends and admirers after adopting a style of play known as Bazball. Named after the side’s coach, Brendon (Baz) McCullum, it is an aggressive, carefree approach to the game in which risks are taken with both bat and ball. It doesn’t always come off but win or lose, it has made the England team a lot more fun to watch.</p><p>Rishi Sunak is a cricket fan and in his early days as Boris Johnson’s chancellor was a strong advocate of an economic form of Bazball. This was early 2020 and, in truth, the Treasury and the Bank of England had no choice but to throw caution to the wind because a global pandemic was raging. Sunak borrowed more than any other peacetime chancellor so that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak">furloughed workers</a> still received wages.

<p>An uncomplicated, comforting pleasure that harks back to childhood – post-Covid, it’s no surprise that ice-cream parlours are coming in from the cold</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/10-great-places-to-eat-ice-cream">OFM’s pick of the licks – 10 places for great ice-cream</a></li></ul><p>One lunchtime, a few weeks into the first lockdown of 2020, a customer came into <a href="https://www.caliendos.co.uk/" title="">Caliendo’s Gelato</a> in London’s Kentish Town, bubbling with excitement. “I asked her how long she’d been waiting,” says Michelina Caliendo-Sear who, with her partner, Fiona Bell, had opened the ice-cream parlour in December of 2019. “She said over half an hour. I went to the back door and looked out.” Customers were queueing right round the corner and far up the sidestreet. They were clearly prepared to wait a very long time indeed for scoops of blackcurrant and liquorice or fig and walnut and, most of all, for the famed Bronte pistachio, made with prestige nuts harvested from the very foothills of Mount Etna. “We were their treat at the end of their lockdown walk. That was when I knew the business was going to be OK,” Caliendo-Sear says.</p><p>In May, Caliendo’s was named the first ice-cream parlour of the year, in a competition run by the Ice Cream Alliance, which represents hundreds of parlours and producers. “We are honoured and proud to have won,” Caliendo-Sear says, “especially among such stiff competition.” She’s not wrong. The fact is that ice-cream – a broad term that can cover everything from hard scoop to gelato, soft serve to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/sep/03/how-to-make-perfect-kulfi" title="">kulfi</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/25/tougher-and-chewier-australia-is-being-treated-to-a-new-world-of-ice-cream" title="">dondurma</a> to sorbet, frozen yoghurt and so much more – is having a moment. You could say that right now, ice-cream is hot. In 2022, the value of the UK sector rose by 6% to £1.7bn. While tough trading conditions recently have taken their toll, before the pandemic the number of dedicated ice-cream parlours was rising by 20% a year. Nearly two-thirds of all ice-cream manufacturers operating today have been incorporated only since 2015.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/it-feels-sinless-jay-rayner-britain-ice-cream-business-booming">Continue reading...</a>

Made by the Italian-French partnership of <a href="https://www.bekalemoine.com/project.php">Ila Bêka and Louise Lemoine</a>, it focuses on a 20-year-old <a href="https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/projects/165-rehab-clinic-for-neurorehabilitation-and-paraplegiology/">rehabilitation centre</a> for people disabled by accident or illness, designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron on a site in Basel. It features patients telling their stories and battling to regain their physical capabilities, and a closeup of a slug crossing a path. The building itself, a beautiful and calming environment of wood and sunlight and views of nature, stays in the background.</p><p>The previous and first room doesn’t show much by way of graspable architectural projects either. It is dominated by timber-framed vitrines stacked with the models, mockups and samples of materials with which Herzog &amp; de Meuron investigate their designs. It’s like an alchemist’s laboratory, a cabinet of curiosities, a promiscuous but measured pile-up of shapes and substances. Multiple versions of a concert hall or a stadium or a skyscraper, in wood or cardboard or coloured plastic foam, jostle with models of a house at the same size, or fragments of molten-looking glass or refined copper, or a concrete panel imprinted with the image of a giant beetle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/16/herzog-and-de-meuron-royal-academy-london-review-inscrutable-show-puts-life-before-architecture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A puma narrates this humorous experimental novel about humanity’s relationship with animals and nature</p><p>Over the past few years, non-human narrators have cropped up repeatedly in experimental fiction. There was the slowly decaying protagonist of Emma Glass’s <em>Peach</em> and, most recently, in Maddie Mortimer’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/maps-of-our-spectacular-bodies-9781529069389">Maps of Our Spectacular Bodies</a></em>, the villainous voice of cancer spreading through a woman’s body, charting its journey with exquisite, sometimes menacing, lyricism.</p><p>In Virginia-born Henry Hoke’s fifth book, <em>Open Throat</em>, Los Angeles’ much-adored mountain lion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/20/p-22-mountain-lion-los-angeles-death-reaction">P-22</a> (so-called because it was the 22nd puma in a national park service study) gets this literary treatment. “I’ve never eaten a person but today I might,” begins the big cat’s account of the comings and goings in Griffith Park in the Hollywood Hills, where the late P-22 roamed. The person to prompt this change of dietary preference (described as “the man with the whip”) is first encountered dressed as a cowboy, engaged in some kind of illicit sexual activity. He only appears on three occasions in the novel, but unwittingly becomes the feline’s long-running nemesis, a symbol of everything wrong with humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/open-throat-by-henry-hoke-review-inside-the-mind-of-a-lion-king">Continue reading...</a>

Glossy, rich and fleeting, apricots always make summer special<p>The wait for lunchtime feels endless. I take a white loaf, carve off a thick slice and toast it until its crusty edges have singed. I spread it with thick white ricotta straight from the tub, then prise a ripe apricot in two, flick out the stone, cut the fruit into thick wedges and lay them on top of the ricotta. Depending on what is to hand, I will then grind over the faintest amount of black pepper or a few crushed pistachios. The hot, chewy toast, velvety curd and sweet-sour fruit will keep me going until lunch is ready.</p><p>Apricots are at their best for such a short time in the summer that I tend to feast on them whenever I can, tucking into their soft, fluffy skin and almost jelly-like flesh at every chance. They can, of course, disappoint, and in truth that is often the case. The trick is to take matters into your own hands, ripening the fruit at home. Buy them unrefrigerated (chilling seems to sound the death knell for this fruit), then ripen them on a sunny windowsill or simply on a dish in the kitchen. They may take a day or two to become lusciously ripe, but I am convinced the wait is worth it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/nigel-slater-recipes-raspberry-and-apricot-shortcake-apricot-and-harissa-chutney">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Harold Pinter theatre; Young Vic; Barbican; Hampstead theatre, London</strong><br />Mark Rylance mesmerises as the tormented Hungarian doctor; Kwame Kwei-Armah’s new satire is all too timely; Kyle Ramar Freeman is irresistible; and Will Young compels</p><p>It was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/18/mark-rylance-questions-readers-famous-fans-dr-semmelweis-jerusalem-dont-look-up">Mark Rylance</a> who elected to bring <strong><a href="https://drsemmelweistheplay.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwb6lBhBJEiwAbuVUStMELtWRL1CKtzUC9vvnigUSHmlVXSMUV6Ih2_2o7yTApYdP_yPtnRoCM0sQAvD_BwE">Dr Semmelweis</a></strong> on to the stage with the help of writer Stephen Brown and director Tom Morris. The collaboration began during the pandemic when handwashing was in the headlines – appropriately, in that Semmelweis’s discovery, in 1847, was that he could save women dying of puerperal fever in childbirth, on the wards of Vienna’s general hospital, by getting doctors to wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution. More challenging was persuading a conservative, high-handed Viennese medical profession to listen to the findings of a loose cannon of a Hungarian doctor with poor communication skills. This show had a sellout run in Bristol last year and has now been repurposed in a magnificently polished new draft for the West End.</p><p>Designer Ti Green’s hospital is a gilded period piece – as poised as the medical knowledge of the period was unsteady, with not an antiseptic surface in sight. But it is for Rylance’s character study of the doctor that this show is a must-see (the medical history is of interest too). Rylance’s Semmelweis is a stiff, formally tormented soul with a little black moustache. In his quieter moments, he looks like one of those 19th-century photographs in which sitters are obliged to keep their faces still lest movement wreck everything. He has an uncanny ability to convey distress through his body, almost without moving: the inward becoming outward.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/16/dr-semmelweis-harold-pinter-theatre-west-end-mark-rylance-tom-morris-review-beneatha-s-place-young-vic-kwame-kwei-armah-a-strange-loop-barbican-song-from-far-away-will-young">Continue reading...</a>

## A food revolution: campaigners in Liège want all the region’s produce to be grown locally. Can they do it?

<p>In the Belgian city, a group of tireless activists have one life-changing aim: to ensure most of their food is local and organic. What can we learn?</p><p>This is not a Hollywood story: it’s a Belgian story, for a start. It’s not even certain to end well; that’s a bit up in the air right now. But it’s a story about how things – important things – could be different. How they could, perhaps, be better. It’s a story about Liège, a city whose 19th-century heyday as a coal and steel powerhouse is long gone. Like many ex-coal and steel towns, Liège is poor, with increasing numbers of households living in poverty, but it also has a strong solidarity culture, a diverse population – and the best waffles.</p><p>So far, so Belgian. But why are we talking about Liège? Because in 2013, a group of activists who wanted to make food and city life better, greener and fairer, brought 600 people – all with an interest in food production – together. It asked them to imagine what could be different in Liège, within one generation. It’s an interesting question, the fundamental one really: what change can we concretely effect within our lifetimes? What they arrived at was this: “That in 35 years, one generation, the majority of food consumed in the Liège region would be grown locally in the best ecological and social conditions.” That’s a nice, if wordy, aspiration. But the thing is, they’ve tried to make it happen and even – to a degree – have succeeded.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/the-good-life-in-liege-the-start-of-a-food-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The BBC presenter scandal was absolutely not the main story last week</p><p>It’s Thursday morning. Boris Johnson, who made a former KGB agent’s son a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/31/evgeny-lebedev-jo-johnson-and-ian-botham-among-36-peerage-nominations-boris">lord</a> and attended sexy parties at his fairytale hacienda, has failed to hand over his mobile phone to the Covid inquiry as some secret spies said there might be all stuff on it. Johnson has also spaffed out another child, this time in wedlock, but the announcement of the birth was delayed by a week, which has inadvertently helped to detract from his ducking and diving and lying, like when he got that jack russell cross that we never see any more. The baby, Frank Alfred Odysseus Red Herring Picaninny Bum Boys Letterbox Johnson, also fulfils the same function as when Johnson started talking about how he liked to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax">model buses</a> out of crates, in 2019, to game malleable search-engine algorithms away from his Brexit bus lies. As with so many of Johnson’s promises, we are yet to see any evidence of his ability to fashion a single model bus from crates. Perhaps he broke them all throwing them at Dilyn the dog. And trying to father a child every time he abuses the rules isn’t a long-term strategy, even for a man as profligate as the former prime minister.</p><p>It’s Thursday morning. Yesterday, at prime minister’s questions, the MP for Newark, Robert Jenrick, doubled down on his decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/07/robert-jenrick-has-cartoon-murals-painted-over-at-childrens-asylum-centre">paint over</a> welcoming murals of Mickey Mouse in a processing centre for unaccompanied migrant minors on the grounds that many of them were teenagers, so the images weren’t “age appropriate”. Perhaps the teenage refugees would have related better to a mural of Mickey Mouse wanking into a crusty sock? Or deciding that vinyl is actually cool. Or being a massive miserable pain in the arse for six years. In contrast to Jenrick’s hastily concocted excuse, the minister for migration and borders, Lord Murray of Blidworth, told former child refugee, and top Jamaican sound system operator, Lord Dubs that the initial decision to paint the murals was a mistake by some cowboy contractors. Perhaps they were supposed to write “Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here” in the Conservatives’ blue Franklin Gothic font over a painting of the two-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi dead on a beach near Bodrum in 2015.</p><p><em>Basic Lee</em>’s tour dates are <a href="https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates/">here</a>.

From Austria to Italy, Sweden to Spain, the far right is gaining ground. But ultimately, people want security and fairness, not regressive policies<p>Nigel Farage imagines he is a true Brit, the man who said what the establishment prohibited and so allowed Britain to shed noxious European influence. In truth, he is a true European, member of a fast-growing insurgent pan-European right, surfing the same anti-immigrant, anti-liberal, anti-democratic constitution tides as politicians of his ilk are doing across the EU. Almost every European country now has a Faragist making the political weather – with one key difference. None wants to repeat Britain’s disastrous experience and leave the EU. Unintentionally, Farage has done the European cause one great service.</p><p>Yet, as Spain’s Vox, with its roots in Franco’s fascism, hopes for success in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/will-spains-snap-election-usher-in-the-far-right-or-can-pedro-sanchez-gamble-pay-off" title="">imminent elections</a>, echoing what Giorgia Meloni, with her Brothers of Italy’s comparable roots in Mussolini’s fascism, achieved last year by becoming prime minister, mainstream European politics quivers. Liberals and the left are in retreat before parties that celebrate the primacy of family and faith, oppose same-sex marriage, want a crackdown on immigration and multiculturalism, do not believe in climate change, critique all things woke, and, above all, believe their nation is more special than any other. Parties in almost every country in Europe repeat the refrain, climb in the polls and are either in national or regional government (Finland, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Poland, Italy, Hungary) or soon could be (Germany, France, Holland, Spain).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/europe-surging-rightwards-but-populist-tide-start-to-ebb">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This uncompromising novel, an acerbic takedown of awards, celebrity and success, is a challenging but rewarding read</p><p>What even is this? It’s a daring, uncompromising, bonkers serious-scape of the kind that rarely gets the limelight in the UK’s contemporary literary field. Why? Because it’s subversive, off the wall and, frankly, challenging to the status quo of what literature is and does. For all these reasons, I’m glad of it.</p><p>Corey Fah is a writer who’s been awarded a prize for “the fictionalisation of social evils”, but the prize turns out to be a strange, UFO-like trophy that Fah repeatedly tries and fails to collect. Bambi Pavok, a time-travelling deer with eight legs and a spider’s “drinking-straw mouthpart”, appears on the scene. A madcap adventure unfolds in which Fah befriends Pavok (sort of) and with Drew – Corey’s partner – they become embroiled in a reality TV show about wormholes, hosted by Sean Saint Orton (an unrecognised writer whose story makes reference to the life of English playwright Joe Orton). The finale takes place in a football stadium/pop-up TV studio, where the characters travel in a time loop, trying to work out how to stop the mayhem. By the end of the novel, social mobility as we know it – awards, celebrity and “success” – has been roundly debunked.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/corey-fah-does-social-mobility-review-isabel-waidner-playfully-surreal-dark-fable">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Any victim is a liar’: sexual violence scandals in Italy expose deep-seated sexism

<p>Two high-profile cases underscore how sexual harassment and rape are downplayed, as women are disparaged</p><p>The news in Italy this week has been dominated by two sexual violence scandals. In one, the son of the speaker of the senate, the street-fighting politician Ignazio La Russa, is under investigation for rape. In another, a 66-year-old school caretaker who, from behind, inserted his hands inside the underwear of a 17-year-old student from Rome, was absolved because the assault only lasted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/fury-italy-school-caretaker-cleared-groping-assault-lasted-seconds" title="">“between five and 10 seconds”</a>.</p><p>Both cases have revealed that Italy is incapable of taking the subject seriously. After it emerged that a 22-year-old woman had denounced his son, La Russa stated that she had taken cocaine before going to Milan’s Apophis club in May. The newspaper <em>Libero</em> then revealed the alleged victim’s prescription drugs. The insinuation was that if she remembered nothing between being offered a drink in the club and waking up in La Russa’s bed (at which point she was informed she had also had sex with someone else), it was her own fault.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/16/any-victim-is-a-liar-sexual-violence-scandals-in-italy-expose-deep-seated-sexism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last year, all of literature’s big prizes went to small publishers. In a risk‑averse climate, edgy debuts and ‘tricky-to-sell’ foreign titles have found a home at the likes of Fitzcarraldo Editions and Sort Of Books – and the gamble has paid off</p><p>A quiet revolution is afoot in British publishing. Earlier this year, when <em>American Psycho</em> author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/14/bret-easton-ellis-james-and-the-giant-peach-changed-my-life-the-shards">Bret Easton Ellis </a>brought out his latest bestseller, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/08/the-shards-bret-easton-ellis-review-metafiction-1980s-los-angeles">The Shards</a></em>, the book came to UK readers not from his usual publisher, Picador – his home for nearly four decades – but from a small independent company, <a href="https://swiftpress.com/">Swift Press</a>, a freelance-powered outfit so light on overheads it doesn’t even have an office. Likewise, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/12/sheila-heti-books-by-women-still-get-treated-differently-from-those-by-men">Sheila Heti</a>, the prize-winning Canadian author of zeitgeisty autobiographical cogitations <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/08/motherhood-sheila-heti-an-excellent-choice-panic-joy-emma-brockes-review">Motherhood</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/11/sheila-heti-how-should-person-be">How Should </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/11/sheila-heti-how-should-person-be">a Person Be?</a></em>, recently announced that her next book won’t be out with her regular publisher, Penguin Random House, but with south London indie <a href="https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/">Fitzcarraldo Editions</a>, not yet 10 years in business. Last year’s Booker winner, Sri Lankan writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/08/shehan-karunatilaka-seven-moons-of-maali-almeida-theres-a-sri-lankan-gallows-humour-weve-been-through-a-lot-of-catastrophes">Shehan Karunatilaka</a>, came to us courtesy of the smallest publisher ever to win the prize, husband-and-wife indie <a href="https://sortof.co.uk/">Sort Of Books</a>. In 2022, all the glittering literary prizes went to indies – not only the Booker, but its sister prize for translated fiction, the International Booker, as well as the Nobel, the Goldsmiths, the Pulitzer and Australia’s A$100,000 (£80,000) Victorian prize for literature. The last four remarkably were all won by Fitzcarraldo, the UK home of celebrated French memoirist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/21/annie-ernaux-french-writer-nobel-prize-literature">Annie Ernaux</a> and foremost among a wave of new small publishers punching above their weight. What’s going on?</p><p>“The thing about the publishing world is that most people don’t understand how it works,” says Valerie Brandes, chief executive of black-owned London indie <a href="https://jacarandabooks.co.uk/">Jacaranda Books</a>. “Even people in publishing don’t understand how it works! But I’d make so bold as to say the real publishing is happening at the bottom.” It’s a view that is increasingly widespread in the industry. The argument runs something like this: because commercial pressures at large houses encourage cautious commissioning (see the way every breakthrough success, be it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/28/sally-rooney-hell-of-fame-normal-people">Sally Rooney </a>or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/04/richard-osman-no-ones-born-a-writer-i-write-because-i-read-it">Richard Osman</a>, heralds an attack of the clones), nimbler indies – operating with tighter margins – step into the void and give choice-starved readers the books that corporate imprints deem unsaleable or otherwise risky. Whether these are from veteran authors left on the scrapheap (according to Ellis, Picador didn’t want <em>The Shards</em>), boundary-pushing first-timers such as Sheena Patel (author of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/29/im-a-fan-by-sheena-patel-review-fizzing-debut-about-a-sociopathic-narcissist">I’m </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/29/im-a-fan-by-sheena-patel-review-fizzing-debut-about-a-sociopathic-narcissist">a Fan,</a></em> recently the winner of a British Book award) or foreign greats deemed tricky to sell (witness Fitzcarraldo’s wonder trio of overseas Nobel laureates, Ernaux, Svetlana Alexievich and Olga Tokarczuk), all are finding homes with upstart maverick publishers that – as their prize success indicates – are reaping the spoils.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/uk-indie-publishing-mavericks-shook-up-books-booker-nobel-fitzcarraldo-sort-of-books-daunt">Continue reading...</a>

## Let’s be clear about why the Tories are so keen to exploit the travails of the BBC | Andrew Rawnsley

A significant faction of the right and their press allies want to emasculate or even obliterate the national broadcaster<p>Everyone has an agenda when they pronounce about the BBC, but not everyone is open about it, so here’s my declaration of interest. I treasure the BBC. I do so not just because I enjoyed being one of its graduate trainees and presenting programmes on the Beeb. It is one of this country’s institutions that we can genuinely call world class. The BBC is not perfect, but its flaws are greatly outweighed by its many virtues. No other country has a national broadcaster like it and we’d be fools to allow it to be destroyed. A monthly cost per TV-owning household of £13.25 – a single trip to the cinema will often set you back more – is outstanding value for the calibre and range of its output. The aspiration to be fair and balanced in its news reporting and analysis is not always impeccably fulfilled, but in my experience BBC journalists make an energetic effort to achieve that goal and are doing so in an environment in which it has become more and more challenging.</p><p>Trustworthy news is critical when so much of public life is being drenched by a tsunami of misinformation and the threat from deep fakery is growing ever greater. This is also a period characterised by intense political partisanship. That makes it more essential than ever that we have a broad church national broadcaster to provide an arena in which people of all political denominations can engage with one another and a place to which the public can confidently turn at moments of national drama. During the pandemic, more Britons went to the BBC than anywhere else for reliable information. During election nights, the BBC is most people’s first choice to bring them the results. It is a binding agent for Britain at times of both crisis and celebration.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Kids at large in the world, dogs out and about in restaurants… why is the debate so utterly babyish?<p>Last month our friend Jay Rayner wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/04/the-parakeet-london-the-food-is-great-but-beware-of-the-dogs-restaurant-review" title="">a review of a pub</a> with very nice food but also, a “pro-dog” policy. You may have read it, plenty did, many fans logging on to add their thoughts to a piece that described the singular frustration of a stranger’s dog (I’ll quote) “indulging in rigorous arse-end frottage” against Jay while he was “trying to get into the asparagus”. Here on the desk, working on the magazine, we expected a certain amount of feedback – dog lovers are passionate and often very online, alert and sensitive to any perceived criticism of their family (dogs), faith (dogs) or right to love (dogs). But we were unprepared for the speed at which the argument below the line became about something else entirely.</p><p>Those arguing the case for dogs in restaurants said they would far prefer to dine next to a dog than dine next to a badly behaved child. The comments continued, detailing examples of children moaning, and parents changing their babies’ nappies right there at the table. Others responded with stories of dogs licking their arses and then a plate. Battle lines were drawn in ketchup and a small war played out beneath Jay’s descriptions of mutton and a chocolate torte, one that has recently become familiar to anyone with skin in the game and half an eye on the internet. It was between the child-havers and the child-free, and it never fails to shock me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/16/kids-v-dogs-is-a-hot-topic-when-it-comes-to-eating-out-in-restaurants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will he stay or will he go? The Italian’s future is clouded in mixed messages despite being touted as the successor to Tite</p><p>You may have heard that Carlo Ancelotti will be the next manager of Brazil, at least if you have been listening to the president of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), anyway. If you have been listening to Ancelotti or Real Madrid, on the other hand, chances are you haven’t heard a thing. And that may be the most telling portrait of the way the pursuit of him has played out: no long-awaited announcement of his arrival. No arrival, either.</p><p>On 5 July, the CBF president, Ednaldo Rodrigues, named the Italian as the Brazil coach from 2024. Since then there has been silence. Ancelotti has said nothing, Madrid have said nothing and the CBF has said nothing, not officially. Even Rodrigues hadn’t said much at the time: a single word slipped in like an afterthought or an accident that was entirely deliberate, confirming an open secret and clarifying the one remaining doubt: a date.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/16/carlo-ancelotti-real-madrid-brazil-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How to get fitter, stronger and more flexible without going anywhere near the gym</p><p>Like buying hats or undergarments, staying healthy is not a one-size-fits-all situation. This is as true for diet and mood as it is for exercise, which is why behavioural scientists advise that the key to keeping fit is finding exercise that works for you. The truly excellent news is that even if you’re gym-phobic, unwilling to commit to team sports, averse to jogging or just plain short of time, physical activity is equally valid when split into bijou stints woven seamlessly and conveniently throughout your day.</p><p>Long gone, says <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/mh-murphy" title="">Marie Murphy</a>, professor of exercise and health at Ulster University, is the notion that you’ve got to sweat for at least 20 minutes for it to be worthwhile: 10-minute sessions are equally good, and even just a few minutes will still serve us well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/16/easy-does-it-23-nifty-fitness-hacks-for-busy-lives">Continue reading...</a>

These are the “Treasures”, a cheesy evangelical vocal group with a sideline in biblical violence, whose male counterparts the “Watchmen” train for morality-police duties with peacocking capoeira routines.

Lest Nolan’s Cillian Murphy-starring biopic of atomic bomb creator J Robert Oppenheimer not serve the facts diligently enough, then <em>Oppenheimer: The Real Story</em> (from 17 July) and <em>To End All War: Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb</em> (Now TV) are on hand to fill in any gaps. They join a long line of documentaries on the subject and its adjacent concerns; the surprise is that it’s taken this long for Oppenheimer himself to be the protagonist of a major Hollywood drama.</p><p>But the legacy of the atom bomb, from its development to its impact to its all-round political aura, is a rich one, spanning everything from esoteric arthouse films to genre B-movies.

<p>Russia says air defence forces intercepted attacks over port city of Sevastopol, but no damages were reported </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-508-of-the-invasion">What we know on day 508 of the invasion</a></li></ul><p>Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine, I’m Yang Tian bringing you the latest news.</p><p><strong>Russia</strong> has shot down nine Ukrainian drones over the <strong>Crimean port of Sevastopol</strong> early on Sunday, according to a Moscow-installed official. There was no reported damage to the city and surrounding water area.</p><p><strong>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling civilians in a village in Zaporizhzhia after three people were wounded in attacks. </strong>The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said Russian forces bombed the village of Stepnohirske using multiple rocket launchers, hitting an administrative building. Moscow-backed officials claimed it was Kyiv’s forces that shelled a school in the village of Stulneve and air defence forces intercepted a drone over the city of Tokmak. Both sides have denied targeting civilians.</p><p><strong>Russia has issued criminal charges against seven people who planned to kill two prominent Russian journalists in an alleged Ukrainian-backed plot</strong>, according to the state-owned Tass news agency. Russia’s FSB security service detained an unspecified number of people who conducted reconnaissance near the homes and workplaces of journalists Margarita Simonyan, head of state media outlet RT, and Ksenia Sobchak, who ran against President Vladimir Putin in 2018. The FSB said detainees had admitted preparing attacks on the two women on behalf of Ukraine and had been promised a reward of 1.5m roubles for each one.</p><p><strong>South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has pledged to increase his country’s humanitarian and non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine</strong> after a meeting with President <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> in Kyiv. Yoon said Seoul would “expand the scale of supplies from last year, when we provided materials such as helmets and bullet-proof vests”, adding that humanitarian aid would be increased to $150m in 2023, from $100m last year.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has said the main objective of the deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports to resume was not achieved</strong>, in a call with his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa. The Black Sea grain deal that eased fears of a global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine is due to expire late Monday unless Russia agrees to renew it. “The main goal of the deal, namely the supply of grain to countries in need, including on the African continent, has not been implemented,” Putin said according to a Kremlin release.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has criticised Bulgaria’s president over his remarks that Kyiv is to blame for Russia’s ongoing war and that supplying arms to</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>only prolongs the conflict. </strong>President Rumen Radev spoke about the recent Nato summit and said that he wanted “to make it clear that Ukraine insists on fighting this war … But it should also be clear that the bill is paid by the whole of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>.” The embassy of Ukraine in Sofia rejected Radev’s stance that supplying arms to Ukraine fuels and prolongs the war, saying Kyiv was making all possible efforts to restore peace.</p><p><strong>Ukrainians have reacted with bemusement, mild irritation and irony to UK defence secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/12/uk-defence-secretary-ben-wallace-suggests-ukraine-could-say-thank-you">Ben Wallace’s comments</a> that the country should be more grateful</strong> for the help it is receiving from the UK and other allies as it fights off Russian aggression. Kyiv previously regarded Wallace as a staunch supporter and friend. His remarks – on the second day of the Nato summit in Lithuania last week – mystified officials. “Whether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,” Wallace said, asked about President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s frustration at not being given a formal invitation to join Nato.</p><p><strong>A large convoy carrying fighters from the Wagner private army was spotted entering Belarus from Russia early on Saturday,</strong> according to independent monitoring group Belaruski Hajun. At least 60 trucks, buses and other large vehicles crossed into the eastern European country accompanied by Belarusian police. Belarus’s defence ministry said it planned for the mercenaries and Minsk’s own armed forces to conduct joint military drills.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-shoots-down-nine-ukrainian-drones-over-crimea-moscow-official-says">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No-entry signs are up around the beautiful Taymouth estate as a US developer plans to build luxury homes</p><p>At one time, locals and those visiting the village of Kenmore on the north-eastern banks of Loch Tay, Perthshire, were able to take a leisurely walk through the woodlands of the 180-hectare Taymouth estate, enjoying local wildlife, Victorian landscaping and views of imposing 19th-century Taymouth Castle. Today, in high summer and peak tourist season, would-be walkers are instead met with “path closed” signs and security warnings, while the castle – clad in scaffolding – is only visible from the roadside en route to nearby Aberfeldy.</p><p>According to campaigners, this, alongside the recent closure of local amenities such as a post office, hotel and boat hire company, is symptomatic of the “strangling” of Kenmore by developers who have bought up much of the village. Now an online campaign, Protect Loch Tay, aims to put a stop to plans by the US firm Discovery Land Company (DLC) to build a 320-hectare gated community on the Taymouth estate and neighbouring Glenlyon estate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/16/its-all-for-the-rich-anger-in-scotland-over-huge-lochside-gated-community">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hong Kong artist Fion Hung Ching-Yan’s intriguing image is inspired by an old parable about a child’s parental loyalty</p><p>The 24 Paragons of Filial Piety is a series of traditional Chinese folk tales that illustrate acts of extreme loyalty performed by children for their parents. The Hong Kong artist <a href="https://www.hungchingyan.com/">Fion Hung Ching-Yan</a> has used those stories – which her father used to tell her at bedtime – as the visual stimuli for her series of therapeutic pictures, <em>The Skeletons in the Closet</em>. Think Eminem meets Confucius.</p><p>This image, now on show in Brighton, is based on the ancient story of the child who visits a family friend in a distant province and is given a mandarin orange. The family friend observes the child stealing two more oranges and hiding them in his sleeve. The host’s anger at the theft turns to praise, however, when he discovers that the child has taken the fruit not for himself but for his mother at home. Hung, it seems, is not wholly convinced by the implied guilt trip of that parable – the moral of her updated story is that there would never be enough oranges to satisfy the demands of her parents; she needs one or two for herself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/16/the-big-picture-a-wry-take-on-a-chinese-folk-tale">Continue reading...</a>

If the Ukrainian counteroffensive fails to attain its ambitious objectives, no amount of western aid will allow Kyiv to prevail – including the controversial cluster munitions, that Washington is making available to the Ukrainians at the expense of its own soft power. The real choice facing the west is between a direct involvement of Nato and an end to hostilities through a peace treaty or an armistice of indefinite duration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/nato-should-not-enter-war-ukraine-observer-letters">Continue reading...</a>

New Zealand v Alsace and South Africa v the Loire, the same grape in different areas brings very different rewards<p><strong>Te Whare Ra Toru, Marlborough, New Zealand 2022 (£20.35, <a href="https://shop.lescaves.co.uk/lescaves-items?c=Wines">lescaves.co.uk</a>) </strong>The wine world has a bit of a thing for events in which the wines of a supposed upstart from the New World are tasted alongside the wines that inspired them in the classic European regions. It’s a habit that dates back to the Judgement of Paris, a tasting that still looms large in the wine trade imaginary despite taking place almost half a century ago in 1976, when a Paris-based British merchant, Steven Spurrier, got a panel of French experts to blind taste a bunch of California wines against the very best of Bordeaux and Burgundy. Sensationally, two California wines came out on top, announcing the US region’s arrival as a serious fine wine player on the world stage. The most recent event of this type I attended pitted a set of wines from New Zealand against their equivalents in Alsace. “Alsace Rocks, New Zealand Rolls”, was designed to be more instructive than competitive, but it certainly showed how far top aromatic New Zealand whites, such as Toru, have come.</p><p><strong>Domaine Zind Humbrecht Heimbourg Pinot Gris, Alsace 2017 (£32, <a href="https://www.thewinesociety.com/">thewinesociety.com</a>) </strong>The gorgeous aromatic ripple of tropical and temperate fruit (pineapple and mango meets apple and pear) of Toru’s Alsace-alike blend of gewürztraminer, pinot gris and riesling set the tone for a tasting in which the New Zealand wines performed much stronger than this Francophile expected, with many of the New Zealand bottles matching (if never quite out-matching) the equivalent Alsace wine they were tasted against. The Toru, for example, was not at all out of place in the company of the immaculate silkily textured honeyed blend of 13 grapes from one of my favourite Alsace producers: Marcel Deiss Berckem 2018 (£26.95, <a href="https://www.leaandsandeman.co.uk/">leaandsandeman.co.uk</a>). And it was a surprise for me, too, that Prophets Rock Pinot Gris 2020 from Central Otago, with its sumptuous succulent pear and quince and gentle floral tones, was able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the luxuriously plush but fluent wine made from the same grape variety, pinot gris, by one of the world’s most celebrated white winemakers, Olivier Humbrecht in Alsace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/old-world-v-new-world-who-wins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With the sun high in the sky and the night’s bright with reds and yellows and blues to enjoy</p><p>Midsummer at the. summerhouse: 29C and a hosepipe ban. Small planes scan the plots for too-green grass. Water use is monitored. Drooping trees perk up with occasional light rain. The two-month no-mow meadow is alive with daisies, poppies, cornflowers, every kind of grasshead. I walk around with the <a href="https://identify.plantnet.org/">Pl@ntNet</a> app. I am near-addicted to the bird-identifier Merlin, turned to Sound ID, making sense of the chorus.</p><p>I cycle past the looping peewits, scan for the flickering skylarks, watch, entranced by the skimming martins living in the sand cliffs along the beach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/16/the-danish-meadow-bursts-into-colour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of shelling civilians; Moscow issues criminal charges against seven in alleged plot to kill top Russian journalists</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling civilians in a village in Zaporizhzhia after three people were wounded in attacks. </strong>The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said Russian forces bombed the village of Stepnohirske using multiple rocket launchers, hitting an administrative building. Moscow-backed officials claimed it was Kyiv’s forces that shelled a school in the village of Stulneve and air defence forces intercepted a drone over the city of Tokmak. Both sides have denied targeting civilians.</p><p><strong>Russia has issued criminal charges against seven people who planned to kill two prominent Russian journalists in an alleged Ukrainian-backed plot</strong>, according to the state-owned Tass news agency. Russia’s FSB security service detained an unspecified number of people who conducted reconnaissance near the homes and workplaces of journalists Margarita Simonyan, head of state media outlet RT, and Ksenia Sobchak, who ran against President Vladimir Putin in 2018. The FSB said detainees had admitted preparing attacks on the two women on behalf of Ukraine and had been promised a reward of 1.5m roubles for each one.</p><p><strong>South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has pledged to increase his country’s humanitarian and non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine</strong> after a meeting with President <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> in Kyiv. Yoon said Seoul would “expand the scale of supplies from last year, when we provided materials such as helmets and bullet-proof vests”, adding that humanitarian aid would be increased to $150m in 2023, from $100m last year.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has said the main objective of the deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports to resume was not achieved</strong>, in a call with his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa. The Black Sea grain deal that eased fears of a global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine is due to expire late Monday unless Russia agrees to renew it. “The main goal of the deal, namely the supply of grain to countries in need, including on the African continent, has not been implemented,” Putin said according to a Kremlin release.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has criticised Bulgaria’s president over his remarks that Kyiv is to blame for Russia’s ongoing war and that supplying arms to</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>only prolongs the conflict. </strong>President Rumen Radev spoke about the recent Nato summit and said that he wanted “to make it clear that Ukraine insists on fighting this war … But it should also be clear that the bill is paid by the whole of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>.” The embassy of Ukraine in Sofia rejected Radev’s stance that supplying arms to Ukraine fuels and prolongs the war, saying Kyiv was making all possible efforts to restore peace.</p><p><strong>Ukrainians have reacted with bemusement, mild irritation and irony to UK defence secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/12/uk-defence-secretary-ben-wallace-suggests-ukraine-could-say-thank-you">Ben Wallace’s comments</a> that the country should be more grateful</strong> for the help it is receiving from the UK and other allies as it fights off Russian aggression. Kyiv previously regarded Wallace as a staunch supporter and friend. His remarks – on the second day of the Nato summit in Lithuania last week – mystified officials. “Whether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,” Wallace said, asked about President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s frustration at not being given a formal invitation to join Nato.</p><p><strong>A large convoy carrying fighters from the Wagner private army was spotted entering Belarus from Russia early on Saturday,</strong> according to independent monitoring group Belaruski Hajun. At least 60 trucks, buses and other large vehicles crossed into the eastern European country accompanied by Belarusian police. Belarus’s defence ministry said it planned for the mercenaries and Minsk’s own armed forces to conduct joint military drills.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-508-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
