The tweet, which did not include any text, saw Zuckerberg reference the Spider-Man pointing meme to take a jab at Elon Musk. It turns out the use of that meme was more apt than the Facebook founder could have imagined.</p><p>As highlighted by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/15/threads-a-slack-alternative-completely-unrelated-to-instagram-has-seen-downloads-surge/\"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, the release of Instagram\u2019s Threads translated into a boon for another app of the same name. Threads, a Slack alternative that has been around since 2019, saw more than 880,000 downloads on iOS between July 6th and July 12th, according to an estimate <a href=\"https://www.data.ai/en/\"><ins>Data.ai</ins></a> shared with the outlet. Where previously it had \u201cfew downloads\u201d before that period, Threads became the 52nd most downloaded App Store program globally. In a handful of European Union countries, including Germany, Spain and Italy, it even managed to crack the top 10. That might have something to do with the fact Instagram\u2019s Threads isn\u2019t available in the EU, and Meta has since started blocking people who try to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-blocks-eu-users-from-accessing-threads-through-a-vpn-135306350.html\"><ins>access the service through a VPN</ins></a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"93828957645e4486b3c2cd6b2e3c9568\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://t.co/r6DpBbRWh8\">pic.twitter.com/r6DpBbRWh8</a></p>\u2014 threads (@Threads) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Threads/status/1677385807144058880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>In addition, owing to the fact it owns threads.com, Threads (the Slack alternative) has enjoyed a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in traffic to its website. In fact, the company has since added a badge to its frontpage that declares it\u2019s \u201cnot associated with Instagram.\u201d Over on Twitter, you\u2019ll find a similar disclaimer. \u201cWe have no affiliation with Meta. But you\u2019re welcome to stick around!\u201d the company\u2019s profile states.</p><p>Of course, Meta and Threads aren\u2019t the first companies to employ the same branding. As <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, there are more than a few companies called Lightyear, including a <a href=\"https://lightyear.one/\"><ins>solar electric vehicle startup</ins></a>, an <a href=\"https://www.lightyear.co/explore-courses\"><ins>online course platform</ins></a> and two separate <a href=\"https://www.lightyear.cloud/\"><ins>fintech firms</ins></a>. Still, it\u2019s funny a coincidence when you consider Threads, the workplace chat app, was co-founded by Rousseau Kazi, a former Facebook product manager. Oh, and Meta used to operate an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-threads-shutdown-december-2021-214523820.html\"><ins>Instagram companion app</ins></a> also confusingly named Threads. I suppose there\u2019s no originality left in Silicon Valley.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-sent-another-app-named-threads-to-the-top-of-the-app-store-charts-214007131.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-sent-another-app-named-threads-to-the-top-of-the-app-store-charts-214007131.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-16T21:40:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Russia bans state officials from using Apple devices over US spying concerns", "description": "<p>Russian authorities have begun to ban government employees from using Apple devices for official state use, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6567e7f2-c5fb-4da4-bd95-bf7ceef54038\"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>.

But space travel itself always represented more than a scientific endeavor. Human spaceflight was one of the \u201cgreat dreams\u201d of the 1960s, as space historian Valerie Neal reminds us, and as a \u201cbig idea,\u201d spaceflight relied heavily on American cultural narratives. The Apollo program (1963\u20131972) conjured the image of pioneering the frontier in the 1960s\u2014exploration and discovery were indispensable to America\u2019s history and continuing redefinition, and Americans welcomed the frontier as a metaphor for space exploration (Neal 15). The shuttle program (1972\u20132011) echoed the narrative of Americans \u201cgoing to work.\u201d As the Apollo missions were replaced by the space shuttle, NASA supporters and commentators depicted the shuttle crews with imagery associated with blue-collar labor: \u201castronaut repairmen made service calls in a vehicle often called a space truck.\"</p><p>Both of these narratives \u2014 \u201cpioneering the frontier\u201d and \u201cgetting the job done\u201d \u2014 are closely associated with a third narrative that was becoming deeply ingrained in American national identity in the 1960s: the myth of the United States as a nation of immigrants and of the immigrant as the backbone of America\u2019s egalitarian democracy. This American immigrant myth was not born in the nineteenth or even in the early twentieth century, when immigration was peaking and Congress struggled to impose limitations and quotas. The myth reached wide acceptance only in the early 1960s. It is no coincidence that John F. Kennedy presented the immigrant myth most succinctly in his pamphlet, A Nation of Immigrants, in 1963, as Kennedy was preparing to ask Congress to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws. At the same time, his administration was pressing furiously to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, a central goal of the New Frontier. Interestingly, Kennedy\u2019s space proposals were a far more important policy priority for the administration than immigration reform (the latter was not accomplished until 1965, as we shall see later). But his articulation of the \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d narrative provided powerful imagery in support of the space program he championed from the start of his administration.</p><p>Kennedy\u2019s articulation of the complex immigration myth featured not just a welcoming America, but an idealized immigrant, united with others by little other than a common love of freedom. Ours was \u201ca nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers, people eager to build lives for themselves in a spacious society that did not restrict their freedom of choice and action.\" Citing Tocqueville, Kennedy noted that immigrants\u2019 very poverty made them more inclined toward egalitarian democracy. No arena of American life was untouched by the influence of immigrants, and immigrants themselves were paragons of self-reliance, ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and pioneer spirit. \u201cIt was the future and not the past to which he was compelled to address himself,\u201d Kennedy wrote, describing the motivations of the nineteenth-century immigrant.</p><blockquote><p>Except for the Negro slave, he could go anywhere and do anything his talents permitted. A sprawling continent lay before him, and he had only to weld it together by canals, by railroads and by roads . . . This has been the foundation of American inventiveness and ingenuity, of the multiplicity of new enterprises, and of the success in achieving the highest standard of living anywhere in the world.</p></blockquote><p>The space program was the next frontier in the natural progression toward excellence. It evoked not only the immigrant\u2019s capacity for adventure and discovery but also his practicality and capacity to work hard and tame his surroundings. From the time of the English settlers, who \u201cfought a rugged land\u201d in the words of Kennedy, immigrants had to overcome adversity to earn their fortunes and shape their environment. They had worked as artisans, provided cheap labor for American farms, factories, mills, and mines, and climbed the economic ladder to provide succeeding generations with educational opportunities. They had moved forward to get the job done. Launched under the motto \u201cGoing to Work in Space,\u201d the space shuttle was a vehicle that could deliver satellites and repair them in orbit, carry commercial payloads, and support a research laboratory. Astronauts would carry out their work all but rolling up their sleeves as builders and repair technicians, wielding robotic arms and power hand tools. Businesses could use the shuttle as a workhorse to launch satellites or develop manufacturing capabilities. All of this economic productivity in space could be expected to resonate with a nation whose increasingly diverse immigrant workforce was transitioning to a new economy. American society was reflected not only symbolically but practically in NASA\u2019s missions. They produced results that appeared almost impossibly ambitious. NASA represented excellence: the best work in the world. Space travel also mirrored some of the risks and hardships of the immigrant experience. As the American public began questioning the nation\u2019s investment in space travel through the 1980s, advocates harked back to this part of the immigrant narrative. In the aftermath of the 1986 Challenger tragedy, the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Future of the US Space Program (1990) reminded Americans that acceptance and resilience in the face of failure were a part of America\u2019s pioneer and immigrant legacies:</p><blockquote><p>In a very real sense, the space program is analogous to the exploration and settlement of the new world. In this view, risk and sacrifice are seen to be constant features of the American experience. There is a national heritage of risk-taking handed down from early explorers, immigrants, settlers, and adventurers. It is this element of our national character that is the wellspring of the U.S. space program.</p></blockquote>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-how-nasa-helped-jfk-build-his-nation-of-immigrants-143027063.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-how-nasa-helped-jfk-build-his-nation-of-immigrants-143027063.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-16T14:30:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft and Sony agree to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation", "description": "<p>Following a bitter, months-long feud over the company's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sony have signed a deal to keep the Call of Duty franchise on PlayStation consoles. &quot;We are pleased to announce that Microsoft and PlayStation have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard,&quot; Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1680578783718383616?s=20\">tweeted Sunday morning</a>. &quot;We look forward to a future where players globally have more choice to play their favorite games.&quot;&nbsp;</p><div id=\"7fee4c82073c45338c426275f1b008da\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We are pleased to announce that Microsoft and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PlayStation</a> have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

In an effort to secure approval from regulators, including the FTC and CMA, Microsoft went on to sign an agreement with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html\">Nintendo</a> to bring the series to the company's future consoles. It also came to terms with cloud gaming providers like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-putting-xbox-games-on-geforce-now-in-an-attempt-to-win-over-regulators-184818183.html\">NVIDIA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before today, Jim Ryan, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, made clear he was strongly opposed to Microsoft's Activision bid. \u201cI don\u2019t want a new Call of Duty deal.
