China little pinks are decreasing because been fooled too often/Fake foreigner", "description": "#Chinainsights#Chinanewstoday#littlepink\nIn China, people who are fervently patriotic or love the Communist Party are called Little Pink. No one has done any statistics on whether its number is growing or decreasing. But through personal observation, we believe that there should be fewer of them because this group is being impacted by information from all corners. Some should have gradually changed their minds.\nThis little Pink is surprised to discover that red China has become quite lonely in the world after several trips abroad.\n\nHave questions?
