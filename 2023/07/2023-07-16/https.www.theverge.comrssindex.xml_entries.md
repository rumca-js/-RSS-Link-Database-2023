  <p id="rZm2OF">Not to be all Marie Kondo about it, but my Mac Studio sparks joy in me every day, and it’s not because it’s the fastest computer I’ve ever owned. It’s also not strictly about the front-facing ports Apple gave it, nor is it the village of ports that live in the back.</p>
<p id="8zMxSK">It’s the mustache.</p>
<p id="hyulqd">See, I found this mustache sticker in the back of a drawer in my house. I don’t know where it came from, only that it was there, and the moment I found it, I knew immediately where to put it: smack-dab in the middle of my Mac Studio. I’d been thinking for awhile that the Studio has this goofy face on the front, and slapping a curly ‘stache on it just drove that home. It delights me, and recently, I’ve been thinking about why this goofy twee addition to my...</p>

  <p id="V4FqhL">Around the time J. Robert Oppenheimer learned that Hiroshima had been struck (alongside everyone else in the world) he began to have profound regrets about his role in the creation of that bomb. At one point when meeting President Truman Oppenheimer wept and expressed that regret. Truman called him a crybaby and said he never wanted to see him again. And Christopher Nolan is hoping that when Silicon Valley audiences of his film <em>Oppenheimer </em>(out June 21) see his interpretation of all those events they’ll see something of themselves there too.</p>
<p id="seXnza">After a screening of <em>Oppenheimer</em> at the Whitby Hotel yesterday Christopher Nolan joined a panel of scientists and Kai Bird, one of the authors of the book Oppenheimer is based on to talk about the...</p>

  <p id="ZBbY2F">Apple may do a new product launch in October, according to <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Mark Gurman in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-16/apple-creates-new-vision-products-group-vpg-for-future-mixed-reality-headsets-lk5g2ee4"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, and he speculates that the focus of the presumably-post-iPhone 15 launch will be new Macs, hinting the M3-powered iMac may be among them. Gurman has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/5/23625972/apple-new-imac-launch-m3-chip">previously written</a> that Apple is planning to release an M3-powered iMac at the end of this year.</p>
<p id="Tvpa4o">Gurman hedges pretty hard on this prediction, but the timing feels right. The last time we saw a new iMac was when Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review">released its colorful redesign</a> more than two years ago. </p>
<p id="cvd7vB">That doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll see any changes to the form factor this time around. In last week’s <em>Power On, </em>Gurman wrote that larger, potentially up to 32-inch iMacs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788627/apple-imac-32-inch-mac-os-retina-apple-silicon">won’t show up until late 2024</a>, so...</p>

  <p id="uEfdNA">Sony has agreed to a deal for <em>Call of Duty</em> with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation after the proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says Sony and Microsoft have agreed to a “binding agreement” to keep <em>Call of Duty </em>on PlayStation. It’s not immediately clear if this is a 10-year deal, like Microsoft has signed with Nintendo and other cloud providers.</p>
<p id="f4yoyk">This ends a bitter battle between the companies that has been waged both privately and publicly over the past year after Microsoft announced its proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard in January 2022.</p>
