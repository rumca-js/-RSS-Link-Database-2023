He was about to wrap up when an audience member yelled out about cocaine at the White House. As most of you know, there was blow found at the White House where Joe Biden works and lives. On an unrelated note, Hunter Biden doesn't do cocaine. He just likes the smell.</p><p>Carlson couldn't resist. The White House cocaine scandal is his favorite story of all time.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Unfortunately, we have to fact-check Tucker. It wasn't an entire 8-ball of coke. It was only a dime bag of coke. Tucker should be more precise with his language. We figured he'd want to hear it from a friend and not Politi"fact."</p>
<h3>A cocaine in the White House timeline</h3><br /><img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e005d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34340167&amp;width=980" /><p>There was a mystery packet of white powder found at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. <a href="https://redstate.com/bonchie/2023/07/06/holy-coke-the-white-house-cocaine-story-changes-yet-again-n772007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The story kept changing</a>. The blow was found in the West Wing, then not in the West Wing, then in the West Wing again. It's been in the library, a work area, up Hunter's butt, in an executive cubby, and so on. </p><p>The final story was that it was found in an uber-exclusive area of the White House near the situation room. An area they were oddly specific about pointing out <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/white-house-cocaine-situation-room" target="_blank">was right near where Kamala Harris parks her car</a>.</p><p>Karine Jean-Pierre spread misinformation from the White House podium that the Biden Family wasn't even in the White House at the time. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-cocaine" target="_blank">They were. Joe AND Hunter</a>.</p><p>The Secret Service concluded its investigation and said they have no idea whose cocaine it was. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/secret-service-cocaine" target="_blank">Even corporate media says BULLPLOP!</a></p><h3>"Don't trust a man with numb gums."</h3><br /><img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="58336" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34340173&amp;width=980" /><p>Tucker didn't take the low-hanging fruit and make a Hunter Biden joke. The cocaine could have been anyone who uses that secure area of the White House. Even Joe Biden. Funding out that Biden and/or his cabinet members do blow explains so much of their agenda.</p><p>Being in media for a quarter of a century, Carlson has seen people high on coke before. Acting out someone riding those white lines:</p><p>“It’s like … crazed and grandiose. I’ve got a plan. YOU’RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT! It’s unbelievable, it’s going to totally work. What we’re going to do... we’re gonna totally rearrange everything, okay? We’ve been doing things a certain way for a long time, okay? And it’s worked, but I’ve got a better plan!”</p><p class="">
	Tucker ended with some sage-like advice for the audience: don’t trust a man with numb gums.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Keep it in mind, we'll circle back in a minute. </p><p>Adam Devine was a guest on Theo Von's <em>This Past Weekend</em> podcast. it was a lot less controversial than the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/theo-von-youtube-roseanne-barr" target="_blank">last time Theo's podcast has come up</a>. The two lamented how hard it was to get comedies greenlit by the studios anymore. Oldheads know this, but in the olden days, we would have laugh-out-loud funny movies we'd quote with our friends for years and years and years. Now when Devine goes to even pitch a comedy, the studio wants to know "why" we need to make this movie now.</p><p>i.e. What's the woke social/political angle?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Devine pointed out there was a time there would be over forty comedies in theaters per year. Last year? Six. And of those six movies...</p><p>"You get to the end of what you think was a comedy and you're like, 'Was this about global warming? Was there some deep hidden message I should recycle more?"</p><p>"Wait, so the moon is trans?"</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The joke about political correctness (what we used to call wokeness) was always that you couldn't make <em>Blazing Saddles</em> today. The band SR-71 even wrote a song about it back in 2000. <em>Blazing Saddles</em> is a classic Mel Brooks movie that makes fun of racists. By 2023 standards, the movie (made in the 70s) doesn't make racism serious enough. Even though... it's a comedy.</p><p>Writers for <em>The Office</em> <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mindy-kaling-office" target="_blank">will tell you that they could never make <em>The Office</em> today</a>. Even though people STILL watch and love <em>The Office</em>. It was the most-watched comedy during the pandemic. </p><p>Hollywood has made the twisted calculation that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ben-stiller-tropic-thunder" target="_blank">being allowed to laugh</a> is one of the things that made Donald Trump happen. So now no one can laugh ever again. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/muppets-disney-warning" target="_blank">Emotional hemophiliacs on Twitter can't handle it</a>, and the studios have an agenda to push.</p><p>Now to my initial question: What was the last laugh-out-loud comedy movie you remember seeing? I go back to two movies that aren't classics but were laugh-out-loud for me: <em>Get Him to the Greek</em> (2010) and <em>The Internship</em> (2013). I legit can't think of any comedies that stand out to me right now that were released in the past decade.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
