<p>Wimbledon champion has talent and trickery to join the elite but must maintain the winning mentality she has finally found</p><p>There are few better places to catch a glimpse of the next tennis champions than at the Wimbledon qualifying tournament on the grounds of Roehampton’s Bank of England Sports Centre, where many begin to plot their way into the top levels of the sport.</p><p>Last year, that was particularly true. A recognisable face among the crowd there was a Czech player by the name Marketa Vondrousova, but she was not in competition. After undergoing a second wrist surgery nearly two months earlier, Vondrousova was in the midst of a six-month layoff. She made her trip from the Czech Republic as a tourist while supporting her best friend and doubles partner, Miriam Kolodziejova, with her wedding imminent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/marketa-vondrousova-wimbledon-champion-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tourists played three specialist slow bowlers to beat England, learning a lesson from their male counterparts in 2005</p><p>With one ball to come in the 100th over of the match, it was Natalie Sciver-Brunt on her haunches holding the handle of her bat, puffing for air. She needed six to win, four to tie and force a super over. After her final swing of the match, one that didn’t connect cleanly enough to find either variety of boundary, it was the whole ground that was short of air, one long exhale from the England-supporting crowd. Taking back the trophy had still been a chance, then it was gone.</p><p>As the men’s and women’s Ashes series have unspooled side by side across the past few weeks, the comparisons to 2005 have not stopped.

## Should I worry about ticks?

<p>Evidence suggests their numbers could be increasing – with bites transmitting viral, bacterial and potentially life-threatening diseases. But there are ways to guard against these attacks</p><p></p><p>As arachnid superorders go, ticks are pretty evolutionarily successful. They’ve been around for at least 100 million years in one variety or another, with their main party trick – hanging around until they can latch a host to feed on – working on thousands of different animals across almost endless environments. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/country-diary-tick-tock-its-tick-oclock">how concerned should you be about them in the UK</a>? You won’t miss the blood they take, but they can cause a variety of unpleasant conditions in their hosts – and there’s some evidence that their population is growing.</p><p>Just so we’re all on the same page, there are at least <a href="https://www.lymedisease.org/types-of-ticks/">900 species of ticks </a>currently operating across every continent – <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018846/">some targeting seabirds</a> and lizards, others cattle <a href="https://www.bluecross.org.uk/advice/dog/health-and-injuries/ticks-on-dogs?amp&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwb6lBhBJEiwAbuVUSlkq7kCs_S1IoewrDOqUX_Dxy2L-izrRAebkWD961-F-pzr3pOtSOBoC6DkQAvD_BwE">or dogs</a>. Ticks sense vibrations and body heat, and will find a good place to wait for a host, then latch on to it, finding a patch of skin where the animal’s blood vessels run close to the surface and where it’s hard to be scratched away. At this point, it digs in and inserts its barbed, tubular mouthpart – sometimes secreting <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12384">attachment “cement” </a>to make itself harder to remove.

## Sam Burton: Dear Departed review – timeless, low-key charm

<p>(Partisan)<br />Written after time on the road, the LA-based songwriter’s second album channels the spirit of Glen Campbell and Harry Nilsson </p><p><a href="https://samburtonmusic.com/">Sam Burton</a> has come full circle since his 2020 debut, <em>I Can Go With You</em> – leaving his adopted home town of Los Angeles, first for his Utah roots and then some itinerant California wandering, before finding himself settled in LA again. His travels informed the songs he wrote while he was away, not least the hypnotic I Don’t Blame You’s opening (“Well, I feel like a sail when I’m looking around/ For some wind to move me”) and the self-explanatory A Place to Stay. On his return, he hooked up with producer Jonathan Wilson for this second album.</p><p>As with Wilson’s work for Father John Misty and Angel Olsen – and, indeed, his own solo oeuvre – there’s a timeless lushness to the sound of <em>Dear Departed. </em>It’s an album that draws heavily on the influence of 1960s and 70s singer-songwriters – think Harry Nilsson, Glen Campbell and Jackson Browne. Songs develop at a leisurely pace, subtly deployed strings and piano very much foregrounding Burton’s gentle, ruminative, slightly mournful vocals. There’s a low-key charm throughout – most notably on Maria – but while these songs frequently smoulder, they rarely ignite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/16/sam-burton-dear-departed-review-timeless-low-key-charm">Continue reading...</a>

The government should put its money into teaching every child how to knit and sew if it really wants to avoid fashion waste<p>‘In France, we have no petrol, but we have ideas.” So goes a popular French saying born in the 1970s during the oil crisis. Said differently, France is a champion of quirky initiatives that can feel both admirable and somewhat pointless. The latest in a series of eco-friendly measures taken by the French government is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/12/stitch-in-time-france-to-help-pay-for-clothes-to-be-mended-to-cut-waste#:~:text=From%20October%2C%20people%20will%20be,responsible%20fashion%20hub%20in%20Paris." title="">“repair bonus”</a>. Instead of throwing into the bin a pair of ripped trousers, a bag with a broken strap or a moth-eaten polo neck, the state will pay for them to be mended at your local cobbler or <em>retoucheur</em> (sewing workshops). From October and for the next five years, we will be able to claim back between €6-€25 of the costs of mending our clothes and shoes with artisans who have joined the scheme.</p><p>The hope is to help create a virtuous circle, change habits for the planet’s sake (700,000 tonnes of clothing is thrown away in France every year), sustain local artisans and even create jobs in what we now need to call the “<a href="https://refashion.fr/citoyen/fr/qui-sommes-nous" title="">refashion</a>” sector. Three years ago, a similar scheme encouraged my compatriots to fix their old toasters or rickety washing machines, rather than dispose of them out of frustration. Legislators even obliged companies to revise their obsolescence strategy by publishing a “repairability index” for each item produced. Consumers can now buy new home appliances knowing in advance how easy (or difficult) they are to repair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/the-french-dont-need-president-macron-to-tell-us-how-to-make-do-and-mend">Continue reading...</a>

At that age you have the world at your fingertips<p>My son has turned five and the temptation is to say that this seems ludicrous; my little boy, all grown up, a man of the world already, that kind of thing. In truth, I don’t really feel that way at all. I’ve been keeping pretty meticulous records of my calendar and the numbers appear to check out, plus he is 4ft tall and closing out his first year of primary school so, yes, five does seem about right. I don’t, however, say this out loud when fellow parents at his small birthday gathering ask where the time went. I just say, ‘Wow, yeah, can you believe it?’ even though I can believe it perfectly well.</p><p>There’s a mote of shame in this, as if the best thing I can say about my son is that I feel like I’ve only known him for a wet weekend. Maybe, I counsel myself, the passage of time has simply been complicated by Covid lockdowns, which took up a decent chunk of his toddler years, indeed stretched them to near-purgatorial lengths. This theory hits a snag when I consider that this has been true for every parent I know, and they all seem utterly perplexed at the speed of the Earth’s orbit. I picture them now, leaving with their party bags, wordless and disconsolate. Returning indoors to crunch numbers on battered calculators, and scream at the hundred calendars they’ve connected with red twine across their kitchen wall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/16/seamas-oreilly-it-is-his-fifth-birthday-and-my-son-is-growing-up-fast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With tremendous wit and wisdom, the former head of Margaret Thatcher’s policy unit identifies the qualities particular to dictators – and warns against consigning such people to history</p><p>How to deal, psychologically speaking, with Boris Johnson and Donald Trump? For obvious reasons, many of us have spent the past several years telling ourselves that these (insert your own insult here) politicians are outrageous anomalies, mere boils on the otherwise unblemished face of the body politic. Of course boils are nasty, their suppurating eruptions highly unpleasant for anyone who happens to be in the vicinity. We all know this. But we take comfort in the fact that they may also be treated. The condition, ultimately, is curable. The state – I won’t say deep state – will carefully apply its very own brand of topical antibiotics, and the inflammation will eventually disappear, smoothness restored at last.</p><p>But is this really true? The writer Ferdinand Mount doesn’t believe that Johnson and Trump are as exceptional as we might like to imagine – we must, Mount instructs, abandon the comforting illusions of historicism, the idea that liberal democracy is inevitably here to stay – and in his brilliant new book, he sets out to put them in context, looking for traces of their tactics and their effects in, among other strong men of history, Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon Bonaparte, António de Oliveira Salazar, and General de Gaulle. The result is a kind of field guide to Caesarism; think of it as I-Spy an Autocrat<em>. </em>Mount uses his examples as a means of telling us what to look out for, from propaganda and wall-to-wall lies to a certain (weird) kind of charisma; from careful timing (the authoritarian bides his time) to national susceptibility (peak grievance is his moment). More encouragingly, he also examines how Caesars are unmade, a section that includes accounts of events as disparate as Catiline’s attempt to seize control of the Roman state in 63BC, Indira Gandhi’s imposition of a state of emergency in India in 1975, and, yes, both the toppling of Boris Johnson by Conservative MPs and the march on the Capitol after Donald Trump lost the American election to Joe Biden in 2020.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/big-caesars-and-little-caesars-julius-caesar-boris-johnson-ferdinand-mount-review-wonderfully-wry-field-guide-to-autocrats">Continue reading...</a>

The presenter talks about her dog named Barold, curry-cooking boyfriend and gross but amazing breakfast recipe<p><strong>Up early or lie in?</strong> I start being an assistant to two dogs at 7am. I share Winnie Winnipeg with my flatmates. Barold’s name was inspired by a posh friend who thought Barry was short for Barold. I was going to name my firstborn Barold, but I decided I don’t want children – so it had to be the dog.</p><p><strong>First thing you do?</strong> My boyfriend [musician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/james-blake" title="">James Blake</a>] and I have our hour of mandated coffee, doughnuts and gossip. We’re like two little old ladies – it’s been our morning routine for eight years. If I’m filming at 4am, he’ll get up at 3am for gossip, even if he’s not working.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/16/sunday-with-jameela-jamil-first-thing-is-an-hour-of-coffee-doughnuts-and-gossip">Continue reading...</a>
