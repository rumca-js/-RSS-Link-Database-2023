[{"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic Both Blurs And Upholds The Franchise's Age-Old Binaries", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, July 15, 2023. Below, we look at how it challenged and subverted some of Star Wars' most common tropes.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Star Wars is obsessed with what machine and memory create, the blurred selves at the intersection of metal and flesh. Darth Vader is the clearest example of this. Anakin's descent to the dark side renders itself real in his deformed body. Obi-Wan says that he is \"more machine than man,\" a fact that is leveraged in the stated impossibility of his redemption. Evil in Star Wars is associated with a disabled body, especially one that was once meat, muscle, and nerve, but is now wired with circuits.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Droids cannot be \"force-sensitive\" the way people can, and thus they don't bear the moral weight of metal. But they are still seen as lesser. Droids provide slave labor and are owned by heroes and villains alike. A New Hope establishes within the first 20 minutes that droids' memories are routinely wiped. Luke's uncle Owen suggests it with the casualness of asking Luke to take out the trash. In the Star Wars universe, there is an entire class of people whose capacity to remember is entirely dependent upon the people who own them. Both inside and outside of its fiction, the perceived personhood of sentient beings relies on whether or not you are made of metal.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-both-blurs-and-upholds-the-franchises-age-old-binaries/1100-6515992/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-both-blurs-and-upholds-the-franchises-age-old-binaries/1100-6515992/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-16T18:31:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Zelda Expert Breaks Down Viral TOTK Clips", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4166161-zelda_er_v2_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Our in-house Legend of Zelda combat expert reacts to some of the most impressive Tears of the Kingdom gameplay clips.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/zelda-expert-breaks-down-viral-totk-clips/2300-6461876/", "date_published": "2023-07-16T15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Microsoft And Sony Reach Deal To Keep Call Of Duty On PlayStation", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Days after defeating the FTC\u2019s challenge to its purchase of Activision Blizzard--and one day before its scheduled meeting with the UK\u2019s CMA--Microsoft has reached an agreement with Sony to keep the Call Of Duty franchise on PlayStation post-merger.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft boss Phil Spencer announced the deal via Twitter, where he says the two sides \u201chave signed a binding agreement\u201d to keep the successful first-person shooter franchise coming to PlayStation consoles. \u201cWe look forward to a future where players globally have more choice to play their favorite games,\u201d the tweet continued.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">We are pleased to announce that Microsoft and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">@PlayStation</a> have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
