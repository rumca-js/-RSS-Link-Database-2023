Well that’s a catchy title isn’t it.

Sony basically said “hey, I guess Microsoft gets Activision”. That’s it.

That’s the video.

I mean, there’s more to it than that, but, like, that’s all you really NEED to know.

So….yeah.

I mean I talk about Call of Duty.

You guys like call of duty right?

No?

Oh that’s a shame.

I’ll talk about PlaySTation. And XBOX.

Those are cool.

Right?

Oh.

Que lastima.
