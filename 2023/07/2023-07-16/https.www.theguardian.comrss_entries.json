There always seemed to be a problem: a joke or a satire on Gainsbourg\u2019s part to which they weren\u2019t entirely party, a level of controversy that Gainsbourg was willing to provoke but they were not. There was the 18-year-old France Gall, who he duped into singing a song that was evidently \u2013 to all but the innocent Gall herself \u2013 about oral sex, causing her to temporarily retreat from public life in mortification, and furnished with a succession of other songs that appeared to be viciously mocking their singer as she sang them (the Eurovision-winning Poup\u00e9e de Cire, Poup\u00e9e de Son, depicted her as a hopelessly naive puppet, whose fans didn\u2019t have a clue what they were doing). There was Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a passionate affair, who first recorded the scandalous duet Je T\u2019Aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus, then refused to allow it to be released, fearful of precisely how scandalous it was going to be. There was his daughter Charlotte, whom he corralled into recording a duet called Lemon Incest, then cast in a film, Charlotte for Ever, in which he played her father, reducing her to tears on the set during a scene in which he undressed her. And there was Vanessa Paradis, their working relationship so fraught that Gainsbourg took to calling her Vanessa L\u2019Enfer.</p><p>But that never happened with Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. They were a couple for 12 years: their working partnership outlived their separation in 1980, lasting until Gainsbourg\u2019s death in 1991. The standard line is to call her his muse on account of the songs he wrote for her \u2013 Jane B, Ma Ch\u00e9rie Jane, La Fille aux Claquettes, Ballade de Johnny-Jane, Lost Song, D\u00e9pressive \u2013 or the songs she inspired: Birkin performed the role of, and was clearly the model for, the titular heroine in Gainsbourg\u2019s masterpiece, the 1971 concept album Histoire de Melody Nelson. But the word \u201cmuse\u201d implies a certain passivity that sells Birkin hopelessly short: she felt far more like Gainsbourg\u2019s co-conspirator. It was Birkin who modelled Gainsbourg\u2019s iconic latterday image. There seemed to be nothing he could come up with that she would baulk at. Singing the song that Bardot had refused to release, and riding out the resultant scandal, which grew far bigger than even Bardot had feared, encompassing not just radio bans, but condemnation from the Vatican. Demonstrating La D\u00e9cadanse, Gainsbourg\u2019s attempt at instituting a dance craze that involved the male lead grasping his female partner\u2019s breasts. Being photographed naked and chained to a radiator for Lui magazine, complete with accompanying text by Gainsbourg describing her as his \u201clittle hermaphrodite\u201d.

But I\u2019d make so bold as to say the real publishing is happening at the bottom.\u201d It\u2019s a view that is increasingly widespread in the industry. The argument runs something like this: because commercial pressures at large houses encourage cautious commissioning (see the way every breakthrough success, be it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/28/sally-rooney-hell-of-fame-normal-people\">Sally Rooney </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/04/richard-osman-no-ones-born-a-writer-i-write-because-i-read-it\">Richard Osman</a>, heralds an attack of the clones), nimbler indies \u2013 operating with tighter margins \u2013 step into the void and give choice-starved readers the books that corporate imprints deem unsaleable or otherwise risky. Whether these are from veteran authors left on the scrapheap (according to Ellis, Picador didn\u2019t want <em>The Shards</em>), boundary-pushing first-timers such as Sheena Patel (author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/29/im-a-fan-by-sheena-patel-review-fizzing-debut-about-a-sociopathic-narcissist\">I\u2019m </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/29/im-a-fan-by-sheena-patel-review-fizzing-debut-about-a-sociopathic-narcissist\">a Fan,</a></em> recently the winner of a British Book award) or foreign greats deemed tricky to sell (witness Fitzcarraldo\u2019s wonder trio of overseas Nobel laureates, Ernaux, Svetlana Alexievich and Olga Tokarczuk), all are finding homes with upstart maverick publishers that \u2013 as their prize success indicates \u2013 are reaping the spoils.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/uk-indie-publishing-mavericks-shook-up-books-booker-nobel-fitzcarraldo-sort-of-books-daunt\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/uk-indie-publishing-mavericks-shook-up-books-booker-nobel-fitzcarraldo-sort-of-books-daunt", "date_published": "2023-07-16T08:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Let\u2019s be clear about why the Tories are so keen to exploit the travails of the BBC | Andrew Rawnsley", "description": "A significant faction of the right and their press allies want to emasculate or even obliterate the national broadcaster<p>Everyone has an agenda when they pronounce about the BBC, but not everyone is open about it, so here\u2019s my declaration of interest. I treasure the BBC. I do so not just because I enjoyed being one of its graduate trainees and presenting programmes on the Beeb. It is one of this country\u2019s institutions that we can genuinely call world class. The BBC is not perfect, but its flaws are greatly outweighed by its many virtues. No other country has a national broadcaster like it and we\u2019d be fools to allow it to be destroyed. A monthly cost per TV-owning household of \u00a313.25 \u2013 a single trip to the cinema will often set you back more \u2013 is outstanding value for the calibre and range of its output. The aspiration to be fair and balanced in its news reporting and analysis is not always impeccably fulfilled, but in my experience BBC journalists make an energetic effort to achieve that goal and are doing so in an environment in which it has become more and more challenging.</p><p>Trustworthy news is critical when so much of public life is being drenched by a tsunami of misinformation and the threat from deep fakery is growing ever greater. This is also a period characterised by intense political partisanship. That makes it more essential than ever that we have a broad church national broadcaster to provide an arena in which people of all political denominations can engage with one another and a place to which the public can confidently turn at moments of national drama. During the pandemic, more Britons went to the BBC than anywhere else for reliable information. During election nights, the BBC is most people\u2019s first choice to bring them the results. It is a binding agent for Britain at times of both crisis and celebration.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It\u2019s a habit that dates back to the Judgement of Paris, a tasting that still looms large in the wine trade imaginary despite taking place almost half a century ago in 1976, when a Paris-based British merchant, Steven Spurrier, got a panel of French experts to blind taste a bunch of California wines against the very best of Bordeaux and Burgundy. Sensationally, two California wines came out on top, announcing the US region\u2019s arrival as a serious fine wine player on the world stage. The most recent event of this type I attended pitted a set of wines from New Zealand against their equivalents in Alsace. \u201cAlsace Rocks, New Zealand Rolls\u201d, was designed to be more instructive than competitive, but it certainly showed how far top aromatic New Zealand whites, such as Toru, have come.</p><p><strong>Domaine Zind Humbrecht Heimbourg Pinot Gris, Alsace 2017 (\u00a332, <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/\">thewinesociety.com</a>) </strong>The gorgeous aromatic ripple of tropical and temperate fruit (pineapple and mango meets apple and pear) of Toru\u2019s Alsace-alike blend of gew\u00fcrztraminer, pinot gris and riesling set the tone for a tasting in which the New Zealand wines performed much stronger than this Francophile expected, with many of the New Zealand bottles matching (if never quite out-matching) the equivalent Alsace wine they were tasted against.
