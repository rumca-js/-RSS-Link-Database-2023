I don\u2019t know where it came from, only that it was there, and the moment I found it, I knew immediately where to put it: smack-dab in the middle of my Mac Studio. I\u2019d been thinking for awhile that the Studio has this goofy face on the front, and slapping a curly \u2018stache on it just drove that home. It delights me, and recently, I\u2019ve been thinking about why this goofy twee addition to my...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/16/23796785/apple-design-mac-studio-minimalism-macbook-air-pro-iphone\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/16/23796785/apple-design-mac-studio-minimalism-macbook-air-pro-iphone", "date_published": "2023-07-16T20:02:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "Christopher Nolan wants Oppenheimer to be a cautionary tale for Silicon Valley", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"Christopher Nolan, a white man, sits at a panel holding a microphone and speaking.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vU7TpqcxJsqczby1-8-niEeBlpc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72456647/Z9R_0484_xP3zaQ7t.0.jpeg\" />\n        <figcaption>Christopher Nolan at a screening of Oppenheimer at the Whitby Hotel in NYC. | Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images For Universal Pictures</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"V4FqhL\">Around the time J. Robert Oppenheimer learned that Hiroshima had been struck (alongside everyone else in the world) he began to have profound regrets about his role in the creation of that bomb. At one point when meeting President Truman Oppenheimer wept and expressed that regret. Truman called him a crybaby and said he never wanted to see him again.

Gurman has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/5/23625972/apple-new-imac-launch-m3-chip\">previously written</a> that Apple is planning to release an M3-powered iMac at the end of this year.</p>\n<p id=\"Tvpa4o\">Gurman hedges pretty hard on this prediction, but the timing feels right. The last time we saw a new iMac was when Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review\">released its colorful redesign</a> more than two years ago. </p>\n<p id=\"cvd7vB\">That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019ll see any changes to the form factor this time around.
