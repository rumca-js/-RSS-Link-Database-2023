Johny: Why Lisa, Why Lisa?!
Please talk to me! PLEASE!
You're part of my life!
You are everything!
I could not go on without you, Lisa!

Lisa: You're scaring me.

Johny: You are lying! I never hit you!
YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!

Lisa: Why are you so hysterical?!

Johny: Do you understand life? Do you!?
