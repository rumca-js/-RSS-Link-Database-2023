It's the biggest Transformers flop in theaters so far and it adds almost nothing to the franchise. It just makes you wish that Shia Labeouf's Sam Witwicky was still here, and yes, even that Megan Fox was still here. Instead,  Rise of the Beasts offers things like animal transformers called Maximals that are barely in the movie and final battles in an empty cgi jungle that pales in comparison with Dark of the Moon for example. The movie is sort of empty, as many modern bad Hollywood movies often are. In today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's see what that means and how to avoid it.\n\nBook, Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW1TN97D?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420\nBook, PDF: email me at saltyfilmento(a)gmail.com\n\nSupport:     https://patreon.com/filmento\nFollow:        https://twitter.com/filmento\nFilmento en Espa\u00f1ol: https://youtu.be/ViDZUofaZd8\n\n#transformers   #transformersriseofthebeasts #anatomyofafailure\n\nMusic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@WhiteBatAudio\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@NanoverseProductions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@AimToHeadOfficial\n\n\n-\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023)\nRise of the Beasts is \u201cthe best Transformers movie yet.\u201d See it on the biggest screen possible.
