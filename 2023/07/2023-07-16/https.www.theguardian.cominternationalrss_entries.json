For obvious reasons, many of us have spent the past several years telling ourselves that these (insert your own insult here) politicians are outrageous anomalies, mere boils on the otherwise unblemished face of the body politic. Of course boils are nasty, their suppurating eruptions highly unpleasant for anyone who happens to be in the vicinity. We all know this. But we take comfort in the fact that they may also be treated. The condition, ultimately, is curable. The state \u2013 I won\u2019t say deep state \u2013 will carefully apply its very own brand of topical antibiotics, and the inflammation will eventually disappear, smoothness restored at last.</p><p>But is this really true? The writer Ferdinand Mount doesn\u2019t believe that Johnson and Trump are as exceptional as we might like to imagine \u2013 we must, Mount instructs, abandon the comforting illusions of historicism, the idea that liberal democracy is inevitably here to stay \u2013 and in his brilliant new book, he sets out to put them in context, looking for traces of their tactics and their effects in, among other strong men of history, Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, and General de Gaulle. The result is a kind of field guide to Caesarism; think of it as I-Spy an Autocrat<em>. </em>Mount uses his examples as a means of telling us what to look out for, from propaganda and wall-to-wall lies to a certain (weird) kind of charisma; from careful timing (the authoritarian bides his time) to national susceptibility (peak grievance is his moment). More encouragingly, he also examines how Caesars are unmade, a section that includes accounts of events as disparate as Catiline\u2019s attempt to seize control of the Roman state in 63BC, Indira Gandhi\u2019s imposition of a state of emergency in India in 1975, and, yes, both the toppling of Boris Johnson by Conservative MPs and the march on the Capitol after Donald Trump lost the American election to Joe Biden in 2020.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/big-caesars-and-little-caesars-julius-caesar-boris-johnson-ferdinand-mount-review-wonderfully-wry-field-guide-to-autocrats\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/big-caesars-and-little-caesars-julius-caesar-boris-johnson-ferdinand-mount-review-wonderfully-wry-field-guide-to-autocrats", "date_published": "2023-07-16T06:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Sunday with Jameela Jamil: \u2018First thing is an hour of coffee, doughnuts and gossip", "description": "The presenter talks about her dog named Barold, curry-cooking boyfriend and gross but amazing breakfast recipe<p><strong>Up early or lie in?</strong> I start being an assistant to two dogs at 7am.
