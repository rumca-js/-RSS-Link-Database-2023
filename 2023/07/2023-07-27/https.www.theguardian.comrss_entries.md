## Farewell David Silva, a little wizard full of ethereal, understated magic | Sid Lowe

<p>Whether it was with Manchester City, Real Sociedad or Spain, the midfielder’s grace and grit were a true joy to behold </p><p>One of the first things you notice in <a href="https://twitter.com/21LVA/status/1684550149681340416">David Silva’s farewell</a> is the pitches. Dusty pitches. Muddy pitches. Then perfect pitches. Almost as perfect, by the end, as the timing, the passing, the ease of it all, something about him that was almost ethereal. “Today is a sad day for me; today it is time to say goodbye to what I have dedicated my whole life to,” he says quietly. The video is short and understated, and there he is: a tiny boy and an adult not very much bigger, three decades of footage. Places change, the context too; the player doesn’t.</p><p>When Silva arrived in Eibar in 2004, he was 18. He was 5ft 7in, had never played a senior game and came from Arguineguín – population 5,004 – in the Canary Islands, land of dry, hard pitches and tidy, slow, technical players. Not the kind of footballer, or fighter, supposed to play up there. On loan from Valencia’s B team, Eibar’s fitness coach assured those who hadn’t seen him, which was all of them, that he could play, but he didn’t look quite right. What’s <em>he</em>, this small, timid kid, doing <em>here</em>? In the second division, in wet, cold Eibar, the embodiment of, well, something else entirely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/27/david-silva-retires-injury-tribute-manchester-city-spain-real-sociedad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a personal look at the shocking origins of minstrelsy, the actor speaks truth to power on the same channel that showed blackface in his living room when he was growing up</p><p>Ever since Thomas D Rice became the “father of American minstrelsy in the 1830s”, Black people have been mocked, bullied and humiliated by white performers darkening their skin to portray Blackness. Blackface runs the gamut of culture, appearing everywhere from Shakespeare productions to David Baddiel “impersonating” footballer Jason Lee on TV. But in 2023, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, with films, television shows and cartoons trying to erase blackface from its records.</p><p>As David Harewood on Blackface shows, scenes in which Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby and Judy Garland use blackface are now often edited out of their otherwise family-friendly movies. Many of the films and TV shows Harewood explains were once “mainstream British culture” can now only be found in archives where they are gathering dust, “shelved and put out of sight because the subject is too difficult or uncomfortable for people to face”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/27/david-harewood-on-blackface-review-a-shocking-deeply-moving-piece-of-television">Continue reading...</a>

There aren’t too many pages left to turn in this story. It’s always like this at the Oval, of course; it’s where series finish and another summer of Test cricket ends. This year it’s two months earlier than usual, so the schedule is out of kilter with the seasons. But the weather was autumnal, and so was the cricket. It was a cold, cloudy and floodlit day’s play between two tired teams, all loose shots and sloppy drops, jaffas and long hops, as if everyone was getting by on whatever dregs of adrenaline they had left after playing all these Tests in the past few weeks.</p><p>As always, there are questions in the air about whether the Test summer is going to take one or two of the players’ careers on its way with it. These are two old teams – 15 of the 22 players are over 30 – and as long as they go on these days, it seems likely that a lot of them will have quit Test cricket by the time Australia play here again in 2027.

Why won’t it do the same for trans people now?, 25 July</a>).</p><p>The stark reality is that we are trying to navigate a way forward in an atmosphere of deep mistrust and, from what I have witnessed among my trans friends, understandable anger and pain at how they have been vilified. Hate crimes against the trans community have soared, they have been smeared with accusations of being predators, and many have been left totally unsupported in their healthcare needs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/27/the-labour-party-is-walking-a-fine-line-on-trans-rights">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This 17-year-long wrongful imprisonment scandal has lessons for all levels of the criminal justice system</p><p>No criminal justice system that generates a miscarriage of justice like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/26/appeal-court-overturns-manchester-rape-conviction-of-man-who-spent-17-years-in-jail-andrew-malkinson" title="">Andy Malkinson’s</a> can feel at ease with itself. Mr Malkinson was convicted in 2004 of a rape he did not commit. He spent 17 years in prison before being released on licence in 2020. This week, the court of appeal quashed the original conviction on the basis that DNA evidence now made it unsafe. Mr Malkinson is thus a free man. But a large part of his life has been stolen from him. As he himself put it outside the law courts on Wednesday, he was effectively kidnapped by the state.</p><p>That is disturbing enough. Now it may get more Kafkaesque still. If Mr Malkinson receives financial compensation for his wrongful conviction and his years inside – for which, on the face of it, he has a strong claim – an assessor will be expected to deduct “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001p22t" title="">saved living expenses</a>” to reimburse the prison service for the cost of his board and lodging. It is jaw-dropping that an unjustly imprisoned person can be charged in this way for their own wrongful imprisonment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-freeing-of-andy-malkinson-a-case-for-reform">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is not enough time for the Tories to make good on their promise to create a ​​‘high-skill, high-wage’ economy</p><p>“Levelling up” is a political slogan with its own <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities" title="">department</a>, recognition for the role it played in winning the Conservatives the 2019 election. Tackling the blight of regional inequality was dubbed as the Tories’ “<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9463/" title="">defining mission</a>”. But data <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/pay-growth-londons-top-earners-has-driven-geographical-inequality-mean-earnings" title="">released</a> this week shows successive Conservative prime ministers have failed that task in one key way. The Institute for Fiscal Studies finds a widening geographical wage gap in the last three years – driven by income increases for well-paid workers in London which mask real wage cuts elsewhere.</p><p>Mean wages for employees living in the capital had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/25/big-pay-rises-london-uk-ifs-earnings-gap" title="">increased</a> by 5%, after adjusting for inflation, to £4,400 a month before tax. This is almost double the average national increase of 2.7%. Those living in London’s commuter belt saw pay increases of 4.5%. But many workers were now between 1% and 4% worse off than they were before Covid-19 arrived. Ministers have chosen year after year to set the price of labour in <a href="https://archive.li/O4Ezv" title="">education and public administration</a> at levels that ensure workers suffer real pay cuts. The jobs market is not just about demand and supply. Labour shortages have been most acute in low-paid sectors. Health and social care settings are struggling to fill roles. But real pay growth there is just 2.5% – below the UK average rise. Industrial action <a href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/who-is-on-strike-and-when/" title="">continues</a> because workers find themselves unable to bargain for better pay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/27/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-widening-regional-pay-gaps-expose-conservative-failure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Old-school practical effects date back to the silent era and are created with artistry and care. Is the novelty of CGI green-screen action wearing off in favour of craft models?</p><p>For the past 12 months, Hollywood has been facing a serious case of CGI fatigue, with critics tearing into would-be blockbusters for their over-reliance on it. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-is-prefab-marvel">In the New Yorker</a>, Richard Brody wrote that heavy effects work in Ant-Man 3 “instead of endowing the inanimate with life, subtract it”, while Ellen E Jones wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/the-little-mermaid-review-ariel-disney-halle-bailey">in the Guardian</a> that Little Mermaid was “rendered lifeless” by CGI. The Netflix rom-com You People, starring Jonah Hill, made headlines <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/you-people-jonah-hill-lauren-london-kiss-cgi-1235320295/">when it was revealed that the final kiss in the film was done with CGI</a> and the actor <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/christian-bale-says-green-screen-111100085.html">Christian Bale didn’t mince words</a> when he said working exclusively in front of green screens on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/09/thor-love-and-thunder-review-taika-waititi-chris-hemsworth-natalie-portman-sentimental-multimillion-dollar-romp">Thor: Love &amp; Thunder</a> was “the definition of monotony”.</p><p>As if in response, 2023 has delivered a buffet of practical-effects-driven films to the multiplex. Greta Gerwig used techniques dating back to silent film and soundstage musicals to bring her fantastical, hot-pink vision of Barbieland to life, Christopher Nolan reconstructed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer">Oppenheimer’s Trinity test</a> using miniatures, and Christopher McQuarrie hoisted a train carriage 80ft into the air in order to film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/09/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-review-tom-cruise-rebecca-ferguson-hayley-atwell-vanessa-kirby">Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’s</a> stomach-churning final stunt.

<p>Soaring rents, intrusive questions, baffling rules: landlords and agents behave as they please because tenants are 10 a penny</p><p>Earlier this year I found myself served notice on my flat after complaining to my landlord that he shouldn’t swear at us, his tenants. That is the standard I have grown to expect in the private rented sector, where ego runs roughshod over legal rights. With no way of challenging the notice, I needed to arrange some viewings – and fast.</p><p>I found a friend who was willing to share. With the average one-bed flat in the area where I live costing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/15/rent-outside-london-passes-1000-for-first-time-figures-show">more than £1,000</a> a month in rent alone, that’s a good friend to have. Every letting agent I phoned asked a whole ream of invasive screening questions: what was the nature of our relationship? Did we have pets? Did we smoke? Did we work from home? How many cars did I have? What was my annual income? Did I have a permanent contract? How much did I have in savings? I had to provide all this before I could learn the address. It’s clear from the get-go that agents call the shots, and applicants suffer whatever indignities they must.</p><p>The writer is in his 30s and lives in the south of England</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/27/twenty-renters-flat-britain-home-landlords-agents-tenants">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Kenneth Hamilton<br />(Prima Facie, two CDs)</strong><br />Pianistic flair and technical brilliance are the hallmarks of this winning record, in which Hamilton delivers Liszt’s transcriptions of works by Schubert, Wagner and others</p><p>In old age, as Kenneth Hamilton relates in the informative and entertaining notes accompanying his latest piano recording, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-liszt">Franz Liszt</a> was in the habit of advising his pupils that they might not have much success in playing his own music but that he did have “some modest ability” as a transcriber. The subsequent one and a half centuries have largely corrected that mistrust of one of 19th-century romanticism’s towering originals, and nowadays it is Liszt’s vast array of transcriptions and paraphrases, perhaps, that is undervalued. Having tackled a selection of original works in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/02/death-and-transfiguration-kenneth-hamilton-plays-liszt-review-liberating-and-refreshing">the first instalment of his Liszt series</a>, Hamilton now turns his attention to some of those reworkings.</p><p>The title of the collection, Salon and Stage, indicates the sources of his selection. There are transcriptions of songs by Schubert, Mendelssohn and Clara Schumann alongside more substantial works derived from opera. The best known piece here is probably Liszt’s paraphrase on Verdi’s Rigoletto – the Aida and Ernani paraphrases are included too – while the discs begin with the most spectacular of all these arrangements, the overture to Wagner’s Tannhäuser, which Hamilton plays with tremendous verve and intensity, every strand of the piano textures crystal-clear. For good measure he follows it with Song to the Evening Star from the same opera, complete with Liszt’s own coda. There’s more Wagner later on, with the deliciously decorated version of Am Stillen Herd from Die Meistersinger, and a witty, tricksy Spinning Song from Der Fliegende Holländer, glitteringly dispatched.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/kenneth-hamilton-plays-liszt-volume-2-salon-and-stage-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London</strong> <br />Of course Acosta has lost a little bounce after half a century, but the Cuban master still dances with care, specificity and dramatic flair<br /></p><p>When Carlos Acosta staged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/09/carlos-acosta-classical-farewell-michael-clark-company-to-a-simple-rock-roll-song-review">his Classical Farewell</a> in 2016, he said it was the last time he’d be donning his ballet tights. But like many performing icons, Acosta’s never really said goodbye and the tights are out again for a feelgood 50th birthday gala season.<br /><br />Fifty may be long past a dancer’s average retirement age (although he’s not the only one still pirouetting, see: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/26/dancer-alessandra-ferri-baryshnikov-nureyev-woolf-works-royal-ballet">Alessandra Ferri</a>) and Acosta’s never going to be the dancer he was 20 years ago – the bounce goes, the height of the arabesque – but you still want to watch him. Certainly the packed Opera House does, cheering in an un-English manner as the curtain rises to reveal a trim Acosta centre stage, dressed as the god Apollo.<br /><br />The Cuban has charisma in spades, and grace and graciousness. The trick in a show like this is to lean on what you can still do well, and reveal facets of a role we might not have noticed before. Apollo was a signature of Acosta’s in his heyday, George Balanchine’s young god ascending to Olympus. Acosta dances with care, specificity and dramatic flair. Unlike some portrayals that begin with Bambi-like naivety, Acosta can no longer play the ingenue; his Apollo already has authority, but this time, perhaps, is thinking about how to use it. It’s a portrayal of patriarchy Ryan Gosling’s Ken would love: charmed man born into power, plays with the muses (“Come hither! Begone!”), but these women are serene and self-possessed, especially Céline Gittens’ spritely Polyhymnia, delightful in precision and personality.</p><p>Acosta was always a masterful partner, and when he dances Swan Lake’s White Swan pas de deux with the divine Marianela Nuñez, the way he holds and turns her like a precious object magnifies her performance; he’s switched on at every moment. Their Manon pas de deux is more exposed, technically, but no less ardent. And where Acosta can’t dance the bravura steps he brings in some back-up, his nephew Yonah Acosta (a principal with Bavarian State Ballet) to do the barnstorming leaps for him in Le Corsaire. Not that Uncle Carlos doesn’t still have chops. A more recent contemporary work, Mermaid by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, plays on his swift, tight turns.<br /><br />It’s a thoughtfully chosen programme, with a piece by early mentor Ben Stevenson from Houston Ballet, and dancers from Birmingham Royal Ballet, where Acosta is now artistic director, including a near-naked Brandon Lawrence in Valery Panov’s Liebestod, marvelling at the male form to a crescendo of Wagner.<br /><br />We see Acosta’s own uneven choreography, his experimental remake of the Dying Swan, always moving forward.

<p>The playful Venezuelan American singer answers your questions, taking in Marc Bolan, haircuts from Cate Le Bon, and his ‘bottomless pit of regret’</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Your forthcoming album, </strong><strong>Flying Wig,</strong><strong> was produced by </strong><strong>Cate Le Bon</strong><strong>. What was it like to collaborate with her and what influence did she have on the album’s sound?</strong> <em>VerulamiumParkRanger<br /></em>We’ve been friends for years, which began with an impromptu haircut. There weren’t any scissors so I asked Cate to cut my hair with a fork. I was kidding, but she agreed. It hurt, but a bond was born. When it came to this record she was the only person I wanted to ask. It was supposed to be co-produced but five minutes into the first day and seeing how she approached it I knew I could trust this person. So I said: “Cate’s producing.” Brian Eno’s <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/another-green-world-mw0000650120">Another Green World</a> is one of my favourite albums of all time, but I attribute any Eno-ness [on Flying Wig] to Cate. There were so many times making the record when she’d go: “Why are you crying?” And I’d just say: “Because it’s so close to what’s in my head.” Just don’t ever ask her for a haircut.</p><p><strong>You’re often associated with the genre “freak folk”. What do you think of the term?</strong> <em>Peasywease<br /></em>I didn’t make it up and none of my friends ever used it. I’d rather be called nu metal! I hated the tag and wanted to avoid it at all costs. Twenty years later, my licence plate says: “King … <em>Queen</em> of freak folk.” I go to the airport and go, “Freak folk coming through.” It’s the tackiest, stupidest thing so I decided to embrace it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/devendra-banhart-reader-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alarm is spreading over kids’ thirst for the highly collectible, highly caffeinated Prime Energy, but it’s not first time companies have marketed energy drinks for children</p><p>A year and a half ago, two YouTubers and sports stars, Logan Paul and KSI, once rivals in the boxing ring, came together to fight a common enemy: Gatorade. They channeled their energies, and their combined 40 million social media followers, into a rival fruit-flavored sports drink they called Prime Hydration.</p><p>Their young fans across the US and UK were captivated. Almost immediately, the drink became a rare commodity, and therefore precious. Young people posted YouTube and TikTok videos of their epic quests through convenience stores to find it, sometimes at ridiculously marked-up prices. They charged each other exorbitant sums in playgrounds for open bottles and amassed collections of all nine flavors. Paul and KSI and their partner, Congo Brands, made a reported $250m from the brand – <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/logan-paul-ksi-prime-hydration-youth-sports/">which does, undeniably, actively target children in its marketing</a> – in 2022.

## Matildas stunned by Nigeria to leave Women’s World Cup hopes in balance

<p></p><p>All week, the question for the Matildas had been where the goals would come from, in the absence of injured captain Sam Kerr and, more recently, concussed striker Mary Fowler. On Thursday night, it turned out that was the wrong question. Nigeria put three past a shell-shocked Australia to silence the home crowd and leave the Matildas’ Women’s World Cup dreams hanging by a thread. Without Kerr and Fowler, the Australians found two goals – only they had not counted on conceding three.</p><p>How a game, and possibly a whole World Cup campaign, can change in a heartbeat. Following a dominant but goalless first 45 minutes, the Matildas opened the scoring in the first minute of injury time. When the moment came, the Matildas streamed towards their bench. After a week of adversity – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/matildas-captain-sam-kerr-out-of-world-cup-opening-matches-with-calf-injury">Kerr’s late withdrawal</a> before the team’s opening match, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/26/mary-fowler-ruled-out-concussion-matildas-injury-aivi-luik-womens-world-cup-nigeria-game">concussions to Fowler and Aivi Luik</a>, questions about whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/27/matildas-attacking-versatility-means-goals-will-come-despite-injuries">the Matildas could withstand this pressure</a> – the players knew instinctively where they wanted to be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/27/matildas-stunned-by-nigeria-to-leave-womens-world-cup-hopes-hanging-in-balance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Better under the sea than the land, the film director says, but marine experts beg to differ as the authorities meets to decide the future of deep-sea mining</p><p>In an exclusive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/22/james-cameron-interview-titan-deep-sea-mining">interview with Guardian Seascape</a> last Saturday, James Cameron argued that it is “less wrong” to mine the deep sea than mining on land. “I’ve seen an awful lot of seafloor,” said the Titanic director and accomplished deep-sea explorer. “And while there are some amazing creatures, they tend to be clustered in small habitats.

They are also forbidden from promoting their work, and that means no more interviews, no more larky YouTube videos and, crucially, no more gala premieres. Nothing demonstrated this better than this month’s Oppenheimer premiere in London.

## Dexys: The Feminine Divine review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>(100%)<br /></strong>Back after seven years and an apparent retirement, here’s another left turn in a career full of them: a baffling, brave record with some exceptionally beautiful songs</p><p>Diehard Dexys fans have long been primed to expect the unexpected. Almost from the moment they first appeared, as the 70s became the 80s, it was apparent that this was a band that would run entirely according to their leader Kevin Rowland’s own, occasionally imponderable, internal logic. The release of a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/dexys">Dexys</a> album invariably heralded complete change: a radically different look, a new sound, a new lineup.</p><p>But even said diehard fans might raise an eyebrow at The Feminine Divine. It is not so much that it doesn’t look, or occasionally sound, like any previous Dexys album. The cover drawing of the Hawaiian goddess Pele looks as if it belongs on the sleeve of a psychedelic trance compilation; there are musical diversions into sleazy Prince-ish electronic funk, jangling Balearic house pianos and slow-motion breakbeats topped with spoken word vocals that bring to mind early 70s Serge Gainsbourg – but diversions are par for the course with Dexys. It’s not that Rowland spends a considerable chunk of the album excoriating his younger self, the Rowland who made the albums that diehard fans first fell in love with. That is par for the course, too, at least in Dexys’ latter-day incarnation – their first album in 27 years, 2012’s One Day I’m Going to Soar, was a self-flagellating exploration of Rowland’s failings, filled with self-doubt and dissatisfaction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/dexys-the-feminine-divine-review">Continue reading...</a>

I was a young executive and the president came in and said, “I just came back from England and we signed a super talent.” I think she was 19 – it was Sinéad. This was before she shaved her head. When we heard [debut album] The Lion and the Cobra it was one of the greatest meetings I’ve ever attended – it was staggering, this record. It came out and we promoted it in a very unorthodox way. The key was getting it to go up the American college media charts, which it did and we took it to No 1. There were remixes of Mandinka and various other records – we had an MC Lyte version of I Want Your (Hands on Me).</p><p>Sinéad was terrific, so smart. And you could see at that young age she was very torn about stardom and recognition. The first day she landed, we decided to have dinner. We were going downtown, and I don’t know who made the decision to have a limousine but she wouldn’t get in. She wanted to go in a van. And then we got to Tower Records – the buzz was already out about Sinéad and a DJ was playing the record. She got very upset and said to me, “If there was a hole in the ground, I would crawl into it right now. Please tell him to take it off.” And I said to her very nicely, “It’s a homage. It’s respect.” She said, “<em>Please</em>, I don’t want to hear it. Please, please, please.” And we left. That was the contradiction of fame and recognition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/sinead-oconnor-ripped-up-the-popes-photo-on-tv-snl">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The dreamers and schemers who conjured up ideal futures, from Thomas More to Extinction Rebellion</p><p>In medieval Europe, poor people cheered themselves up by telling stories about the land of Cockaigne, where rivers flowed with wine, churches were made of puddings and it rained delicious fluffy cheese. Here was a fantasy of sensual excess, a caricature of the peasant dream of material abundance to keep you going through the dark ages.</p><p>Not all utopias have been quite so big on the pleasures of the belly. Indeed, as Niall Kishtainy demonstrates in this glorious book, the dreamers and schemers who conjure up ideal future states tend to downplay consumption on principle. The goal of utopians throughout history, from Thomas More and William Morris all the way up to Extinction Rebellion, has been for people to have as much as they need – not just food but housing, education and fresh air – and no more. Taking extra creates scarcity for someone else, and that is not the utopian way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/27/the-infinite-city-by-niall-kishtainy-review-a-history-of-utopias">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2009, two bookshops a week were closing in the UK and the days of physical books seemed numbered. Now, indie stores are booming. What explains the turnaround – and can it be sustained?</p><p>When Sarah Mullen was asked to set up a children’s book festival in a leafy suburb of Birmingham in 2012, she couldn’t find an independent bookseller to run the bookstall. “So we all rolled up our sleeves and did it ourselves,” she says. Pregnant with her third child, she had recently given up her job as a solicitor to work for the Bournville Village Trust. Mullen’s task was to set up the Bournville BookFest, which ran for 10 years before being brought to a halt by the Covid pandemic. But far from accepting defeat, she rolled up her sleeves once again and “pivoted the whole thing into a bookshop”. Two years on, <a href="https://www.bournvillehub.com/bookshop">the Bookshop on the Green</a> is thriving – a living rebuttal to the once widely held idea that the digital era meant certain death for the neighbourhood bookstore.</p><p>When I visit early on a Friday morning, a turquoise vintage Smith Corona typewriter holds centre stage in the Bookshop on the Green. Beside it stands Bradley Taylor, a poet whose job is to write poems on demand for anyone who asks. He has composed a lot of Batman and football poems for the children who pile in on Saturdays, he says, before sitting down to tap one out for me about the joy of bookshops. In the multitasking tradition of small retailers, Taylor is also assistant manager.

## Disney Illusion Island review – immune to its own charm

<p><strong>Nintendo Switch; Dlala Studios/Disney Interactive</strong><br />With the sweetness and delight associated with Disney absent, this new platform game is a strangely cynical waste of potential</p><p>Disney Illusion Island initially feels as though it is going to be a bright romp through a magical landscape, starring the beloved quartet of Disney mainstays – Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy. Surely we would follow them anywhere, iconic as they are. However, from the opening scene, it’s clear that the sweetness and delight associated with Disney stories is strangely absent. The writing is immediately off-putting: dry, cynical remarks pepper the dialogue, seemingly intended as ironic, but coming across as jaded and undercutting any sense of playfulness or wonder.</p><p>This jarring tone is disappointing: from the outset the game is operating at a distance from itself. For example, the magic words Mickey et al must use to defeat the end of level bosses are “Tee Be Dee” – to be determined. Even the heroes themselves clock this as arbitrary. It might be a funny jab if it was a one-off joke, but the whole narrative is hung around an overwrought self-awareness that we are on a constructed mission with conveniently placed help – and peril – set up along the way. Some games manage this ironic distance elegantly and with heart – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/aug/04/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review">Paper Mario: The Origami King</a> comes to mind – but in this instance, it becomes tiresome quite quickly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/27/disney-illusion-island-review-nintendo-switch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fugitive seeks refuge in a 1960s commune in the Lake District, in an energetic novel that captures an era</p><p>There are historical novels, and then there are fancy dress novels – though these often pass as historical novels. The historical novelist will try to get every detail right. Food, clothing and vocabulary have to be verifiably period. The writer of fancy dress fiction, by contrast, is more concerned with capturing the general vibe of the world they’re aiming to reinhabit. Attitude is everything.</p><p>The same holds for historical dramas on TV and film.

<p>The England striker remained prolific in a negative Spurs side, and statistics show he could reach new heights in Bavaria</p><p>Tottenham fans are resigned to Harry Kane’s departure this summer. While some are keen to put an end to the saga once and for all, Spurs losing their star striker would have a significant impact on Ange Postecoglou’s first season in charge. Only Erling Haaland (36) scored more goals than Kane (30) in the Premier League last term. There is an argument to be made that the latter’s goal haul in <em>this</em> Spurs side is more impressive than the Manchester City striker’s maiden campaign.</p><p>The question now is where next for Kane. Bayern Munich are the favourites to secure his services, even after <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/postecoglou-anger-harry-kane-shirt-27377464">a Bild reporter’s bizarre shirt stunt</a> during a recent Tottenham press conference. The aim now is for both Bayern and Spurs to agree a suitable fee before next month’s deadline, in order for Postecoglou to prepare for life after Kane. It wouldn’t be easy – the homegrown striker has scored at least 17 league goals in each of his past nine seasons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/27/harry-kane-bayern-munich-tottenham-goals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A seasoned correspondent looks back at life in the run-up to invasion</p><p>Bakhmut, called Artemivsk by the Russians, has become part of the grim roll call of the Ukraine war, one of the eastern cities blasted into a jagged hellscape of shattered buildings and rubbled roadways by the back-and-forth struggle between the two sides. Bakhmut even has the dubious distinction of being the place where the mercenary army of the infamous restaurateur turned <em>condottiere</em> Yevgeny Prigozhin battled for months to provide Vladimir Putin with a pyrrhic and temporary victory. It was also the city to which a 25-year-old Chris Miller, fresh from a stint as a local journalist in Oregon, was posted on joining the Peace Corps. This was 2009, before the 2013-14 Revolution of Dignity, before the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the start of an undeclared conflict in the south-eastern Donbas region, and a world away, it seemed, from the 2022 invasion.</p><p>Nonetheless, some of the early seeds of trouble were already growing. The young American – there to teach English and work in the local library – encountered people convinced he was a spy (he smiled too much) who fulminated against the politicians in Kyiv (not that they were any more keen on Moscow). In 2014, this sentiment would transform among a small but sadly armed minority into a conviction that they had to rebel, and the rest is bloody history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/27/the-war-came-to-us-by-christopher-miller-review-on-the-ground-in-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Augustin Mouchot’s solar-powered engine caused a stir at the World Expo in 1878 but it came too soon</p><p>In 1861, a French maths teacher, Augustin Mouchot, was so concerned that world supplies of coal would eventually run out that he invented ways of using solar power, starting with a solar water heater for baths and a solar oven for cooking. In 1866, he invented a solar-powered steam engine, using a trough of curved shiny metal to focus the sun’s rays on to a tube filled with water, turning the water to steam, which drove an engine.<br /><br />Mouchot showed his largest solar engine at the World’s Fair in Paris in 1878. The sun’s rays were concentrated in a reflective metal cone focused on a boiler attached to a heat-powered refrigeration device that produced blocks of ice. It caused a sensation, with audiences watching in amazement to see ice made by solar power. Mouchot also used a solar-powered steam engine to drive a printing press and a water pump for irrigation.<br /><br />The exhibition in 1878 also marked the rise to prominence of the internal combustion engine, at just the time when coal and oil were becoming much cheaper, and so interest in solar energy and engines rapidly faded.

<p>Not even a cast boasting Samuel L Jackson and Olivia Colman could save one of the least watched MCU projects ever. Does this mark the end of the world-dominating franchise?</p><p>If you want a sign of how far the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has fallen, look no further than this week’s Secret Invasion finale. Look at its comprehensive lack of impact. Look at the dearth of reaction it generated. For years, Secret Wars was held up as the One Big Story, one of the only things that could possibly top the breathless superhero orgy of Infinity War and Endgame. Yet it ended up being parped out on Disney+ as a series, and nobody on earth cared about it.</p><p>To be clear, this isn’t entirely Secret Invasion’s fault. For some time now, the entire MCU has been on the skids. Its CGI looks so bad that directors actively mock it in promotional videos, as Taika Waititi did for Thor: Love and Thunder. In return, the visual artists who work on the film complain about being overworked and overstretched in the service of film-makers who don’t seem to know what they want. Meanwhile, former stars such as Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr are becoming increasingly public in their misgivings about their roles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/27/secret-invasion-marvel-samuel-l-jackson-olivia-coleman">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Wait, am I the fool here?’: why our fears of being scammed are corrosive and damaging

<p>Is our tendency to expect the worst of people preventing us from supporting those who really need help?</p><p>In 2007, three experimental psychologists, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.127" title="">coined</a> the word “sugrophobia”, which would translate to something like a “fear of sucking”. The researchers – Kathleen Vohs, Roy Baumeister and Jason Chin – were looking to name the familiar and specific dread that people experience when they get the inkling that they’re “being a sucker” – that someone is taking advantage of them, partly thanks to their own decisions. The idea that psychologists would study suckers academically seems almost ridiculous at first. But, once you start to look for it, it becomes clear that sugrophobia is not only real, it is a veritable epidemic. Its influence extends from the choices we make as individuals to the society-wide narratives that sow distrust and discrimination.</p><p>The number of sucker synonyms alone suggests a cultural obsession: pawn, dupe, chump, fool, stooge, loser, mark and so on. Public debates about a wide range of social policies and technological advances feature inchoate fears about who’s going to be swindled next. Will ChatGPT help students cheat unwitting teachers? Is remote work popular since the Covid-19 pandemic because employees can slack off more easily?

<p>Teenagers are terrified of getting things wrong and risking failure, and who can blame them?</p><p></p><p>I run a lot of writing workshops in secondary schools and what I see is this: teenagers afraid to be creative. Even when I assure them they can’t get it wrong, they pause and agonise and look to their teacher, because they’ve been conditioned to mimic – it gets them good grades, after all.</p><p>Teenagers are terrified of getting things wrong and risking failure, and who can blame them? It’s not like being in primary school, when they were encouraged to play. Younger students have no trouble taking a few prompts and turning them into a story, because they delight in creating characters they have control over, and situations that are scary and funny and daring. But teenagers look at the blank page and freeze. “I don’t know,” they might say aloud, while internally their inner monologues say this: <em>If I get this wrong, I might fail this task, which will affect my grade, which will lower my Atar, and I mightn’t get into the course I want, and my life will be ruined. </em>(Don’t believe me? Ask a year 12 student.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/27/why-we-must-teach-our-teenagers-to-break-free-of-fear-and-fight-for-creative-freedom">Continue reading...</a>
