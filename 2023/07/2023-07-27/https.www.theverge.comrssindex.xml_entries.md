  <p id="iGCcV9">Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was <em>very</em> bullish on AI during the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23655620/intels-not-out-of-the-pc-slump-yet">Q2 2023 earnings call</a> — telling investors that Intel plans to “build AI into every product that we build.”</p>
<p id="K49E1F">Later this year, Intel will ship Meteor Lake, its first consumer chip with a built-in neural processor for machine learning tasks. (AMD <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23539638/amd-ryzen-7945hx-mobile-cpu-laptop-7940hs-ces">recently did the same</a>, following Apple and Qualcomm.) </p>
<p id="fBne73">But while Intel previously suggested to us that only its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21559670/intel-core-rebrand">premium new Ultra chips</a> might have those AI coprocessors, it sounds like Gelsinger expects AI will eventually be in everything Intel sells. </p>

  <p id="YNHsT2">Lionel Messi has taken MLS by storm, and that’s good news for Apple. The league partnered with Apple for a streaming service called MLS Season Pass, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752531/messi-mls-streaming-apple-tv-plus">which kicked off this season</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/14/23167555/apple-tv-mls-live-sports-streaming">will continue for the next decade</a>. And though Messi only played his first match for his new club, Inter Miami, on July 21st, it seems that viewership has already improved.</p>
<p id="QtCvR5">While Apple did not release specific numbers, in a statement, Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr explained that the week of July 19th–26th had “the 3 most-watched matches ever on MLS Season Pass, with viewers in almost 100 countries and regions around the world. And the fans for those matches were roughly split between the MLS Season Pass English and Spanish language broadcasts.”</p>

In an email, LinkedIn spokesperson Amanda Purvis tells <em>The Verge</em> the company is “always exploring” new ways to improve user experience on the platform.

  <p id="AtvVlc">We like to talk about range anxiety, but the reality is we’re dealing with charging anxiety when it comes to EVs. It’s great that an electric vehicle can cover 300 miles on a charge, but if the infrastructure is sparse and, in many cases, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308612/ev-charging-broken-unreliable-survey-jd-power">not working correctly</a>, the ability to cover hundreds of miles on a single charge just means you’re hundreds of miles from home if things go sideways. </p>

  <p id="Fa5qCo">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/">a new report by <em>Reuters</em></a>, Tesla performed “intentional inflation” about the range estimates of its electric vehicles under the guidance of CEO Elon Musk. </p>
<p id="igKV8D">An anonymous source said the automaker had started to use algorithms about a decade ago that would inflate projections at a full charge. Then, once Teslas reach a 50 percent state of charge, the numbers get a bit more realistic so drivers have a better chance of avoiding getting stranded, along with a 15-mile buffer that allows the vehicle to drive on battery after it reaches zero. According to the source, “Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged.”</p>

  <p id="yG9UsM">The next major release from <em>Pokémon Go</em> developer Niantic is launching very soon. The studio announced today that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23687404/monster-hunter-now-niantic-pokemon-go-ar-real-world"><em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a>, a collaboration with Capcom, will be available globally on September 14th, launching on both iOS and Android.</p>
<p id="Uv9BOO">The announcement was made as part of a lengthy presentation detailing more about how the game will actually work, including the weapons that’ll be available at launch (sword and shield, great sword, long sword, hammer, light bowgun, and bow) and how the cycle of hunting and gearing up will play out. <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> also has a clever feature called paintball, where players can mark monsters they come across so they can fight them later.</p>

  <p id="W4xm9z">In the finale of <em>The Witcher</em>’s third season — which also happens to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/29/23430147/liam-hemsworth-replacing-henry-cavill-season-4-the-witcher-netflix">the final episode where Henry Cavill will play the lead role</a> — our hero, Geralt of Rivia, spends most of his time in bed. This is not an exaggeration: after getting his ass thoroughly kicked in a previous episode, he’s stuck recuperating in a forest, trying his best to get healthy so he can continue his quest. It’s a bizarre choice that sidelines Geralt in what should, in theory, be an important moment for the series, the character, and the actor. Instead of sending Cavill out on a high note, the season just kind of... ends.</p>
<p id="sbbdkh">It didn’t have to be this way. When it debuted way back in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill">Netflix’s adaption of <em>The Witcher</em> proved to be a surprisingly faithful version...</a></p>

<p id="5Z1vMv">I’ve been patiently waiting for this moment since Nintendo announced it was introducing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591722/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-games-expansion-pack">Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games</a> to the service back in February. Released back in 2001, <em>Oracle of Ages/Seasons</em> are two of the most underrated titles within the retro <em>Legend of Zelda</em> franchise, often overshadowed by <em>Majora’s Mask</em> and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. Each version has its own unique gameplay mechanics that changed the world around them: <em>Oracle of Ages</em> being more puzzle-based and allowing Link to travel...</p>

  <p id="x9jyuZ">The European Commission is opening a formal antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s bundling of its Teams software with its Office productivity suite. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack originally filed an anti-competitive complaint</a> against Microsoft with the European Commission in July 2020, just months after a global pandemic began and the Microsoft Teams userbase started to grow rapidly.</p>
<p id="tWzmne">The European Commission will <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3991">now carry out an in-depth investigation</a> into whether Microsoft may have breached EU competition rules by tying or bundling Microsoft Teams to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.</p>

<p id="ufq9Vs">Slack elevated the status to an “outage” about 30 minutes later, at 5:57AM ET:</p>

  <p id="nTxwQm">There’s a new bipartisan bill to establish a new federal agency tasked with regulating online platforms. </p>
<p id="9UsYDT">The bill, sponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would create a new agency called the Digital Consumer Protection Commission that would be empowered to go after giant tech firms for a slew of anti-competitive behaviors and failing to protect consumer privacy.</p>
<p id="zPG4qL">“For years I have been trying to find ways to empower consumers against Big Tech,” Graham said in a statement Thursday. “I have heard too many stories from families who feel helpless in the face of Big Tech.

  <p id="m3M6yK">Reddit wrapped up its 2023 r/Place collaborative canvas on Tuesday, but if you missed it while it was happening or want to relive the evolution of the artwork, there’s a few ways to look back on the project.</p>
<p id="xht1WI">If you just want to take it all in as it happened, I’d recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/xjOMPka5WFo">Reddit’s official r/Place 2023 timelapse</a>, which I’ve also embedded at the top of this post. The coordination on display is impressive. While the project was going on, users would be able to place one individual pixel every few minutes, so to do any sort of complex artwork, groups of people across Reddit would have to work together to bring their designs to life. If you want to look at the evolution of r/Place more granularly, you can scrub through the canvas’...</p>
