Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Gad Saad discuss his newly published book, “The Saad Truth about Happiness: 8 Secrets for Leading the Good Life.” They also discuss the parasitic ability that ideas can have on the human mind, the predictors for left wing authoritarianism, the evolutionary argument for why humans are spiritual beings, the biblically rooted idea that divinity exists and manifests within rather than from without, the connections between religiosity and true happiness, and how the spirit of play is integral to living a meaningful life.

Gad Saad, Ph.D is a Canadian author, professor, podcaster, researcher, and public speaker. Saad was born in 1964 to a Jewish family (Considers himself culturally Jewish, though he is spiritually atheist) in Beirut, Lebanon, before his family fled to Canada in order to escape the Lebanese civil war in 1975. Saad earned his B.Sc. and M.B.A at McGill University, followed by an M.Sc. and a Ph.D from Cornell University. Since 1994, Saad has been a professor in marketing at the John Molson School of Business at Concordia University, Quebec. From 2012 to 2015, Saad was the editor of the scientific journal Evolutionary Psychology, and currently writes a blog for Psychology Today called Homo Consumericus.
