Audio Logs is back for a brand new series! It's the GameSpot show where the people behind the games you love tell the untold stories of how they were made so you can get a deeper understanding and greater appreciation of them.

This week we're joined by Half Mermaid's Sam Barlow, who talks about the inspiration for 2022's Immortality. He also discusses how the game's match cut mechanic works and, crucially, how it knows when to feed its spooky subverted scenes to players. 

Audio Logs airs every Thursday on GameSpot.
