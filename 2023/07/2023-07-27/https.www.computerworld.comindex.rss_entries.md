<p>Internet accessibility can be a major problem for the visually challenged. If a website doesn’t support screen readers, visitors with sight problems have to get help from someone else to use the site.</p><p>Given that most businesses or organizations, from healthcare to hospitality, primarily use websites to interact with their customers, you can understand the issue. Though the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) allows individuals to sue businesses for inaccessibility, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2023/07/disability-testers-keep-businesses-accessible-will-scotus-ban-them/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">appears poised to overturn that option</a>, which could create a variety of issues related to information access.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703569/generative-ai-could-be-a-critical-tool-for-the-visually-impaired.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Apple appears to have slipped in hints of a new feature in the latest beta of iOS 17 released this week — a new solid state Action Button. The multi-function button would replace the existing mute switch and is thought to be one of the marquee features coming to the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3701911/will-anyone-be-interested-in-the-iphone-15.html">high-end iPhone 15 Pro</a>.</p><p>Just like the Action Button on Apple Watch Ultra, this is a taptic button.

Critics, including many AI researchers, worry that if the technology continues unchecked, it could become increasingly dangerous, spread misinformation, invade privacy, steal intellectual property, take control of vital infrastructure, and even pose an existential threat to humankind.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703250/is-generative-ai-mightier-than-the-law.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
