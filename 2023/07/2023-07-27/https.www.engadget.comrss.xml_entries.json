In a statement, Meta\u2019s policy chief Nick Clegg said that the research suggests Facebook may not be as influential in shaping its users\u2019 political beliefs as many believe. \u201cThe experimental studies add to a growing body of research showing there is little evidence that key features of Meta\u2019s platforms alone cause harmful \u2018affective\u2019 polarization, or have meaningful effects on key political attitudes, beliefs or behaviors,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>The researchers\u2019 initial findings, however, appear to paint a more complex picture.</p><p>One study <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1ODYtMDIzLTA2Mjk3LXciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU2NGJjNmE0LTQyMmEtNGE2Mi1hM2YyLTRlMTQzY2ExNDYxOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfskyIlcBR7H5ROm8DVMpmCaOs7B4dp40OPYgC9EnSog&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06297-w\"><ins>in </ins><em><ins>Nature</ins></em></a> looked at the effect of so-called \u201cecho chambers,\u201d or when users are exposed to a large amount of \u201clike-minded\u201d sources.

Only a &quot;limited number&quot; got an alert for a second tremor, investigators say.</p><p>We've asked Google for comment. Product lead Micah Berman tells the <em>BBC </em>millions of people in Turkey received earthquake alerts, although the company hasn't shared data indicating widespread notifications. Google did show a handful of social media posts from people who said they received a warning, but only one was for the first quake. Berman says he doesn't have a &quot;resounding answer&quot; as to why social networks were quiet about alerts, but does note the nature of a quake and the reliability of internet access can affect the system.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Android Earthquake Alert System uses the accelerometer (that is, motion sensing) in phones to effectively crowdsource warnings. If many phones vibrate at the same time, Google can use the collective data to find the epicenter and magnitude of the quake, automatically sending a warning to people who are likely to feel the brunt of the shaking. While there's no more than a minute's notice, that can be enough time to find cover or evacuate. The technology can theoretically help people in areas where conventional warnings are unavailable.</p><p>The concern is that the system might have failed during a strong (7.8-magnitude) earthquake. Even if it worked, it's not clear how many people should and do receive warnings in cases like this, not to mention milder incidents. Without more data, it's not certain that Android's quake alerts are reliable substitutes for traditional warnings over radio and TV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/androids-earthquake-warning-system-failed-in-turkey-according-to-the-bbc-210612253.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/androids-earthquake-warning-system-failed-in-turkey-according-to-the-bbc-210612253.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-27T21:06:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "X placed ads from Discovery, Showtime and USA Today on a neo-Nazi account", "description": "<p>X (formerly Twitter) continues to struggle to keep advertisers on board, and the brands that have stuck around are seeing ads show up in unexpected places.

Tesla updated its mobile app to remove appointment options for users asking about range, and instead gave them the choice of asking a company representative to call.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The complaints don't stem from technical flaws, the insiders claim. Instead, Tesla supposedly began tinkering with range estimates roughly a decade ago to exaggerate figures when an EV was fully charged. Cars would only begin showing more accurate range numbers below a 50 percent charge. The company also gave vehicles a 15-mile range buffer when the estimate reached zero, much as combustion engine cars still have fuel in the tank when the gauge reads &quot;empty.&quot;</p><p>It's not certain if Tesla continues to rely on code to exaggerate range, if the report is accurate. Tesla has disbanded its public relations team and isn't available for comment. However, the company has already faced criticism and legal trouble over range concerns. The EPA asked Tesla to slightly reduce its range estimates from the 2020 model year onward, and South Korea <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-tesla-fine-ev-range-disclosure-cold-weather-153655339.html\">fined Tesla $2.2 million</a> in January for allegedly failing to disclose that range can drop in cold weather.</p><p>Tesla isn't alone in embellishing range, but may be worse than most. The standards body SAE International recently <a href=\"https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0349/\">published</a> a study indicating that EVs typically fall 12.5 percent short of their official range in highway driving. One of the co-authors, Gregory Pannone, tells <em>Reuters</em> that Tesla's shortfall was a much higher 26 percent. Brands like Ford, Mercedes and Porsche also offer more conservative estimates by using an EPA formula instead of running extra tests.&nbsp;</p><p>Elon Musk's firm isn't necessarily cheating, as Pannone explains. Instead, it may be exploiting EPA range procedures more aggressively than its peers. If true, though, that's still problematic for buyers who might never come close to the range they expected.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-allegedly-formed-a-team-to-quash-driving-range-complaints-164750696.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tesla-allegedly-formed-a-team-to-quash-driving-range-complaints-164750696.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-27T16:47:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Researchers\u2019 app could help people with visual impairments navigate the NYC subway", "description": "<p>Researchers at NYU\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and Grossman School of Medicine have created an app to help people with visual impairments navigate New York City\u2019s subway system.

This is something that the Xbox Series consoles simply don\u2019t have.</p><p>Meanwhile, the PS5 offers a library of console exclusives including <em>God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k</em>, <em>Returnal</em>, the <em>Demon\u2019s Souls </em>remake, Insomniac\u2019s Spider-Man series, every <em>The Last of Us</em> game and re-release, and a litany of Final Fantasy titles. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0f845666-5cc0-42c7-863d-d873ae1b6087&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=PlayStation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZjg0NTY2Ni01Y2MwLTQyYzctODYzZC1kODczYWUxYjYwODciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGxheXN0YXRpb24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3BzLXBsdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNjA1ZDc0NS1mNTQyLTQ0ZDAtYmZmNy0zZGE5YmMwZTg3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdjkii3KgcxDuw2nUj5Qg9PVudYh5KkEe8dEKkH5BCce&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fps-plus%2F\">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, the highest tier of Sony\u2019s monthly subscription service, adds cloud streaming, freebies and a catalog of games to download at any time.

While we'd still like to see more exclusives on Xbox, there are major titles on the horizon like <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Redfall</em> and the revamped <em>Forza Motor Sport</em>. PC gamers may also appreciate cross-purchases between Windows and Xbox titles, as well as the ability to stream games from the cloud using Game Pass. Sure, Sony still has a stranglehold on big-budget narrative games, but the sheer wealth of offerings on Microsoft's platforms \u2014 including small indies, classic franchises and a ton of great games via EA Play (included with Game Pass for PCs and Ultimate) \u2014 is staggering.</p><p>It used to be that you'd have to stick with the same console all of your friends are using, but these days the availability of cross-play multiplayer on most titles makes that consideration moot. If you want to play <em>Call of Duty </em>with your friends, it doesn't really matter if you get an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5. So the best advice now? Base your choice on the exclusives you'd like to play, as well as the potential subscription benefits. If you want to see where Master Chief goes next, or are just tired of paying full price for first-party games and some indies, you'll probably be happiest with a Series X and Game Pass. <em>\u2013 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2>Best budget console: Xbox Series S + Game Pass</h2><p></p><p>The<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9YYm94LVMvZHAvQjA4RzlKNDRaTj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTYwNWQ3NDUtZjU0Mi00NGQwLWJmZjctM2RhOWJjMGU4NzQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5tvXXcxcwzqSc_8BjIFCPFrrzKNgDPICXIq19zzS0L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXbox-S%2Fdp%2FB08G9J44ZN&amp;uuid=KoI0joQIoP6aSaY034405\"> Xbox Series S</a> packs enough power to play the latest and greatest games, but it truly shines as a semi-portable Game Pass machine. The Series S is a compact console that does not have a disk drive, and it typically costs $300 (though it\u2019s frequently on sale for $250 to $270). This little rectangular baby can play games at resolutions higher than 1080p, though it won\u2019t hit 4K, and it\u2019s less powerful overall than the Series X.

The Steam Deck came out in February 2022 and quickly emerged as a popular PC portable for people who wanted to spend time away from their desks, but not their Steam libraries. It\u2019s a chunky handheld gaming console with dual analog sticks and trackpads; standard face buttons, bumpers and triggers; four rear clickers, and a 7-inch LCD touchscreen. It\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\"> big and strangely beautiful</a>, and plays most PC games just fine.</p><p>The Steam Deck starts at $400 and tops out at $650, making it relatively affordable in the world of<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/handheld-gaming-pc-retro-indie-handhelds-steam-deck-playdate-150038001.html\"> PC portables</a>. The Steam Deck is a little too big and battery-sucking to be a must-have carry-on while traveling, but it\u2019s perfect for cuddling on the living room couch \u2013 with a supportive pillow and power outlet nearby. <em>\u2013 J.C.</em></p><h2>Best for first time gamers: Nintendo Switch Lite</h2><p></p><p>Nintendo has a history of making tank-like portable consoles, and the<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtTGl0ZS1CbHVlL2RwL0IwOTJWVDFKR0Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2MDVkNzQ1LWY1NDItNDRkMC1iZmY3LTNkYTliYzBlODc0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeJyPYLs3KmIeIWKy3q0sgGuVHaOVdgPGgNqqeIyd729&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Blue%2Fdp%2FB092VT1JGD&amp;uuid=4TYsim5VjU5AQwD646407\"> Switch Lite</a> is no exception. It's just as fast as its larger sibling, but since it has integrated controls, you won't have to worry about any Joy-cons flying away if it's dropped. The Switch Lite's 5.5-inch screen and smaller frame always makes it easier for tiny hands to hold, something I've found particularly useful as my four-year-old daughter is finally getting into video games. There's a wide variety of child-friendly content available on the Switch, but we'd recommend diving into the classic of library Nintendo titles via the console's online service. Kids will ultimately figure out <em>Minecraft </em>on their own, but it's up to the older generation to instill the value of proper platforming with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. <em>\u2013 D.H.</em></p><h2>Best handheld gaming console for commuting: Nintendo Switch Lite</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtTGl0ZS1CbHVlL2RwL0IwOTJWVDFKR0Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2MDVkNzQ1LWY1NDItNDRkMC1iZmY3LTNkYTliYzBlODc0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeJyPYLs3KmIeIWKy3q0sgGuVHaOVdgPGgNqqeIyd729&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Blue%2Fdp%2FB092VT1JGD\">Switch Lite</a> is by far the cutest handheld gaming console on the market today and this is just one reason it\u2019s ideal for use in public. The Switch Lite is a tiny, lightweight handheld with a 5.5 inch LCD touchscreen and basic gamepad buttons, and it\u2019s sold in a variety of colorways and special editions. It feels natural to pull out while on the bus, riding the subway, in a waiting room, or just hanging out at a cafe, bar or park. It\u2019s a low-profile portable that offers a library of engaging games from Nintendo and beyond, including exclusive franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Mario Kart, Smash Bros., Bayonetta, Animal Crossing and Kirby.</p><p>In comparison to the standard Switch, the Lite model is sturdier for everyday commutes because it doesn\u2019t have detachable controllers and it takes up less space in your bag. It\u2019s also about $150 cheaper than the larger <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2hUTS1OZW9uLUJsdWUtSm95JUUyJTgwJTkxQ29uVE0tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwQkZKV0NZVEwvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxlLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNjA1ZDc0NS1mNTQyLTQ0ZDAtYmZmNy0zZGE5YmMwZTg3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfHWbvZ3H4BVL5-__W3Ql06J0eBlri8QkH9GvPXFLhvz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-SwitchTM-Neon-Blue-Joy%25E2%2580%2591ConTM-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0BFJWCYTL%2F\">Switch</a>, at $200. <em>\u2013 J.C.</em></p><h2>Best for air travel: Nintendo Switch</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2hUTS1OZW9uLUJsdWUtSm95JUUyJTgwJTkxQ29uVE0tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwQkZKV0NZVEwvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWxlLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNjA1ZDc0NS1mNTQyLTQ0ZDAtYmZmNy0zZGE5YmMwZTg3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfHWbvZ3H4BVL5-__W3Ql06J0eBlri8QkH9GvPXFLhvz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-SwitchTM-Neon-Blue-Joy%25E2%2580%2591ConTM-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0BFJWCYTL%2F\">Switch's</a> hardware may be showing its age, but it's still the best way to get some gaming in during long flights. Having a 6.2-inch screen (or 7-inches with the pricier Switch OLED) in your hands makes it easy to ignore annoying seat neighbors, countless delays and all of the other indignities of air travel. The Switch should also survive for several hours of gameplay, and it's easy to charge for longer journeys. While the Steam Deck may be tempting, it's also so large it'll likely fill up much of your backpack. The Switch can still fit alongside your computer and other gear, and its game library is so vast, you'll never be left wanting for things to play. <em>\u2013 D.H.</em></p><h2>Best retro gaming console for nostalgia: Retroid Pocket 3</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SZXRyb2lkLVBvY2tldC1IYW5kaGVsZC1NdWx0aXBsZS1FbXVsYXRvcnMvZHAvQjBCOFM5R0g4VD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1sZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTYwNWQ3NDUtZjU0Mi00NGQwLWJmZjctM2RhOWJjMGU4NzQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVsnRqtesX7qDfs4kLbW-WqJzsbmsnuUUYD3njwurA23&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRetroid-Pocket-Handheld-Multiple-Emulators%2Fdp%2FB0B8S9GH8T\">Retroid Pocket 3</a> is an accessible, streamlined <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/retroid-pocket-3-irl-153508438.html\">emulation machine</a> that\u2019s capable of handling games from the sixth generation down \u2013 that\u2019s anything up to the GameCube and PlayStation 2.

This little device is tinier than a Switch Lite and it has a 4.7 inch LCD touchscreen \u2013 that\u2019s smaller than Nintendo\u2019s latest handheld but bigger than the screen of a classic Game Boy, for what it\u2019s worth.

For $10 a month, you can play hundreds of games, including all of Microsoft's first-party software, as well as major titles like <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> and <em>A Plague Tale Requiem</em>. Even better, Microsoft-owned titles are available the day they're released! Bump up to the $15 Game Pass Ultimate tier and you'll also get access to cloud gaming, which lets you stream select titles to your phone, computer and even some TVs. The sheer variety of content on Game Pass makes it hard to stomach paying full price for a game ever again.</p><p>Sony's response to Game Pass amounts to an evolution of its <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0f845666-5cc0-42c7-863d-d873ae1b6087&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=PlayStation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZjg0NTY2Ni01Y2MwLTQyYzctODYzZC1kODczYWUxYjYwODciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGxheXN0YXRpb24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3BzLXBsdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNjA1ZDc0NS1mNTQyLTQ0ZDAtYmZmNy0zZGE5YmMwZTg3NDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdjkii3KgcxDuw2nUj5Qg9PVudYh5KkEe8dEKkH5BCce&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fps-plus%2F\">PlayStation Plus service</a>.

Until Sony caves, having release day access to titles makes Game Pass the obviously better subscription service. <em>\u2013 D.H.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-27T15:30:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony has sold over 40 million PS5 consoles", "description": "<p>It didn't take long for Sony to cross another PlayStation 5 milestone.

Soon after, Mycle got in touch to say its own offering, the Mycle Cargo, was exactly the bike I was looking for. It added that the struggles I\u2019d had with heavy loads and steep hills wouldn\u2019t be a problem for its affordable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rad-power-radrunner-plus-electric-bike-irl-153525330.html\">cargo longtail</a>. After spending the better part of three months riding this thing around, I can heartily agree that it ticks many of the boxes I was hoping for. I may not have fallen head-over-heels in love with it in the way I had hoped, or expected to, but I\u2019m sure it could find a place in the homes of many cyclists.</p><p>Mycle is a British-built e-bike which fits into the same category as Tern\u2019s GSD, with a step through frame and beefy longtail. Support struts and plastic panels enclose the thick rear wheel, which houses the surprisingly-powerful 250W hub motor. Now, I won\u2019t bang this drum too much, but this thing is <em>less than half the price</em> of some of its competitors in the cargo longtail space. Here in the UK, a Tern GSD or Yuba\u2019s Spicy Curry will set you back around \u00a35,000 before you start picking optional extras. By comparison, the Cargo\u2019s retail price is \u00a31,999, which will get you the standard setup, including integrated front and rear lights.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Mycle Cargo bike in a wood.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/c138e920-e437-11ed-b5fe-b933b768d735\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The model I tested, meanwhile, had a few luxuries added on, including an LCD display which adds \u00a3150 to the price.

These bikes need to be affordable to win over would-be buyers who can quite reasonably say that five grand would get you a decent second-hand car and cover a year\u2019s running costs. And while two thousand pounds is no small investment for a lot of people right now, it may wind up saving them cash if it helps them get around without a car. You can certainly carry at least two kids on the rear deck, and can probably mount a third seat up front should you need.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Mycle Cargo bike in a wood.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/d4650d80-e437-11ed-9ebd-b70ddb1887f6\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Mycle Cargo measures in at 187cm (73.6in) long and 73cm (28.7in) wide, with a quoted kerb weight of around 80 pounds. Even in my fairly spacious house, it took up a lot of room, and it requires a decent amount of effort to get it up my front steps. Which is a euphemistic way of saying that if you\u2019re in a small space, or don\u2019t have great upper body strength, you might need to look for an alternative. I found that, the longer I rode it, the easier it became to handle, so I think my time with the bike has contributed to some minor enswolening of my arms.</p><p>The bike arrives half-assembled, and you\u2019ll need to get a hex key to screw in the footplates, caboose, front basket and fit the handlebars.

If you can, get a bike store to do the finishing off for you, especially if you\u2019ve got chunky hands and a tendency to swear in frustration after the screw falls out three times in a row.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Mycle Cargo bike in a wood.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/38820520-e438-11ed-b299-501f1091c265\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The bike is fitted with a wonderfully comfortable seat, and is equipped with a modest, but solid, set of components. There\u2019s Tektro mechanical disc brakes and a 7-speed Shimano Altus set, which might provoke a sniff or two from higher-minded cycling types. Both are what I\u2019d call modestly priced, and aside from the odd stiff gear change, neither felt out of place, with good braking even on steep hills. It\u2019s also clear that cost savings in this area help get the overall price down without causing too much pain for the rider on a daily basis. One nitpick I do have is that the built-in double-sided kickstand is sturdy, it still feels a little weak and I wish it was a bit thicker.</p><p>Now, from here on out, we\u2019ll be talking about my experience of riding Mycle Cargo, and I\u2019d say that I\u2019m a general-purpose cyclist at best. Certainly, I\u2019m open about my deficiencies, and hope that I can offer a better perspective for would-be riders than a road-hardened professional. If you\u2019re a novice rider looking for a cargo bike, then these are the issues you\u2019ll probably want to be mindful of, whereas more experienced riders can probably just look at the price, what you get for that chunk of cash, and head to the Mycle website to pre-order one.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Mycle Cargo bike in a wood.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/51775530-e438-11ed-8e6b-d348869f8585\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The issue with weight, for instance, is going to be harder for novices to deal with compared to people who already own more than one pair of waterproof trousers. Mycle Cargo is heavy and, in my early rides, proved to be more than I could handle in terms of its balance issues. Even with fat tyres, which are designed to improve balance, I found it very easy to lose control of this thing at lower speeds. I tried to take the kids to school in rush-hour traffic, and pushed off in a quiet moment, only to find the bike started to wobble. I tried to correct it, but in doing so nearly pitched sideways into a van coming the other way.</p><p>Fortunately, this problem did eventually go away, but it took me a lot of (solo) trial-and-error and some counterintuitive tyre-deflating before I put the kids back on it again. Once I\u2019d got the Mycle set up the way I did, riding became a lot easier and I had some fairly glorious runs around the local area. But don\u2019t expect to climb on this in the first hour or two and expect to be zooming around your town without a care in the world. The learning curve is there, and it is steep, and I found the damped steering \u2013 designed to prevent you making risky, aggressive turns \u2013 was a bit of a pain in my early trips.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Mycle Cargo bike in a wood.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/81a59f50-e438-11ed-bfbf-0a95b8b00ef9\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Once you get past the slow-speed wobbles, however, do you find Mycle Cargo\u2019s comfort zone, which is unleashing its vast reserves of power. Accelerate a bit, and you\u2019ll find riding the bike is easy and comfortable, but if you only run it on flat ground, you\u2019ll miss out on its party piece. My kids\u2019 school is at the top of a hill that measures around 11 degrees (or more) at its gentlest point. And I\u2019ve ridden a few 250W hub motor bikes up there with varying levels of comfort, and even a light single-seater can sometimes struggle.</p><p>This thing? With all the added weight in its frame and two kids in the back? I have never seen a bike move this fast. It shot up the hill faster than the car I was passing, and I very quickly had to dial down the assistance level to stop feeling uncomfortable. When that pedal assist kicks in after a second or so\u2019s delay, you feel as if you\u2019re being towed by a car. It ships with a throttle but I don\u2019t think I was ever compelled to use it outside of trying to intentionally test it, because one full turn of the pedal and this thing moves like a rocket.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Mycle Cargo bike in a wood.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/9fdebe70-e438-11ed-babe-e4fd7c53d1f6\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I cannot overstate how much power Mycle has managed to wring out of this motor, to the point where I\u2019d almost want to joke that it\u2019s really a 500W motor with the wrong label. I cannot imagine anyone riding this thing and thinking that it\u2019ll do anything but conquer any terrain you put in front of it. If I had infinite time and money, I\u2019d take this to France and irritate everyone doing a mountain cycle climb as I lap them while lazily pedaling my way to lunch. The downside is the lack of refinement; dial down the electric assist and you\u2019ll very quickly feel a lurch as the motor steps down a notch.</p><p>That\u2019s really where your money isn\u2019t going with a bike like this \u2013 into the refinements that would see it go from a two grand bike to a five grand one. I can think of plenty of tweaks I\u2019d like to see, including a lighter weight, lower center of gravity and better handling. But if the choice is this bike or one that\u2019ll cost more than twice the price, I\u2019d rather keep my cash in the bank.</p><p>You can pre-order the <a href=\"https://www.mycle.co.uk/products/cargo-electric-bike\">Mycle Cargo</a> now, with deliveries slated for some point in August. That will come with a few tweaks, including upgraded brakes \u2013 hydraulic, rather than mechanical \u2013 and fittings for a new rear-caboose. The new model will also be able to use a new clubhouse-style weather tent to keep your kids dry on windier days, but there\u2019s no word on how much that\u2019ll cost you at present.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mycle-cargo-is-almost-the-longtail-of-the-people-ive-been-waiting-for-130046591.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mycle-cargo-is-almost-the-longtail-of-the-people-ive-been-waiting-for-130046591.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-27T14:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Photoshop can now use generative AI to expand images", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/adobe-adds-generative-ai-editing-to-photoshop-110034887.html\">Generative AI in Photoshop</a> is now useful for more than filling in gaps.

Drag the crop tool beyond the original picture size and you can add material with or without a text prompt.

They\u2019re smarter, more powerful and (marginally) better at avoiding chair legs during a cleaning session than they ever were before, and some of them even have built-in mopping functionality and a penchant for pet hair. Plus, you don\u2019t have to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">shell out as much money</a> to get one either. It\u2019s safe to say the space is pretty saturated now, with established names like iRobot and Shark competing with companies like Anker and TP-Link that are not necessarily known for their dirt-sucking tech. With all those choices, deciding which is going to be the best buy isn\u2019t as simple as it was a few years ago. We tested out many of the newest models available now to see how they stack up against each other and to help you choose the best robot vacuums for your needs. Here are our top picks.</p><h2>Are robot vacuums worth it?</h2><p>We tackled this question when we reviewed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">budget robot vacuums</a> and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors \u2013 just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That\u2019s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They\u2019re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don\u2019t have the same level of suction you\u2019ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While WiFi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine\u2019s attention on a specific area, which almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 mimics the spot-cleaning you\u2019d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.</p><h2>What to look for in a robot vacuum</h2><figure><img alt=\"iRobot Roomba 981 robot vacuum\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/6f4230f0-0be4-11eb-b3f6-db9714009fa4\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">iRobt / 1996-2001 AccuSoft Co., All rights reserved</div></figure><p>As we explained in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">budget guide</a>, WiFi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren\u2019t WiFi connected, though, so it\u2019s best to double check before you buy cheap. WiFi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.</p><p>Suction power is another important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it\u2019s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don\u2019t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots.</p><p>Ultimately, we recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job cleaning carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have \u201cmax\u201d modes as well, which ups the suction power but also typically eats at battery life faster than the \u201cnormal\u201d cleaning mode.</p><p>Past a certain price threshold, you\u2019ll find advanced features like home mapping, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home\u2019s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or areas. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children\u2019s toys. Higher-end models like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html\">iRobot\u2019s j7 series</a> even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.</p><p>We\u2019re also now starting to see more robot vacuums with mopping capabilities. Machines with this feature have a water reservoir either built into the robot\u2019s chassis or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part. Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human\u2019s job.</p><p>Finally, for peak convenience, consider a robot vacuum that comes with a self-emptying base. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine\u2019s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base \u2013 that means you won\u2019t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you\u2019ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks. Just keep in mind that most self-emptying bases require proprietary garbage bags \u2013 another long-term expense you\u2019ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you\u2019ll still have to clean up that yourself.</p><h2>Best midrange robot vacuum: Shark AI Robot Vacuum with Base</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TaGFyay1SVjI1MDJBRS1TZWxmLUVtcHR5LUNhcGFjaXR5LU5hdmlnYXRpb24vZHAvQjA5Sjg4R05XMz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jby0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzRkODUyMDctZGQ2OS00MDExLTk3ODYtY2Q5NGUyZmJlYTlkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZq0VHuEZj_B57XCVYGC-grcbJG3gFOFhwAzowhk8gQQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FShark-RV2502AE-Self-Empty-Capacity-Navigation%2Fdp%2FB09J88GNW3\">Shark\u2019s RV2502AE AI robot vacuum</a> with self-emptying base ticks all of the boxes that a mid-range machine should. It offers reliable cleaning performance, its mobile app is easy to use and it produces accurate home maps. On top of that, its base is bagless, which means you won\u2019t have to spend money every few months on garbage bags for your robotic vacuum.</p><p>Setting up the Shark is as simple as taking it and its base out of the box, plugging the base in and downloading the companion mobile app to finish things up. The machine connects to WiFi, allowing you to control it via the app when you\u2019re not at home, or using Google Assistant and Alexa voice commands. The first journey the Shark makes is an \u201cExplore Run,\u201d during which it produces a map of your home that you can then edit from the mobile app.</p><p>The Shark produced a pretty accurate floorplan of my two-bedroom apartment, and I was happy to see a \u201cre-explore\u201d option that I could use if the map wasn\u2019t up to my standards. With a completed map, you\u2019re then asked to label rooms in your home. That way, you can send the Shark to only the bedroom for more direct cleaning jobs, select \u201cno-go\u201d zones and more.</p><p>The first few times I ran the Shark robot, I had it clean my whole apartment. I was impressed by how quiet it was \u2013 or rather, how much quieter it was compared to other robo-vacs I\u2019ve tried. You\u2019ll have to turn up the volume on your TV if it\u2019s cleaning in the same room, but it\u2019ll be hard to hear when it\u2019s sucking up debris down the hallway. It also did a decent job maneuvering its way around the cat toys I left out on the floor. The device\u2019s object detection feature claims it can avoid things as small as four inches, but I found that it was much better at sensing and moving around the three-foot-long cat tunnel on my floor than the many tiny mouse toys.</p><p>But even if Mr. Mouse caught the edge of the Shark\u2019s wheels now and then, the robo-vac took it all in stride. One thing I look for when testing robot vacuums is how much attention they need from me during cleanings. The best ones are hands-free and require no extra attention at all \u2013 once they start a job, they\u2019re smart enough to putter around your home, move around objects and return to their base when they\u2019re finished. With Shark\u2019s robo-vac, I never had to tend to it when it was cleaning. Now, I did my due diligence and picked up pieces of clothing and charging cables off the ground before running the Shark (ditto for every other robot vacuum I tested), so those things were never in the way. Most companion apps will actually remind you to do this before starting a cleaning job.</p><p>This Shark machine comes with a self-emptying base, so it will empty its dustbin after every cleaning run \u2013 and also during a job if its bin gets full before it\u2019s done. In the latter situation, the Shark will go back to cleaning automatically after it\u2019s freed up its bin. That\u2019s a great feature, but I found the best thing about the base to be its bagless design. Shark\u2019s device is unlike most other robot vacuum clean bases because you don\u2019t have to keep buying proprietary garbage bags to outfit the interior of the base. When you want to empty the base, part of it snaps off and opens to eject debris, and it easily locks back in place when you return it. Not only is this quite convenient, but it also brings the lifetime cost of ownership down since you won\u2019t be buying special bags every few months.</p><p>Its worth noting that Shark has a couple of models that are similar to the RV2502AE that just have a different color scheme, a 30- versus 60-day self-emptying base capacity and other minor differences. The biggest feature that would impact how you use the machine is the clean base capacity: we recommend springing for the 60-day models if you want to interact as little as possible with your robo-vac.</p><h2>Runner up midrange: Roomba j7</h2><p></p><p>Not much has changed since Amazon bought iRobot a little while back \u2013 the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk0TlczMThGP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNGQ4NTIwNy1kZDY5LTQwMTEtOTc4Ni1jZDk0ZTJmYmVhOWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUaQjsLbJk5-A_tWoDK_gIJ96y9XC3rhDzu1IsC1wWwE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB094NW318F&amp;uuid=PmHs6FH5VqPkRRnY23240\">Roomba j7</a> remains a great option if you want the latest obstacle avoidance technology from the company in an attractive package. The $600 j7 doesn\u2019t come with a clean base, but you can get <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9pUm9ib3QtUm9vbWJhLVNlbGYtRW1wdHlpbmctUm9ib3QtVmFjdXVtL2RwL0IwOTROWUhUTUY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tY28tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM0ZDg1MjA3LWRkNjktNDAxMS05Nzg2LWNkOTRlMmZiZWE5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUrGDCA6iEn4dd7AhlFFO5ymk6pJCnO42aPAk8dLwVQQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiRobot-Roomba-Self-Emptying-Robot-Vacuum%2Fdp%2FB094NYHTMF&amp;uuid=FY36YivyEaRX82kj24240\">the same vacuum with one</a> for $200 extra.</p><p>The biggest selling point of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html\">Roomba j7 series</a> is its upgraded AI-driven computer vision which helps it detect and move around objects. This includes pet poop \u2013 a robot vacuum\u2019s arch nemesis \u2013 and iRobot even promises pet owners that it will replace their j7 machine if it runs into pet poop within the first year of ownership.</p><p>That\u2019s one feature I was happy I never got to test while reviewing this Roomba, as my cat kept all of her activity to her litter box. Otherwise, the Roomba j7 did a good job sucking up dirt and debris around my apartment and it didn\u2019t make too much noise while doing so. All of the robo-vacs I tested at this mid-range level had roughly the same level of suction, so there wasn\u2019t a big difference between them when it came to cleaning power.</p><p>Like other robot vacuums, you can set cleaning schedules in the iRobot mobile app so you never have to start a cleaning job on the fly. The app also has a \u201cfavorites\u201d section, which lets you create profiles that you\u2019ll use all the time like \u201cclean the living room and the entryway.\u201d And if you prefer to use voice commands, the robot supports Amazon\u2019s Alexa and the Google Assistant.</p><p>The Roomba j7 has Imprint Smart Mapping, but unlike the Shark, it took more than one runthrough of my home for it to create a complete map. iRobot\u2019s app distinguishes between a regular cleaning job and a \u201cmapping run,\u201d so make sure you\u2019re choosing the latter the first few times you run the machine.</p><p>I tested the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM3RsaWtZaD91dWlkPXY2SnBQZEZXZzNySzlaamMyNTI0MCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzRkODUyMDctZGQ2OS00MDExLTk3ODYtY2Q5NGUyZmJlYTlkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9D5tTRVOLVScx5veo3oFL95BkwbzY-AGtzGZUTREyp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3tlikYh%3Fuuid%3Dv6JpPdFWg3rK9Zjc25240\">j7+</a>, which means I was treated to the roaring sounds of the machine emptying its dustbin into its base. The emptying process isn\u2019t as simple as an automatically opening flat that shakes dirt from one garbage can to another \u2013 the base actually sucks the dirt from vacuum. This was the case for all of the machines I tried that came with self-emptying bases; they\u2019re all quite loud, but the Roomba j7+ was the loudest of them all. The <em>whooshing</em> sounds last for only five to 10 seconds, but it was shocking the first time it happened. Just keep that in mind if you ever decide to run your self emptying robot vacuum at night when others are sleeping.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Anker Eufy RoboVac X8 Hybrid</h2><p></p><p>You may be unfamiliar with Anker\u2019s robot vacuums, but they\u2019re often more affordable alternatives to the iRobots and Sharks of the world. The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldWZ5LU5hdmlnYXRpb24tVHdpbi1UdXJiaW5lLVRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZ2VuZXJhdGVzL2RwL0IwOFhKUlhKUFY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tY28tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM0ZDg1MjA3LWRkNjktNDAxMS05Nzg2LWNkOTRlMmZiZWE5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQM45-pJl1YmQcjSVD4ZYCgnoBH2p7LFiCMTscprJjmg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Navigation-Twin-Turbine-Technology-generates%2Fdp%2FB08XJRXJPV&amp;uuid=kJgjHYXZa7TUqxo529250\">Eufy RoboVac X8 Hybrid</a> isn\u2019t a budget machine by any means, but it\u2019s a solid robot vacuum that offers a few key features that many competitors don\u2019t have. Plus, you can often find it on sale for $549 or even $449.</p><p>Unlike our other midrange picks, the X8 Hybrid doesn\u2019t come with a self-emptying base, nor is there one you can purchase separately. It\u2019s just a standalone robo-vac, but the \u201chybrid\u201d indicates that it\u2019s also a robot mop. It has both a dustbin for collecting debris and a 250-milliliter water tank that you can fill whenever you want to run a mopping cycle. Plenty of other robot vacuums have this feature, and it could be even more useful than a self-emptying bin if you have lots of tile or hardwood floors throughout your home.</p><p>Besides that, I was impressed with how easy it was to set up the X8 Hybrid, how accurate its mapping capabilities were and how many extra features it supports. It has four cleaning modes \u2013 auto, room, zone and spot \u2013 and four suction levels starting with Pure at the low end and topping out at Max. These features give you a lot of control over where the machine cleans and how powerfully it will do so. The X8 Hybrid was in Pure mode the first time I ran it, and I was surprised by not only how quiet it was but also how thoroughly it cleaned considering it was on the lowest suction setting.</p><p>There\u2019s also a \u201ctap and go\u201d feature that lets you pinpoint any spot on your home map in the EufyHome app, sending the robot there to clean. Manual controls are also available, which isn\u2019t something you see on a ton of robo-vacs. This option lets you control the machine almost like a slow and slightly clumsy RC car, giving you more control over where it cleans.</p><p>It may not have the name recognition that iRobot or Shark do, but the Eufy RoboVac X8 Hybrid is a solid choice nonetheless, especially if you don\u2019t care to add a clean base into the mix. It\u2019s an even more tempting choice if you can snag it at a lower price when it\u2019s discounted.</p><h2>Best robot vacuum and mop: iRobot Roomba j7+ Combo</h2><p></p><p>Vac-and-mop devices aren\u2019t new, but they are new to iRobot\u2019s lineup and the company made a great one in the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9pUm9ib3QlQzIlQUUtUm9vbWJhLUNvbWJvVE0tU2VsZi1FbXB0eWluZy1WYWN1dW0vZHAvQjBCQ0gzSjlSRD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jby0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzRkODUyMDctZGQ2OS00MDExLTk3ODYtY2Q5NGUyZmJlYTlkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARTmdgZl1gUi_F15vRTuFJyKh2cQRV6N89ooVvNFhS0Z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiRobot%25C2%25AE-Roomba-ComboTM-Self-Emptying-Vacuum%2Fdp%2FB0BCH3J9RD&amp;uuid=hYlvHwbmiJ6xUMEp33252\">Roomba j7+ Combo</a>. This machine offers an elegant solution to what usually is a more manual process of instructing the robot vacuum where to mop and where to actually vacuum. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-combo-j7plus-hands-on-150010629.html\">2-in-1 version</a> of the Roomba j7+ has a mop pad built in that only flips down when the machine senses that it\u2019s rolling over hard flooring, dispensing water and cleaning solution before lighting scrubbing your floors. When it\u2019s on carpet, it\u2019ll act like a standard robot vacuum.</p><p>Arguably the most compelling reason to get a robot vacuum at all is convenience, and iRobot managed to figure out how to incorporate mopping into an already stellar robot vacuum without removing any convenience. Sure, you have to add water and cleaning solution when you want to mop, and dispose of the remnants when it\u2019s finished, but that\u2019s about it. The Roomba has enough smarts to take care of the rest, without accidentally dampening your carpet along the way. The included self-emptying base still comes in handy as it will suck up the vacuumed debris that the robot catches, but just know that it will not take care of excess water for you.</p><p>Aside from the adding mopping abilities, the Combo is basically just a Roomba j7+ and that\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s been one of our favorite robot vacuums since it came out thanks to its improved obstacle avoidance, strong suction power, accurate home mapping technology and decent battery life. The iRobot mobile app, from which you can start and schedule jobs, edit your home map and more, is easy to use, and you can even control the machine using Alexa or Google Assistant commands. The hardest thing to swallow about it (besides how it sounds like a jet engine when emptying debris into the clean base) is its sky-high, $1,100 price tag.</p><h2>Runner up robot vacuum and mop: Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 Vacuum and Mop</h2><p></p><p>The main reason why <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TaGFyay1Nb3BwaW5nLUNsZWFuRWRnZS1UZWNobm9sb2d5LVJWMjYxMFdBL2RwL0IwQjhCNk4yRzQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tY28tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM0ZDg1MjA3LWRkNjktNDAxMS05Nzg2LWNkOTRlMmZiZWE5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUiRxvIrGvJYS1Tpk9ens9Af2AMfWzg5XVkaa5efnblN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FShark-Mopping-CleanEdge-Technology-RV2610WA%2Fdp%2FB0B8B6N2G4&amp;uuid=punoXPrB8hlAJIhk37253\">Shark\u2019s machine</a> is our runner-up pick is its more manual nature. It comes with two dustbins, one for vacuuming only and one for vacuuming and mopping that has a water reservoir and a detachable mop pad. You have to switch to the appropriate dustbin when you want to mop your floors, and after each job, the dustbin will not automatically empty into the clean base since it has the reservoir in it. You\u2019ll have to manually empty it instead, but you would have to do that anyway to clean and refill the water tank in preparation for the next job.</p><p>Despite being a more hands-on machine, Shark\u2019s robotic vac and mop was a pleasure to review. Setting it up was as quick and simple as one of the company\u2019s standard robot vacuums, and its first run will create a map of your home, which you can then label with room names, edit with no-go zones and carpeted areas and more. You can even choose to have the robot do a dry run first before doing any actual mopping, so you can make sure it doesn\u2019t enter into the carpeted areas you\u2019ve indicated in your home map. In my testing, the robot accurately stayed away from these zones that I set and I actually like having that little bit of extra control over where the machine goes. But of course, that\u2019s just another thing you have to do manually that iRobot\u2019s vac and mop takes care of using built-in tech.</p><p>The Shark\u2019s water\u2013and-solution based cleaning abilities are basic but much better than having to schlep out an old-school mop and bucket yourself. My mix of hardwood and tile floors appeared noticeably cleaner after the Shark passed over them with its mopping pad. I know I\u2019ll have to whip out my floor steamer every once in a while to really get a deep clean, but the Shark\u2019s capabilities are more than enough for biweekly runs \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to beat the convenience of not having to do it yourself.</p><p>Shark\u2019s machine has a few other things going for it, too: the self-emptying base is bagless, which means you won\u2019t have to shell out more money over time for proprietary garbage bags like you will have to with iRobot machines; its mobile app remains easy to use and one that newbies will be able to pick up quickly; and, maybe most importantly, this device comes in at $700. That\u2019s still a good chunk of change, but it\u2019s a far-cry cheaper than the Roomba j7+ Combo.</p><h2>Best premium robot vacuum: iRobot Roomba s9+</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9pUm9ib3QtQXV0b21hdGljLURpc3Bvc2FsLUNvbm5lY3RlZC1BbnRpLUFsbGVyZ2VuL2RwL0IwN1FYTTJWNlg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tY28tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM0ZDg1MjA3LWRkNjktNDAxMS05Nzg2LWNkOTRlMmZiZWE5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARYnce8gCqKJjQz5qcCb7WNExYXIao_-EnXKOjyOSb2W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiRobot-Automatic-Disposal-Connected-Anti-Allergen%2Fdp%2FB07QXM2V6X&amp;uuid=jskxG14fUqr8nM1x41254\">Roomba s9+</a> is admittedly overkill for most people \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing if not one of the best robot vacuums out there. You\u2019ll notice its premium features as soon as you unbox it. The s9+ is the biggest but also the most attractive robo-vac I tried, with a corner-friendly design, copper accents and a 1.5-foot tall self-emptying base. The setup was quick and easy, with the machine taking only a few minutes to connect to my home\u2019s WiFi and the iRobot app.</p><p>While the s9+ doesn\u2019t have the Precision Navigation feature that the newer j7 does, it has something called \u201cCareful Driver\u201d that uses a 3D sensor to detect and clean around objects. It seems that the main difference is that the s9+ isn\u2019t specifically wired to avoid pet poop, so keep that in mind if you have furry friends around the house. However, with 40x the suction power of a standard Roomba, the s9+ does a great job cleaning up pet hair.</p><p>It\u2019s also louder than the j7 when it\u2019s cleaning, but not irritatingly so, and I noticed a deeper clean in my carpets thanks to the extra suction. And it changes its cleaning mode automatically when transitioning from, say, carpeting to a hardwood floor.</p><p>Even this $1,000 robot vacuum bumped into a few table legs while cleaning, but it was noticeably better than other machines at navigating around my furniture and correcting itself when it got stuck. It also moves faster than the j7, so it was able to cover a bit more of my apartment before it had to return to the base for charging after about one hour of cleaning. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the s9+ wasn\u2019t nearly as loud as the j7 vacuum when emptying its dustbin into the clean base.</p><p>With the iRobot app experience being the same across all Roombas, the s9+ stands out for its subtle premium features like its elegant design, elegant-looking clean base, superior cleaning intelligence and top-of-the-line suction power. Aside from the extra suction, those are all nice-to-haves rather than must-haves, so most people \u2013 including you! \u2013 probably don\u2019t need the Roomba s9+. It\u2019s the fanciest robot vacuum iRobot has to offer, but you\u2019ll get a similar level of quality with the Roomba j7 while spending a couple hundred bucks less.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Roborock S7+</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2Jvcm9jay1BdXRvLUVtcHR5LTYwLURheXMtVWx0cmFzb25pYy1EZXRlY3Rpb24vZHAvQjA5NE40Vko3Uz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jby0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzRkODUyMDctZGQ2OS00MDExLTk3ODYtY2Q5NGUyZmJlYTlkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASKKiO2KxuLlVxL1O6bgrxEBoUdUQTrsewyTqf_ieEN-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoborock-Auto-Empty-60-Days-Ultrasonic-Detection%2Fdp%2FB094N4VJ7S&amp;uuid=XjmgQzk15Hifg4Hv44255\">Roborock\u2019s high-end S7+</a> deserves a mention for its cleaning power and number of additional features that many other competitors don\u2019t have. First, the S7+ is a vac-and-mop combo, and its mopping map automatically lifts itself out of the way when the machine reaches the carpet. That means you can have it clean your whole home, vacuuming and mopping in the right spots, without you giving it any extra attention (besides filling its 300ml water tank at the start).</p><p>The expensive machine has a longer setup process because its self-emptying base comes in two pieces. You must attach the bottom of the base, where the robo-vac charges, to the garbage-bin upper portion using a few screws and a tool that attaches to the bottom of the base. Roborock provides everything you need to do this in the box, so while it takes a bit more time, it\u2019s still an easy process.</p><p>What wasn\u2019t so easy for me at first was connecting the S7+ to the Roborock app. The vacuum had trouble connecting to my home\u2019s WiFi network, but I was able to connect it to the Mi Home app, which is Xiaomi\u2019s main smart home companion app (Xiaomi is an investor in Roborock). There aren\u2019t a ton of differences between the two apps when it comes to robo-vac controls, but the S7+ is designed to work with Roborock\u2019s program. After troubleshooting with a Roborock representative, I was able to fix the problem by factory resetting the vacuum and that allowed me to connect it to the Roborock app properly.</p><p>That said, the Roborock app isn\u2019t nearly as polished as those from iRobot, Shark and others. The main page shows your home\u2019s map along with the battery level, cleaning time, cleaning area in feet, and buttons that let you quickly start a cleaning job and empty the dustbin. You\u2019re also able to select specific rooms or zones to clean, but the rest of the control options live in the menu accessible by the three-dot icon at the top-right corner of the app. Things are a little buried, and that might make the S7+ harder for robot-vacuum newbies to use.</p><p>When it comes to cleaning performance, the Roborock S7+ did a great job sucking up dirt around my home. In addition to the usual features like cleaning schedules, zone targeting and others, the vacuum also has things like child lock, which will disable the physical buttons on the machine; different auto-emptying settings to choose from; \u201cpin and go,\u201d which lets you tap on your home map to send the robot to a specific location; and manual direction controls so you can move the machine like a toy car. This isn\u2019t the robot vacuum to get if you want the most polished experience \u2013 and you may very well want that if you\u2019re dropping $1,000 on one \u2013 but it remains a powerful vac-and-mop machine with a handful of extra perks.</p><h2>Best budget robot vacuum: Roomba 694</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9pUm9ib3QtVmFjdXVtLVdpLUZpLUNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS1DYXJwZXRzLVNlbGYtQ2hhcmdpbmcvZHAvQjA4U1A1R1lKUD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jby0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzRkODUyMDctZGQ2OS00MDExLTk3ODYtY2Q5NGUyZmJlYTlkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAb8pJKrhk87JwEVFszwAZJcafwVLg0MN3ue_h2HpSKX3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiRobot-Vacuum-Wi-Fi-Connectivity-Carpets-Self-Charging%2Fdp%2FB08SP5GYJP&amp;uuid=P3NHIfItcOem7PNb48260\">iRobot\u2019s $279 Roomba 694</a> is a good robot vaccum option for most people thanks to its good cleaning power and easy-to-use mobile app. We won\u2019t get too deep into it here since we have a whole guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">affordable robot vacuums</a> with additional recommendations.

Controversial because he\u2019s a Klingon who defected during the recent war, who is also known as the \u201cButcher of J\u2019Gal.\u201d Not just because of the orders he gave, including massacring his own civilians, but because he killed all of his generals just before he defected. Dak'Rah is embraced by Pike, Una and Uhura as a beacon of hope for a more peaceful future. But Ortegas, who fought in the war, and M\u2019Benga and Chapel, who actually served in a field hospital on J\u2019Gal, can\u2019t get over the past, or their own pain.&nbsp;</p><p>We flash back to Chapel\u2019s arrival on J\u2019Gal, where she\u2019s greeted by Trek good luck charm Clint Howard\u2019s commanding officer. Her orientation lasts for all of a minute before she\u2019s picking up casualties from the transporter pad and trying to save them without key medical tech.

M\u2019Benga and Chapel quickly bond over their rough time in the medical trenches, and develop a shorthand to help each other along.</p><figure><img alt=\"L-R Anson Mount as Pike, Robert Wisdom as Dak&#92;'Rah and Christina Chong as La&#xe2;&#x80;&#x99;an appearing in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds streaming on Paramount+, 2023.

None of them are able to make nice for too long, and Ortegas quickly leaves, with Chapel following behind. Pike notices that while M\u2019Benga remains, he\u2019s gripping the arms of his seat so tightly that he\u2019s about to rip them off, and asks him to go look after the absent pair. But not before Ra, knowing that M\u2019Benga loves martial arts, asks to set up a session between the two with an arm grip that\u2019s a little too aggressive.</p><p>Back on J\u2019Gal, M\u2019Benga treats a wounded soldier who wonders what the point of this battle really is. The doctor gives a rousing speech, bringing to mind the \u201cyou want me on that wall\u201d speech from Aaron Sorkin\u2019s <em>A Few Good Men</em>. He says the risk of Klingon expansionism is too great, and that Starfleet fights so that others can live their lives in peace. But while the speech is effective, it\u2019s delivered a little too convincingly, especially given we soon learn that M\u2019Benga used to be the guy wielding the knife rather than the scalpel.</p><p>Soon after, a special forces commander asks M\u2019Benga for some Protocol 12, the green steroids M\u2019Benga and Chapel used in \u201cThe Broken Circle.\u201d As annoyed as I was that M\u2019Benga himself created it \u2013 I\u2019m never a fan of secret origin stories where the same five characters are at the center of literally everything in the universe \u2013 I was pleased we didn\u2019t get an over-explanation of its genesis. The doctor refuses, so the commander asks if M\u2019Benga himself, under his old guise of \u201cThe Ghost\u201d will join the team on its daring mission given how effective his murder skills are, or were.</p><p>The military is planning to send a small unit to try and wipe out J\u2019Gal\u2019s leaders once and for all, while committing the bulk of its forces to a grand frontal assault as a distraction. The soldier M\u2019Benga previously patched up is going back out there to get chopped up, everyone knowing ahead of time they\u2019re being sent to the meat grinder. But the Klingons are ready for them, disabling the field hospital\u2019s power generators, preventing them from saving the casualties as they pile up. Chapel gets a transporter online, but can\u2019t activate it without wiping the soldier who was kept in the pattern buffer earlier, something M\u2019Benga does with little hesitation.</p><p>Back on the ship, M\u2019Benga and Dak'Rah start their sparring session, with Dak'Rah doing his best to try and make nice with the doctor. He talks about how good the symbolism of two former enemies, quite literally on the opposite sides of the same battle, standing side-by-side would be. But M\u2019Benga can\u2019t bring himself to be friends, just allies, and soon starts to ask Dak'Rah which of his generals fought the hardest during his final day on J\u2019Gal.

As much as it focuses on the great people of history making soliloquies on the bridge of their starships, that\u2019s the start of things, not the end. Despite its apparent progressivism, it rarely engages with the material concerns of the ordinary people living and serving in Starfleet on that sort of level. That\u2019s why the fact we got to see the Klingon war from something approaching the ground is a refreshing change.</p><p>And at the start of the season, I talked about how confident <em>Strange New Worlds</em>\u2019 storytelling had become. Bursting out of the gate, even its weaker episodes were elevated by a production team pulling their hardest in the same direction. With a strong script, credited to writer/producer Davy Perez and directed by Jeff W. Boyd, there\u2019s not much that can go wrong. It helps, too, that <em>Strange New Worlds</em> this year has restrained its urge to explain, and over-explain, every facet of what\u2019s going on. But what really makes this episode is the towering, blockbuster performance by Babs Olusanmokun as Dr. M\u2019Benga who, once again, demonstrates he\u2019s this series secret weapon.</p><p>It\u2019s Olusanmokun who holds the broad tangle of ideas in this script together, including the key issues around memory, grief and forgiveness. There\u2019s a clear dichotomy between those in the crew who are motivated for revenge and those who are looking toward a better future. I\u2019m sure that particular conflict can be mapped over several real-world fault lines, for better or worse. The episode, wisely, doesn\u2019t necessarily take one side over the other, although the fact M\u2019Benga and Chapel are our POV characters this week means we\u2019re already on side.</p><p>It\u2019s a shame that there\u2019s less emphasis on making Dak'Rah as fully rounded-out a character as he could, or should be. He\u2019s not given space to justify Pike\u2019s faith in him, and it\u2019s clear pretty much as soon as he arrives that he\u2019s ever so slightly phony. Much of this can be attributed to our old enemy running time, and the fact that <em>Strange New Worlds\u2019</em> storytelling is that much more ambitious this time out. But I\u2019m never going to criticize a series for having too many ideas and not enough time to explore all of them in enough detail.</p><p>Oh, and I wanted to draw attention to<em> Strange New Worlds</em>\u2019 excellent use of virtual stages both here and for much of the season. The world of J\u2019Gal feels pretty believable, rendered as a living backdrop behind the field hospital in the flashback sequences. Given the cost and logistical demands of trying to set up a series of night shoots on rough terrain, I can understand why the team opted to shoot the scene in the studio. But while keen-eyed fans will be looking for the edges of the stage, the atmosphere feels a lot more real than if they were acting in front of a green screen.</p><p>It\u2019s clear now that each season of Strange New Worlds conforms to a similar shape across its run. After a mission-setting premiere, you get three episodes exploring standard Trek tropes, with a focus on Una and La\u2019an. Episode five is a Spock-heavy romantic comedy romp, followed by a heavy episode that emphasizes the season\u2019s overall theme. Seven is a lighter episode, while eight is primarily focused on Dr. M\u2019Benga, while nine is one of two big showcase episodes to cap the season. And I\u2019m hoping I get some credit for clocking \u2013 <em>last year</em> \u2013 that we were going to see a musical episode, which is what we\u2019re getting next week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-probes-the-limits-of-redemption-130025700.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-probes-the-limits-of-redemption-130025700.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-27T13:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "GoodRx now offers an iOS 'medicine cabinet' for managing prescription meds", "description": "<p>GoodRx, best known for its prescription drug price comparison tool, has launched a new free offering called \u201cMedicine Cabinet.\u201d The tool will allow GoodRx app users to manage their prescription medications on a single platform.

At the heart of the app are daily pill reminders that are customizable to any treatment plan that is uploaded into the app. GoodRx Chief Product Officer Mark Hull said the reminders feature is huge because 50 percent of the time, Americans are struggling to take their medications as prescribed for reasons as simple as forgetfulness or cost.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Medicine Cabinet also includes a dashboard for GoodRx\u2019s rewards program which offers users monetary perks like e-gift cards for staying on top of medication refills. \u201cNobody's integrating or rewarding people for having those healthy habits,\u201d Hull said. <br /><br />\u201cWhat we've found is that the winning model for us is to marry the discounts, the value and the rewards, with the basic healthy habits and reminder stuff,\u201d he added. GoodRx claims it can save consumers up to 80 percent off the price of prescription drugs by partnering with pharmacy benefits managers to negotiate deals on drugs.

You can use it to scan documents, QR codes and more, allowing you to save IRL files in a pinch, pull up menus at restaurants and even check grocery prices on the fly. Here\u2019s how to scan almost anything with your iPhone.</p><h2>How to scan documents with an iPhone</h2><p>The default way to scan a document with an iPhone lives within iOS\u2019 native Notes app. Open it and open a new note. Tap the camera icon on the bottom menu bar, tap Scan Documents and then hold your phone to frame the document you want to scan.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"How to scan with an iPhone\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/b4ebc5c0-2a1e-11ee-b3bd-d9fe3f65cda4\" style=\"height: 1700px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><p>The camera will scan the document automatically. But, just like taking a photo, you also have the option to do it manually by tapping the white button at the bottom of the screen or pressing the volume button.</p><p>If your document is more than one page, repeat the process for each page and hit the Save button at the bottom right corner when you\u2019re done. If you need to redo or edit a scan, tap the stack icon at the bottom left corner. Once saved, all of the pages will be attached to the same note in your library.</p><figure><img alt=\"How to scan with iPhone\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/cb605e60-2a1e-11ee-bf5e-e86c3965e3c8\" style=\"height: 1700px; width: 1686px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><p>Your iPhone also has the ability to scan the text in your document and make a note from it as well. Just tap and hold on text in your scanned document and highlight the portion you want to extract. You can then make a new note from that, or copy and paste the text into an existing note.</p><h2>How to scan a QR code with an iPhone</h2><p>Open the Camera and hold it up to the QR code. Tap the link that generates beneath the code and it will take you straight to your browser. You will automatically be sent to the site or PDF that the QR code links to.</p><p>Another way to scan a QR code is by using iOS\u2019 built in Code Scanner. First, go to settings and tap Control Center. Then, tap the green plus icon next to Code Scanner to add it to your Control Center. Swipe down from the top right corner of your home screen and tap the Code Scanner. The icon is represented with a small QR code inside four corners framing it.</p><figure><img alt=\"How to scan with an iPhone\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/30e59890-2a1f-11ee-bdfa-930c3dbc3962\" style=\"height: 1700px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Julia Mercado / Engadget</div></figure><p>That option will take you to another form of your camera. This time, there\u2019s no need to click a link: just frame the code in the four white corners and wait. Code Scanner will automatically show you what's linked in your browser.</p><h2>How to scan a barcode with an iPhone</h2><p>Unfortunately, iPhones can\u2019t handle barcodes on their own just yet, but there are third-party apps that can. Depending on the barcode, each app can help you do something different.

With decades of titles to pluck from (and the first port of call for most indie titles, too), there's so much to choose from. Gaming on your PC adds the benefits of (nearly always flawless) backward compatibility and console-beating graphical performance \u2014 if you've got the coin for it. The whole idea of what a gaming PC is and where you can play it is shifting, too, with the rise of handheld \u201cconsolized\u201d PCs like the Steam Deck. We've tried to be broad with our recommendations here on purpose \u2013 there are so many great new titles out there for PC gamers to play, consider these some starting points.</p><h2>Rollerdrome</h2><p></p><p><em>Rollerdrome</em> is lush. It\u2019s incredibly stylish, taking cues from 1970s Hollywood sci-fi but with an attractive cel-shaded filter over every scene. Even better than its stunning visuals, <em>Rollerdrome</em> has smooth, precise mechanics that allow players to fall into a flow in every level. The game is all about gliding through the environments on rollerblades, picking up speed and doing tricks while dodging and shooting enemies, managing weapons and controlling time \u2013 and it all comes together in a thrilling dystopian bloodsport.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It\u2019s a joy to dodge, dodge, dodge and then leap into the air, slow down time and take out the people shooting at you, refilling ammo and collecting health in the process. Meanwhile, an unsettling story of corporate greed unfolds naturally beneath the rollerblading bloodshed, keeping the stakes high. <em>Rollerdrome</em> was a sleeper hit of 2022, so if you\u2019ve been napping on this one, now\u2019s the time to wake up and play.</p><h2>Stray</h2><p></p><p><em>Stray</em> a perfectly contained adventure game that has you embodying a cat in a post-apocalyptic world humans have left behind. It has plenty of fresh ideas, each one pared down to its purest form. Plenty of actions in <em>Stray</em> exist simply because they make sense for a cat protagonist (and probably because they\u2019re cute as hell). There\u2019s a discrete button to meow, and the robots the cat shares its world with react with shock and frustration when you cut across their board game, throwing pieces to the floor. It\u2019s possible to curl up and sleep basically any time, anywhere \u2013 even directly on top of a robot stranger. When the cat gets pets and cuddles from the robots, it purrs and the DualSense\u2019s haptics fire up in response. The environmental puzzles take advantage of this cat-level perspective, inviting players to look at the world with different, light-reflective eyes.</p><p>As well as puzzle-solving, ledge-leaping and blob-dodging, <em>Stray</em> introduces a world of lighthearted dystopia, where robots don\u2019t hate the humans that came before them. Instead, they attempt to cultivate plants that can survive in the dark, just because people would have liked that. Compared with most dystopian cyberpunk games, <em>Stray</em> is downright joyful.</p><h2>Overwatch 2</h2><p></p><p>Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>still has a steep learning curve. Stick with it, though, and you\u2019ll get to indulge in perhaps the best team shooter around. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal \u2014 stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. It\u2019s much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye, matches may seem like colorful chaos, but <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a deceptively simple goal \u2014 stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win.</p><p>It\u2019s much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That, along with across-the-board new character tweaks, has made gameplay faster-paced and more enjoyable compared with the original <em>Overwatch</em>. There's a greater emphasis on individual impact, but you'll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory.</p><p>Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles, you\u2019ll surely find a few <em>Overwatch 2</em> characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great (though often fairly expensive) new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too, thanks to Blizzard\u2019s trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can marvel at how good it looks.</p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><p></p><p>Did you think this list would not include <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>? The strengths of FromSoftware\u2019s latest action-RPG are many, but what\u2019s most impressive about the game is how hand-crafted it feels despite its scale. <em>Elden Ring</em> is big, but it never feels like it\u2019s wasting your time. Far from it; FromSoftware has created a rich open world, with something surprising, delightful or utterly terrifying around every corner. I\u2019ll never forget the moment I found a chest that teleported my character to a cave full of Eldritch monsters. <em>Elden Ring </em>is full of those kinds of discoveries.</p><p>And if you\u2019re worried about hitting a brick wall with <em>Elden Ring\u2019s</em> difficulty, don\u2019t be. Sure, it can be tough as nails, but it\u2019s also From\u2019s most accessible game to date as well. If you find combat overly punishing, go for a mage build and blast your enemies from afar. And if all else fails, one of the rewards for exploring <em>Elden Ring\u2019s </em>world is experience that you can use to make your character stronger.</p><h2><strong>Apex Legends</strong></h2><p></p><p>You can find everything compelling about the battle royale genre in a round of <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends\"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>. Every move you and your 59 fellow combatants make depends on your collective actions just beforehand. You\u2019re always reacting to one another, whether you see it or not. Each game becomes an intricate web of choices, all stemming back to that initial, seemingly harmless drop onto the map. As with other battles royale, <em>Apex</em> demands you think ahead, assess risks and actually pay attention to your surroundings rather than charge into combat recklessly. And it\u2019s still a thrill when the end is near.</p><p>Where <em>Apex</em> stands out compared to rivals like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Warzone </em>\u2013 which are still good times in their own ways \u2013 is its character and <em>game feel</em>. Its roster of playable characters is <em>Overwatch</em>-like in its diversity of abilities and styles of movement. Likewise, each gun and attachment has a different impact on how you play. All of it remains exceptionally smooth to control, as expected from the team behind the <em>Titanfall </em>series.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> may still be the most accessible battle royale shooter, but <em>Apex</em> will feel right at home to anyone familiar with FPS games, and its ping system still makes it possible to work with your teammates without saying a word. It\u2019s still receiving <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apex-legends-is-finally-getting-a-team-deathmatch-mode-190958660.html\">regular updates</a> four years into its life, and it remains a free-to-play game that doesn\u2019t require a dime for you to be competitive.</p><h2>Beat Saber</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzYyMDk4MC9CZWF0X1NhYmVyLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASISJhJ9AfiSg1s_IvOgUaPpQxQExZaunF_G047nxIA2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F620980%2FBeat_Saber%2F\"><em>Beat Saber</em></a> is a euphoric gaming sensation that makes the most of virtual reality. You'll swing your unofficial lightsabers at incoming boxes, slicing and slamming them to the beat of the soundtrack. Similar to iconic rhythm-rail-shooter, <em>Rez</em>, which has its own VR iteration, <em>Beat Saber</em> often makes you feel like you're creating the music as you hit your cues. We might have had initial reservations on the soundtrack at launch but new tracks and customizations continue to add to the challenge. There's even a level creator for PC players, making this the definitive version.</p><h2>Control</h2><p></p><p>Take the weird<em> Twin Peaks</em> narrative of <em>Alan Wake</em>, smash it together with<em> Quantum Break</em>'s frenetic powers and gunplay, and you've got <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2NvbnRyb2xfdWx0aW1hdGVfZWRpdGlvbj8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE0ODgzMTdjLTA4YmMtMzc3Zi1hNDYwLTM2NDY5N2Y0Yjc1ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVoMosYPtd4HwheMmYKZb6sMF8-j_AKxiIauZp5Z3Sp3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fcontrol_ultimate_edition%3F\"><em>Control</em></a>. Playing as a woman searching for her missing brother, you quickly learn there's a thin line between reality and the fantastical. It's catnip for anyone who grew up loving <em>The X-Files</em> and the supernatural. It's also a prime example of a studio working at their creative heights, both refining and evolving the open-world formula that's dominated games for the past decade.</p><h2>Disco Elysium Final Cut</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9nYW1lL2Rpc2NvX2VseXNpdW0_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDg4MzE3Yy0wOGJjLTM3N2YtYTQ2MC0zNjQ2OTdmNGI3NWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV_riA3RCmEe-kCXw-LaoWEc0kL6fiiH793WwDnrOQl6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fgame%2Fdisco_elysium%3F\"><em>Disco Elysium</em></a> is a special game. The first release from Estonian studio ZA/UM, it's a sprawling science-fiction RPG that takes more inspiration from D&amp;D and <em>Baldur's Gate</em> than modern combat-focused games. In fact, there is no combat to speak of, instead, you'll be creating your character, choosing what their strengths and weaknesses are, and then passing D&amp;D-style skill checks to make your way through the story. You'll, of course, be leveling up your abilities and boosting stats with items, but really the game's systems fall away in place of a truly engaging story, featuring some of the finest writing to ever grace a video game.</p><p>With the <em>Final Cut</em>, released 18 months after the original, this extremely dialogue-heavy game now has full voice acting, which brings the unique world more to life than ever before. After debuting on PC, PS5 and Stadia, <em>Final Cut </em>is now available for all extant home consoles \u2013 including Nintendo\u2019s Switch.</p><h2>Halo Infinite</h2><p></p><p>Master Chief's latest adventure may not make much sense narratively, but it sure is fun to play.

The main campaign is more open than ever, while also giving you a new freedom of movement with the trusty grappling hook. And the multiplayer mode is wonderfully addictive (though 343 still needs to speed up experience progression), with a bevy of maps and game modes to keep things from getting too stale. The only thing keeping it from greatness is its baffling and disjointed story.</p><h2>FTL: Faster Than Light</h2><p></p><p>Who hasn't wanted to captain their own spaceship?

All you have to do is travel through a number of star systems, recruiting crew members and collecting scrap as you make your way towards a final showdown against a stupidly overpowered ship. Gameplay is roughly divided between a map view, where you can take as much time as you like to chart the most efficient route to your goal, and combat events which play out in real-time (although you can and will be using a pause button to slow things down).</p><p>Where the real fun comes in is in the narrative, which plays out in two ways. There's the structured side, where every so often you'll be asked to make decisions that may improve or hinder your chances of survival. And then there's the natural story you create for yourselves, as you're forced to decide, for example, whether it's worth sacrificing a crew member for the greater good.</p><h2>Hades</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzExNDUzNjAvSGFkZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDg4MzE3Yy0wOGJjLTM3N2YtYTQ2MC0zNjQ2OTdmNGI3NWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ8aRFQ4Ch10WuKIhYY6Z5SW6amEO_r5oQUwBXqe-3FD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1145360%2FHades%2F\"><em>Hades</em></a> was the first early access title to ever make our best PC game list. It's an action-RPG developed by the team behind <em>Bastion</em>, <em>Transistor</em> and <em>Pyre</em>. You play Zagreus, son of Hades, who's having a little spat with his dad, and wants to escape from the underworld. To do so, Zagreus has to fight his way through the various levels of the underworld and up to the surface. Along the way, you\u2019ll pick up \u201cboons\u201d from a wide range of ancient deities like Zeus, Ares and Aphrodite, which stack additional effects on your various attacks. Each level is divided into rooms full of demons, items and the occasional miniboss.</p><p>As <em>Hades</em> is a \u201croguelike\u201d game, you start at the same place every time. With that said the items you collect can be used to access and upgrade new weapons and abilities that stick between sessions. <em>Hades</em> is on this list not for any reason other than it\u2019s super accessible and very, very fun. You can jump in for 30 minutes and have a blast, or find yourself playing for hours.</p><h2>Half-Life: Alyx</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzU0NjU2MC9IYWxmTGlmZV9BbHl4LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAc5gBM4X-AflaEOzPc2jJEjhEVG01SI6rSbVT8bXbESn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F546560%2FHalfLife_Alyx%2F\"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a> feels like a miracle. After 13 years away from the franchise, Valve delivered a genuinely thrilling prequel to <em>Half-Life 2</em> while also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html\">charting new territory for VR gameplay</a>. The gravity gloves, its key new feature, is the closest I\u2019ve ever felt to having telekinetic powers. It gives you multiple movement options so you don\u2019t get sick trotting around the expansive environments. Oh yeah, and it\u2019s also absolutely terrifying, banking on the claustrophobic nature of VR. There\u2019s no looking away when a facehugger leaps at you from the dark, or when a horrifically deformed zombie gets in your face. It might sound a bit hyperbolic, but <em>Alyx</em> might end up being one of the most important titles of this generation. Building a big-budget game for a niche VR market doesn\u2019t make much sense for most companies, but for Valve, it\u2019s Tuesday.</p><h2>Nier Automata</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzUyNDIyMC9OaWVSQXV0b21hdGEvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDg4MzE3Yy0wOGJjLTM3N2YtYTQ2MC0zNjQ2OTdmNGI3NWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcTmrWOL661fE5NjtRkHajcbvssTeOoT8CD-Gc4nNq8m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F524220%2FNieRAutomata%2F\"><em>Nier Automata</em></a> takes the razor-sharp combat of a Platinum Games title and puts it in a world crafted by everyone's favorite weirdo, Yoko Taro. Don't worry, you can mostly just run, gun and slash your way through the game, but as you finish, and finish and finish this one, you'll find yourself pulled into a truly special narrative, that's never been done before and will probably never be done again. It's fair to say that the new <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzUyNDIyMC9OaWVSQXV0b21hdGEvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDg4MzE3Yy0wOGJjLTM3N2YtYTQ2MC0zNjQ2OTdmNGI3NWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcTmrWOL661fE5NjtRkHajcbvssTeOoT8CD-Gc4nNq8m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F524220%2FNieRAutomata%2F\">PC release</a>, as is unfortunately often the case, wasn't exactly the best and is still remarkably lacking in options, but it's at least stable now, and trust us when we say this one is unmissable.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator</strong></h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzEyNTA0MTAvTWljcm9zb2Z0X0ZsaWdodF9TaW11bGF0b3JfR2FtZV9vZl90aGVfWWVhcl9FZGl0aW9uLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVnRxG-ekiXGAgWcisB2PY9x9rit-dwEMG5IgsNpzM-9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1250410%2FMicrosoft_Flight_Simulator_Game_of_the_Year_Edition%2F\"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> came out at the perfect time, when the world was on lockdown and airline travel was an impossibility for most people. Not only does <em>Flight Sim</em> let players pilot a vast array of aircrafts, but it presents the world on a platter in stunning, ridiculous detail. It\u2019s an escape, it\u2019s educational and it\u2019s entertaining \u2013 is that what they mean by E3? \u2013 and there\u2019s really nothing else on its level when it comes to realistic physics simulations. Pandemic or no, <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> is an incredible achievement with a long tail both inside and outside of the video game industry.</p><h2>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h2><p></p><p>Many were ready to write off the Resident Evil series after the disaster that was <em>Resident Evil 6</em>. What started as <em>the</em> horror game on the original PlayStation had become a bloated mess of an action game. Instead of throwing the whole franchise in the trash and forgetting about it, Capcom took a hard look at what wasn't working, which \u2014 surprise! \u2014 was basically everything, and thoroughly rebooted the formula. Borrowing from Kojima's <em>PT</em> and, in some ways, Creative Assembly's <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzQxODM3MC9SZXNpZGVudF9FdmlsXzdfQmlvaGF6YXJkLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAU5UPX3mbo6Is9NiYmcDWQzquzsyhZq3--a_Zou0XJyx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F418370%2FResident_Evil_7_Biohazard%2F\"><em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em></a> is horror through powerlessness. For the majority of the game, you're basically unable to do anything but run from or delay your foes. And that's what makes it so good.</p><h2>Return of the Obra Dinn</h2><p></p><p>This is an unforgettable ghost-story-slash-murder-mystery with a distinctive old-school graphical style. It's unlike any game we've played in a while, with a low-key musical score and a style of puzzle solving that's like one satisfying, grisly riddle.

There is, however, a corpse near the captain's cabin. As you track the deceased's final footsteps, leading to yet more grisly ends, you need to figure out what happened. Who killed who?

It's not perfect; the combat system is rough, frustrating death comes in the form of falling from just a few feet and there's a lot of quest filler alongside many incredibly well thought out distractions. The scope and ambition on display will have you hooked, and once you're done, there are some excellent expansions to check out.</p><h2>Forza Horizon 5</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vYXBwLzE1NTEzNjAvRm9yemFfSG9yaXpvbl81LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQ4ODMxN2MtMDhiYy0zNzdmLWE0NjAtMzY0Njk3ZjRiNzVmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbfjgDm3FnRXwEKdhqrCLjUEVb0kBGC7R4Htv0gtJvYe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1551360%2FForza_Horizon_5%2F\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>deftly walks a fine line by being an extremely deep and complex racing game that almost anyone can just pick up and play. The game has hundreds of cars that you can tweak endlessly to fit your driving style, and dozens of courses spread all over a gorgeous fictional corner of Mexico. If you crank up the difficulty, one mistake will sink your entire race, and the competition online can be just as fierce.</p><p>But if you\u2019re new to racing games, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> does an excellent job at getting you up and running. The introduction to the game quickly gives you a taste at the four main race types you\u2019ll come across (street racing, cross-country, etc.), and features like the rewind button mean that you can quickly erase mistakes if you try and take a turn too fast without having to restart your run. Quite simply, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is a beautiful and fun game that works for just about any skill level. It\u2019s easy to pick up and play a few races and move on with your day, or you can sink hours into it trying to become the best driver you can possibly be.</p><h2><strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/product/\"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a> is an ideal MMO for people who don\u2019t play MMOs. Yes, there\u2019s a hotbar and raids and gear to loot, and yes, it requires an enormous time investment to get the most out of it. But at its core, this is a story-driven RPG like any other <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Most of it is built to be played solo; you can even tackle dungeons with AI party members instead of other people. The narrative grows in scope and nuance as you work through its four major expansions, but the base game has its virtues, too. It\u2019s an epic about work, about putting in labor and compassion to rebuild a world that will always be a little broken, one quest at a time. The latest expansion, <em>Endwalker</em>, concludes the core, eight-year-long storyline in rousing fashion.</p><p>Being able to quickly swap between classes on one character lets you shake up the admittedly straightforward combat, and you can pick up side \u201cjobs\u201d that are more explicitly about existing in the land instead of saving it. If you want to craft meals as a <a href=\"https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Culinarian\">Culinarian</a> or harvest resources as a <a href=\"https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Botanist\">Botanist</a>, go for it. If you want to hunt for treasure maps, play at the casino, battle in PvP arenas, listen to Bards play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MLf27oILNo\">actual music</a> or just be one of those <a href=\"https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/a_realm_reborn/world/#!/races/content?roegadyn\">buff green dudes</a> who stands around <a href=\"https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Limsa_Lominsa\">Limsa Lominsa</a> wearing nothing but bunny ears, you can. Like the best MMOs, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> feels like another world, one you\u2019ll probably never grasp in its entirety. And if you do want to play with others, it\u2019s all brought to life by a genuinely welcoming community. Just note that you\u2019ll need to pay a monthly subscription fee, though you can access the base game and first expansion for no added cost.</p><h2><strong>Euro Truck Simulator 2</strong></h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/\"><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em></a> tasks you with driving a bunch of big trucks across Europe, delivering cargo and building out your own trucking business. As the name implies, it\u2019s a sim, so the trucks handle realistically and you\u2019re expected to follow the rules of the road, refuel your car and complete your deliveries on time, with minimal damage. This is a condensed version of Europe, but each trip takes time, and usually, little else of note happens along the way.</p><p>That slowness is the point. <em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em>\u2019s pleasures are similar to those of actual driving: cruising down an open road, listening to real streaming radio stations, glancing at the sights as you pass by. It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-relaxing-video-games-140048572.html\">deeply relaxing</a> game as a result. All you have is the road, a destination and a hulking rig to keep on track. You\u2019ll get there when you get there. The management bits of <em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em> aren\u2019t as interesting as the driving, but there are loads of mods and DLC to shake up the experience.

The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3991\">European Commission has announced a probe into if Microsoft bundling Teams</a> with its product suites violated EU competition rules. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/slack-microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust-complaint-134423931.html\">Slack filed its antitrust complaint in 2020</a>, alleging that Microsoft's decision to include Teams with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 is illegal and that the company blocked some users from removing the software.&nbsp;</p><p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-reportedly-unbundle-teams-from-office-to-avoid-antitrust-concerns-183139403.html\">Microsoft agreed to remove Teams from its Office suite</a> in an attempt to prevent a probe, but said it was unclear how it would do so. The effort wasn't enough to avoid concerns and make a deal. In its announcement opening the investigation, the European Commission said it &quot;is concerned that Microsoft may grant Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers a choice on whether or not to include access to that product when they subscribe to their productivity suites and may have limited the interoperability between its productivity suites and competing offerings.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A Microsoft spokesperson responded to the news: &quot;We respect the European Commission\u2019s work on this case and take our own responsibilities very seriously. We will continue to cooperate with the Commission and remain committed to finding solutions that will address its concerns.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't the first time Microsoft has found itself in hot water with the European Commission. In 2009, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2009-12-16-eu-settles-affairs-with-microsoft-no-fines-this-time.html\">company agreed to offer EU users different browser options</a> instead of forcing them to use Internet Explorer in Windows. Four years later, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-06-microsoft-european-commission-fine.html\">European Commission fined Microsoft \u20ac561 million</a> ($625 million) after a &quot;glitch&quot; stopped the browser choice screen from consistently appearing. The current investigation has no decision deadline, so it might be some time before the European Commission announces Microsoft's fate.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-faces-an-eu-antitrust-probe-over-its-bundling-of-teams-114147712.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-faces-an-eu-antitrust-probe-over-its-bundling-of-teams-114147712.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-27T11:41:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Everything announced at Samsung's Summer Unpacked 2023 event", "description": "<p>Cruelly timed for just after The Morning After newsletter yesterday, Samsung\u2019s latest Unpacked media event was a first for the company.
