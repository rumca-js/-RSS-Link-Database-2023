<p>The Acer Aspire 3 is a good option for most kids, as it ticks a lot of boxes. It&rsquo;s robust, inexpensive, and performance is fast enough for everyday tasks like writing assignments and browsing the web. The full-size keyboard has a spacious layout as well, which is perfect for longer typing sessions. While that&rsquo;s all well and good, the internal components are really what makes this laptop a good buy.</p>

<p>Under the hood this laptop is packing an Ryzen 3 7320U processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of PCIe SSD storage. The processor has four cores and eight threads. A CPU with multiple cores generally means more reliable performance. Granted, aesthetically it&rsquo;s a bit boring. But this laptop clearly favors function over attractive aesthetics&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of the sturdiest budget laptops we&rsquo;ve ever tested. All in all, we feel as though the pros far outweigh the cons. The Aspire 3 should suit the needs of your kid perfectly and it&rsquo;s worth every penny.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a huge screen at an affordable price point, the Acer Swift 3 is well worth considering. According to our reviewer, the 16-inch 1080p display offers &ldquo;rich, lifelike color.&rdquo; Will your kid care about the vibrant picture? Maybe. Maybe not. Regardless, a big screen is useful for productivity tasks like writing papers and scrolling through documents. While the screen is the main headliner, the specs are surprisingly impressive for the price. </p>

<p>The Swift features an Intel Core i7-11370H processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe SSD storage. This is a good value for a sub-$800 Windows laptop. The keyboard is also enjoyable to use and the chassis feels durable. Despite the large screen, the Swift is rather slim, making it a good laptop for travel. That said, battery life is mediocre and there&rsquo;s lots of bloatware. If you can live with those flaws, then this is a lovely laptop with solid specs.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for phenomenal battery life, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is a fantastic option. When we ran our battery benchmark, which cycles through videos and various tasks, the laptop lasted 14 hours on a single charge. In other words, your child doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about plugging in during the school day. The Spin is also a convertible, which makes it really versatile. You can prop it up like a painter&rsquo;s easel for watching videos or swing the screen around and use it like a tablet. The build is rather robust as well. There was hardly any flex in the keyboard tray. </p>

<p>Thanks to the internal components, the Spin delivers relatively zippy performance. It&rsquo;s rocking an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of PCIe SSD storage. The port selection isn&rsquo;t too shabby, either. You&rsquo;re getting USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, HDMI, a microSD card slot, and a headphone jack. There are a few trade-offs to be aware of, though. Fan noise can be loud under heavier loads and there&rsquo;s no physical privacy shutter on the webcam. However, those issues are relatively minor. Overall, the Spin is a decent laptop that performs well and offers outstanding battery life.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 has a lot to offer, but its standout feature is its keyboard. Our tester liked the &ldquo;crisp and taught&rdquo; feel of the keys. There&rsquo;s even a decent amount of space around the palm rests, which makes for a more comfortable typing experience. The port selection is a solid combination of old and new. It has two USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, a 3.5mm combo jack, and a microSD card reader. There&rsquo;s zero need for an adapter, which is always a plus.</p>

<p>Performance is somewhat mediocre, though. The Flex 5 comes equipped with an Intel Pentium Gold 7505 processor, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and 32GB of eMMC&nbsp;storage. While the processor is fine, the RAM and storage are on the lighter side. Our tester noticed a slowdown in performance when he opened up multiple tabs. However, as long as you&rsquo;re using the cloud and aren&rsquo;t running anything too intensive or demanding, the Flex 5 is a decent choice. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop beyond its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook because they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: The PCMark 10 benchmark is how we determine how well the laptop handles general use tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, streaming, and so on. It&rsquo;s a way to simulate everyday use.</li>



<li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li>



<li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It renders a 2D scene over a short period of time. </li>



<li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. This is how we test our array of gaming laptops. </li>



<li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies. If you&rsquo;re a regular traveler, you&rsquo;ll want a battery that can last longer than a full school day.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life.</li>



<li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li>



<li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications.</li>



<li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark.</li>



<li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is how we gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-sort-of-specs-should-i-go-for">What sort of specs should I go for?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Finding the right laptop for your kid can be a daunting task. If your child is younger or tends to be more accident-prone, do you go for something cheap? What about security concerns? If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start, don&rsquo;t sweat it. We&rsquo;ve put together a couple of quick tips for worried parents. Check out the info below.</p>



<p>If you plan on getting a Windows laptop for school, all you really need are the basics. An Intel Core i3 processor is fine for general-use tasks like surfing the web, writing papers, making presentations, and so on. A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/619258/what-the-heck-is-a-discrete-graphics-card-anyway.html">discrete graphics card</a> isn&rsquo;t totally necessary unless your kid likes to play <em>Minecraft</em> or some such. If you&rsquo;ve got a budding gamer on your hands, we recommend an Nvidia RTX 3060 or 3050 Ti, as they&rsquo;re relatively affordable. </p>



<p>For RAM, 8GB will keep things nice and zippy. As for storage options, 256GB is a good minimum, especially if your child doesn&rsquo;t have a ton of stored photos. Go for an SSD (solid state drive) if you can, as they&rsquo;re faster and quieter than hard drives.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a Chromebook, shoot for a mid-range one if you can. Within the $400 to $600 range you&rsquo;re likely to find Intel Pentium processors, which deliver better browser performance and are capable of running more intensive gaming apps. We&rsquo;d suggest at least 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You don&rsquo;t need a ton of storage space, as you&rsquo;ll be storing most of your work in the cloud.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a laptop for school, battery life is absolutely vital, as your kid is going to be taking this thing from class to class. A laptop that lasts anywhere from 10 to 12 hours on a single charge is a good baseline. That&rsquo;s a good deal more than a full school day. Chromebooks in particular are known for having fantastic battery life, as they&rsquo;re low-powered machines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">A Chromebook is a great fit for most kids</a>, especially if you have any security concerns. They&rsquo;re durable, affordable, and largely virus-free. The downside is that they exclusively run Chrome OS. If you have an older child, a Windows laptop might be a better option. Windows can run just about any app or browser. However, that kind of flexibility comes at a price. Windows laptops tend to be more expensive than Chromebooks (but not always!).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-budget-laptop-and-a-tablet">What is the difference between a budget laptop and a tablet?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The line between laptop and tablet blurs more and more as companies integrate the features of both into their devices. As of now there are still a few key distinctions between the two. Laptops are larger, have more storage, and generally pack better performance and productivity features. Tablets on the other hand are smaller and more portable, tend to have longer battery life, and are typically cheaper.</p>



<p>You should first ask yourself what the primary use of the device will be when choosing between a budget laptop and a tablet. Is productivity and storage the most important to you? Then a laptop&mdash;even a budget model&mdash;will be your best bet. Or do you need something that is portable and has a long battery life? Then a tablet is the way to go.</p>

## Public companies now have a deadline to report cyberattacks

<p>A new rule implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission will now require public companies to disclose data breaches much faster. Instead of working on their own timetables (in which it can take months before the public learns about information lost to a hack), public traded companies must share incidents four business days after discovery.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808943/sec-cybersecurity-public-companies-hacks-data-breaches&amp;xcust=2-1-2010884-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, the information reported to the SEC must not only happen within four days, but it must also include specific details on the attack. That includes how large it is, what it involves, when it happened, and how it will affect the company&mdash;all info that normally takes agonizingly long for consumers to learn.</p>



<p>The SEC does make an exception to this compact timeline: If publicly announcing an incident could run a risk to national security or public safety, then it can be delayed. (Not unlike the practice used for disclosures about software and hardware security vulnerabilities.)</p>



<p>The SEC also now wants to know how companies plan to address cybersecurity threats and who&rsquo;s in charge of managing that area. The change in policy additionally requires publicly traded companies to explain their cybersecurity practices (including if they don&rsquo;t have any), as well as the expected risks from existing threats and previous incidents.</p>



<p>For the full details, you can read about this new set of regulations in the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-139&amp;xcust=2-1-2010884-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SEC&rsquo;s press release</a>&mdash;you&rsquo;ll certainly have time to. The rules for cyberattack disclosures will begin to take effect 90 days after their date of publication in the Federal Register or December 18, 2023, which ever comes later. (Smaller companies get a longer reprieve; they get 180 days before they must begin reporting security breaches.) Companies must start reporting their cybersecurity protocols in the fiscal year ending on or after December 15th, 2023. As it stands, it likely won&rsquo;t be until 2024 that we&rsquo;ll see if identifying the scope and effect of a data breach (and preparing a statement for the US government) can happen as fast as four days&mdash;or if companies will start classify most breaches as a matter of public safety or national security.</p>

<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s ferocious GeForce RTX 4090 is a fire-breathing monster of a graphics cards, delighting gamers with 24GB of VRAM, unrivaled gaming performance, and steep power requirements to feed the beast. Its $1600 price tag is just as beastly. Nevertheless, gamers worldwide have been eagerly awaiting the launch of an upgraded version in the form of the long-rumored GeForce RTX 4090 Ti &mdash; a graphics card that Nvidia hasn&rsquo;t ever uttered a peep about. </p>



<p>A new report claims this will probably not happen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-rtx-4090-ti-but-possible-new-rtx-4060-and-rtx-4070-models">No RTX 4090 Ti, but possible new RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 models</h2>



<p>The well-known (and oft-accurate) leaker Kopite7kimi tweeted on Thursday that Nvidia has cancelled the market launch of the RTX 4090 Ti. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I'm afraid there won't be RTX 4090 Ti anymore. Some low-grade AD103 and AD106 chips will be another versions of RTX 4070 and 4060.</p>&mdash; kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1684490813567545344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-2010870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">July 27, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The rumored graphics card, allegedly planned with an improved version of the AD102 chip packing even more hardware inside, will not happen, according to the leak. Instead, Kopite7kimi claims Nvidia wants to concentrate on new GPUs from the RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 series, featuring trimmed AD103 and AD106 chips. Current models of the RTX 4070 use an AD104 chip, while the RTX 4060 Ti has an AD106 chip. The new AD103 chip should have more cores and also be able to connect more memory.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-little-hope-remains">A little hope remains</h2>



<p>A new model of the RTX 4060 with AD106 could be an improved version of the RTX 4060 Ti. Alternatively, the new GPU could also replace the RTX 4060 with 8GB VRAM. Nvidia&rsquo;s plans for its upcoming GPU models remain unclear. </p>



<p>That said, while Nvidia has yet to comment on any of these rumored, unreleased graphics cards, it&rsquo;s possible that an RTX 4090 Ti will be released after all, but an even <em>more</em> expensive high-end model of the RTX 40- series doesn&rsquo;t seem very worthwhile for Nvidia in today&rsquo;s weak PC market.</p>

You can even make money by sharing local disk space as a Storj node. For the average user it&rsquo;s a great deal, but implementing automated backups requires third-party software. </p>
</div>


<p>Storj offers the most storage for free of any online cloud backup service we&rsquo;re aware of. A whopping 25GB, or five times the usual freebie average. It also remains affordable at the next higher tier&ndash;$4 monthly per TB. That&rsquo;s $48 a year&ndash;$22 cheaper than the OneDrive I use now, although the latter includes Microsoft Office.</p>



<p>The downside for the average user is that you must use third-party clients to automate backups&ndash;Storj doesn&rsquo;t provide one. A major upside is that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.storj.io/&amp;xcust=2-1-1965026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Storj </a>will pay you if you host a Storj storage node on your local storage. </p>



<p>And if you&rsquo;re into nerding out, it&rsquo;s also an international distributed-object data system that delivers roughly the same download speeds no matter where you are in the world. If download speed is important to you, then Storj is king of the hill.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="storj-design-and-pricing">Storj design and pricing</h2>



<p>In terms of data organization and language Storj is very Amazon S3-like, employing &ldquo;buckets.&rdquo; These  are akin to root folders, with bucket encompassing &ldquo;projects&rdquo; roughly approximating volumes. </p>



<p>Alas, as mentioned, Storj doesn&rsquo;t provide a graphic backup client for its services. It instead relies upon its UpLink CLI (Command Line Interface), a somewhat limited Web interface, or an access utility such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://cyberduck.io/download/&amp;xcust=2-1-1965026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://s3drive.app/&amp;xcust=2-1-1965026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">S3Drive</a> to facilitate manual operations. </p>



<p>For automation, you&rsquo;ll need a third-party backup client such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.duplicati.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1965026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Duplicati</a> (free), which supports Storj&rsquo;s own protocols. Others such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1953731/arq-7-backup-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Arq 7</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/819871/novabackup-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NovaBackup</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.2brightsparks.com/download-syncbackpro.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1965026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SynBackPro</a> utilize Storj&rsquo;s S3 compatibility to the same end.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1997343" height="493" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Storj-online-storage-13.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Storj divides your online storage in to projects, then buckets, then folders and files.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Additionally, many NAS boxes, including my QNAP TS-253, allow you to define an S3-compatible destination for backups. From my inquiries for this article, it also seems that S3-compatibility is in the works for a number of other backup clients such as my favorite, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605046/r-drive-image-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">R-Drive Image</a>. </p>



<p>Fair warning: You must configure the link between the client and Storj, and it&rsquo;s not dead simple. It requires<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.storj.io/dcs/how-tos/backup-with-duplicati&amp;xcust=2-1-1965026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> generating access info from Storj</a> (it&rsquo;s very secure with encryption keys required), entering it into your app, etc. If you follow the online docs to the letter, you should be fine.</p>



<p>I also found the help rather scattershot in quality, sometimes out of date given I was using Windows 11, and &mdash; once or twice &mdash; incorrect.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1997355" height="949" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Storj-online-storage-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Storj may not be dead easy, but it&rsquo;s certainly affordable!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As noted, Storj employs a distributed object model that utilizes storage nodes across the world. All parity and location info, however, is stored and maintained on Storj&rsquo;s own servers. If you balked at that &ldquo;across the world&rdquo; bit, Storj provides geo-fencing that will limit data to the U.S. or the EU.</p>



<p>If you have enough always-available storage and a fast connection, you can also make money with Storj, as shown below. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1997342" height="684" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Storj-online-storage-16.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">If you have 500GB of storage to spare, you can host a Storj node and get paid for it.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Hosting a storage node is not for the average user simply looking to back up, but hey, it&rsquo;s a revenue stream that&rsquo;s there if you need it. Albeit one paid in Storj tokens. These may then be converted to standard currency, so don&rsquo;t misunderstand my meaning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="storj-performance">Storj performance</h2>



<p>For every 1GB you backup, you actually transfer 2.76GB because of parity required for geographically wide distribution. The parity info doesn&rsquo;t count towards your storage cap, but it does mean longer uploads. </p>



<p>That said, from here in San Francisco with using my 5Mbps Comcast uplink, uploading data from a Mac using the Chrome browser, as well as Cyberduck wasn&rsquo;t all that bad: 690KBps, which is actually higher than the theoretical 600KBps my connection should be capable off. However, because of the larger amount of data involved, total upload times were at best,on par with other services I&rsquo;ve tested, at around 2.65GB (actual data) per hour.</p>



<p>Downloads on the other hand, were ludicrously fast compared to what I&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere&ndash;close to the 30MBps my plan allows. That, folks, is <em>fast</em>. By way of comparison, I get 20MBps from Dropbox and only 5MBps with OneDrive. There might be something to this distributed data deal after all, though I haven&rsquo;t tried it from elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>The response of the HTML interface was smooth and flawless&ndash;no glitches of any kind. However, I do have one web gripe&ndash;the inability to download an entire bucket, folder, or seemingly a group of files using your browser. Use Cyberduck instead and throw those devs a buck or three for a nice job.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="great-but-not-for-everyone">Great but not for everyone</h2>



<p>I really love Storj and the distributed data concept, but it&rsquo;s not a particularly good fit for less tech-savvy users due to the lack of a backup or even sync client&ndash;hence the 4 stars. That said, the pricing is enticing, as is the scintillating download performance if you&rsquo;re willing to adapt. And for some, it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to generate some extra revenue utilizing your excess storage. For those users, it&rsquo;s a 4.5 easy.</p>



<p>Look for an upcoming review of DriveX, an online storage vendor that utilizes Storj&rsquo;s technology and services.</p>

<p>Nvidia introduced Video Super Resolution early in 2023, leveraging the AI tensor cores inside of its GeForce RTX graphics cards to intelligently upscale and clean up grainy videos. We tested the feature and declared that using <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html">Video Super resolution is like going from VHS to Blu-ray</a>. VSR is particularly useful for older video content that doesn&rsquo;t look great on modern screens with high resolutions. The technology is also useful if you don&rsquo;t have enough internet bandwidth for higher resolutions. </p>

<p>Similar to Nvidia&rsquo;s well-known DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) technologies, Nvidia relies on machine learning to improve image quality. To use VSR, you need an Nvidia GeForce graphics card from the RTX 30- or RTX 40-series series, the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers for online videos, VLC for local videos, and the latest Nvidia Game Ready or Studio drivers. </p>



<p>It is unclear why the RTX 20-series GPUs are excluded, although these graphics chips are also DLSS-capable and presumably have suitable hardware for VSR. It&rsquo;s possible that Nvidia will also support these graphics cards in the future, however. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia VSR" class="wp-image-1981738" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pcw08_Nvidia-VSR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>If internet bandwidth is limited or the video is only available in a low resolution, then Nvidia&rsquo;s VSR helps to render the content in a higher resolution in no time.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>To activate VSR, first open the Nvidia Control Panel by right-clicking on the desktop selecting its entry in the context menu. In the left sidebar of the Nvidia Control Panel, navigate to &ldquo;Video&rdquo; under &ldquo;Customize video settings&rdquo; and activate the &ldquo;Super resolution&rdquo; checkbox under &ldquo;RTX video enhancement.&rdquo; </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Activate RTX VSR in Nvidia Control Panel" class="wp-image-1525317" height="711" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-setup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>In the &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; drop-down menu you can select the desired level of upscaling. Note here that a higher level provides better results, but also requires more GPU resources, as we explained in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html">deep-dive testing of Video Super Resolution</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve made your changes, click on &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; and close the control panel. </p>



<p>Then open your browser (or VLC) and start a video of your choice that has a resolution between 360p and 1440p. VSR comes into play automatically when you play the video in full-screen mode. This way you can save bandwidth or enjoy your favorite videos on YouTube in high resolution that better suits your <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">high-resolution monitor</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an irrepressible tech newshound, you might have heard that prices for Intel processors are going up, particularly the Core CPUs that make up the majority of the company&rsquo;s business. According to Intel itself, those price increases aren&rsquo;t happening. The company issued a rare direct refutation of the story, pouring cold water on the red-hot rumor mill. </p>



<p>The story started on a German user forum citing an unconfirmed letter from Intel to retail partners before sprouting alarming stories on European news publications and eventually going worldwide. Said letter claimed that more or less every CPU the company sold at retail would be going up in price in order to fund expanded fabrication facilities and a company restructuring. </p>



<p>This, despite the fact that now would be a disastrous time to double-down on internal investment at the literal cost of retail competitiveness since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470576/1470576.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the PC market is in a protracted and alarming slump</a>. Prices inevitably go up over a long time frame, but if anything market forces are pushing most PC components <em>down </em>at the moment, as you can see with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1664694/its-a-great-time-to-upgrade-your-ssd.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">free-falling sticker street prices on SSDs</a> and other components. Intel is also facing some particularly stiff competition from AMD at the moment, especially for high-end chips where the biggest profits are made. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-shoots-down-reports-of-a-cpu-price-increase#xenforo-comments-3815016&amp;xcust=2-2-2010494-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware quotes an Intel spokesperson</a>, who said that &ldquo;we can confirm that Intel has not sent the letter described to customers and partners, and has not initiated a price change to its CPU portfolio at this time.&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s certainly possible that Intel plans to raise prices in the long term, the fact that someone deemed it necessary to refute these reports in such direct terms means speaks for itself. Don&rsquo;t expect to see a portfolio-wide price increase any time soon. </p>

<p>After the recent automatic Windows Updates KB5028244 and KB5027303 caused problems for many users, Microsoft has temporarily stopped distributing them. The Windows team is now in the process of correcting the error with the help of the &ldquo;Known Issue Rollback&rdquo; feature in Windows.</p>



<p>Users reported problems playing videos after installing the updates from the end of June. Microsoft has now confirmed the issue and announced that it stems from a bug in the WVC1 and VC-1 video codecs. Apps for Windows 10 and Windows 11 that use these codecs may no longer be able to play back or record videos. Some cameras and webcams are also affected. Microsoft worked fast to correct the problem, as noted on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22h2#some-apps-might-fail-to-playback--record--or-capture-video&amp;xcust=2-1-2010459-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Release Health Dashboard</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-distributes-emergency-fix">Microsoft distributes emergency fix</h2>



<p>Microsoft just released an emergency fix. Thanks to the Known Issue Rollback features, affected users now only have to wait for the problem to be fixed automatically. Distribution of the KIR update started on July 25. The original updates were stopped, the bugs were ironed out, and the update was made available again.</p>



<p>Affected systems are the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Windows 11 version 22H2</li>



<li>Windows 11 version 21H</li>



<li>Windows 10 version 22H2</li>
</ul>

## Photoshop adds outpainting to see beyond the Mona Lisa

<p>Adobe Photoshop has added a feature it calls Generative Expand, an &ldquo;outpainting&rdquo; technique that expands the borders of an original photo or artwork using generative AI.</p>



<p>Generative Expand is the latest part of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928107/adobe-photoshop-ships-beta-with-ai-art-tools-from-firefly.html">AI enhancement of Photoshop</a>, which began with Adobe Firefly and has now moved into mainstream tools. You can use Generative Expand in the beta version of the desktop Photoshop app, within the Crop tool.</p>



<p>Outpainting has been a feature of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art</a> scene for some time, enjoying a renaissance of sorts last fall when OpenAI&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338403/the-grandfather-of-ai-art-dall-e-is-now-free-for-you-to-try.html">DALL-E tool</a> (the basis of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html">Bing Image Creator</a>) added a generative expansion function. With outpainting, you can ask the AI algorithm to &ldquo;expand&rdquo; Van Gogh&rsquo;s <em>Starry Night</em> painting, for example, to show part of the scene that the painter never actually created. Was the <em>Mona Lisa</em> actually in a pizza shop? You can add that, too.</p>



<p>Some tools make that process easier than others, however. With DALL-E, you have to add a small square to expand the painting, and it&rsquo;s not clear what to do: Describe the painting itself to expand it? Suggest a scene that the artist could have created? Photoshop is trying both approaches with Generative Expand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Adobe Photoshop Generative Fill beach before" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1017" id="2009800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-19-at-2.52.53-PM-1.png" width="1520" /><img alt="Adobe Photoshop Generative Fill beach after" class="image-compare__image-after" height="4912" id="2009801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/beautifulbeachextended-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="7360" /></div><figcaption>An example of Adobe Generative Fill within Photoshop.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Note that you could already use a <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-1-2009781-1-0-0/destination:https://firefly.adobe.com/generate/inpaint" rel="nofollow">Generative Fill (or &ldquo;<em>in</em>painting&rdquo;) feature within Firefly</a>, shown off at end of this story.</p>



<p>It appears that Adobe is trying to encourage users to not create fantastical images, but transform a vacation photo taken in portrait, for example, into a landscape shot. An example of this is the header image at the top of this story, the &ldquo;original&rdquo; of which is the right-hand photo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-use-generative-expand-in-photoshop">How to use Generative Expand in Photoshop</h2>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need access to the beta version of desktop Photoshop&mdash;Generative Expand is not yet available in the production version.</p>



<p>To use this new feature without a prompt, select the <em>Crop</em> tool, then drag <em>beyond</em> the original boundaries of the image. Click &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; in the Contextual Task Bar, and Photoshop&rsquo;s AI will do what it can to fill the remaining portion of the image with generated content. Photoshop will seamlessly blend the two together in the same layer. This is the simplest method of employing Generative Expand.</p>



<p>You also have the option of adding a custom scene to the original image. To use Generative Expand with a prompt, you&rsquo;ll begin by again expanding the scene using the Crop tool. Adobe isn&rsquo;t exactly clear how a prompt will actually be added, but you&rsquo;ll be able to do so (possibly by right-clicking). In this case, you&rsquo;ll see a few variations of the AI-generated output to choose from. After you select your preferred option, the expanded image will be added non-destructively in a new Generative Layer.</p>

<p>Adobe is now supporting text prompts in over 100 languages, the company said, and promising new AI-generated features for the fall. With several of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html">the best AI art generators</a> already ahead of them, Adobe has plenty of examples to follow.</p>

<p>A quality monitor arm is among the smartest upgrades you can purchase for your home office setup. Monitor arms greatly improve the range of positions a monitor can take on your desk, providing more comfort and an attractive look. They also free up space on your desk, leaving it open for other use.</p>



<p>These perks are offset by a problem: the price. Most monitor arms worth buying are close to $200, and heavy-duty arms are even more expensive. It&rsquo;s important to buy the right monitor arm the first time&mdash;to that end I put several popular monitor arms through their paces.</p>



<p>Here I offer the best monitor arms from my tests. </p>

<p>The Ergotron LX is a sturdy, practical monitor arm that can handle most monitors. It&rsquo;s easy to set up, easy to use, and (when purchased in its white or polished aluminum colorway) attractive.</p>

<p>Ergotron positions the LX as an entry-level monitor arm, but the company&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; exceeds most competitors. The arm is primarily constructed from metal, with some plastic cladding, and can support monitors that weigh up to 25 pounds. Ergotron recommends sticking to monitors 34 inches wide or smaller. The monitor arm is backed by a 10-year warranty.</p>

<p>The arm has a healthy range of adjustment that includes 13 inches of lift, 75 degrees of tilt, 360 degrees of rotation, and 360 degrees of pan (or swivel). While not as smooth as the Herman Miller Flo, I was able to adjust the monitor arm left, right, forward, and back without standing.</p>

<p>Setup is simple. The monitor has an included clamp and grommet mount. Installation is mostly handled with a bundled Allen wrench, though you&rsquo;ll still need a Philips head screwdriver to attach your monitor to the VESA mount. Most owners will be able to install smaller monitors (24 to 27 inches) alone, but help is recommended for larger displays.</p>

<p>Ergotron also avoids any serious flaws. I have a few nitpicks, sure. I think the clamp could be smaller. The white colorway doesn&rsquo;t have a color coordinated VESA mount. And the arm&rsquo;s overall design looks a bit industrial. Still, this is a bomb-proof mount, and it&rsquo;s available under $200. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Want a monitor arm that gets the job done and looks good doing it? The Herman Miller Flo is for you.</p>

<p>The Flo&rsquo;s design sets it apart from the pack. Herman Miller ditches the angular, industrial design of many competitors for a smooth, natural look. While clearly designed for a corporate office, it also fits in with a home office setup, where its friendly, approachable look helps it blend in with its surroundings. The Flo is backed by a 12-year warranty and offers 24/7 customer service.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to set up and use. The monitor&rsquo;s clamp works similarly to other monitor arms I tested, but it&rsquo;s more refined and requires fewer screws (a grommet is also available). The VESA mount is also excellent, providing a simple clip design that&rsquo;s secure and can be easily pre-mounted to a monitor for simple installation. The way this mount works accommodates monitors that have a slightly recessed mount position, which may cause problems for other monitor arms.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s range of adjustment isn&rsquo;t much different from other high-end monitor arms. It offers 13.3 inches of vertical adjustment, 80 degrees of tilt, and 360 degrees of swivel and rotation. That&rsquo;s essentially identical to the less expensive Ergotron LX. The Flo&rsquo;s operation is smoother, however: I found I could adjust a monitor&rsquo;s height with a mere nudge.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the Flo has a listed weight limit of 20 pounds and recommends use with monitors weighing at least 7 pounds. Most monitors fit within this range, but some heavier models won&rsquo;t be compatible with the Flo.</p>

<p>Herman Miller lists the Flo at $295, which is a lot to ask for a single-monitor arm. The Ergotron LX offers similar features at a much lower price. However, the Flo is a smoother, more appealing monitor arm, and worth the upgrade if you want form with your function.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s natural, given the only slight difference in name, to think the Ergotron HX is merely an uprated version of the Ergotron LX. That&rsquo;s not the case. This is an entirely different monitor arm which pairs its increased capacity with improved build quality and a more professional look.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk weight. The Ergotron HX is rated to hold monitors that weigh up to 42 pounds and screen sizes up to 49 inches. That&rsquo;s an extraordinarily high weight limit&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t reviewed a single monitor in 2023 that exceeds it. I attached both a 32-inch widescreen and 38-inch ultrawide monitor, which weighed roughly 15 and 20 pounds, respectively, and the HX easily handled both.</p>

<p>The use of plastic is minimal and reserved for small portions of cladding that appear used only for cable routing. The arm&rsquo;s moving parts include larger, sturdier mechanisms, and felt extremely smooth in my use. Ergotron backs the arm with a 10-year warranty.</p>

<p>The monitors range of adjustment is a bit limited compared to the LX. It offers 11.5 inches of height, 75 degrees of tilt, 180 degrees of swivel, and 360 degrees of rotation. However, a somewhat more limited height adjustment is typical in this category due to the size of monitors these stands are expected to carry.</p>

<p>The monitor arm&rsquo;s impressive design also provides a more robust look. This could be a con for some, however, as the arm can seem a bit&hellip;much in a home office setup. It&rsquo;s an expensive arm, as well. Expect to pay about $350.</p>

<p>The Ergotron HX is an obvious choice if you want to mount an ultrawide, super-ultrawide, or large format widescreen monitor on your desk.</p>

<p>The Workstream by Monoprice single monitor arm is a no-frills solution that delivers basic monitor arm features at an exceptionally low price.</p>

<p>The monitor arm has an all-metal construction that in some ways feels sturdier than the Ergotron LX, as the Workstream doesn&rsquo;t include as much plastic cladding. It&rsquo;s not entirely a win, though, as the plastic that exists feels frail (and I even broke a small, though unnoticeable, bit while adjusting the monitor).</p>

<p>It provides a good range of adjustment, with 13.2 inches of height and 90 degrees of tilt, swivel, and rotation. The arm&rsquo;s height and tilt adjustment are comparable to others on this list, but it can&rsquo;t swivel in a full circle, which may prove annoying if you frequently move a monitor arm to share your screen with colleagues.</p>

<p>The Workstream&rsquo;s slim budget is felt in its difficult setup and stiff operation. Users will need to install several screws for a clamp or gromet mount. More screws may need to be adjusted once the arm is in place, as its default tension proved inadequate for supporting a 32-inch monitor.</p>

<p>Monoprice lists the monitor as capable of supporting 20 pounds, but I felt the 32-inch monitor (which weighed 15 pounds) was pushing the Workstream to its limits. Monoprice also skimps on the warranty, offering just one year of coverage.</p>

<p>These flaws are easily excused by the Workstream&rsquo;s $60 price tag. It&rsquo;s clearly less capable, less attractive, and more difficult to use than Ergotron&rsquo;s LX, but it offers a good range of adjustment and durable construction for less than half the price. It&rsquo;s an ideal choice for shoppers on a tight budget, as well as those who plan to install a small, light 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.</p>

<p>Two monitors are always better than one, and the same goes for monitor arms. It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that Ergotron&rsquo;s LX Side-by-Side ranks as our best dual monitor arm. The Ergotron LX Side-by-Side pairs two LX monitor arms together on one mount. The look, feel, and specifications of each arm are close to its standalone sibling.</p>

<p>Monitor size is one exception: While the standard LX is rated for monitors up to 34 inches, the Side-by-Side&rsquo;s arm is only rated for monitors up to 27 inches. The monitor arms aren&rsquo;t long enough to fit two 32-inch or 34-inch monitors side-by-side. Vertical arrangements are also supported, though only if one of the two monitors is small (less than 23 inches diagonal).</p>

<p>Look and feel is otherwise similar to the standard Ergotron LX, and that&rsquo;s why the dual monitor arm also earns a recommendation. The dual-monitor arm provides the same winning balance of build quality, adjustability, and smooth operation, and it&rsquo;s backed by the same 10-year warranty. &nbsp;Pricing is a bit higher at $330, which is a slight savings compared to buying two LX arms individually.</p>

<p>The same logic that applies to our favorite dual monitor arm also to the budget model, giving Monoprice&rsquo;s Workstream Dual Monitor Arm a clear path to victory.</p>

<p>In fact, the dual arm&rsquo;s pricing is even more impressive. The Workstream Dual Monitor is four times less expensive than the Ergotron LX Side-by-Side. I&rsquo;m a bit shocked by the quality Monoprice can offer at a $100 price point. Ergotron&rsquo;s alternative is more attractive and easier to use, but is it <em>four times</em> better? That&rsquo;s a tough call.</p>

<p>The Workstream&rsquo;s downsides are identical to standard model. Build quality is impressive for the price, but the arm is difficult to set up and not as smooth in operation. I&rsquo;m also doubtful the arm is capable of handling two 20-pound monitors, as its spec sheets claim. Fortunately, 27-inch monitors (the largest this arm can handle side-by-side) usually weigh less than 10 pounds, so weight capacity shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-monitor-arm">What to look for in a monitor arm</h2>



<p>Purchasing a monitor arm is a bit different from purchasing most home office gear. A monitor arm, unlike a monitor, is a hefty, durable piece of equipment that never really goes obsolete. It must also support the specific functions you want out of the box, since upgrades and customization tend to be limited.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adjustability-and-range-of-motion">Adjustability and range of motion</h3>



<p>The range of adjustability and motion a monitor arm can offer is a critical but often overlooked feature. A monitor arm should adjust for height, tilt, swivel, and pivot&mdash;and it should do so without tools.</p>



<p>All the monitor arms we recommend meet this standard, but some differences remain. Only some monitor arms provide 360 degrees of swivel, meaning the neck of the monitor arm can be rotated to any position. That&rsquo;s handy if your desk is in the middle of your room since you can use the monitor from various positions.</p>



<p>Most inexpensive monitor arms ditch adjustability and stick with simple tension mechanisms that are secured by a screw. It&rsquo;s inexpensive but fixes the monitor&rsquo;s position in place once it&rsquo;s adjusted. We recommend avoiding mounts that use this strategy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ease-of-installation-and-adjustment">Ease of installation and adjustment</h3>



<p>None of the monitor arms tested were difficult to install, but the difference between budget and premium models was clear. Budget models require more screws to install, and the default tension of the arm&rsquo;s adjustment mechanism is less likely to be suitable out-of-the-box.</p>



<p>The ease of adjustment varies greatly, too. All the monitor arms we surveyed require an Allen wrench to adjust tension (which is necessary if the arm seems too stiff or loose), but some were much more difficult than others. The Herman Miller Flo felt smooth and effortless, while the Workstream by Monoprice required serious torque.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cable-management">Cable management</h3>



<p>Proper cable management is important if you value a clean, clutter-free desk.</p>



<p>This is one aspect of design that didn&rsquo;t improve with pricing. The Herman Miller Flo&rsquo;s cable management was basic, while the Workstream by Monoprice hid cables well. This did come with a trade-off, though, as the Flo&rsquo;s seemed least likely to cause cables to bind while moving the monitor.</p>



<p>While cable management is useful, none of the monitor arms I tested can handle the full complement of cables that might be attached to a high-end USB-C monitor (like the Dell U3223QE). This is an aspect of monitor arm design that manufacturers could improve.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="maximum-supported-size-and-weight">Maximum supported size and weight</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s important to buy a monitor arm that can handle the monitor you own.</p>



<p>This won&rsquo;t be a major concern if you own a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor, as most such monitors weigh 10 pounds or less. With that said, it&rsquo;s wise to double-check the monitor&rsquo;s weight before buying a monitor arm. Remember the monitor&rsquo;s weight can exclude its stand. Larger 32-inch, 34-inch, and 49-inch monitors are more difficult to handle and may require an upgrade to a &ldquo;heavy duty&rdquo; monitor arm.</p>



<p>Monitor size limits should be respected as well. It might be possible to attach a 40-inch monitor to an arm meant for a 32-inch monitor. The 40-inch monitor may even come within the arm&rsquo;s weight limit. A larger monitor will distribute weight differently, however, which could cause an arm&rsquo;s tension mechanism to fail.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-monitor-arms">How we test monitor arms</h2>



<p>Every monitor arm we recommend was personally tested first-hand at a PC World contributor&rsquo;s home or the PC World office. We examine the quality, ease of installation, and range of adjustment of each arm to verify it meets the manufacturer&rsquo;s claims. The monitors we use to test arms can vary over time, but generally include at least one 27-inch and one 32-inch widescreen monitor. Monitor arms rated for &ldquo;heavy duty&rdquo; use were tested with at least one monitor that weighs 20 pounds or more.</p>
