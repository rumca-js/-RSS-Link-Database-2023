By day three, the field of 56 teams is cut to just 16. By the end of the day, only one team will earn the title of best Ranger.\n\nInsider's chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent three days following the competition at the Fort Benning Army installation, which only three weeks later changed its name to Fort Moore as a result of a congressional act to rename military bases whose names honored Confederate leaders.\n\nAll competitors are Ranger-qualified, meaning they have completed the challenging 62-day Ranger course that earns them the coveted Ranger tab. \n\nAlong with the bragging rights that come with winning \"BRC,\" winners receive a prize package worth nearly $18,000. The prizes include rifles, pistols, gun safes, and other tactical equipment. Historically, competition winners continue to rise in the Army ranks and get opportunities to work in academia and Hollywood.\n\nChapters\n:00 Intro\n1:02 Day 1 begins\n1:20 Team 11, 10th Mountain Division\n2:24 What it means to win\n3:18 Mass-start buddy run\n3:49 Team 36, 75th Ranger Regiment\n4:26 Army Ranger heritage\n5:01 Run, swim, run\n5:43 Malvesti obstacle course\n6:33 Team 29, 3rd US Infantry Regiment\n7:42 Army combat fitness test\n7:52 Helicopter ride\n8:10 Urban assault course\n9:20 Gun ranges\n9:28 Special-duty status\n9:38 Team 29 coaches\n10:54 Rest before ruck\n11:45 Ruck march\n12:06 Fort Benning name change\n12:32 Day 2 begins\n13:07 Day stakes\n13:56 Sponsors and prizes\n14:25 Standings after day stakes\n14:36 Zip line\n14:51 Tactical water movement\n15:23 Team 29 returns\n16:17 Day 3 begins\n16:29 Team 36 on rappel tower\n16:50 Team 36 on obstacle course\n17:08 Team 11 on rappel tower\n17:50 Team 11 on obstacle course\n18:08 Gun range\n18:38 Helocast\n18:56 Combat water survival assessment\n19:37 Final buddy run\n20:10 Conclusion\n\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:\nEvery Way Army Snipers Are Trained To Be \"Lethal Soldiers\" | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSexFPtep0\nHow West Point Makes Over 13,000 Meals A Day For Army Cadets | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgnMNzvYqkk\nEvery Item In An Air Force Gunship Pilot's Go Bag | Loadout | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI-FqD7XLu4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#armyranger #usarmy #insiderbusiness \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nWhat It Takes To Survive The Army's 60-Hour Best Ranger Competition | Boot Camp | Insider Business", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LpHCElQdz0", "date_published": "2023-07-27T15:50:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_LpHCElQdz0/hqdefault.jpg"}]
