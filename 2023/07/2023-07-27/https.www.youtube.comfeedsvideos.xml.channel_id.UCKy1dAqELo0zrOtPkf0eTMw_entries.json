The upcoming horror movie stars Corey Hawkins (In the Heights, Straight Outta Compton) as Clemens, a doctor who joins the Demeter crew, Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones, The Nightingale) as an unwitting stowaway, Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans) as the ship\u2019s captain and David Dastmalchian (Dune, the Ant-Man franchise) as the Demeter\u2019s first mate. The film also stars Jon Jon Briones (Ratched, American Horror Story), Stefan Kapicic (Deadpool films, Better Call Saul), Nikolai Nikolaeff (Stranger Things, Bruised), and Javier Botet (It films, Mama).\n\nBased on a single chapter from Bram Stoker\u2019s classic novel Dracula, The Last Voyage of the Demeter tells the terrifying story of the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to carry private cargo\u2014fifty unmarked wooden crates\u2014from Carpathia to London. Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship. When the Demeter finally arrives off the shores of England, it is a charred, derelict wreck. There is no trace of the crew. \n\nFrom DreamWorks Pictures and the producers of Zodiac and Black Swan, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal (Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark, Trollhunter), from a script by Bragi F. Schut (Escape Room), Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Zak Olkewicz (the upcoming Bullet Train), based on the chapter \u201cThe Captain\u2019s Log\u201d of Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. \n\nThe film is produced by Brad Fischer and by Oscar-nominated producer Mike Medavoy and Arnold Messer for Phoenix Pictures and is executive produced by Matthew Hirsch.\n\nThe Last Voyage of the Demeter opens in theaters on August 11, 2023.\n\n#IGN #Movies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtFSJ91EH4", "date_published": "2023-07-27T23:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eBtFSJ91EH4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Ad Infinitum - Official Pre-Order Trailer", "description": "Get a look at the unsettling world of Ad Infinitum, including gameplay and terrifying monsters, in this latest trailer for the upcoming game.\n\nThe line separating nightmare and reality is becoming increasingly blurred.

Can the Dark Knight elude the police, capture the Phantasm and clear his own name? Unmasking the Phantasm is just one of the twists in this dazzling animated feature, which provides new revelations about Batman's past, his archrival the Joker, and Batman's most grueling battle ever - the choice between his love for a beautiful woman and his vow to be the defender of right.\n\nThe release will also include an all-new featurette Kevin Conroy: I Am The Knight, which takes a look at the legacy of Kevin Conroy, who voiced Batman for 30 years in film, television, video games, and more.\n\nThe 4K HDR/SDR remaster of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm was sourced from the 1993 Original Cut Camera Negative and was scanned at 4K resolution. Digital restoration was applied to the 4K scans to remove dirt, scratches and additional anomalies, but special care was given to not touch the film grain or the animation cel dirt that was part of the original artwork. This is the first time since its theatrical release that it is presented in its 1.85 aspect ratio. The original 2.0 mix and the 5.1 tracks were remastered to remove or improve defects such as pops, ticks, dropouts, and distortion.\n\nThe Batman: Mask of the Phantasm filmmaking team is composed of the award-winning core group behind Batman: The Animated Series.

Where it excels, though, is in providing a wholesome co-operative journey through a charismatic cartoon world that\u2019s well-suited to pairings of parents and their children, or perhaps older and younger siblings. It effectively gives every member of the party the means to happily bound along on the ride without ever being made to feel like a burden. If you\u2019re after a frictionless, family-friendly platforming adventure that\u2019s heavy on charm and light on challenge, then Disney Illusion Island fits the bill better than a muzzle on Donald Duck.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zteAWg0wuEo", "date_published": "2023-07-27T12:00:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zteAWg0wuEo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages & Oracle of Seasons - Official Nintendo Switch Online Trailer", "description": "Get a look at these two classic The Legend of Zelda games, which have just been added to the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy library.

Jumping in and learning its satisfyingly punchy combat and long list of fun and unique playable characters that you can tag in for combos turns a somewhat shallow pond of an early game experience into an impressive lake of collaborative combat options. But things got a little too repetitive and frustrating before I even got my first clear thanks to the shallow enemy pool, few game-changing upgrades, a brutal difficulty spike if you choose to save the wrong boss for last, and lack of worthwhile unlockables to chase outside of new fighters.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #DoubleDragon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v4YkAYydIc", "date_published": "2023-07-27T07:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7v4YkAYydIc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Witcher Season 3 Volume 2 Review", "description": "The Witcher Season 3 Volume 2 reviewed by Jarrod Jones.\n\n\"The Witcher is back to flex even more political intrigue and surprise character reveals, and it reliably comes packing a stirring fight sequence or two, but the month-long wait to finish season 3 amounts to disappointment.
