There are transcriptions of songs by Schubert, Mendelssohn and Clara Schumann alongside more substantial works derived from opera. The best known piece here is probably Liszt\u2019s paraphrase on Verdi\u2019s Rigoletto \u2013 the Aida and Ernani paraphrases are included too \u2013 while the discs begin with the most spectacular of all these arrangements, the overture to Wagner\u2019s Tannh\u00e4user, which Hamilton plays with tremendous verve and intensity, every strand of the piano textures crystal-clear. For good measure he follows it with Song to the Evening Star from the same opera, complete with Liszt\u2019s own coda. There\u2019s more Wagner later on, with the deliciously decorated version of Am Stillen Herd from Die Meistersinger, and a witty, tricksy Spinning Song from Der Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder, glitteringly dispatched.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/kenneth-hamilton-plays-liszt-volume-2-salon-and-stage-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/kenneth-hamilton-plays-liszt-volume-2-salon-and-stage-review", "date_published": "2023-07-27T14:30:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018An incredible loss\u2019: Ireland shares memories of Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor", "description": "<p>Shocked by her death, the singer\u2019s compatriots are recalling her courage, kindness and humour</p><p>The memories have come tumbling out.

charisma to burn", "description": "<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London</strong> <br />Of course Acosta has lost a little bounce after half a century, but the Cuban master still dances with care, specificity and dramatic flair<br /></p><p>When Carlos Acosta staged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/09/carlos-acosta-classical-farewell-michael-clark-company-to-a-simple-rock-roll-song-review\">his Classical Farewell</a> in 2016, he said it was the last time he\u2019d be donning his ballet tights. But like many performing icons, Acosta\u2019s never really said goodbye and the tights are out again for a feelgood 50th birthday gala season.<br /><br />Fifty may be long past a dancer\u2019s average retirement age (although he\u2019s not the only one still pirouetting, see: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/26/dancer-alessandra-ferri-baryshnikov-nureyev-woolf-works-royal-ballet\">Alessandra Ferri</a>) and Acosta\u2019s never going to be the dancer he was 20 years ago \u2013 the bounce goes, the height of the arabesque \u2013 but you still want to watch him. Certainly the packed Opera House does, cheering in an un-English manner as the curtain rises to reveal a trim Acosta centre stage, dressed as the god Apollo.<br /><br />The Cuban has charisma in spades, and grace and graciousness. The trick in a show like this is to lean on what you can still do well, and reveal facets of a role we might not have noticed before. Apollo was a signature of Acosta\u2019s in his heyday, George Balanchine\u2019s young god ascending to Olympus. Acosta dances with care, specificity and dramatic flair. Unlike some portrayals that begin with Bambi-like naivety, Acosta can no longer play the ingenue; his Apollo already has authority, but this time, perhaps, is thinking about how to use it. It\u2019s a portrayal of patriarchy Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken would love: charmed man born into power, plays with the muses (\u201cCome hither! Begone!\u201d), but these women are serene and self-possessed, especially C\u00e9line Gittens\u2019 spritely Polyhymnia, delightful in precision and personality.</p><p>Acosta was always a masterful partner, and when he dances Swan Lake\u2019s White Swan pas de deux with the divine Marianela Nu\u00f1ez, the way he holds and turns her like a precious object magnifies her performance; he\u2019s switched on at every moment. Their Manon pas de deux is more exposed, technically, but no less ardent. And where Acosta can\u2019t dance the bravura steps he brings in some back-up, his nephew Yonah Acosta (a principal with Bavarian State Ballet) to do the barnstorming leaps for him in Le Corsaire. Not that Uncle Carlos doesn\u2019t still have chops. A more recent contemporary work, Mermaid by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, plays on his swift, tight turns.<br /><br />It\u2019s a thoughtfully chosen programme, with a piece by early mentor Ben Stevenson from Houston Ballet, and dancers from Birmingham Royal Ballet, where Acosta is now artistic director, including a near-naked Brandon Lawrence in Valery Panov\u2019s Liebestod, marvelling at the male form to a crescendo of Wagner.<br /><br />We see Acosta\u2019s own uneven choreography, his experimental remake of the Dying Swan, always moving forward. And also look back, in a short blast from Tocororo, his semi-autobiographical show from 2003 (we could have done with a bit more of this high spirit). Most surprising is how his clunky Carmen is given new life, danced by his<a href=\"https://www.acostadanza.com/en/node/1\"> Havana-based company Acosta Danza</a>, transformed with earthy Latin/flamenco spirit and a naturalism previously lacking.<br /><br />At heart this show may be about reliving memories, but Acosta is undeniably one of the greats \u2013 and one of the art\u2019s great advocates too, about to launch a new dance centre in Woolwich, London. It would be churlish not to cheer this supremely hard-working star.<br /><br />\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/carlos-at-50-details\">Carlos at 50 continues until 30 July at the Royal Opera House</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/27/carlos-at-50-review-acosta-royal-opera-house-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/27/carlos-at-50-review-acosta-royal-opera-house-london", "date_published": "2023-07-27T14:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Devendra Banhart: \u2018A tattoo of bull\u2019s horns almost piercing my nipples felt very inspiring\u2019", "description": "<p>The playful Venezuelan American singer answers your questions, taking in Marc Bolan, haircuts from Cate Le Bon, and his \u2018bottomless pit of regret\u2019</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Your forthcoming album, </strong><strong>Flying Wig,</strong><strong> was produced by </strong><strong>Cate Le Bon</strong><strong>.

Almost from the moment they first appeared, as the 70s became the 80s, it was apparent that this was a band that would run entirely according to their leader Kevin Rowland\u2019s own, occasionally imponderable, internal logic. The release of a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dexys\">Dexys</a> album invariably heralded complete change: a radically different look, a new sound, a new lineup.</p><p>But even said diehard fans might raise an eyebrow at The Feminine Divine. It is not so much that it doesn\u2019t look, or occasionally sound, like any previous Dexys album. The cover drawing of the Hawaiian goddess Pele looks as if it belongs on the sleeve of a psychedelic trance compilation; there are musical diversions into sleazy Prince-ish electronic funk, jangling Balearic house pianos and slow-motion breakbeats topped with spoken word vocals that bring to mind early 70s Serge Gainsbourg \u2013 but diversions are par for the course with Dexys. It\u2019s not that Rowland spends a considerable chunk of the album excoriating his younger self, the Rowland who made the albums that diehard fans first fell in love with. That is par for the course, too, at least in Dexys\u2019 latter-day incarnation \u2013 their first album in 27 years, 2012\u2019s One Day I\u2019m Going to Soar, was a self-flagellating exploration of Rowland\u2019s failings, filled with self-doubt and dissatisfaction.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/dexys-the-feminine-divine-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/27/dexys-the-feminine-divine-review", "date_published": "2023-07-27T11:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "House of Fraser owner could close more big shops as department store industry is \u2018broken\u2019", "description": "<p>Retail group says pretax profits almost doubled as Sports Direct improved margins</p><p>The owner of House of Fraser has said it could close more stores, after shutting eight in the past year and declaring \u201cthe department store globally is broken\u201d.</p><p>Michael Murray, the chief executive of Mike Ashley\u2019s retail empire Frasers which also owns Sports Direct, the designer street fashion chain Flannels and a plethora of brands from Jack Wills to Evans Cycles, said its department store portfolio was \u201ccontinually under review\u201d and some outlets were \u201cstill too big and we have to find solutions for the excess space\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/27/house-of-fraser-close-stores-department-store-sports-direct\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/27/house-of-fraser-close-stores-department-store-sports-direct", "date_published": "2023-07-27T10:58:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018No one knew what to do\u2019: when Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor ripped up the pope\u2019s photo on TV \u2013 the inside story", "description": "<p>Record label executive Daniel Glass remembers the infamous 1992 SNL appearance that resulted in the artist becoming \u2018totally cancelled\u2019</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/controversy-never-drowned-out-the-astonishing-songcraft-of-sinead-oconnor\">Alexis Petridis pays tribute</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/sinead-oconnor-dies-aged-56\">Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor dies aged 56</a></strong></li></ul><p>At the record label Chrysalis in New York, we had a Wednesday marketing meeting every week.

This was before she shaved her head. When we heard [debut album] The Lion and the Cobra it was one of the greatest meetings I\u2019ve ever attended \u2013 it was staggering, this record. It came out and we promoted it in a very unorthodox way. The key was getting it to go up the American college media charts, which it did and we took it to No 1. There were remixes of Mandinka and various other records \u2013 we had an MC Lyte version of I Want Your (Hands on Me).</p><p>Sin\u00e9ad was terrific, so smart. And you could see at that young age she was very torn about stardom and recognition. The first day she landed, we decided to have dinner. We were going downtown, and I don\u2019t know who made the decision to have a limousine but she wouldn\u2019t get in. She wanted to go in a van. And then we got to Tower Records \u2013 the buzz was already out about Sin\u00e9ad and a DJ was playing the record. She got very upset and said to me, \u201cIf there was a hole in the ground, I would crawl into it right now. Please tell him to take it off.\u201d And I said to her very nicely, \u201cIt\u2019s a homage. It\u2019s respect.\u201d She said, \u201c<em>Please</em>, I don\u2019t want to hear it.

In 1866, he invented a solar-powered steam engine, using a trough of curved shiny metal to focus the sun\u2019s rays on to a tube filled with water, turning the water to steam, which drove an engine.<br /><br />Mouchot showed his largest solar engine at the World\u2019s Fair in Paris in 1878. The sun\u2019s rays were concentrated in a reflective metal cone focused on a boiler attached to a heat-powered refrigeration device that produced blocks of ice. It caused a sensation, with audiences watching in amazement to see ice made by solar power. Mouchot also used a solar-powered steam engine to drive a printing press and a water pump for irrigation.<br /><br />The exhibition in 1878 also marked the rise to prominence of the internal combustion engine, at just the time when coal and oil were becoming much cheaper, and so interest in solar energy and engines rapidly faded.
