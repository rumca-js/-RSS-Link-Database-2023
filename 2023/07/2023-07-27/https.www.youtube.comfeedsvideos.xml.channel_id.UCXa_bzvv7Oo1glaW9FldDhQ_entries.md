Crytek’s bounty hunting PvPvE FPS Hunt: Showdown has enjoyed growing success since its release to early access in February 2018. In fact, during the recent Tide of Shadows event to coincide with the March time release of it’s bulky 1.12 update, Hunt: Showdown broke its own concurrent player record. Principal behind its ongoing success is the developer’s consistent fan-led approach, actively participating in community groups to discover and discuss ideas which they then incorporate into the game. 

Of course, Hunt: Showdown’s gunslinging is fantastic too – tense, exploratory, and overwhelmingly thrilling, with a focus on individual playstyle. The game risked fusing too many disparate elements together in an effort to craft something unique, but as it happens Hunt: Showdown balances it’s influences just right to make it one hell of a game.

Baldur’s Gate 3 was always going to be a massive release, but it seems to be shaping up to be even bigger than most could have imagined. Boasting an emphasis on choice and consequence mechanics and enabling players to author their experiences to unprecedented degrees the way very few games can claim to have done in the past, Larian Studios’ upcoming release is well and truly looking like the ultimate realization of what RPGs are about, and in particular, what a good CRPG can be capable of. 

Here, we talk about why Baldur’s Gate 3 is looking like an unmissable experience for anyone with a passing interest in the genre.

The Mortal Kombat has several storied characters, with backstories and subplots going a long way back. However, there are perhaps none with longer-running tales than the original cast, which includes Liu Kang. Earthrealm's Champion, who won Mortal Kombat when the first game was released in 1992, is also one of the greatest heroes in fighting games.

For a time, his fate was tied to the official canon of the series, and this continued in Mortal Kombat 11, where, after his present and past selves merged.

Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons wants you to remember the ‘90s heyday of the franchise. Ultimately, the game will take you on an abbreviated journey through New York City duking it out with gnarly gangs and the territories in subway systems, junkyard trash pyramids, and beyond. 

While there is some fun to be had, this beat ‘em up is subpar when compared to the likes of Streets of Rage 4 and other– games with far more substance in their combat offerings. However, it’s also not the worst beat ‘em up on the market, either. If you’re a fan of the Double Dragon series, then this might be one trip worth taking. However, if the series means nothing to you, then you can certainly do better.
