The DOJ promised it wouldn&#8217;t target journalists and their sources during leak investigations. It also said wouldn&#8217;t engage in questionable CFAA prosecutions that appeared to involve nothing more than unapproved (or unexpected) access to data. Both of those self-imposed restrictions seem to have been ignored in a case involving former Deadspin contributor Tim Burke and [&#8230;]

You may recall that early on in Elon’s ownership of Twitter, he insisted that “removing child exploitation is priority #1” while exhorting his supporters to “reply in the comments” if they saw any. Leaving aside that this is a ridiculously terrible process for having people report potential CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) or, as some [&#8230;]

On Wednesday, the Senate revealed an amended version of the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) for today’s hearing over the bill. One would hope with so much public pushback over the bill, they might do something crazy like trying to fix the bill. That is, apparently, way too much to ask. Earlier today, the Senate [&#8230;]
