Lia, as you know, is a NCAA champion female swimmer. Who as Will Thomas, a male swimmer, was at best mid. Then he transitioned to she, and Lia's new female teammates were told if they weren't okay with it THEY were the ones who had mental problems. One of those former teammates was Paula Scanlan.</p><p>Paula was the anonymous teammate <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">who appeared in the <em>What Is A Woman?</em> documentary</a>. Last month <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate" target="_blank">she came forward and revealed her identity</a>. Today, she testified before Congress at a hearing about "Gender-Affirming Care," where she revealed the 18 times a week her teammates were forced to undress in the presence of Lia, a 6-foot-4 biological male fully intact with male genitalia.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<blockquote>When we tried to voice our concerns to the athletic department, we were told that Lia swimming and being in our locker room was a non-negotiable and <strong>were offered psychological services to become comfortable with the idea of undressing in front of a male</strong>.</blockquote><p>Then Paula bravely dropped a bombshell about why this was such a personal issue for her.</p><blockquote>I know of women with sexual trauma who are adversely impacted by having biological males in their locker room without consent. I know this because I am one of these women. I was sexually assaulted on June 3 of 2016. I was only sixteen years old.</blockquote><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Hearings don't go anywhere. And the Democrats who support the policy that favors Will Thomas over Paula Scanlan both willfully distort what the criticisms of those policies are and refuse to talk to anyone who disagrees with them. These brave girls need to go right up to these elected officials -- and Joe Biden if he's ever allowed in public -- and get Democrats on camera explaining to the victims' faces that the victims are the ones who need to deal with it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Fox gives "polite ultimatum" to remove race clip from Jason Aldean's "Small Town" video: report

I'm not sure if you know this, but people who supported those riots feel Aldean's video was insensitive. I had guessed that the edit could have been made when FOX 5 Atlanta put in a copyright claim about her news clip.</p><p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/26/jason-aldean-music-video-try-that-in-a-small-town-black-lives-matter-protest/" target="_blank">According to TMZ</a>, lucky guess!</p><p>Portions of a six-second FOX 5 Atlanta news clip appeared in the original music video twice. At one point, it was projected onto the exterior wall of a Tennessee County courthouse that was also featured in the Hannah Montana movie.</p><p>When the video production company reached out FOX 5 Atlanta to use the footage, FOX asked to see a copy of the lyrics. The production company sent a link to the song instead. At the time, I'm guessing whoever listened to the song didn't find anything wrong with it. Because -- and this is key --- there is nothing wrong with the lyrics. </p><p>It wasn't until the video came out that someone on Twitter got in their feels over it. Then one thing led to another. Gun control harpy Shannon Watts got the video <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shannon-watts-jason-aldean" target="_blank">removed from a network that barely plays videos</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-hot-100-sales" target="_blank">caused Aldean to see a 999% increase</a> in plays.</p><p>Yet still...</p><blockquote>Our sources say a week ago, FOX reached out to the production company and asked them to remove the video to avoid any legal action -- which was described to us as a "polite ultimatum" -- and the production company complied.</blockquote><p>The new video has been up for a week before the journalsimers at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/25/jason-aldean-controversial-music-video-edited/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>, while analyzing the video like it was the Zapruder film, discovered it was off by six seconds.</p><p>The important thing is it wasn't Aldean who bent the knee. That would have been disappointing. Plus the original video is still all over the internet. If you can spot the six seconds, you're much more eagle-eyed than I am.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>Left and right don't agree on many issues. One of the few where there is common ground is way too many elected officials are too f*cking old to be elected officials. You shouldn't be allowed to hold office if you're in your 70s, let alone your 80s and 90s. Selfish staffers keep propping their bosses up so they don't have to look for a different job and count on an uninterested electorate to do the rest.</p><p>Hoggy thought now would be a good time to remind us how he has derp for brains, claiming the McConnell episode is yet another ever of a right-wing corporate media protecting McConnell.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>If there is but one regret about this exchange is that it didn't take place before a live studio audience.

## Watch: MSNBC lady swears Joe Biden did nothing wrong but love Hunter Biden... to Biden's former spokeswoman

	It's not the shamelessness of the White House using "Joe Biden just loves his son" to dismiss any criticism of Hunter Biden's shady business dealings. It's the shamelessness of knowing they can get away with it on corporate media without being challenged. Exhibit Q is an MSNBC analyst dropping the line on an MSNBC host. The analyst is a former Democrat senator. The host is Joe Biden's former spokesman Jen Psaki.
</p>
<p>
	Yes, the Jen Psaki <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jen-psaki-hunter-biden-reporter" target="_blank">who would dismiss Hunter Biden questions from the White House podium</a> before it became KJP's job.

	 They are going to try to indict a father for loving his son who has been addicted to drugs and or alcohol and without evidence of the father doing anything other than loving that son. And that, I think, doesn’t fly with most of the American people.
</blockquote>
<p>
	Hunter Biden <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-movies-dad" target="_blank">banged prostitutes</a>, sent his father <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-movies-dad" target="_blank">clips of his homemade porn</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-business-partner-bombshell" target="_blank">used his father's political connections</a> -- as the Vice President of the United States -- to get ahead is what's not going to fly with most of the American people. Neither will the talking point of Joe Biden being a family man. People who love their families <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/msnbc-shields-joe-biden" target="_blank">don't reject their four-year-old grandchildren because of politics</a>.
</p>
<p>
	This latest dispatch of the "Joe just loves his son" talking point came <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hunter-biden-expected-plead-guilty-criminal-tax-case-rcna96232" target="_blank">after Wednesday's court debacle</a>. Hunter Biden was expected to plead "guilty" on tax charges as part of the sweetheart deal his father's DOJ cut with him. He also expected that. to include immunity from being charged for all other crimes. The judge said, "Absolutely not." Hunter pleaded "not guilty" as a result.
</p>
<p>
	As of this writing, corporate journalsimers have not started to write hit pieces attacking the judge. Yet.
</p>
<p>
	The White House to cable news pipeline is good work if you can get it and be a Leftist. Jen Psaki went from NBC News to the Obama Administration to CNN to the Biden Administration back to MSNBC. It's a good thing she's not a Republican. If she were, people may think this was unethical.

## Ice Cube uncensored with Tucker Carlson: Says he's banned from 'The View,' compares trans people to pigeons

He didn't lay down anything on wax. I would have liked to have heard the "No Vaseline (Rupert Murdoch's Ex-Girlfriend Remix). But the two had a great conversation and when Ice Cube said <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ice-cube-podcast-tour" target="_blank">he was going to be burning a few bridges</a>?</p><p>Expect a lot of content created about Ice Cube being a right-wing extremist.

</blockquote>
<p>One show that Cube said he is no longer welcome on is "The View."</p><blockquote>A few [of the hosts} didn't like where I was coming from. That's what I was told by the producers. I don't know if the producers were copping out to use the hoists as an excuse not to have me on and explain myself. I don't follow their brand of politics, I guess."</blockquote><p>This isn't surprising. A lot of the hosts, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-scott-joy-behar" target="_blank">especially white woman</a> Joy Behar, have severe issues with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/view-tim-scott-monday" target="_blank">black men who are independent thinkers</a>.</p><p>Where I think the interview is going to cause Leftists to go into conniptions is Cube's "comment" on trans people. I put the word  "comment" in finger quotes because he was making a broad argument about how people are allowed to say they are "born this way" if they were born one way. Yet if you were "born this way" as a man with male instincts, you're toxic.</p><blockquote>Not everyone needs to affirm you. If I wake up and say "I feel like a pigeon and I want everybody to treat me like a pigeon," so,e people may say "Whatever, we'll treat you like a pigeon." But some people may choose to be like "Dude...no. That's your world. We're not a part of it."</blockquote><p>Tucker's reaction is all of us.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="41305" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34682021&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>They tackled issues of race and Cube's views on the police too, where he said some things Carlson and maybe a lot of you reading this may not agree with. But it was a respectful conversation between two people about important issues. We need a lot more of this.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## As Anheuser-Busch sees massive layoffs, Dylan Mulvaney makes serious bank lecturing colleges on "women's empowerment"

And as parent company Anheuser-Busch is forced to lay off hundreds of employees, Mulvaney is cashing in on the college lecture circuit telling college students "damn, I feel like a woman." Doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo doo.</p><p>Let's go... girls?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Ever since Bud Light bypassed thousands of real girls who love college basketball in favor of guy who presents as a girl who doesn't know what a "March Madness" is, sales are down over 25%. Bud Light is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-falls-top-ten" target="_blank">no longer even a top TEN beer </a>in America and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-bars-restaurants" target="_blank">lost its top spot</a> in bars and restaurants. Though in fairness to the TikTok ingénue, having your <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing" target="_blank">executives lash out at how much they hate your customers</a> may have played a hand.</p><p>Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/07/26/anheuser-busch-laysoff-hundreds-workers-bud-light-boycott/" target="_blank">made the layoff announcement that affects hundreds of employees</a>. He didn't mention the controversy since he<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-cbs-mornings" target="_blank"> doesn't like putting Dylan's name in his mouth</a>, but... know what I mean?</p><blockquote>“While we never take these decisions lightly, we want to ensure that our organization continues to be set for future long-term success. These corporate structure changes will enable our teams to focus on what we do best—brewing great beer for everyone.”</blockquote><p>Some of you may be thinking, "What about Dylan Mulvaney? Is Dylan Mulvaney going to be okay?" Dylan is getting $40,000 a pop to go to college campuses and discuss "women's empowerment" with your daughters. And I guess your sons too.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>It's a great hustle if you can get it. Maybe Anheuser-Busch can pay Dylan $40,000 to teach their now-former employees how to make money as an influencer. It's really easy. Start a TikTok. Pretend you're a girl. Print money.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
