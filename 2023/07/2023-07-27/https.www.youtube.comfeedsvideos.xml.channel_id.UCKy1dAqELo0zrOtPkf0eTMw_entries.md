A somber declaration is made in this clip from The Last Voyage of the Demeter. The upcoming horror movie stars Corey Hawkins (In the Heights, Straight Outta Compton) as Clemens, a doctor who joins the Demeter crew, Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones, The Nightingale) as an unwitting stowaway, Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans) as the ship’s captain and David Dastmalchian (Dune, the Ant-Man franchise) as the Demeter’s first mate. The film also stars Jon Jon Briones (Ratched, American Horror Story), Stefan Kapicic (Deadpool films, Better Call Saul), Nikolai Nikolaeff (Stranger Things, Bruised), and Javier Botet (It films, Mama).

Based on a single chapter from Bram Stoker’s classic novel Dracula, The Last Voyage of the Demeter tells the terrifying story of the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to carry private cargo—fifty unmarked wooden crates—from Carpathia to London. Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship. When the Demeter finally arrives off the shores of England, it is a charred, derelict wreck. There is no trace of the crew. 

From DreamWorks Pictures and the producers of Zodiac and Black Swan, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is directed by André Øvredal (Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark, Trollhunter), from a script by Bragi F. Schut (Escape Room), Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Zak Olkewicz (the upcoming Bullet Train), based on the chapter “The Captain’s Log” of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. 

The film is produced by Brad Fischer and by Oscar-nominated producer Mike Medavoy and Arnold Messer for Phoenix Pictures and is executive produced by Matthew Hirsch.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter opens in theaters on August 11, 2023.

F1 Manager 2023 reviewed by Christopher Edgerton. Narrated by Luke Reilly.

F1 Manager 2023 proves that Frontier isn’t one and done; it’s a championship contender. Race Replay is an absolute show stealer, and there’s nothing better than solving the strategic puzzle laid out for you in a single go. F1 Manager 2023 is as enjoyable to listen to at normal speed as it is to play, and although you can rush at 16x speed for an entire season in an afternoon if you want, it’s far more relaxing to treat it like an actual race and just chill out and watch. F1 Manager 2023 is a game that understands that racing can be a sport everyone can enjoy, and if you enjoy any type of management game at all, you should add this to your collection.

The first thing you might ask yourself when you start playing One Punch Man: World is -- why does it take so many darn punches to put down basic enemies? It says “One Punch” right there in the title. The reason for this was not made clear during my recent 30-minute play session. Fortunately for One Punch Fans, you’ll find an action game that looks and plays like an interactive version of the anime. Key moments have been accurately recreated in-engine, and you’ll even be able to expand on what was seen in the show. At a glance, you might even think you’re watching the anime instead of playing the game.

Check out the trailer for Landscape With Invisible Hand, an upcoming sci-fi drama movie based on the novel by M.T. Anderson. The film stars Asante Blackk, Kylie Rogers, and Tiffany Haddish.

Years into a benevolent alien occupation of Earth, the human race is still adjusting to the new world order and its quirky coffee table-sized overlords called the Vuvv. Their flashy advanced technology initially held promise for global prosperity, but rendered most human jobs – and steady income – obsolete. When 17-year-old artist Adam Campbell (Asante Blackk) and new girlfriend Chloe Marsh (Kylie Rogers) discover the Vuvv are particularly fascinated with human love and will pay for access to it, they decide to livestream their budding romance to make extra cash for themselves and their families. Life is good, for a while, until the flame of their teenage love fizzles out and they're forced to make very different, absurdly life-altering sacrifices for their families.

Landscape With Invisible Hand, directed by Cory Finley, opens in theaters in August 2023.

Watch our Secret Invasion series review! An underwhelming and often dull espionage show, Secret Invasion fails to capture the excitement and threat that its Invasion of the Body Snatchers-like plot chases. It's built on well-intentioned foundations, and there’s some promising ideas that – perhaps in other hands – could have made for a strong reinterpretation of the comic book classic. Solid performances, especially those of Samuel L. Jackson and Olivia Colman, hold everything together, and there’s the occasional observation that provides the story with some deeper meaning. But a lack of complexity and overall intrigue means Secret Invasion is unable to grow its good ideas into anything genuinely compelling.

Marvel Studios' Secret Invasion is available to stream now on Disney Plus.

## Batman: Mask of the Phantasm - Official 4K Ultra HD Trailer (2023) Kevin Conroy, Dana Delany

In celebration of the film's 30th anniversary, the animated movie Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is getting a new remaster coming to 4K Ultra HD on September 12, 2023. Check out the trailer for the film, starring Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman, alongside Dana Delany (Desperate Housewives, China Beach) as Bruce Wayne’s love interest, Andrea Beaumont, Mark Hamill (Star Wars franchise) as the Joker, Stacy Keach (Nebraska, Prison Break, Mike Hammer) as Phantasm/Carl Beaumont, Abe Vigoda (Barney Miller, The Godfather) as Salvatore Valestra, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (The F.B.I.) as Alfred, Hart Bochner (Die Hard) as Arthur Reeves, Bob Hastings (McHale’s Navy, The Poseidon Adventure) as Commissioner Gordon, Robert Costanzo (Forget Paris, City Slickers) as Detective Bullock, Dick Miller (Gremlins, The Terminator) as Chuckie Sol, and John P. Ryan (The Right Stuff) as Buzz Bronski. Additional voices included Pat Musick, Marilu Henner, Neil Ross, Ed Gilbert, Jeff Bennett, Jane Downs, Vernee Watson, Charles Howerton, Thom Pinto and Peter Renaday.

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm opens with the city's most feared gangsters being systematically eliminated, and assumed blame falling on the Caped Crusader. But prowling the Gotham night is a shadowy new villain, the Phantasm, a sinister figure with some link to Batman's past. Can the Dark Knight elude the police, capture the Phantasm and clear his own name? Unmasking the Phantasm is just one of the twists in this dazzling animated feature, which provides new revelations about Batman's past, his archrival the Joker, and Batman's most grueling battle ever - the choice between his love for a beautiful woman and his vow to be the defender of right.

The release will also include an all-new featurette Kevin Conroy: I Am The Knight, which takes a look at the legacy of Kevin Conroy, who voiced Batman for 30 years in film, television, video games, and more.

The 4K HDR/SDR remaster of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm was sourced from the 1993 Original Cut Camera Negative and was scanned at 4K resolution. Digital restoration was applied to the 4K scans to remove dirt, scratches and additional anomalies, but special care was given to not touch the film grain or the animation cel dirt that was part of the original artwork. This is the first time since its theatrical release that it is presented in its 1.85 aspect ratio. The original 2.0 mix and the 5.1 tracks were remastered to remove or improve defects such as pops, ticks, dropouts, and distortion.

The Batman: Mask of the Phantasm filmmaking team is composed of the award-winning core group behind Batman: The Animated Series. Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm directed the film from a screenplay by Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Martin Pasko and Michael Reaves, based on a story by Burnett.

Marvel Studios mostly sat out this year’s Comic-Con, doing little more than releasing a new trailer for The Marvels during the show. But there was one upcoming Marvel project that made a surprise appearance at the convention. Fans lucky enough to attend the "Designing the X-Men: A This Week in Marvel Special Event" panel were treated to updates on the animated series X-Men ‘97, straight from producers Beau DeMayo, Jake Castorena and Larry Houston. There was even new footage shown of this hotly anticipated X-Men revival.

That footage isn't being released online, but fear not. IGN is here to break down what was shown and what we learned about X-Men '97 at Comic-Con.

Disney Illusion Island reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on Nintendo Switch.

"Disney Illusion Island’s platforming may be extremely polished but it’s not particularly inventive, and nor is it likely to appeal to anyone who favours a more combat-oriented Metroidvania experience – its enemies are strictly for dodging rather than destroying, and its small assortment of boss fights are mostly anticlimactic. Where it excels, though, is in providing a wholesome co-operative journey through a charismatic cartoon world that’s well-suited to pairings of parents and their children, or perhaps older and younger siblings. It effectively gives every member of the party the means to happily bound along on the ride without ever being made to feel like a burden. If you’re after a frictionless, family-friendly platforming adventure that’s heavy on charm and light on challenge, then Disney Illusion Island fits the bill better than a muzzle on Donald Duck."

Double Dragon Gaidens: Rise of the Dragons reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

It is very easy to have a good time playing a few runs of Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons roguelike gauntlet of four levels and bosses. Jumping in and learning its satisfyingly punchy combat and long list of fun and unique playable characters that you can tag in for combos turns a somewhat shallow pond of an early game experience into an impressive lake of collaborative combat options. But things got a little too repetitive and frustrating before I even got my first clear thanks to the shallow enemy pool, few game-changing upgrades, a brutal difficulty spike if you choose to save the wrong boss for last, and lack of worthwhile unlockables to chase outside of new fighters.

The Witcher Season 3 Volume 2 reviewed by Jarrod Jones.

"The Witcher is back to flex even more political intrigue and surprise character reveals, and it reliably comes packing a stirring fight sequence or two, but the month-long wait to finish season 3 amounts to disappointment. As it subtly acknowledges the parting of star Henry Cavill while simultaneously attempting to hype its audience for the two Cavill-less seasons yet to come, The Witcher’s confused – and confusing – direction has never been more apparent."
