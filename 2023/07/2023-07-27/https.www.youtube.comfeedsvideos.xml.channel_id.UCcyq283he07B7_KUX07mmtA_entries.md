At the US Army's annual Best Ranger Competition, 56 two-man teams representing 27 different Army units undergo a grueling 60-hour gauntlet of physical and mental tests. By day three, the field of 56 teams is cut to just 16. By the end of the day, only one team will earn the title of best Ranger.

Insider's chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent three days following the competition at the Fort Benning Army installation, which only three weeks later changed its name to Fort Moore as a result of a congressional act to rename military bases whose names honored Confederate leaders.

All competitors are Ranger-qualified, meaning they have completed the challenging 62-day Ranger course that earns them the coveted Ranger tab. 

Along with the bragging rights that come with winning "BRC," winners receive a prize package worth nearly $18,000. The prizes include rifles, pistols, gun safes, and other tactical equipment. Historically, competition winners continue to rise in the Army ranks and get opportunities to work in academia and Hollywood.
