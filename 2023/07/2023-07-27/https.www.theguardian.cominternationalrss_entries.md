## Alexandra Popp is Germany’s fiercely competitive captain driven by Euros hurt | Karen Carney

<p>The prolific striker has had bad luck with injuries but fully fit at this World Cup, she has the experience to take her country far</p><p>Eight years ago I was playing in the World Cup third-place playoff when we won a penalty in extra time and a Germany player was trying to unsettle the taker, Fara Williams. I felt it necessary to get in the way to protect my teammate by pushing my opponent – only to realise it was Alexandra Popp and that I might have made an error of judgment. The next minute, Eni Aluko had to join me to give us a chance of keeping Popp at arm’s length because it was the type of situation that needed two people to stop such an ultra-competitive person.</p><p>Thankfully for us, Fara scored and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report" title="">we took third</a> but it was classic mind games from Popp. We saw this as our chance to finally beat a great rival and finish third, whereas Germany were upset not to reach the final, but Popp was still determined not to lose. It is a sign of who she is: a winner who will do everything she can to succeed. She has incredible technical and tactical ability but what has always stood out to me is her mental strength. Every professional footballer can kick, head and tackle but in elite sport mentality separates the good from the great, and she certainly falls into the latter category.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/27/alexandra-popp-germany-fiercely-competitive-captain-driven-euros-hurt-womens-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Injured in Manchester and early on at the Oval, his toughness was evident with a four-wicket haul on day one of the fifth Test</p><p>Pat Cummins had been waiting a long time for this. Across the Ashes series, at Lord’s and Headingley and Old Trafford, he had kept losing tosses, being asked to bat, and saying that he would have bowled first if given the chance. Perhaps luck spared him three mistakes: Australia made 416 at Lord’s and won, and in the other matches had plenty of partnerships without making the most of them in decent batting conditions.</p><p>In the fifth Test at the Oval he finally got his way. You could see the arguments in favour: cloudy day, tinge of green in the pitch, the chance to take control of the match. But it was also heart-in-mouth for Australian supporters, like any bowl-first decision tends to be. It was the same fixture four years earlier when Tim Paine made the same decision, losing the match and tying the series 2-2. Or go back a few weeks, when India asked Australia to bat first before losing by a mile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/27/australias-gamble-pays-off-as-durable-starc-shows-class-england-ashes-fifth-test">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Americans should still make it to the knockouts. But they will need to improve quickly if they are to make a serious challenge for the title</p><p>When the United States won the 2019 Women’s World Cup, they did so with a team certain of their identity, one that pressured opponents into submission early in each match. The Americans scored in the 12th minute or earlier in each of their first six games of that campaign. A defining characteristic of the USA in that era was their high press and counter-press after losing possession. It was suffocating and relentless – and it forced some of the best teams in the world to panic.</p><p>Since taking over after that World Cup, head coach Vlatko Andonovski has attempted to add nuance to the team’s style. They still press high – just not as often. Now, the US drop off at times and let their opponents play. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/26/uswnt-netherlands-world-cup-match-report">Thursday’s 1-1 draw with the Netherlands</a> brought to fore the realities of that double-edged sword.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/27/uswnt-usa-womens-world-cup-soccer-netherlands">Continue reading...</a>
