I described it as “a cross between an interactive documentary and a virtual museum exhibition,” and it really set a new bar for retro game collections. Now, the studio is tackling another project: <em>Karateka</em>, the game Jordan Mechner made before the iconic <em>Prince of Persia</em>.</p>
<p id="gahKSG">Called <em>The Making of Karateka</em>, the new project sounds much like <em>Atari 50</em>, only focused on a specific game. It includes “pixel-perfect versions” of the original <em>Karateka</em> releases and early prototypes you can actually play, along with a host of design documents and documentary-style video features. There’s even a brand-new remastered version of the action game. “What...</p>

FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel says the new rules will maintain citizens’ “well-established freedom to pick their preferred device and provider.”</p>
<p id="GZtUqr">Under the proposed regulations, wireless providers would be required “to adopt secure methods of authenticating a customer” when they swap SIM cards to a new device or port their phone number over to another carrier. They would also have to notify customers when a SIM change or port-out request is initiated and do other things to protect customers from phone hijacking fraud. </p>

  <p id="nu6NZ4">If Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown is forcing you out of your ex’s account, now it’s easier to transfer your profile to the old account you just reactivated (or maybe even your new partner’s). In <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/profile-transfer-keeps-netflix-experience-constant">an update on Tuesday</a>, Netflix says you can now use its profile transfer tool to send your viewing history and recommendations to an existing account.</p>
<p id="BXUq2N">Before this change, Netflix only let you transfer your profile to newly created accounts. This was pretty inconvenient if you already had an inactive account with Netflix that you wanted to start using again or if you planned on sharing an existing account with someone you’ve just moved in with. </p>

The new feature marks a notable expansion of what you can do with its avatar system, which it has been slowly building out as part of its metaverse vision.</p>
<p id="KuVLMj">Based on a short video in Meta’s blog post about the news, it appears using your Meta avatar in a call will look somewhat like using one of Apple’s Memoji avatars <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate">on a FaceTime call</a>. Meta’s avatars also follow your facial expressions and mouth movements, which could make it easier to tell what someone is actually saying while they’re chatting with you as an avatar.

The company has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23745071/nothing-phone-2-specs-rumors-features">preannounced plenty of details about the handset</a>, so the big news today is the Phone 2’s price and release date. It’ll be available starting at $599 (£579 / €679), and unlike last year’s device, the Phone 2 will be available to buy in the US. Preorders start today, and the phone will be publicly available July 17th. </p>
<p id="e9kgoy">There are a couple of different variants of the Phone 2 available. The starting price gets you 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but there are also step-up models with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $699 (£629 / €729) and 12GB and 512GB of storage for $799 (£699 / €849).

You don’t have to feel too discouraged, though; Prime Day still serves as a great opportunity to save some on a variety of budget-friendly gadgets and gizmos, from smart speakers to standout controllers, all of which can be had for less than $50.</p>

<p id="qhuyEl">If you know where to look, there are quite a few budget-friendly items on sale for Prime Day, many of which we’ve rounded up below.

  <p id="SQpQDU">A California judge is allowing Microsoft to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard after five days of grueling testimony. Microsoft still faces an ongoing antitrust case by the Federal Trade Commission, but Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley has listened to arguments from both the FTC and Microsoft and decided to deny the regulator’s request for a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p id="gdCChU">In a ruling submitted today, Judge Corley said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p id="KZUsVk">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox.

<p id="B1ascB">If a teen opts in, their parent or guardian will be able to see recently added friends, servers they’ve joined or participated in, and the display names and avatars of people they’ve messaged or called in DMs or group DMs. All of this data will show up on a new Family Center dashboard, which shows a teen’s activity over the past seven days. Parents will also get the data in a weekly email summary. However, parents will <em>not</em> be able to see what their teen writes or says.</p>

  <p id="skzI6J">Bear 2, the new note-taking app from developer Shiny Frog, is launching today on iOS, iPadOS, and Mac. It comes with lots of new features. You can now create tables in Bear notes. You can play GIFs, preview links and PDFs, scan documents, add footnotes and a table of contents, bring your own fonts, and more. You can also style your documents more easily: until now, using Bear required at least a passing knowledge of the Markdown language, but now it looks and works more like any other text editor. I’ve been using the beta for many months, and it’s one of my favorite note-taking apps for Apple devices.</p>

  <p id="Z1tXxt">Twitter users trying to find links to Meta’s microblogging rival Threads are finding that the Elon Musk-owned social media network appears to be limiting results. That’s despite Twitter currently being filled with links to Threads content, which you’d expect to be able to find via search. We spotted the behavior via a <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuiTZi9PFqU">Threads post from Andy Baio</a>, but the behavior is also being widely reported by Twitter users.</p>
<p id="vuhPYx">The issue was first noticed when using the “url:” search operator, which is normally used to <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query#:~:text=twitterapi%20%2Dto%3Atwitter-,url,-%3A">search for links to a specific URL</a>. For example, searching “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=url%3Atheverge.com&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">url:theverge.com</a>” on Twitter brings up every single tweet that links to <em>any</em> page on <em>The Verge</em>, regardless of whether the URL has been shortened.
