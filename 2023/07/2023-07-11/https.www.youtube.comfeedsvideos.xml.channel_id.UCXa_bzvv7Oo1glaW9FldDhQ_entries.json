(2023 Edition)", "description": "It\u2019s been well over 2 years since Sony released the PS5, and fans have been treated to wonderful experiences like Horizon Forbidden West since its launch that serve as a great showcase for the power of the new hardware. \n\nBut thanks to recent advancements in the consumer PC hardware space, owning a rig that\u2019s comparable to the performance of PS5 has become a much more lucrative option than it was in the past.\n\nWe picked off-the-shelf brand new components to aggregate a 1:1 performance when compared with the PS5, and our total cost excluding software and peripherals came at around $770. It\u2019s pretty cheap when you put in against our 2021 edition which cost around $1130, but the price gap is bound to get even lower as we progress deeper into this generation.\n\nVideo link to 2021 Edition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McC-4RDzW34", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf2Zhv2XzbQ", "date_published": "2023-07-11T15:30:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yf2Zhv2XzbQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 WORST-LOOKING Games of 2023 So Far", "description": "Each year, video games push the limits on what's possible, from gameplay and story-telling to features. Graphics are no different, and despite the continuing debate of their importance vs gameplay, no one can deny that 2023's games have been very good with their fidelity.\n\nHowever - and you knew this was coming - some games haven't looked good. Several go from \"uneven\" to \"downright awful\" at times. Whether it's faltering on a technical level, the overall presentation, performance problems, or the art style, this year's dreadful-looking games are also some of its worst.\n\nIt isn't to say that you can't have fun even if the presentation is abysmal, but regardless, here are our picks for the worst-looking games of the year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czhOkbFGKo", "date_published": "2023-07-11T13:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4czhOkbFGKo/hqdefault.jpg"}]
