Universal is backing the film, which has a budget of around $200 million, as reported by <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/tom-cruise-space-movie-dead-reckoning-1235666807/\">Variety</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During the premiere of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 in New York, Cruise said he didn't have a production start date set, but mentioned that they have been working diligently on the space-set movie. Before moving forward with his next project, Cruise still needs to finish making Dead Reckoning Part 2. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, overseeing both Dead Reckoning movies, confirmed that he and Cruise will resume work on Part 2 as soon as the Part 1 press tour ends.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The latest installment of the Mission: Impossible series, opening in theaters this week, pits Cruise's IMF agent Ethan Hunt against a mysterious villain from his past, reuniting him with allies Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). However, one of the notable features of any Mission: Impossible movie is its impressive stunts, and Dead Reckoning Part 1 is no exception. In a daring sequence, Cruise skillfully maneuvers <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-performed-mission-impossible-7s-biggest-stunt-on-the-first-day-of-production/1100-6515378/\">a motorcycle off a cliff</a> and gracefully descends using a parachute.

Using the product is straightforward--just plug it into your console, plug in the mClassic power cable, then reconnect your HDMI cable from your TV into the mClassic. It works natively with any console that offers an HDMI port, making this a great way to improve last-gen graphic quality. Depending on your TV, it'll upscale older games to either 1440p or 4K. </p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Marseille-mClassic-Plug-Console-Upscaler/dp/B07X6KDQ98?tag=gamespot-primeday-20\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>As mentioned, it's also a wonderful accessory for retro gaming on modern TVs.

That said, regardless of which console you play on, the mClassic will certain help display crisper textures and a clearer picture for retro games, making them highly playable on modern TVs.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prime-day-deal-save-big-on-graphics-upscaler-for-switch-and-retro-consoles/1100-6500859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prime-day-deal-save-big-on-graphics-upscaler-for-switch-and-retro-consoles/1100-6500859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-11T15:46:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Mission Impossible's Pom Klementieff Was Thrilled To Trade In Her MCU Character For A Dark Villain", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">If you keep up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you surely know all about Pom Klementieff's portrayal of Mantis in the Guardians of the Galaxy films.

Along with several other weekly deals, GOG is offering the PC first-person adventure game <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/en/game/betrayer\">Betrayer</a> for free right now. You just need to log in or create an account and add it to your library. Then, you'll have the option of downloading a (DRM-free) copy of the game or playing it through GOG's Galaxy storefront.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Betrayer is an odd game, to say the least. It's a first-person shooter that isn't really much of a shooter at all, but rather a paranormal adventure game. You play as an English settler who sails to Virginia in 1604 to join a struggling colony--however, what you find is a wide array of monsters, ghosts, and other spooky enemies to slay with bows and black powder muskets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Created by indie team Blackpowder Games--which consisted in part of developers who worked on the acclaimed first-person shooter F.E.A.R.--Betrayer is perhaps best-known for its striking black-and-white visuals, which can be adjusted in its settings menu. All in all, though it's not for everyone, if you're down for a horror shooter inspired by classics like Silent Hill, it's worth a look. It's also worth noting that Betrayer is not currently available on other storefronts like Steam, so if you want to play it, this is a great opportunity.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-free-pc-game-right-now/1100-6515841/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-free-pc-game-right-now/1100-6515841/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-11T14:31:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Get An Xbox Series S Refurb During Prime Day For $200", "description": "<p>It is officially <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/\">Amazon Prime Day</a>, and if you're in the market for a new game console, the online retail giant has an offer you may want to consider.</p><p>The store is selling a \"renewed\" 2021 model Xbox Series S console for only $200 right now.
