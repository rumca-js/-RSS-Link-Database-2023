## Snag Microsoft 365 for your whole family for less than $5 a month

<p>Microsoft 365&rsquo;s subscription can be well worth the cost. Though Office is a signature feature, you get more than just productivity software with it. It can provide tons of value&mdash;especially if you sign up for the family version. And right now, you can pay just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1L5B54L/&amp;xcust=2-2-1989568-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$70 for a 15-month Family subscription and a $20 Amazon gift card</a> during Prime Day. That&rsquo;s an effective price of $50 for the plan, or just $3.33 per month.</p>



<p>At the normal price of $100 for a 1-year subscription (or $8.25 per month), a Microsoft 365 subscription <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1527859/6-reasons-why-its-worth-paying-for-a-microsoft-365-subscription.html">already is worth the cost</a>. You naturally get access to all Office apps (and always the most current version)&mdash;that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, as well as heavy-hitters like Access and communication tools like Teams. In addition to PC, you can download apps for Office on iPhones, Android, iPads, and Mac, and each person on your plan can use Office apps on up to five devices at a time.</p>



<p>The subscription also includes 1TB of cloud storage <em>per user</em>&mdash;not a shared pool&mdash;for up to six people. Arguably, this benefit is the plan&rsquo;s killer feature. Other cloud storage services (like Dropbox) don&rsquo;t offer that much storage, much less such a low family price. Microsoft even throws in Skype minutes, too&mdash;each family member gets 60 minutes per month for calling mobile phones and landlines.</p>



<p>Both new and existing Microsoft 365 Family users can take advantage of this deal, too. The only catch? Existing users ideally should already have their Microsoft 365 account managed through Amazon. (It can get <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slickdeals.net/f/16779881-69-99-microsoft-365-family-office-20-amazon-gift-card-3-months-free-plus-12-month-auto-renewal#post164616101&amp;xcust=2-2-1989568-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a little weird and complicated</a> otherwise.) If that&rsquo;s you, buying this deal should stack on top of whatever time you still have left in your plan (and you can buy more than one code, too).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a new user, be aware that when you sign up, your Microsoft 365 account will be managed through Amazon, which means you won&rsquo;t be able to later take advantage of discounted codes through other retailers while your account is still active through Amazon. Auto-renew for a yearly plan will also be turned on automatically. (You can disable that.)</p>



<p>But on the whole, this deal is smoking&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not the only one that we love right now. Be sure to check out all of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407062/prime-day-tech-deals-july-2023.html">our Amazon Prime Day coverage</a> as soon as you can, too. The deals run through July 12, but they can sell out before the event&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>Like summer itself, Amazon Prime Day sales are sizzling hot. Case in point: the Samsung 870 Evo, our current top pick for the best SATA SSD. Right now, you can pick up this fantastic drive at rock-bottom prices, with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QBMD6P4&amp;xcust=2-2-1989376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the 500GB model going for a mere $30</a>&mdash;and the other capacities are on deep discount, too.</p>



<p>When it launched, the 870 Evo&rsquo;s list price was more than double what you&rsquo;ll pay today. Besides the 500GB model going for just three Hamiltons, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QBJ2YMG&amp;xcust=2-2-1989376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1TB model</a> ($60), <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QB93S6R/&amp;xcust=2-2-1989376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2TB model</a> ($100), and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QBL36GF/&amp;xcust=2-2-1989376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">4TB model</a> ($170) are at their all-time lows, too. Thanks to lower demand for SSDs and oversupply, we&rsquo;re getting to enjoy absolutely killer bargains on the top performers.</p>



<p>Speaking of&mdash;when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393933/samsung-870-evo-sata-ssd-review-the-speed-you-need-at-sane-prices.html">we reviewed the 870 Evo</a>, we called it the best performer in its class. Thanks to its zippy read/write times, it earned a 4.5 out of 5 star rating <em>and</em> an Editor&rsquo;s Choice Award from us. Rated for sequential read speeds up to 560 megabytes per second, and sequential write speeds up to 530 MB/s, this drive lives up to its specs, both when handling small and large files. There are no compromises with this drive, as you&rsquo;d encounter if you opted for a cheaper model, like the Samsung 870 QVO.</p>



<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to finally replace a hard disk drive to rev up your old PC or just expand your storage, this is a very hot deal. Prime Day lasts until July 12, but deals can sell out before the event is over. Don&rsquo;t wait to pick up one of these drives&mdash;or any <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393625">other incredible SSD on sale right now</a>, if the Samsung 870 Evo isn&rsquo;t to your taste.</p>

## The best 4K Windows Hello webcam is 40 percent off now

<p>The Logitech Brio 4K Ultra HD webcam ranks among our favorite webcams for a reason: It combines Windows Hello with superb 4K resolution for everyday calls. Even better: It&rsquo;s 40 percent off for Prime Day.</p>



<p>The Logitech Brio 4K is 40 percent off for Prime Day, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Calling-Noise-Canceling-Correction-Microsoft/dp/B01N5UOYC4&amp;xcust=2-1-1989288-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on sale at Amazon for $119.95</a>. The webcam is so good that we&rsquo;ve included it in two separate roundups: our list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html">the best webcams</a>, and a smaller, more focused roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">best Windows Hello webcams</a>. In the latter list, the Brio 4K ranks as the best overall Windows Hello webcam, period. Want more? Read our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406618/logitech-brio-4k-pro-review-a-superb-webcam-ready-for-a-ultra-high-resolution-world.html">Logitech Brio 4K review</a>. </p>



<p>The Brio 4K was clearly ahead of its time &mdash; this webcam is seven years old, and its 4K resolution had niche appeal. Many video services didn&rsquo;t even support 4K. Now they do. But you might think that the best part about this webcam is its Windows Hello webcam, which includes a depth sensor to log you in quickly using your face as your password. Now you can log into your PC in a snap. </p>



<p>Rivals have also begun offering 4K webcams, too, but Logitech has responded by lowering its price to keep ahead of the pack. Now Prime Day is here, and Logitech has slashed prices further to keep shoppers buying. </p>

<p>If you need gaming power in a teeny tiny package, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with the Asus ROG Flow X13. This 13-inch, Ryzen-powered ultraportable got <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394093/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-with-xg-mobile-gpu.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a PCWorld Editor&rsquo;s Choice pick</a> when it debuted in 2021, and it&rsquo;s been a mainstay of our laptop roundups ever since. To compete with Prime Day, Best Buy is offering an insane discount on the latest model: $750 off, bringing the sticker price <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-13-4-touchscreen-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-ti-v4g-graphics-1tb-ssd-off-black%2F6494640.p%3FskuId%3D6494640&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">down to just $849.99</a>. </p>



<p>For a nearly 50 percent discount, you get the latest Ryzen 9 6900HS mobile processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, and a respectable (if not exactly top-of-the-line) RTX 3050 Ti graphics card. The rest of the machine is no slouch, either, with a 1920&times;1200 16:10 touchscreen featuring 500 nits of brightness and a 120Hz refresh rate, the better to see every single frame of your game. </p>



<p>If you need more <em>powah</em>, the ROG Flow X13 is compatible with Asus&rsquo; proprietary <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1667601/this-asus-dock-will-give-a-tiny-laptop-rtx-4090-powers-for-a-high-price.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ROG XG Mobile docks</a>, which can boost external graphics with various flavors of add-on GPUs. These are basically custom eGPU setups, but they&rsquo;re small enough to fit in a backpack if you&rsquo;re on the road. The Flow X13 can also be user-upgraded with more storage, but you&rsquo;ll need to find a tiny 30mm M.2 drive, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C27HY1QM/&amp;xcust=2-1-1989243-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">like this one</a>. </p>

## Intel kills its NUC line, but the tiny PC will live on

<p>Intel has decided to stop making its Next Unit of Computing (NUC), but the company will encourage partners to keep making the small form-factor (SFF) PCs, the company said Tuesday.</p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s NUC championed compact PCs, while leaving larger chassis options to partners like Dell and HP. But Intel&rsquo;s decision seems like a natural one, given that Intel has refocused on its core businesses during a period in which it also invested heavily in its own manufacturing operations and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394297/intel-will-build-x86-chips-for-other-companies.html">foundry business</a>.</p>



<p>An Intel spokesman confirmed an initial <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.servethehome.com/intel-exiting-the-pc-business-as-it-stops-investment-in-the-intel-nuc/&amp;xcust=2-1-1989175-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">report</a> by Serve The Home, saying that Intel will continue to support the existing NUCs it has already shipped into the market. </p>



<p>&ldquo;We have decided to stop direct investment in the Next Unit of Compute (NUC) Business and pivot our strategy to enable our ecosystem partners to continue NUC innovation and growth,&rdquo; the Intel spokesman said in an email. &ldquo;This decision will not impact the remainder of Intel&rsquo;s Client Computing Group (CCG) or Network and Edge Computing (NEX) businesses. Furthermore, we are working with our partners and customers to ensure a smooth transition and fulfillment of all our current commitments &ndash; including ongoing support for NUC products currently in market.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The decision ends about a decade of work by Intel to establish the NUC as a viable PC, opening up other uses for SFF devices. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/262259/intel_preps_tiny_next_unit_of_compuing_for_october_ship.html">first-gen NUC</a>&nbsp;featured a third-generation Core i3 processor and became the basis for a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2020577/how-we-built-a-tiny-home-theater-pc-with-intels-nuc.html">home theater PC</a>, with Intel challenging itself on subsequent iterations to<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448114/intel-nuc-kit-d54250wyk-review-this-tiny-pc-punches-high-above-its-weight-class.html"> shrink the chassis even further</a>. Intel&rsquo;s NUC also appealed on two more fronts. First, it was able to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399033/intel-ghost-canyon-nuc9i9qnx-nuc-9-extreme-review.html">establish the NUC as a compact gaming platform</a> to rival traditional game consoles, and, well, it just sounded cool. Etching skulls into the chassis and giving them names like &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401749/intel-hades-canyon-nuc-nuc8i7hvk-review.html">Hades Canyon</a>&rdquo; appealed to metalhead DIY builders. </p>



<p>Over time, though, competitors caught up, and Intel slowed down. In our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394948/intel-beast-canyon-nuc11btmi9-review.html">2021 review of the &ldquo;Beast Canyon&rdquo; NUC</a>, Alaina Yee noted that Intel&rsquo;s move to proprietary components and a more fragile chassis really undercut its appeal.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Intel&rsquo;s NUCs were once undisputed as the most bleeding-edge, incomparable gaming mini-PCs,&rdquo; Yee summed up. &ldquo;But despite its impressive hardware and neat modular riff on DIY building, Beast Canyon&rsquo;s growth in size, more fragile case, and proprietary power supply introduces weaknesses that give the competition an advantage.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s NUCs will always marketed as kits, with some options for you to install yourself and others that it supplied. Now, it sounds like Intel will sunset its own NUC line, ceding it to its ecosystem partners. For DIY enthusiasts, that&rsquo;s not really a problem; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/616650/what-is-a-small-form-factor-pc-5-key-things-to-know.html">building SFF PCs</a> comes with its own issues, but nothing you can&rsquo;t deal with. </p>



<p>Intels&rsquo; departure from NUCs, though, is a traditional tale: Any manufacturer that designs and sells its own components <em>and</em> the systems that they go into gains a theoretical advantage. (Microsoft&rsquo;s entry into the PC business with Surface generated grumbling from its partners, too.) As Serve the Home noted, Intel has also sold off its server business. All this means is that while Intel&rsquo;s NUC may be dead, the crown will be passed to its partners all waiting to seize the SFF throne.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time on a desktop &ldquo;battlestation&rdquo; forum, you know the Edifier R1280T, by sight if not by name. It&rsquo;s the go-to pick for high-quality bookshelf speakers on a budget, a mainstay of excessive desk setups across the internet and real world. Including <em>my </em>excessive desk setup, where these bad boys have been a mainstay for almost five years. A good deal at the standard price of $120, the R1280T set is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016P9HJIA?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1989142-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">30% off for Amazon Prime Day</a>, bringing the price down to an unbeatable $84. </p>



<p>The R1280T is fairly old-fashioned as speakers go, with a 2.0 setup, two RCA inputs, some basic controls on the right, and an IR remote. But with four-inch primary drivers, 13mm tweeters, and 42 watts of power, it can absolutely blast even a large office full of high-quality sound. It even includes removable grilles for easy cleaning. This set has been sitting pretty in the #1 spot on Amazon&rsquo;s bookshelf speaker section for years, and for good reason. </p>



<p>If you need more features, the R1280DBs set with Bluetooth and optical input is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08869TSQ4?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;xcust=2-1-1989142-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">also available with a 30% discount</a>. But for anyone with a standard desktop PC setup (or a laptop and/or dock with a headphone jack), this bookshelf set is all you need and then some. Get an order in quickly if you want it &mdash; the R1280T tends to go out of stock whenever it&rsquo;s on sale. </p>

<p>Amazon Prime Day is here and with it comes oodles of discounts. Seriously, you&rsquo;ll find juicy deals on everything from baby clothes to desktops. If you&rsquo;re interested in the latter, you best stick around. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Skytech-Blaze-3-0-Gaming-Desktop/dp/B0B52VH28X&amp;xcust=2-1-1988932-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Skytech Blaze 3.0 gaming desktop PC for $879.99</a>, which is 20 percent off of the original $1,099.99 price. This mid-sized tower comes with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU as well as fun RGB lighting fans and a minimalist chassis. Overall, it&rsquo;s a solid package for 1080p gaming at a great sale price. </p>



<p>The Skytech Blaze 3.0 features an Intel Core i5-12400F CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and 500GB of NVMe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s enough oomph for playing most modern games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. According to the manufacturer, this tower can hit 60 + frames-per-second at 1080p, and that&rsquo;ll climb higher &mdash; <em>much </em>higher &mdash; in games that support Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted DLSS technology. As for airflow (nothing is worse than a gaming desktop PC with bad airflow), the mesh case and the three RGB Dual Ring fans should keep things nice and cool. </p>



<p>This is a fantastic deal, especially for under $1,000. If you&rsquo;re on a tight budget, then the Skytech Blaze 3.0 gaming desktop PC  is definitely worth considering.</p>

<p>Getting an e-reader can do wonders for bookworms struggling with library management. You don&rsquo;t even have to spend that much either, as today&rsquo;s entry-level options pack a slew of features.

<p>Still, moving up to a higher-end model can bring material benefits. That&rsquo;s especially so when comparing the basic Kindle against the fancier Kindle Paperwhite ($140 MSRP &mdash; or only <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249/&amp;xcust=2-1-552166-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$90 on Prime Day</a> 2023 if you buy the ad-supported version). A few key differences exist between the two models that can dramatically tip the scales in favor of one over the other, depending on your situation.</p>



<p>To make it easier to decide between the two, we&rsquo;ve highlighted the main features of each model. We&rsquo;ve also included a chart at the end of the article that shows the full spec comparison.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kindle-vs-kindle-paperwhite">Kindle vs. Kindle Paperwhite</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="display">Display</h3>



<p>The base Kindle model has a 6-inch, 300-ppi screen with four LEDs. The Kindle Paperwhite upgrades that to a larger, front-flush 6.8-inch, 300-ppi screen with 17 LEDs. The color of front lights on the Paperwhite can also shift from white to amber for more comfortable nighttime reading.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dimensions-weight">Dimensions &amp; Weight</h3>



<p>The Kindle measures 6.2&rdquo; x 4.3&rdquo; x 0.32&rdquo; (157.8 x 108.6 x 8 mm) and weighs 5.56 ounces (158g). It&rsquo;s smaller and lighter than the Kindle Paperwhite, which comes in at 6.9 x 4.9 x 0.32 inches (174 x 125 x 8.1 mm) and 7.23 ounces (205g) for the standard edition. The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition of the Paperwhite is a little heavier at 7.34 ounces (208g).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="storage">Storage</h3>



<p>Surprisingly, the Kindle beats the standard edition of the Kindle Paperwhite in storage&mdash;you get 16GB (Kindle) versus 8GB (Paperwhite). You can get even more space by stepping up to 32GB Paperwhite Signature Edition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="battery-life">Battery life</h3>



<p>Voracious readers often away from a power outlet will feel the difference between the Kindle and the Kindle Paperwhite. The basic Kindle gets up to six weeks on a full charge, while the Paperwhite gets up to ten weeks on a full charge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="water-resistance">Water resistance</h3>



<p>People who read near (or in) water, take note: The Kindle isn&rsquo;t water resistant. Instead, you&rsquo;ll want the Kindle Paperwhite, which is IPX8-rated and can survive in up to two meters of fresh water for an hour at a time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="charging">Charging</h3>



<p>The entry-level Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite both have USB-C charging ports. The Signature Edition of the Kindle Paperwhite also supports wireless charging, and you can fully charge the device with a compatible 10W Qi charging pad in under 3.5 hours.</p>

## This is the single best Thunderbolt dock deal on Prime Day

<p>The Belkin Connect Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core is what many people want: a simple, straightforward Thunderbolt dock that supports a pair of displays &mdash; and for as little as possible. If that&rsquo;s true for you, you need to <em>grab</em> this Prime Day deal: this Belkin Thunderbolt dock is half off on Amazon, or $99.99.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813324/review-belkins-connect-is-a-great-budget-thunderbolt-dock.html">Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core won an Editors&rsquo; Choice award</a> from PCWorld for a good reason: It was simple and straightforward, without all of the multiple bells and whistles that distinguish other docks. But it&rsquo;s also an older Thunderbolt 3 dock, which means that retailers want to phase it out for something better. So <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08438H4GM&amp;xcust=2-1-1988954-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">buy this dock</a> before it&rsquo;s gone. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll get. As we explain in our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a> (where Belkin&rsquo;s dock is a runner-up for our best budget pick), Thunderbolt 3 offers the same speeds as Thunderbolt 4, over the same connector. This square little dock includes the essentials: both HDMI and DisplayPort connectors, plus Ethernet and a pair of USB-A ports to plug in a keyboard and mouse. The only thing it lacks is a power brick, so you&rsquo;ll have to run your existing USB-C charger through its input port. All that saves you money.</p>



<p>Put simply, this is among <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1983354/prime-day-thunderbolt-docks-and-usb-c-hubs-deals-july-2023.html">the best Prime Day deals for Thunderbolt docks</a> ever.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headset for about a year, and dang me if this thing isn&rsquo;t magic. I don&rsquo;t know how else it lasts for months and months on a charge &mdash; I think I&rsquo;ve only plugged the thing in twice since I bought it. HyperX rates the battery at 300 hours, and as far as I can tell, they&rsquo;re not lying. Normally $200, the Cloud Alpha Wireless is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TRW57WB/&amp;xcust=2-1-1988898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$50 off for Amazon Prime Day</a>. </p>



<p>The headset uses a straightforward design with a slick aluminum frame in anodized red-on-black, with big, comfy ear cups, all the better to use for hours at a time. Physical volume controls and a dedicated mute button are all you get on the headset itself, but the boom mic is removable if you&rsquo;re not the chatty sort. The connection is 2.4GHz, USB dongle only &mdash; no wired or Bluetooth. That&rsquo;s probably part of the proprietary battery-saving magic. </p>



<p>The Cloud Alpha Wireless is compatible with DTS Headphone X spatial audio, but as a standard stereo set with 50mm drivers, it should with whatever 3D audio system your PC can pump out. It&rsquo;s also compatible with the PS5, but not the Xbox. There&rsquo;s a reason this one has become an instant hit with the gamer crowd, so if you&rsquo;ve been waiting, pick one up while it&rsquo;s on sale. </p>

<p>Bluetti&rsquo;s new AC180 is a stout portable power station with exceptional AC efficiency capable of&mdash;gasp&mdash;actually giving you 1,000 watt-hours of capacity. We&rsquo;re making our Pikachu surprise face because we&rsquo;ve gotten so used to portable power stations touting their maximum capacity, but in real-world use delivering maybe 80 percent of that.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s like a car company marketing a vehicle on its fuel-tank size, rather than the actual miles per gallon you get.</p>



<p>Bluetti&rsquo;s AC180 doesn&rsquo;t actually change that somewhat misleading marketing practice but with its overall capacity of 1,152 watt-hours combined with its exceptional efficiency powering AC devices, consumers can expect to end up with a nice round 1,000 watt-hours of capacity. which is at least more straightforward.<br /></p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bluetti AC180 Portable Power Station" class="wp-image-1966573" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230412_175622.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>You get four NEMA 6-20P AC sockets rated at 20 amps</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gordon Mah Ung</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-kind-of-ports-does-the-bluetti-ac180-have">What kind of ports does the Bluetti AC180 have?</h2>



<p>For common household AC plugs, the AC180 features four well-spaced NEMA sockets to allow for large wall warts. All four are three-prong NEMA 6-20P but open grounded. If you do want to actually ground the AC180 for extra safety against a ground-fault, Bluetti provides a grounding port on the right side of the unit&mdash;a nice touch that many portable power stations skip. </p>



<p>Each port is rated at 20 amps or 1,800 watts, but you should remember that&rsquo;s the total for the entire unit. The surge rating for an AC port is 2,700 watts, which is in line with EcoFlow&rsquo;s Delta 2 series but lower than the Yeti 1500X&rsquo;s 3,500W and Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro&rsquo;s 3,600W. That 2,700 watt surge rating will lower voltage, too, so only certain appliances such as heaters, are likely to play nice.</p>



<p>For DC charging, you get four USB-A ports rated at a basic 15 watts, sadly without support for QuickCharge protocols or anything exotic. There&rsquo;s also a single USB-C port rated at 100 watts. We verified that the port supports up to 100 watts of USB-PD 3.0, including PPS, or Programmable Power Supply, rates from 3.3 volts to 21 volts.</p>



<p>For the DC port arrangement, we&rsquo;d have preferred one more USB-C port, but we&rsquo;ll forgive it since Bluetti compensates by also including a wireless charging coil in the top of the unit that we tested to its 15-watt rating with a Samsung S23 Ultra.</p>



<p>You also get a &ldquo;cigarette&rdquo; power outlet rated at 12 volts and 10 amps. As we&rsquo;ve said in the past&mdash;that works fine for most uses such as a phone or tablet charger, but certain portable appliances, such as some portable refrigerators and other high-power draw devices, may balk at the minimum 12 volts of power stations designed to run on a car&rsquo;s 14.5 volts when running.</p>



<p>For input, you get an AC inlet rated to hit 1,440 watts while charging, as well as up to 500 watts of DC charging over solar, as well as a car charging port.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The AC180&rsquo;s offline Bluetooth mode lets you control the unit when it&rsquo;s not connected to the internet&mdash;such as during a power outage or when you&rsquo;re in the woods.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bluetti AC180 Portable Power Station" class="wp-image-1966574" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230412_175128.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The AC180 will charge up to 1,440 watts over its AC input port. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gordon Mah Ung</p></div>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><br />What kind of battery does the Bluetti AC180 have?</h1>



<p>Bluetti has long been lauded for being ahead of the curve in adopting lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry versus NMC lithium ion cells. Essentially, that means much longer life cycles at the cost of slightly less energy-dense batteries. How much longer? Bluetti rates the AC180 at 3,500-plus full cycles before the battery can only charge to 80 percent of its original capacity. That&rsquo;s a class-leading rating. For example, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381039/ecoflow-delta-2-power-station-review.html">EcoFlow&rsquo;s Delta 2</a> is rated to 3,000 cycles to 80 percent. The disparity is even more stark when compared to NMC lithium ion cells, which can be rated at 500 or 800 cycles to reach 80 percent capacity.</p>

<p>We should note that the extended life or duty cycles is sometimes overrated depending on how you will use the portable power station. If you are using it in a full-time, off-the-grid situation, it&rsquo;s an important factor, but if you&rsquo;re mostly stowing it on a shelf in the garage and putting it to use maybe six days a year for camping or during a power outage, it&rsquo;s probably less of a big deal. What&rsquo;s nice, however, is that portable power stations with LFP batteries typically get a 60-month warranty compared to the 24-month warranty commonly found with NMC-based portable power stations.</p>



<p>For those interested in expansion capabilities, the AC180 can connect to Bluetti&rsquo;s 800 watt-hour B80, the 2,048 watt-hour B230, or the 3,072 watt-hour B300 for additional battery capacity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-the-bluetti-ac180-perform">How does the Bluetti AC180 perform?</h2>



<p>None of this means anything if the AC180 won&rsquo;t perform. With the all-important AC&mdash;or the power you run your fridge and most home appliances off of&mdash;the Bluetti knocked it out of the ballpark.</p>



<p>We test portable power stations using two different AC loads: a higher 800-watt load using a space heater, and a medium load using a 200-watt incandescent light bulb. Under the 800-watt load, the AC180&rsquo;s 1,152 watt-hours gave us 970 watt-hours, or 84 percent efficiency. That puts it slightly ahead of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1812156/jackery-explorer-1500-pro-review.html">Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro</a>&rsquo;s 83 percent efficiency and well ahead of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784445/goal-zero-yeti-1500x-review.html">Yeti 1500X</a>&rsquo;s 72 percent and Delta 2&rsquo;s 71 percent efficiency.</p>

<p>When we tick down to a 200-watt load, the Bluetti AC180 performs even better giving us 1,007 watt-hours, or a very impressive 87 percent efficiency. While the competing units are also all in the 80s, they&rsquo;re all in the low 80s compared to the Bluetti AC180.</p>



<p>What this is means is that when running AC, the AC180 will simply give you more run time for the rated capacity than most competitors.</p>



<p>Where the AC180 falls down, however, is in DC performance. For that, we discharge the unit using USB-PD with a 60-watt load to simulate a typical small-to-medium laptop load. Of the units we&rsquo;ve tested, the AC180 was the worst, with a 71 percent efficiency rating, which is far short of the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro&rsquo;s 89 percent or the Yeti 1500X&rsquo;s 85 percent running DC.</p>



<p>As part of our review, we also inspect the pure sine wave output of a unit using an oscilloscope and found the AC180 to be fine. Although not quite as perfect as the Yeti 1500X&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not going to matter for most.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bluetti AC180 Portable Power Station" class="wp-image-1966578" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230412_175641.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The AC180  has two fans on each side to keep its components cool.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gordon Mah Ung</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />How loud is the Bluetti AC180?</h2>



<p>One incorrect belief about portable power stations is that they are &ldquo;completely silent.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s simply not true at all times, as it&rsquo;s critical for both performance and safety to keep the battery and conversion circuits cool with fans. We&rsquo;ve seen our share of fairly quiet portable power stations and our share of fairly loud ones too. Bluetti&rsquo;s AC180 falls into the category of reasonably quiet but definitely not silent.</p>



<p>Measuring the sound three feet away from the unit, directly across from one of its two fans, we found the AC180 would hit about 45 dBA under a 1,500-watt load, and under an 800-watt load that would drop to 43 to 44 dBA. That&rsquo;s much quieter than EcoFlow&rsquo;s Delta 2 thanks to the AC180&rsquo;s larger and slower spinning fans. On the other hand, we&rsquo;re kind of bummed that the Bluetti trips the fans under what we&rsquo;d consider a pretty light load of 200 watts, albeit at a still relatively quiet 40 dBA.</p>



<p>The good news is that at under 100 watts, the AC180 fans don&rsquo;t fire up, meaning the power station will remain silent if you need it to run a medical device such as a CPAP machine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-heavy-is-the-bluetti-ac180">How heavy is the Bluetti AC180?</h2>



<p>Perhaps our biggest criticism of the AC180 is its weight. At 35 pounds for 1,152 watt-hours it&rsquo;s one of the chonkier units around. If you think about the unit in terms of rated watt hours per pound, the Bluetti AC180 is a little low at 32.5 watt-hours per pound. Compare that to the Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro, which gives you 40 watt-hours for each of its 37.5 pounds. Thanks to its efficiency though, the Bluetti AC180 makes up some ground and actually outputs more watt hours per pound than the hefty Goal Zero Yeti 1500x. Overall though, it&rsquo;s one of the heavier units around for its capacity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bluetti-ac180-application-support">Bluetti AC180 application support</h2>



<p>The AC180 offers both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth app support for iOS and Android. Our review used the Android version, which is full featured and gives you access to settings on the AC180 on par with the advanced units such as the EcoFlow Delta 2. You can set charge rates, update the firmware, set when the ports shut off, as well as monitor how much power is being consumed and how much power is being fed into the unit by wall plug or solar.</p>



<p>One feature worth calling out is an offline Bluetooth mode that lets you control the unit when it&rsquo;s not connected to the internet. This is especially useful during, say, a power outage or when you&rsquo;re in the woods. More importantly, this also works if your phone doesn&rsquo;t have access to the internet. Some apps force you to log in to a server, so if your phone has no service, you can&rsquo;t control the power station.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bluetti AC180 Portable Power Station" class="wp-image-1966576" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230412_175653.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A wireless charging pad is integrated into the top of the Bluetti AC180.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gordon Mah Ung</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />What accessories come with the Bluetti AC180?</h2>



<p>Out of the box, the AC180 comes with an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, and a solar charging cable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-bluetti-ac180-worth-it">Is the Bluetti AC180 worth it?</h2>



<p>Considering Bluetti&rsquo;s premium brand, and its solid reputation, the AC180 offers a lot of value. It has a list price of $1,099 but kicked off its debut at $799.</p>



<p>With its 1,152 watt-hour rating, that&rsquo;s basically 69 cents per rated watt-hour, which is a bargain. Compare that to the EcoFlow Delta 2, which can be found for $849 on Amazon, or 74 cents per watt-hour, or the GoalZero&rsquo;s Yeti 1500X at $1.18 per watt-hour. Even at its list price of $1,099, you&rsquo;re paying 95 cents per rated watt-hour, which is still very competitive. </p>



<p>Other than its slight weight disadvantage and its mediocre DC performance, it&rsquo;s hard to find any deal-breaking faults with the AC180. You get leading AC efficiency, full-featured app support, the high life cycles of LFE chemistry, all wrapped up with a bow offering good value from a respected brand. </p>

<p>From pool noodles and car seats to powerful laptops and desktop towers, Prime Day has steep discounts on just about anything and everything. If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a luxurious laptop with a 4K OLED touch display and powerful hardware, you&rsquo;re in luck. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenBook-Display-GeForce-UM535QE-XH91T/dp/B09LYJZ8YC&amp;xcust=2-1-1988682-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ZenBook Pro 15 OLED for $1,049.99</a>, which is a massive savings of $450. That&rsquo;s a fantastic price for a laptop with a touch-enabled OLED screen, especially at 2160p. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look because this deal is just too delicious to pass up.</p>



<p>The Asus ZenBook Pro 15 features an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HZ CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a good amount of power right there. It should be able to handle some casual gaming, office work, photo editing, general use, and so on, and be especially well suited for creative professionals. The OLED touch display is rather spacious at 15.6 inches, and it has a resolution of 3840&times;2160 as well as a maximum brightness of 400 nits. The picture should be both vibrant and crisp, making it ideal for photo editing tasks.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenal deal. That said, we&rsquo;d recommend hopping on it sooner rather than later. It&rsquo;s just too good.</p>

<p>If you want to boost your productivity on a laptop (especially a slinky super-slim model), adding some extra ports and external monitors is essential. And there&rsquo;s no better way to do it than with Plugable&rsquo;s 14-in-1 Thunderbolt dock. Not only is it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">our</a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> number one pick in the Thunderbolt dock roundup</a>, it&rsquo;s on sale for Prime Day: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR3T837&amp;xcust=2-1-1988768-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a whopping $60 off</a>, for a final price of $199.96. That&rsquo;s $100 off the original price, too. </p>



<p>This simple-looking but impressive dock boars easy-to-reach USB-A, SD and MicroSD card slots, and a headphone jack on the front, in addition to a secondary USB-C port. Around back you get five more USB ports, double HDMI and double DisplayPort for dual 4K displays, gigabit Ethernet, and the primary USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port for up to 40 gigabits of data transfer and 96 watts of charging. That should be enough for almost any modern laptop. </p>



<p>The dock looks pretty slick too, melding into any desktop setup in vertical or horizontal mode. It&rsquo;s hard to get much more capability from a Thunderbolt dock without moving to a full external graphics card setup&hellip;and that&rsquo;ll run you quite a bit more in terms of price. The deal is marked as today only, so get an order in quickly if you&rsquo;re sure you want it. </p>

<p>Few things bring as much bliss as a good book. It&rsquo;s just you, the story, and plunging into a whole other world for hours at a time. And thanks to Amazon Prime Day, Prime members can get a whole <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku&amp;xcust=2-1-1987813-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">three months of Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle Unlimited</a> service for free&mdash;even if you&rsquo;re a previous Kindle Unlimited subscriber.</p>



<p>A Kindle Unlimited subscription unlocks access to more than 4 million books, which includes unlimited listening to audiobooks that are part of the catalog. Select digital magazines like <em>Consumer Reports</em> and <em>Popular Mechanics </em>are available, too. You can read as much as you like, though you can only have 20 books or magazines checked out at a time. (It&rsquo;s easy to return them and immediately check out something new, though.)</p>



<p>After this free trial ends, Kindle Unlimited costs $12 per month. However, you can cancel your subscription at any time&mdash;and if you do, you&rsquo;ll still get the full three months.</p>



<p>If you want a deeper dive into Unlimited, we gave it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398481/kindle-unlimited-review-of-amazon-subscription-service.html">a spin back in 2019</a>, and the catalog has only grown since then. While new bestsellers are still slower to join the lineup, books published by Amazon&rsquo;s imprints often become available immediately. And there are still many, many other titles to try.</p>



<p>For the whopping price of <em>free</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to give Kindle Unlimited a shot. You might find at least a few new favorite books among the piles and piles awaiting you, ready to help you leisurely while away time on the beach or by the pool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get what you pay for&rdquo; is the platitude trotted out when someone wishes to acknowledge your disappointment without any further necessary action. And in that sense, it can&rsquo;t be applied to the Logitech G413 TKL (deep breath) SE mechanical keyboard. Because the further necessary action is returning it to whatever store you bought it from, and buying a different gaming keyboard. </p>



<p>I won&rsquo;t mince words: This keyboard is significantly overpriced. And that&rsquo;s almost impressive, because at $70, it&rsquo;s on the cheaper end for gaming mechanical keyboards. But a significant lack of features, broadly cheap materials, and a complete lack of programming options make this keyboard more or less unsuitable for gaming. It&rsquo;s not even very good at typing, at least not for the retail price. In short, don&rsquo;t buy the Logitech G413. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html">best gaming keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="logitech-g413-tkl-the-good-and-not-bad-stuff">Logitech G413 TKL: The good and not-bad stuff</h2>



<p>The G413 looks like a bog-standard mechanical keyboard at first glance. And that&rsquo;s what it is: If you didn&rsquo;t spot the very Logitech &ldquo;G&rdquo; gaming logo up in the corner, you&rsquo;d think it was a generic wired board going for perhaps 50 bucks on a Best Buy shelf. The fact that it <em>is </em>a Logitech product, and one that comes with a $70 retail price tag, is a bit of a surprise on both counts. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G413 SE bottom, feet" class="wp-image-1981538" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04519.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>This keyboard comes with PBT keycaps and an aluminum deck. That&rsquo;s the end of the list of its positive attributes. As we&rsquo;ve seen with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666820/havit-kb487l-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Havit KB487L</a> (another name that rolls off the tongue, not), the higher-quality PBT keycaps are becoming more common even at budget prices, which is why I&rsquo;m still giving Razer the Wagging Finger of Shame every time they have the gall not to put them on a $200+ keyboard like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541284/razer-blackwidow-v3-pro-review-a-wireless-keyboard-with-gaming-audacity.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the BlackWidow</a>. And an aluminum deck is a nice addition&hellip;again, assuming you&rsquo;re dealing with a budget keyboard. </p>



<p>Other specs that are neither a positive nor negative include the TKL layout (almost, see next paragraph), bright if somewhat limited white-only LEDs, and a lightweight, compact body. That&rsquo;s about it, time to get a whinge on. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The fact that it <em>is </em>a Logitech product, and one that comes with a $70 retail price tag, is a bit of a surprise on both counts.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="logitech-g413-tkl-the-bad-stuff">Logitech G413 TKL: The bad stuff </h2>



<p>The 6-foot USB cable isn&rsquo;t detachable. Anyone who likes a clean desk setup, and dislikes diving beneath it to get into the rat&rsquo;s nest of cables you&rsquo;ve so carefully hidden, won&rsquo;t appreciate that. Gamers won&rsquo;t appreciate the &ldquo;6-key rollover with anti-ghost,&rdquo; which Logitech lists among this keyboard&rsquo;s positive features. Rollover is the ability for a keyboard to register multiple key presses at once, and six at a time is extremely basic. Any wired keyboard purporting to be for &ldquo;gamers&rdquo; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/477442/mechanical-keyboard-faq-pick-the-right-switch.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">should boast N-key rollover</a> (i.e. unlimited) at the very least. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G413 SE corner, print screen" class="wp-image-1981542" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04467.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s no programming on this keyboard. No macros, either on-the-fly or via Logitech&rsquo;s G HUB software. When I plugged it in, the tool helpfully informed me that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to use the G413&hellip;which means there&rsquo;s no way to customize its layout. Which is a bummer for me, specifically, because taking screenshots is a big part of my job, and <em>there&rsquo;s no freakin&rsquo; screenshot button. </em>Logitech decided that Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause keys were unnecessary on this board, hiding them in a function layer (which, again, cannot be changed). So though &ldquo;TKL&rdquo; is in the product name, the actual layout of this keyboard would be more accurately called &ldquo;Tenkeyless minus three.&rdquo; </p>



<p>And finally, the G413 comes with any switch you want, so long as you want brown. And not just any brown switches, which are not generally the choice of gamers, who prefer linear for fast smooth keypresses. Not &ldquo;Logitech super-duper gaming tactile&rdquo; customized switches. Not even the inexpensive TTC switches, as seen on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676470/logitech-pop-keys-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Logitech Pop Keys</a> keyboard. Nope, these switches come from &ldquo;Long hua,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;d never even heard of before&hellip;and it&rsquo;s a banner day when a switch company can stump me.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G413 SE" class="wp-image-1981539" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04532.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Turns out Long hua is a subsidiary of Kailh, making even cheaper switches rated for just 50 million clicks. (Standard Cherry MX switches boast 100 million.) And even though you&rsquo;re unlikely to hit that E button 50 million times no matter how much <em>Counter-Strike </em>you play, they feel, well, terrible. They&rsquo;re scratchy, they&rsquo;re chattery, they&rsquo;re exactly the opposite of the kind of switch you want on a gaming keyboard. Frankly there are much better switches even if you want a tactile switch, <em>even if you want tactile switches on a keyboard under $70. </em>And of course, you can&rsquo;t swap them out. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-better-options">The better options </h2>



<p> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The G413 TKL SE a bad keyboard from a brand that should know better. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Look, I could go on whining, but you get the gist: This keyboard, while entirely functional, has basically zero options, far fewer features than anything in its price range, and is an embarrassment coming from a brand as storied and high-profile as Logitech. If you want a wired gaming keyboard for under $100, go for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801607/g-skill-km250-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the phenomenal G.Skill KM250</a>. You&rsquo;ll save money and get more features, including quality switches with hot-swap sockets, a radial dial, and RGB lighting. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G413 SE center, lighting" class="wp-image-1981541" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC04497.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you really want that TKL form factor and programming options, go for&hellip;well, almost anything else, but I&rsquo;d start with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-c1-pro-qmk-via-wired-mechanical-keyboard&amp;xcust=2-1-1972501-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Keychron C1 Pro</a>, which offers VIA programming, RGB lighting, and linear switches that are actually good for gaming, all at a lower price. Oh, and a print screen button, which <em>somehow </em>doesn&rsquo;t go without saying. </p>



<p>But whatever you do, don&rsquo;t buy the G413 TKL SE, even on sale. It&rsquo;s a bad keyboard from a brand that should know better. </p>

<p>Amazon Prime Day has entered the building, folks. That means there&rsquo;s no better time than now to find the greatest deals. If you&rsquo;re a hardcore gamer, you may want to stick around, as we&rsquo;ve got a delicious deal for you today. Dell&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/glhc&amp;xcust=2-3-1986823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Alienware M17 gaming laptop for $1,199.99 at Dell</a>, which is a savings of a colossal $1,150 (!!). That&rsquo;s a phenomenal price right there, especially given the specs. Let&rsquo;s point the magnifying glass on the details then, shall well?</p>



<p>The Alienware M17 gaming laptop features an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU, an AMD Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a good amount of power, so this laptop should be able to smoothly run most modern games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. The display is also quite large at 17.3-inches, which is perfect for those who want to see as much as they can. It has a resolution of 1920&times;1080, a refresh rate of 360Hz, and a response time of 1ms. The display should produce buttery-smooth visuals (at least it should with that speedy refresh rate). </p>



<p>This is a phenomenal deal. In fact, it&rsquo;s so good that we don&rsquo;t expect it to last long. You best swoop in before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that PC fans are living in the golden age of keyboards. Since mechanical designs came back into fashion we&rsquo;re awash in an incredible variety of styles, capabilities, customization options, and price points. And naturally, Amazon&rsquo;s smorgasbord of deals on Prime Day will have more than a few of them available at steep discounts. Most of these will require an Amazon Prime account (which you can get free for 30 days if you don&rsquo;t have it already), but competitors like Best Buy will join in the bargains, too. </p>



<p>Retailers all over the web, Amazon included, are already offering up discounts for Prime Day(s), running between July 11 and 12.

<p>As usual, Keychron sits right at the top of our recommendations, with discounts offered throughout their line. DROP&rsquo;s CTRL board is a good starting point if you want a premium, ultra-customizable design, while Epomaker and Skyloong offer much of the same features at a much lower price. Cherry&rsquo;s MX 1.0 is a good choice if you just need a basic, all-around quality mechanical board. </p>

</ul>



<p>There are tons of gaming boards to choose from, but for my money, I&rsquo;d go for the SteelSeries Apex Pro with its adjustable keys on the high end, or Redragon&rsquo;s diminutive Fizz on the low end. For a tiny travel board, Rzer&rsquo;s Blackwidow V3 Mini is unlikely to get cheaper any time soon, with the Asus Falchion being a solid alternative if you like a little protection (and don&rsquo;t need Bluetooth). </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not in need of a mechanical board, the Logitech MX Keys Mini is hard to beat &mdash; it&rsquo;s basically the PC version of Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard, but better. Those who need a split ergo design should check out the Adesso Tru-Forme, which includes a trackball right where your thumbs rest. The SteelSeries Apex 3 isn&rsquo;t a mechanical board, but it <em>is </em>the best deal in gaming boards at the moment. And I personally recommend the Redragon K585 if you want <a href="http://chrome-extension://bbomjaikkcabgmfaomdichgcodnaeecf/suspend.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F1479939%2Fi-got-tired-of-waiting-for-a-wireless-gaming-pc-keypad-so-i-made-my-own.html&amp;title=How%20I%20made%20my%20own%20wireless%20PC%20gaming%20keypad%20%7C%20PCWorld&amp;favIconUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F09%2Fcropped-cropped-PCWorld-Site-Icon.png%3Fw%3D32&amp;scroll_x=0&amp;scroll_y=8395.4716796875&amp;dark_mode=false" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">separate gadgets for gaming and typing</a>. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That depends on what you&rsquo;re doing with it. If you have a laptop and you like typing on it, you&rsquo;re good to go. But if you have a desktop, or you just don&rsquo;t feel good typing for long periods of time on the keyboard you&rsquo;re using now, it might be time for an upgrade. Most of the high-quality keyboards on the market are mechanical now, with big, chunky builds and long, loud key presses, because that seems to be what people prefer. But there are still slim, quiet boards available from companies like Logitech, Microsoft, and Apple. </p>
</div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">2.</span>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-kind-of-mechanical-switch-do-i-need">What kind of mechanical switch do I need? </h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Again, that comes down to what you want to do with it. There are broadly three kinds of switch: Linear (smooth from the top of the key press to the bottom), tactile (a small &ldquo;bump&rdquo; where the key press registers), and clicky (a loud &ldquo;click&rdquo; where the key press registers). These are generically color-coded to Red, Brown, and Blue switches, respectively, though that&rsquo;s not universal &mdash; if you want to be sure, look for the linear, tactile, or clicky terms. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of individual taste, but gamers tend to prefer linear switches, because they can be pressed and released quickly. Those who type for long stretches of time like tactile switches thanks to their finger feedback. And if you want even more feedback, along with a bit of noise, go witch a clicky switch. Just be aware that the noise might not be so well-received by other people in your home or office! </p>



<p>If you want to experiment with different kinds of switches without needing to buy multiple keyboards, get a board with hot-swap sockets. These let you pull out the switches and replace them with a different type. You can even mix and match the switches you put on a single board, if you have enough of them &mdash; Reds for WASD and Browns for the rest, for example. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-layout-keyboard-should-i-get">What layout keyboard should I get? </h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Keyboards come in a shocking variety of layouts these days, from full-sized (with the number pad on the left) to 60%, which is just the main alphanumeric section between the two CTRL keys with the Function row cut off. Tenkeyless, or TKL, is a good middle ground that doesn&rsquo;t shrink any keys but chops off the number pad, and 75% preserves the function row and arrow cluster by shrinking a few of the less-used keys. </p>



<p>60% is great for travel keyboards, or those who don&rsquo;t have a lot of space. Full-size is almost a must if you do a lot of data entry, and rely on rapidly inputting long strings of numbers. Everything else is a balancing act between space and comfort. But keep in mind, the smaller you go, the more often you&rsquo;ll need to use a function key modifier &mdash; a standard 60% keyboard doesn&rsquo;t have arrows or a Delete key on the main later, for example. Smaller boards include a learning curve if you&rsquo;re not used to them. </p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-i-get-a-wireless-keyboard">Should I get a wireless keyboard? </h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That depends on what&rsquo;s important to you. If your keyboard sits in front of your desk and never moves, it&rsquo;s probably not important. But if your keyboard is constantly on the go with you in a bag, or needs to connect to multiple devices over Bluetooth, wireless is the way to go. The latest boards can connect to three or four computers (or phones or tablets) easily, and last for months and months on a charge&hellip;as long as you take it easy with the backlighting. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s one exception: gaming. If you&rsquo;re playing PC games with your keyboard, you want to use a wireless connection with low latency, and that means a dongle you plug in. Unlike some older wireless keyboards, and just like newer kinds of mice, modern wireless gaming boards have almost zero latency. That means you&rsquo;ll never notice a gap between when you press a button and when your character reacts on screen. Just don&rsquo;t use Bluetooth (even if it&rsquo;s an option), as the high latency and crowded wireless bands can cause performance issues. </p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-i-need-a-gaming-keyboard">Do I need a gaming keyboard? </h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Most of the time, no, you don&rsquo;t. You can play PC games on pretty much any keyboard. Gaming keyboards offer a few nice perks, though, including fast polling rates (so even less lag time between key press and on-screen action) and custom programming tools. They also tend to be flashier, with rainbow lights and exotic case materials&hellip;not that any of that will really make a difference to how you play. </p>



<p>Again, if you want a wireless keyboard that&rsquo;s also good for gaming, look for a gaming-specific model that uses a dedicated wireless dongle and not Bluetooth. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to save some cash on a high refresh rate gaming display, the Sceptre C255B-FWT240 is worth considering. The 240Hz is plain ridiculous and I mean that in the best way possible. Visuals should be nice and smooth, especially when playing more intensive games in which every second matters.</p>

<p>The Gigabyte M27U SA monitor has a slight edge over the others in the list above due to its 160Hz refresh rate. Although it&rsquo;s not the steepest discount we&rsquo;ve ever seen, the high refresh rate should deliver luscious visuals. It&rsquo;s a good monitor for photo editors or content creators.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When it comes to monitor specs, you can break it down into three main categories: size, refresh rate, and resolution. Regarding size, a 27-inch monitor seems to be the best option for most folks, as it doesn&rsquo;t take up a ton of desk space and it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes. A 32-inch monitor, for example, may cause eye strain if it&rsquo;s too close to your face. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-monitor-refresh-rate-matter">Does monitor refresh rate matter?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Refresh rates are mostly relevant to PC gaming. The refresh rate is the number of times a monitor refreshes the screen per second. 60Hz is fine for casual gamers, but if you&rsquo;re into fast-paced action titles, we recommend a monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate. This will ensure your monitor never bottlenecks the frame rates generated by your PC. You probably don&rsquo;t need a 240Hz (or higher) refresh rate unless you&rsquo;re a professional gamer. Personally, I use a 60Hz monitor, which is fine for me because the games I play are slower-paced.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-my-monitor-need-4k-resolution">Does my monitor need 4K resolution?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A 1080p monitor is totally fine for most tasks like web browsing and checking e-mail, but 4K is the way to go if you want the ultimate streaming or gaming experience, or simply want more screen real estate for multiple windows, applications, and so on. 4K monitors provide sharper detail than 1080p monitors, but can be more expensive. Still, if you&rsquo;re working with a flexible budget or need that sharper resolution, then 4K is the way to go. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-curved-monitors-better">Are curved monitors better?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Curved monitors are not necessarily better, but they&rsquo;ve got some advantages over the flat variety. They create a more immersive experience, which is can be nice for games and movies. They also theoretically reduce eye strain and fatigue, as they minimize distance and viewing angles. You don&rsquo;t have to adjust your eyes as much. Unfortunately, most curved monitors cost more than flat ones and loss of clarity can happen if you aren&rsquo;t sitting directly in the center of the screen.</p>

<p>We expect that Amazon will limit its best deals to Prime members, so consider <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402239/how-to-get-amazon-prime-for-free.html">signing up for the free 30-day trial</a>. None of Amazon&rsquo;s Thunderbolt deals are at their yearly lows, but they&rsquo;re close.</p>



<p>We have two top deals to recommend. Grab that HP Thunderbolt 4 deal now &mdash; the discounted HP 4J0A2AA is an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813347/hp-thunderbolt-dock-120w-g4-review.html">Editor&rsquo;s Choice award-winning dock</a> at a solid discount. The other standout deal also won an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award: Our review of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813324/review-belkins-connect-is-a-great-budget-thunderbolt-dock.html">Belkin Thunderbolt Dock Core</a> reveals it to be an excellent little portable Thunderbolt dock at a massive discount. The Belkin Thunderbolt Dock deal is for a slightly bulkier dock, and probably should be considered a secondary option.</p>



<p>The Kensington SD2500T is the cheaper little brother of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918583/kensington-sd5500t-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html">Kensington SD5500T</a>, a much-loved dock which offers more ports. We haven&rsquo;t reviewed the Monoprice dock, unfortunately, but the price is right.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re not huge fans of the SD5700T deal or the OWC Thunderbolt Dock, because of the lack of display ports. You&rsquo;ll need to invest in an intermediary cable like this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/uni-Thunderbolt-Compatible-MacBook-Surface/dp/B075V5JK36/&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">USB-C to HDMI cable</a>, at $17 per cable on Amazon. Here&rsquo;s our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1519567/owc-thunderbolt-go-dock-review.html">review of OWC&rsquo;s Thunderbolt Go Dock</a>, a more robust option. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/815647/anker-apex-12-in-1-thunderbolt-4-dock-review-meh.html">Anker 777 Apex won a middling score in our review</a>, but its features are top-notch and the price is just about at its yearly low. </p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t reviewed the Wavlink docking station, but it supplies the capabilities of Thunderbolt via <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">DisplayLink, a compression technology we&rsquo;ve been impressed with</a>. The Anker dock also uses the same technology. Anker&rsquo;s price is a little high, but it does include laptop charging. Wavlink&rsquo;s deal meets the price we&rsquo;ve hoped these devices would achieve, though. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve used the Hiearcool dongle before, and it&rsquo;s solid. We haven&rsquo;t used the Acasis or Acodot hubs, but the price is right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-when-buying-a-thunderbolt-dock-or-usb-c-hub">What to look for when buying a Thunderbolt dock or USB-C hub</h2>



<p>Though we consider a Thunderbolt dock and a USB-C hub to be two separate product categories, they share similarities. Both use a USB-C output from your laptop. The difference is that some laptops use this port as a generic USB-C port, and others route the high-speed Thunderbolt 3 or 4 protocol through the USB-C socket. The former allows for typically 10Gbps of throughput, useful for USB keys, external storage, and perhaps an external display. </p>



<p>Thunderbolt (either Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4) allows for 40Gbps of throughput, designed for high-speed external SSDs and multiple displays. Our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">best USB-C hubs</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a> explain further in much greater detail. </p>



<p>Put simply, USB-C hubs and dongles are relatively cheap, rarely climbing over $60. Prime Day is an opportunity to pick up a USB-C hub with inputs for USB expansion, Ethernet, SD cards, and more for very little &mdash; all ports that your laptop might lack. Just don&rsquo;t go too crazy: All of the devices that the USB-C connects to will transfer data over the same 10Gbps port. That&rsquo;s fine for a keyboard, mouse, and a hard drive which will power on, send data, and turn off. But sending a fire hose of simultaneous Ethernet, storage, and display data won&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;ll need a Thunderbolt dock (and a laptop port) instead. </p>



<p>Thunderbolt docks require more care. Here, consider what you want to do: connect a pair of 4K displays with HDMI? Look for Thunderbolt docks with a pair of HDMI ports. DisplayPort connections will work, but you&rsquo;ll need a cheap intermediary cable. Thunderbolt docks have historically been in short supply, so this is an opportunity to pick up a pricey accessory at a discount. However, they&rsquo;re almost a must for a home office.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Consult your laptop&rsquo;s manual. A Thunderbolt port <em>may</em> be labeled with a small lightning-bolt logo, but that icon can sometimes be used to signal that that port can be used for charging, too. If nothing else, a USB-C dongle/hub will always work with a USB-C port. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>USB ports have been around for years. USB-C replaced USB-A (the square port) because USB-C was more versatile: the port connector was both reversible and allowed for higher speeds. USB-C ports can be rated for either 5Gbps or 10Gbps, just like a normal USB-A port. Some USB-C ports connect to a Thunderbolt chip inside your laptop, though, and this allows the port to run at a higher 40Gbps speed. Physically, the connector looks exactly the same. It&rsquo;s just what it can do that&rsquo;s different.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="whats-the-difference-between-a-usb-c-hub-and-a-thunderbolt-dock">What&rsquo;s the difference between a USB-C hub and a Thunderbolt dock?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Speed and features. A USB-C hub connects to a single 4K (or 1080p) display, and provides a mix of ports: USB-A, SD card slots, and so on. You can usually plug your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C power cable (if it uses one) right into it.</p>



<p>A Thunderbolt dock supplies even more bandwidth for more ports. There are two key differences: It has enough bandwidth to drive a pair of 4K displays, and many docks come with their own power supply that can charge your laptop as well as your phone. All that occurs via the Thunderbolt cable that connects your laptop to the dock.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes and no. Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB4 all run at 40Gbps across the same connector. USB4 is identical to Thunderbolt 4. But if your laptop runs USB4, it won&rsquo;t &ldquo;understand&rdquo; Thunderbolt 3 protocols. </p>



<p>USB4 laptops are still extremely rare, and have an AMD Ryzen chip inside.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Physically, they use the same USB-C cable. Functionally, they&rsquo;re <em>almost</em> the same. Thunderbolt 4 was released almost as a patch to Thunderbolt 3, ensuring that everything worked properly. If your laptop has Thunderbolt, you should probably be able to buy either a Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4 dock without any problems. Since Thunderbolt 3 is being phased out, you&rsquo;ll probably find more discounts on the older Thunderbolt 3 hardware.

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Possibly. Historically, the back of a desktop has been chock-full of I/O ports, especially DIY models that you build yourself. Desktops usually have extra room for internal SSDs, SD cards, and so on. However, if your desktop lacks these things, and includes an external Thunderbolt, you can always add these additional components externally, via Thunderbolt. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Read the user reviews closely. While Macs adopted Thunderbolt first, some of the Apple M1 silicon couldn&rsquo;t keep up with Intel Thunderbolt controllers used by Windows PCs, and the Apple MacOS experience suffered as a result. If a Windows user complains, pay attention; otherwise, you can dismiss them.</p>

<p>Gaming laptop deals are on a tear right now. Currently we are seeing some all time lows on great picks such as the Alienware m17 R5 for a mouth-watering $1,150 off on Dell. It&rsquo;s loaded with upsides, including a Ryzen 9 processor, a Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU, and a whopping 32GB of RAM, which is enough to do 4K gaming. The 17-inch display is also capable of a blazing fast 360Hz refresh rate so you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about your opponents having a speed advantage.</p>

<p>The very first thing you should think about is what type of laptop will be best for you. There are traditional clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, and even Chromebooks. If you want something that is portable and can work as both a laptop and tablet, then a 2-in-1 is a good choice. Traditional clamshells can offer better hardware and often are the way to go for professionals and gamers who require strong performance. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>If it&rsquo;s CPU power you&rsquo;re looking for, look for processors with higher numerical names. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks. Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. The higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. Basic office and web work gets along just fine on a Core i3. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. If you need more power, the Ryzen 7 chip is well suited for content creation like video editing. Finally, if you&rsquo;re dealing with 4K video, spring for a Ryzen 9. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want a discrete graphics card for hardcore gaming or editing videos. It&rsquo;s separate from the processor, so you can expect higher performance out of it. Integrated graphics, on the other hand, are attached to the CPU and uses less power as a result. This is perfectly fine for everyday tasks, especially if you&rsquo;re not doing anything that&rsquo;s graphics-intensive.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a video editor or someone who does a lot of multimedia work, you&rsquo;ll want a display that&rsquo;s anywhere from 15- to 17-inches. The sweet spot is really anywhere from 13- to 14-inches, though. The bigger the display, the heavier your laptop is going to be. A 13- or 14-inch display is the best in terms of portability and value.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s annual Prime Day sales event is here, which means you have the chance to score some great tech deals. This year, Prime Day will run from July 11 through July 12, and should include great deals on everything from gaming PCs to all-in-ones, as well as more traditional desktop machines.</p>



<p>The deals are already underway and we&rsquo;ve curated the best sales on computers from all over the internet. You&rsquo;ll need to be a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.amazon.com/primeearlyaccess&amp;xcust=2-1-796457-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Prime member</a> to take advantage of these steep discounts.

<p>It&rsquo;s still early, but Amazon already has a smattering of attractive offers. The HP Pavilion Gaming Desktop on sale from Amazon for $222 off is a standout budget gaming PC with a Core i5 processor and an RTX 3060 GPU&mdash;that&rsquo;s enough to game at 1080p with decent framerates in pretty much all modern games. Alternatively, for just about the same price you can opt for the Acer Nitro 50 for $510 off on Newegg which comes with a Core i5 processor and an RTX 3050 GPU. Ultimately the better value will come down to your intended use. If gaming is your main priority then opt for the HP model with an RTX 3060. But if you need your computer for work or other multipurpose use then save yourself a little bit of money and go with the Acer Nitro 50 which comes with more RAM.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a ton of options when searching for a desktop computer, but they all mainly fit into four main categories: productivity tower PCs, gaming PCs, mini PCS, and all-in-ones (AiO). Which you should end up buying is entirely dependent upon what your needs are and what you want to do with your computer. If you are looking for something that will work in a home office or family room, then a productivity PC or AiO with a solid CPU and lots of RAM and storage is probably the way to go. If gaming is your main concern, a gaming PC can offer a lot more bang for your buck than a laptop and you should focus on getting the best GPU possible. Or if you just want something that can fit anywhere and provide basic computing then a mini PC is a good bet.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>If you&rsquo;re after CPU power, look for processors with higher numerical names. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks. Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. Typically, the higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. You can get along just fine with a Core i3 for basic office and web browsing. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. If you need more power, the Ryzen 7 chip is well suited for content creation like video editing. Finally, if you&rsquo;re dealing with 4K video, spring for a Ryzen 9. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>If you don&rsquo;t intend to do any gaming on your computer then feel free to save some money by going with integrated graphics. However, if you are looking to get your game on, then we recommend at least an Nvidia GeForce 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT as these are the least expensive discrete graphics cards that can handle ray tracing. The latest gen GPUs are becoming more readily available in pre-built systems so opt for that if you have the money and want a performance boost. But they&rsquo;re still running a bit expensive, so budget gamers will likely be better served with the previous generation cards.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>As for RAM, we think its best to shoot for 16GB at the minimum for productivity and gaming, but for family computers and internet browsing, 8GB should suffice.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Storage size is dependent upon your personal needs, but it is generally a good idea to opt for an SSD over an standard HDD as they are much faster and don&rsquo;t significantly affect the price of a desktop. Before deciding, it&rsquo;s best to consider what your intended use of the computer will be. Are you just doing work or web browsing? Then something like 512GB will be plenty. If you want to load up a lot of large files such as games or content creation projects, then you&rsquo;ll need at least 1 or 2TB or storage. However, just remember that even if your computer doesn&rsquo;t have enough storage built-in you can always <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">upgrade your SSD</a> or go with an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">external drive</a> to increase your available storage options.</p>

</ul>



<p>We generally expect Chromebook deals to be priced between $170 and $250 or so, depending on the configuration. Keep in mind that retailers will dump older Chromebooks for less than $100 &mdash; we take a close look at these to determine whether they&rsquo;re trash or treasure. We&rsquo;ve factored the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394216/google-is-working-to-solve-the-chromebooks-support-problem.html">Chromebook support window</a> into our recommendations, which tends to extend between two and five years on discounted Chromebooks. We prioritize modern, more powerful Chromebook processors, too.</p>



<p>The Acer Chromebook 315 sale is our recommendation, with solid all-around hardware and a price that&rsquo;s at its lowest point for the year. The Asus Chromebook C423 is also at a yearly low, with just a small flaw: 4GB of RAM. </p>



<p>The Vibe Flip is also near a yearly low, with powerful hardware that will work well for productivity or gaming. Acer&rsquo;s Chromebook 516 GE is one of the few times we&rsquo;ve seen a gaming Chromebook go on sale, especially one with such a nice display. That might be worth a purchase all its own. </p>



<p>The Lenovo Slim 3&rsquo;s memory is a little skimpy, but we like Lenovo&rsquo;s Chromebooks and the price seems like a good one for the other specs. Caution! You may see this <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-15-6-chromebook-intel-processor-n200-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-natural-silver%2F6535992.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">HP Chromebook</a> at Best Buy for almost half off, but we&rsquo;re steering clear: It just feels like a 15.6-inch screen with 768p resolution is going to unnecessarily fatigue your eyes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="what-to-think-about-when-buying-a-chromebook">What to think about when buying a Chromebook</h2>



<p>Generally, Chromebooks tend to fall into three categories: ultracheap models at about $100, which can offer solid discounts but can hide gotchas like a subpar screen; midrange $200 to $350 Chromebooks, the typical price point; and premium Chromebooks at $500 and above. The latter are essentially PC laptops with Google&rsquo;s Chrome OS on top, and might be too expensive for your tastes. Our story recommending <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1976934/why-you-should-choose-a-chromebook-over-a-laptop.html">Chromebooks over laptops</a> may help you decide, as might our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">recommendations for the best Chromebooks</a>. We have a more detailed comparison of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">laptops versus Chromebooks</a>, too.</p>



<p>Discounted Chromebooks used to cut corners, like using 768p screens. We try to highlight more eye-pleasing 1080p screens, but smaller Chromebooks may look just fine with an older screen instead. Unlike a laptop, you should worry less about the processor: An Intel Core chip guarantees solid performance, but Celerons are much more common. Don&rsquo;t snub either a Qualcomm Snapdragon or Mediatek Arm chip, either. Instead, Chromebooks with more memory generally perform a bit better. Consider a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">USB-C dongle</a> to connect to an external display, if it doesn&rsquo;t already come with an HDMI port.</p>

<p>Look first at the screen: a large 1080p display is a good starting point. If the system memory is 8GB, that&rsquo;s also signals a quality Chromebook. Don&rsquo;t be so concerned about the microprocessor, as they tend to vary between Intel Pentium and Celeron processors and Arm (Qualcomm and Mediatek) processors. Anything powered by an Intel Core chip or AMD Ryzen (not an A-series) chip should deliver solid performance.</p>

<p>Another summer, another Prime Day sale&mdash;Amazon&rsquo;s big shopping event has finally begun. The sweet bargains include discounts on SSDs and other PC storage, like hard disk drives. Solid-state drives have particularly hefty discounts this year, with some positively jaw-dropping. All our recommended deals are all-time low prices (or very near it).</p>



<p>To get the best deals, you&rsquo;ll need an Amazon Prime subscription, as they&rsquo;re only available to members. Good news is, getting <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402239/how-to-get-amazon-prime-for-free.html">Amazon Prime for free</a> is easy. Not interested in Prime, but still want to save money? A few rival stores are offering steep price cuts as well, though not nearly as many as Amazon. Also, if you want more info on the drives we rate highest, check out our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">top picks for SSDs</a> as well as our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">top picks for external storage</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-prime-day-deals-on-ssds">Best Prime Day deals on SSDs</h2>



<p>This Prime Day is well-timed, as SSD prices were already plummeting. Now you can snag both 2.5-inch and M.2 models for even <em>lower</em> prices. Not too long ago, a good 1TB M.2 Gen 4 SSD would cost you a little over $100. But at the moment, you can snag a great one for as little as $50. Yep.</p>



<p><em>Note:</em> Unless listed otherwise, the warranty for these SSDs is 5 years.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Lower demand and high supply have led to a rapid tumble in solid-state drive (SSD) prices before Prime Day. Even before the big sales began, SSDs cost much less. A 1TB drive that might have been $100 during Black Friday is now often found for around $80 (or 20 percent lower than before). And during Prime Day, those prices have tumbled even further, slicing yet another $20 to $30 off the price. It&rsquo;s a great time to pick one up if you&rsquo;ve been wanting to expand your storage!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-an-ssd-better-than-hdd">Is an SSD better than HDD?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>SSDs are faster and take less room in a PC than a hard-disk drive (HDD), which gives them a strong advantage. If you only have one storage drive in your PC, it should ideally be an SSD so you get faster boot times and quicker access to your files. A HDD as your primary drive will feel much slower.</p>



<p>But HDD still have their advantages. First, they&rsquo;re much cheaper. The going price of a 2TB HDD is about the same as the <em>sale</em> price for a 1TB SSD. You also can get them in higher capacities than SSDs. If you work with huge files, you can pick up an 18TB or 20TB HDD (and as mentioned, since HDD cost less, you&rsquo;ll spend as much or even less as a 4TB SSD). f you need secondary storage and you don&rsquo;t need it to be fast, HDD are a fantastic option.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-i-know-if-an-ssd-deal-is-good">How do I know if an SSD deal is good?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Here&rsquo;s the guideline we use for picking deals: First, it should be for an SSD that performs well (or in select cases, performs well for its MSRP), and is a reasonable price when not on sale. The discount should also be significant for that particular model. Ex: For SSDs that almost never go on sale, a reduction of $5 to $10 is already hefty. For others, that might be closer to $20 to $30. </p>
