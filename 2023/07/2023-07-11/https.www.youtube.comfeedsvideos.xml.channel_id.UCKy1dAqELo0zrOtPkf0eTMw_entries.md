In today's Daily Fix:
Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley has denied the Federal Trade Commission's injunction to stop Microsoft from buying Activision Blizzard. It what is probably the most-watched case in gaming history, the judge was not convinced by the FTC's argument, and the $69-billion deal is one major step closer to happening. In related news, Blizzard has denied rumors that the recently-released Diablo 4 is going to Xbox's Game Pass service. If the deal is formalized, it paves the way for Blizzard games like Diablo to make their way to the service, but as of now, you'll have to spend money to take on Lillith and Co. And speaking of Diablo 4, some players are absolutely walloping bad guys in the game, dealing over A BILLION POINTS OF DAMAGE. Insane. Find out how one player is doing it in today's episode.

## Wolverine Finally Looks Comic Book-Accurate in Deadpool 3 - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

After decades of playing Wolverine on the big screen, we’ve never seen Hugh Jackman bring the iconic character to life in his tried-and-true X-Men uniform we’re all familiar with. Until now, that is! In the upcoming Deadpool 3 film, Jackman will be wearing the outfit first seen within the pages of Hulk Issue 180 back in 1962, where we were introduced to #Wolverine. With Deadpool 3’s Wolverine bearing a striking resemblance to his animated counterpart in that teased image, perhaps the Wolverine we see in the film is based on that particular variant? The #MCU has typed around with the multiverse, so perhaps we’ll see some of that play out in #Deadpool3. Along with Hugh Jackman returning, we also have Jennifer Garner returning as Elektra. But with this news, we also got news earlier this year that fan-favorite Domino will not be returning in Deadpool 3. That’s according to actor Zazie Beetz. We have news on the upcoming Peacock series, Twisted Metal and so much on today’s fix of entertainment with Akeem Lawanson!
