The same can’t be said for the evasive children’s minister</p><p>‘They don’t come to us skipping and singing, with backpacks on.” So says the actor Joe Swash’s mother, Kiffy – who became a foster parent 15 years ago when her own daughters and son were leaving home – of the children who find themselves part of the care system. It’s a system that, as her son discovers by meeting some of its inhabitants and graduates in Joe Swash: Teens in Care, is sometimes barely worthy of the name.</p><p>Swash considers her last foster child, Daniel, to be a brother; the family is bursting with pride that he is about to start university. At the same time, they are aware that Daniel is a rare success story – and emerging from a time (just) before the cost of living crisis and other factors pushed the system past breaking point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/11/joe-swash-teens-in-care-review-the-sheer-number-of-children-failed-by-the-system-is-profoundly-wrong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Everyone loves a summer transfer but here are some that, for different reasons, were less ‘Here we go!’ and more ‘Oh no!’</p><p>All my family are Blackburn; my dad went to school there, my grandparents bought a house from Jack Walker overlooking Ewood Park. Born to northern parents in the south I was the only kid in school who supported Rovers, but it was ace – we were promoted to the Premier League when I was four and crowned champions when I was seven. A year later everything changed: Kenny Dalglish was no longer our manager and Alan Shearer was on the verge of joining Newcastle. Aged eight, I scrawled a tear-stained letter pleading for my hero not to leave and handed it to Martin Tyler – I was best mates with his son at school. He promised to hand it to Alan but I’m 99% sure he never did. Can you imagine: Martin in the tunnel before a game, walking up to Shearer and saying, “Oh Alan, before you go, you know your move from this sinking ship of a club to your hometown side for a world-record fee? Well, thing is, my son’s friend has written you this note asking if you’d reconsider.” Shearer didn’t stay. You broke my heart, Alan.<strong> MB</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/11/you-broke-my-heart-our-writers-on-transfers-that-spoiled-their-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The rules leave voters ignorant of the tension that almost certainly exists between shielding financial interests and advancing the public good</p><p>Far too little is known about one aspect of the closeness of connections between MPs and private companies: the stake of the former in the latter. This is because parliamentarians’ investments in firms have been rendered largely secret. That was until this week when the Guardian revealed that more than<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/09/revealed-shares-held-in-secret-by-scores-of-mps-raise-questions-about-vested-interests" title=""> 50 members of parliament</a> have owned stakes in publicly listed companies, raising questions about possible conflicts of interest. MPs have only to register holdings greater than 15% of a company, or those valued at more than £70,000. Below those limits, the test for MPs to consider is whether their interests might reasonably be thought by others to influence them. But there is no duty on MPs to declare such stakes in companies affected by legislation going through parliament. This can only be bad for democracy.</p><p>Voters are mostly left ignorant of the tension that almost certainly exists for such MPs between shielding financial interests and advancing the public good. Can it be right for a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/09/tory-mp-david-duguid-criticised-windfall-tax-oil-firms-wife-bp-shares" title=""> former Tory minister</a> to criticise windfall taxes on oil and gas companies, including BP, without declaring his wife’s shares in the company, worth more than £50,000? The answer is, surely, no. Parliamentarians could argue that such ethical dilemmas don’t occur. But the system is such that the perception of these quandaries never arises.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/11/the-guardian-view-on-mps-interests-declare-shareholdings-affected-by-laws-going-through-parliament">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The departure of the Netherlands’ longest-serving prime minister means a high-stakes election in an increasingly polarised country</p><p>During 13 years in office, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/mark-rutte-everyman-dutch-pm-whose-teflon-powers-finally-waned-netherlands" title="">acquired</a> the nickname “Teflon Mark” – a tribute to his ability to dodge the fallout from political scandals and forge new coalitions from the rubble of previous governments. It therefore seemed likely that Mr Rutte’s decision to precipitate a snap election last week was another example of the Netherlands’ longest-serving leader playing a canny game. Instead it turned out to be the endgame, as Mr Rutte unexpectedly announced on Monday that he intends to stand down.</p><p>What comes next is, to say the least, up in the air. Mr Rutte, a master deal-maker in a kaleidoscopic system currently comprising 20 parties, has dominated mainstream Dutch politics. His departure leaves a temporary void which more extreme forces will hope to fill. Post-pandemic, in the Netherlands as elsewhere, the challenges of the cost of living and energy crisis, rising global migration and the green transition have proved a boon for the radical right, whose influence is seeping into the mainstream.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/11/the-guardian-view-on-mark-ruttes-resignation-a-departure-with-import-beyond-dutch-borders">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London</strong><br />This survey of the practice’s work, full of strange objects and AR tricks, seeks to challenge Herzog’s own view that ‘architecture exhibitions are so boring’ – but doesn’t always succeed</p><p>A row of crumpled metal pipes lies in a glass vitrine in the Royal Academy, with the look of battered building-site detritus scavenged from a skip. These bits of old pipe, it turns out, have a hallowed status in the archive of Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron. They were used in the late 1990s to develop the unique profile of the windows in their <a href="https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/projects/169-schaulager-laurenz-foundation/">Schaulager art storage facility</a> near Basel. Plaster was cast against their pummelled surfaces, which was then digitally scanned and scaled up to create formwork, on which the building’s rugged concrete walls were poured.<br /><br />Jacques Herzog wanted to create “the sort of fuzzy edge you get when you run your finger along a sandcastle”, forming a horizontal fissure across the facade that looked like a “crack in the earth”. The resulting building is a beguiling thing, a great earthy fortress of art that looks as though it was chiselled out of the ground, its windows ruptured by some momentous tectonic tremor.<br /><br />Such is the process behind the work of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/herzog-de-meuron">Herzog &amp; de Meuron</a>’s globe-trotting, Pritzker Prize-winning practice, whose experimental way of working is brought to vivid life in a new exhibition at the RA. Made famous here for their startling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/16/tate-modern-best-architecture-21st-century-jacques-herzog">transformation of Bankside power station into Tate Modern</a> at the turn of the millennium, they have gone on to build an unparalleled reputation for their ability to reinvent themselves for every single project, each building driven by an almost alchemical approach to materials, and an underlying interest in probing the weird and uncanny. Nothing they do is normal – especially when it comes to exhibitions.<br /></p><p>“Basically,” Herzog told me over a beer in Basel last month, “I think architecture exhibitions are so boring. The actual architecture is always somewhere else, and we are just dealing with a representation. With this exhibition, we wanted to show the realities of what it is to make a building. It is important to put everything on the table – I’ve got nothing to hide.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/11/herzog-de-meuron-review-architectures-masters-of-reinvention-reveal-their-box-of-tricks">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London<br /></strong>In the first of five recitals of Mozart piano works the 24-year-old pianist found proportion and purpose to music that clearly means a great deal to him. </p><p>Now 24, <a href="https://maofujita.com/en/biography/">Mao Fujita</a> won the Clare Haskil piano competition in Switzerland in 2017, and shared second prize in the Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow two years later. The Japanese pianist has since made a handful of appearances in the UK, mostly playing the big showy 19th-century repertoire that seems inevitably to be expected of prizewinners, but for his Wigmore debut he has opted for something very different – a survey of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/05/mozart-where-to-start-with-his-music">Mozart’s</a> piano sonatas presented this week across five recitals.</p><p>While cycles of the Beethoven sonatas may be almost commonplace, Mozart’s piano music rarely seems to receive similar concentrated attention. But it’s clearly music that means a great deal to Fujita; he included one of the sonatas in his prize-winning programme in Moscow, and last year released <a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/9370143--mozart-the-complete-piano-sonatas">recordings of all of them for Sony Classical</a>. And it was obvious from the very beginning of his first Wigmore programme that he does have something personal and fresh to bring to these works. His first sonata was the C major K279, the earliest to survive, but he had opened his recital with the Variations on Ah vous dirai-je, maman K265, perfectly striking a balance in both between muscular clarity and elegance, the exquisite and the down to earth, while never threatening to become precious or twee.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/mao-fujita-review-wigmore-hall-fresh-and-elegant-mozart-from-young-japanese-piano-star">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With Disney-championed stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter moving on from the company’s own record label, it seems the house of mouse’s power is waning</p><p>When Disney Channel star Hilary Duff released her debut album Metamorphosis in 2003, it marked a key shift in pop. Before her, the corporation’s TV teen talent – Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake – had left Disney behind when they signed with major record labels en route to becoming superstars. But with Duff, who played her show’s titular Lizzie McGuire, Disney saw an opportunity: instead of letting one of their biggest names find success elsewhere, they wanted to monetise whatever pop stardom their latest ingenue could deliver, and signed Duff to Disney’s own Hollywood Records, reviving a label that had never really managed to get off the ground.</p><p>Hollywood could promote Disney pop stars across the Disney Channel, Radio Disney and ABC, also owned by the corporation. Soon, a 360-business model was in full operation, and the next generation of Disney Channel stars – the Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez all helmed shows and released music through the in-house label. To keep parents and preteens on side, Disney would supply the sound, the songs and producers, and potentially even dictate what artists wore and how they presented themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/how-disney-pop-stars-got-back-in-the-driving-seat-olivia-rodrigo-selena-gomez">Continue reading...</a>

## And just like that, it got better: how the Sex and the City spin-off found its groove

<p>After bordering on unwatchable, the second season of And Just Like That has slowly found its way back to the magic that fans were missing</p><p>Sex and the City fans might remember the fictional Vogue editor Enid Frick, played by the inimitable Candice Bergen, for both her icy demeanor and immortal words of advice. “The key to having it all,” she once told a young Carrie Bradshaw, is to “stop expecting it to look like what you thought it was going to look like.” By “it”, she meant both fall collections and the less-than-ideal realities of romantic partnership, but I couldn’t help but wonder, would she say the same of television reboots?</p><p>And Just Like That, the sequel to the beloved HBO series, decidedly failed to meet SATC fans’ expectations. The stellar ratings of season one, which debuted last year with an audience of 1.1m households, plummeted to less than half of that for the premiere of season two; for many viewers, Miranda’s Che Diaz-induced spiral had undoubtedly killed the desire to keep tuning in. Season one relied so heavily on cringe-inducing, hapless gags that when they thankfully stopped in the second season, the show lost all momentum; with no backup plan for what the characters might do instead, their worlds felt strangely inert. The highlight of Carrie’s lifeless affair with her producer, devoid of any personality, excitement or sexual tension, was learning to poach an egg. Amid Harry’s improbable desire to wear a top hat to the Met Ball, we were suddenly watching a show about nothing – not the comedic nothing of Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm, but the miserable nothing of characters with no ambitions or stakes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/11/just-like-that-sex-city-satc-season-two">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The court has vastly overextended its own power and flaunted its corruption. It will take a political movement to stop them</p><p>How much do the supreme court’s six Republican justices care about what Americans think of them? The question haunts most accounts of the supreme court, an anxious subtext detectable in every discussion among court watchers and pundits when the court agrees to hear a specific case and after every oral argument.</p><p>There is a safe assumption – borne out in the conservative supermajority’s decisions, in their statements and in their pre-court careers – that they are all personally inclined to take the maximalist conservative route. If they were unconstrained by other factors, like public opinion and the legitimacy of the court, one gets the distinct sense that they would do the worst thing possible: reverse the most social progress, cause the most suffering, undermine democratic representation as much as possible and accrue as much political power as they can to themselves. What stops them, or slows them down, is not an instinct for moderation, or a sense of respect for the other branches, or the law. What slows them down is a caution about public opinion, a fear of what will happen if their institution is delegitimized in the minds of the people – what slows them down, that is, is something like shame.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/11/supreme-court-republican-justices-shame-power-thomas-alito-roberts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Squishy is dishy in compotes, bakes, frozen desserts and even booze, says our panel of cooks</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What can I do with overripe berries?</strong><br /><em><strong>Emma, Bradford</strong></em><br />Sweet, juicy berries are one of the best things about summer, but they can quickly turn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/13/turn-over-ripe-berries-into-cake-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-berry-streussel-cake-tom-hunt">squishy</a>. Providing there’s no mould, Emma’s first option is to bake them. “You absolutely want to be throwing them into the likes of financiers, friands, a bakewell tart or even a berry tart topped with crème patissière,” says <a href="https://www.philipkhoury.com/">Philip Khoury</a>, author of A New Way to Bake, published next month. The reason being, as berries age, “the fibre that gives them their tight and regular structure starts to give, but their flavour becomes sweeter, because the carbohydrates break down into sugar”. So, while the fruit’s texture might be compromised, “it is sweeter and, once baked, will turn nice and jammy”.</p><p>By the same logic, you can’t go far wrong with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/sep/14/nigel-slater-plum-and-marzipan-crumble-recipe">crumble</a>, either. “Get some apples in with the berries, then toss in sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon,” says Crystelle Pereira, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/flavour-kitchen-9781804191088">Flavour Kitchen</a>. How you then make your topping is entirely up for grabs: “Have it oat-based and add coconut oil for more of a breakfast crumble, or use sesame seeds, desiccated coconut or cornflakes for texture.” Nuts, too, are very much encouraged: “Flaked almonds go well with berries, as do cashews or pistachios with strawberries.” (The latter, Pereira adds, “looks really, really good”.)</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p>Known as one of the few cartoons that parents of pre-school kids can enjoy too, this is a tiny bit more grown up, but still a gorgeous, wholesome delight</p><p>“It’s another glorious morning on Puffin Rock.” For parents of small children, Chris O’Dowd’s voice at the beginning of Puffin Rock episodes has the effect of a bell sounding the start of meditation. The animated TV series about a young puffin called Oona and her impossibly cute little brother Baba – “Baba booooo!” – is a soothing, gentle-going delight. It’s routinely included in top 10 lists of shows that parents actually enjoy watching with their kids, and I have to admit it was practically the only thing my daughter watched between the ages of three and five that I could stand to be in the same room as.</p><p>Now comes the film, and it’s business as usual.

Their house style – so magical, so distinctive – puts them fully in the same league as Studio Ghibli and Pixar. Here, too, they fill every frame with an absolute wonder and joy in nature.

## Soft play is a nightmare – so why are adults leaping into the ball pit? | Zoe Williams

<p>Our galloping infantilisation continues at a new centre where there will presumably be less screaming than usual, greater participant continence and a bar. Is this what modern life has come to?</p><p>There is a generational sweet spot – I’m guessing anyone between 65 and 80? – who won’t know what soft play is. You take the principle of a playground, then move it indoors, often to a windowless space in which redeeming features such as fresh air have been removed. Then you add a load of padding and hollow plastic balls in primary colours and reduce the mean age of the children to three or under – when they are mainly screaming or making bad choices. Mess with the acoustics – it’s either the lack of windows or the aggressively cheap corrugated wall material – so that the cacophony is warped and comes from every direction, then submerge all the children beneath the balls, which mysteriously makes them louder, but now invisible.</p><p>Now, every adult is in a chamber of hypervigilant solitude – you can’t see your kid and you can’t figure out whether that noise is coming from him or her, or a pack of wolves – and disoriented by the visual overload.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/11/soft-play-is-a-nightmare-so-why-are-adults-leaping-into-the-ball-pit">Continue reading...</a>

## A Kind of Kidnapping review – sleazy MP no one wants is taken in pitch-black comedy

<p>Bungling amateurs kidnap a morally bankrupt politico in this British film – but his wife won’t spring for him, and he’s enjoying the publicity</p><p>This pitch-black, low-budget British comedy entertainingly revolves around a sleazy, self-serving MP who may or may not bear a passing resemblance to a certain recent prime minister. The MP’s name is Richard “Hardline” Hardy (Patrick Baladi), a politician so morally bankrupt that when he is kidnapped by a pair of bungling amateurs, he spots a once-in-a-life opportunity for cut-through with the British public. “Four million hits!” he says as his eyes light up seeing his kidnap video rack up views on YouTube.</p><p>Hardy’s kidnappers are out-of-work actor Maggie (Kelly Wenham) and her boyfriend Brian (Jack Parry-Jones), a taxi driver studying coding in his spare time. The frankly implausible story of how and why they kidnap Hardy while he’s up north on an opportunistic tour of the regions to visit “working people” (though in truth he seems to have contempt for anyone who doesn’t share his posh accent), is told in flashback. Meanwhile we watch the kidnap flounder when Hardy’s wife, sick of his affairs, refuses to pay up. With no ransom in sight, Maggie and Brian decide to let Hardy go. But he’s got other ideas: why not keep the kidnap up for another few days? What the heck, he’ll pay himself. The publicity is priceless.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/a-kind-of-kidnapping-review-patrick-baladi-youtube">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Seasonal allergies may sound like a joke to some – but they can be truly disruptive, and things are getting worse</p><p>I was on a date. A good one: spontaneous, romantic, the kind you see in the movies. The guy I fancied came back to mine after a gig we’d been at with mutual friends. I brewed mango tea in my favourite pot and showed him my life-drawing sketches. Conversation and Kate Bush albums intertwined as night turned into day. When birds began chirping, I suggested we go for a walk in the park to round off our time together. Big mistake.</p><p>Almost immediately, my nose began its rebellion – unleashing a flow of clear phlegm across the rest of my face. With no tissues, I had to reach for the nearest thing – a tree leaf. I asked my crush to turn around while I loudly blew my nose and got snot everywhere on my hand. I still remember the mucus stuck between my fingers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/seasonal-allergies-worse-hay-fever-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

The University of Cambridge’s youngest Black professor, he joined its faculty of education in March 2023, at 37. Before then, he had been a professor at Glasgow and Durham universities; published three books of academic work, mainly focusing on race and education; and, most importantly to him, raised more than £1m by doing charity work (his ambition is to raise £4m by the time he turns 40). All of this he has squeezed into a time period where he was learning to navigate the world with neurodivergence; Arday didn’t speak until he was 11 and couldn’t read or write until the age of 18.</p><p>It’s an unlikely story, he concedes, one that has made headlines and changed his life irrevocably. But he believes he was always going to do something great. “I knew I was destined to do something,” he says with a smile. “But I didn’t know it’d be this, admittedly.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/jason-arday-cambridge-university-youngest-black-professor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With its lead characters lodged up to their shoulders in gunk for most of its running time, Andres Beltran’s self-serious B-movie has nowhere to go</p><p>This low-budget thriller takes brave strides for the representation of quicksand, still seen sucking people to their doom well into the early 21st century in the likes of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the<em> </em>Crystal Skull. This, apparently, is a fallacy; contrary to <a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2010/08/terra_infirma.html">quicksand’s reputation among 12-year-olds</a> as the most feared method of improbable death, you can’t sink all the way in. As unfortunate American hiker Josh (Allan Hawco) points out: “The weight of the mud’s density is heavier than the human body.” He must be feeling pretty confident, because he jumps in to save his wife Sofia (Carolina Gaitan).</p><p>Actually, what we have on our hands is more of a bog. So “Quagmire” might have been a better title. A floundering couple, on the brink of divorce, take the surefire route of repairing relations by deciding to go on a testing outdoor hike in the Colombian wilderness. After falling victim to a carjacking, they flee into an off-limits zone notorious for its soupy terrain. Alas, the film doesn’t do a reputational salvage job on Colombia itself, whose national parks are apparently full of venomous reptiles and venal criminals, where hotel receptionists are in league with the criminals, and where police attention is lackadaisical.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/quicksand-review-survival-thriller-andres-beltran">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My sexual confidence has plummeted as a result of ageing and a mastectomy. Is there any way to move past this problem?</p><p><strong>I am a </strong><strong>65-year-old woman who has not been sexually active in a very long time due to divorce</strong><strong> and because I can’t find anyone I’m interested in. I </strong><strong>also had a mastectomy at the age of 54, but I haven’t </strong><strong>followed</strong><strong> it up with reconstructive surgery. In my youth I had </strong><strong>a lot of sexual confidence, but between an </strong><strong>ageing body and now a </strong><strong>disfigured one, I </strong><strong>can’t imagine </strong><strong>revealing myself to a man. Friends and family can’t believe I’m still </strong><strong>single</strong><strong>, and although I feel confident otherwise, I can’t get beyond this </strong><strong>problem.</strong></p><p>Start by finding a path back to self-acceptance. This could be via a body-image programme, an online or in-person support group or through books or podcasts on the subject. There are many resources out there, and there are also many healers of all kinds. Seek and follow what feels right and comfortable for you. At the same time, reach out to your community to meet people to talk to, have fun with and share common interests. True sexual intimacy after the types of challenges you have faced is absolutely possible – in fact highly likely – if you can heal your sense of being unlovable. Confidence attracts others, and you will regain that in time if you set your mind on it.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>A couple visit an island to celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary. The wife’s disappearance sparks a dizzying display of double takes and plot pivots</p><p>This mystery drama twist-a-thon from China was a huge hit on home turf recently (far outperforming the latest Indiana Jones feature) and has been picked up for distribution in the UK and the US. Although the 180-degree plot pivots start to get a little ridiculous by the end, the script (credited to writer-producer Chen Sicheng, Shuyi Gu and Yixiong Yin) zips along with such gleeful mischievousness that the ride is too fun to resist. Intriguingly, it is supposedly based on a 1990 Russian film called A Trap for Lonely Man, which was itself an adaptation of a stage play by French writer Robert Thomas for which <a href="http://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Trap_for_a_Solitary_Man">Alfred Hitchcock once bought the rights</a>. You can see traces of what Hitch might have liked about it, because it’s all about dopplegangers, femmes fatale and paranoia spoiling what should have been a nice holiday abroad.</p><p>The unlucky holidaymakers in this instance are Chinese couple He Fei (Yilong Zhu, in an outstandingly good performance) and his wife Li Muzi, who come to Belandia, a fictional south-east Asian island-nation, to celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary. However, Li Muzi goes missing just days after they arrived. With his tourist visa about to run out, He Fei is first met frantically trying to convince the local police to look for her, but with little success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/lost-in-the-stars-review-chinese-doppelganger-twist-a-thon-is-too-fun-to-resist">Continue reading...</a>

Because – bluntly – who the hell buys a book of book reviews? True, publishers still find it worth their while to collect the odds and sods of a Zadie or Salman-tier novelist for £20 a pop. And, yes, enough writers manage to house review-adjacent output under the sexed-up rubric of memoir (think of Joanna Biggs’s recent <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-life-of-ones-own-9781474621229">A Life of One’s Own: Nine Women Writers Begin Again</a></em> or Rob Doyle’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/autobibliography-9781800750524">Autobibliography</a></em>). Yet for entirely sensible reasons there’s no great clamour to immortalise the rough and ready ephemera of the week in, week out yay or nay; otherwise DJ Taylor, a longstanding reviewer for <em>Private Eye</em>, probably wouldn’t have brought out his recent collection <em><a href="http://www.shoestringpress.co.uk/">Critic </a></em><em><a href="http://www.shoestringpress.co.uk/">at Large: Essays and Reviews 2010-2022</a></em> (no sexing that up) with tiny Nottinghamshire outfit Shoestring Press, which unwary readers might well mistake for an invention of one of Taylor’s Bookworm columns.<br /><br />All of which makes <em>Retroland</em>, a pell-mell survey of the past half-century of British fiction from veteran <em>Sunday Times</em> critic Peter Kemp, land as something of an intriguing oddity. Styled as honest-to-goodness lit crit for a mainstream audience (academic criticism being another game altogether), it sets out to argue that modern novels are overwhelmingly preoccupied by the past; a thesis that’s persuasive enough, and one that possibly goes some way to explaining why, come Booker time, writers who buck the trend by staying in the here and now – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/04/my-phantoms-by-gwendoline-riley-review-broken-familial-bonds">Gwendoline Riley</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/29/sarah-moss-the-rhetoric-during-lockdown-was-terrifying">Sarah Moss</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/a-hunger-by-ross-raisin-review-his-most-ambitious-novel-yet">Ross Raisin</a> – seldom get a look in.<br /><br />Kemp’s tantalising introduction sketches the extent of what his subtitle dubs the “dazzling diversity” of fiction in the period at hand, taking in “a novel that uses only the 483 words spoken by Ophelia in <em>Hamlet</em>” (<em>Let Me Tell You</em> by Paul Griffiths), another “narrated by the first edition of Joseph Roth’s 1924 novel <em>Rebellion</em>” (Hugo Hamilton’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/01/the-pages-by-hugo-hamilton-review-joseph-roth-rebellion-colm-toibin">The Pages</a></em>), and another “that excludes the verb ‘to have’” (<em>Next</em> by Christine Brooke-Rose). Yet you won’t find any of them in <em>Retroland</em> proper, home, instead, to discussions of <em>Midnight’s Children</em>, <em>Atonement</em>, <em>Possession,</em> et al – not so much off the beaten track as stuck on the M25.</p><p>But no matter; you read on eagerly, keen to know Kemp’s explanation for the patterns he justly identifies: the “pervasive[ness of] the dual-narrative, double time-scheme novel which juxtaposes a contemporary story with one set in an earlier era” (yes! What’s <em>with</em> that?); the ubiquity of the “trauma plot” (ditto); and the enduring 90s revival of historical fiction, which the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/11/helen-dunmore-appreciation-by-amanda-craig-laugh-with-joy">Helen Dunmore</a> attributed to pre-millennial anxiety about what lay ahead in “the blank, silent sheet of years around the corner”.<br /><br />Kemp agrees that uncertainty seems a factor, “but... only one”, as if there’s some other killer analysis up his sleeve; there isn’t. Despite the setup, <em>Retroland</em> is really a pretext for a whistlestop tour of dozens of novels loosely bunched into four groups –novels of empire, novels of “buried trauma”, novels about history and novels built on older novels (such as Smith’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/on-beauty-9780141019451">On Beauty</a></em>, pegged to EM Forster’s <em>Howards End</em>, or Jeanette Winterson’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/frankissstein-9781784709952">Frankissstein</a></em>), all of which rush by in a largely contextless blizzard of titles, names and plots, with next to nothing by way of logical signposting (“It’s to fiction about personal trauma... that we should now move”, declares Kemp, and that’s that).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/11/retroland-by-peter-kemp-readers-guide-to-dazzling-diversity-of-modern-fiction-review-an-author-preoccupied-by-his-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the early days of the Tahrir Square protests, music was vital to the young people making their voices heard. And though the country is taking another authoritarian turn, that spirit of dissent cannot be extinguished</p><p>As a child growing up in Egypt, I learned that politics could put you in jail, if not simply get you vanished away. I learned this early on from the way my parents, their friends and our relatives distinguished what could or couldn’t be said. If we broached a subject that was out of bounds, we were brought to silence by stern eye contact from an elder. Rumours were rife about what happened to a classmate’s father; we heard snippets of things but knew we could never ask outright. There were subjects never to be addressed.</p><p>Things didn’t change much, even as Egypt became more open in the early 2000s with the arrival of the internet and widespread access to mobile phones. The government had so successfully indoctrinated citizens – partly through patronage, partly through fear – that few dared to speak out, even if asked to. As a journalist working in the country from the age of 18, I was quick to learn the red lines, as we referred to them – the clear parameters of what could or could not be broached. Red lines were considered, tiptoed toward and never crossed. But the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/feb/17/what-caused-egyptian-revolution" title="">Egyptian revolution of 2011</a> changed this in fundamental ways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/egypt-music-hip-hop-mahraganat-rebellion-protests-tahrir-square-cairo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A pod in the strait of Gibraltar has sunk three boats and damaged dozens of others, and their story has captivated the world. What explains this unprecedented behaviour?</p><p>What’s going on with the #orcauprising? You’ve probably gathered the basics: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/orcas-ramming-yachts-spanish-whale-behaviour-trauma-humans">orcas are “attacking” yachts</a>. To be strictly factual, since 2020, a small pod of orcas in the strait of Gibraltar has been interacting with sailing boats in a new way: ramming vessels, pressing their bodies and heads into the hulls and biting, even snapping off, the rudders. Over three years, more than 500 interactions have been recorded, three boats sunk and dozens of others damaged. Last month, the first instance of this behaviour was recorded in another place, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/orca-rams-yacht-off-shetland-first-such-incident-northern-waters">an orca rammed a boat near Shetland</a>. “What I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,” said the Dutch yachtsman targeted, Dr Wim Rutten, who had been fishing for mackerel. “Maybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.”</p><p>There are two fascinating things about this. First, of course, what are the orcas doing? But the second is about another species entirely: us. Why do we like this story so much? Because we do: people – including me – love the idea of orcas attacking boats. Browsing through orca memes, there’s an orca as the <a href="https://twitter.com/commiecentral2/status/1667550552052449287">sickle in the hammer and sickle</a>, with the headline “eat the rich”, and a Soviet-style graphic of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct4ESPPuMW1/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D">a heroic orca emerging under a superyacht</a>. “What if we kissed while watching the orcas take back the ocean,” <a href="https://twitter.com/DothTheDoth/status/1669395211427143680">reads one tweet </a>with 1m views, while a much-used image of an arm holding a microphone up to a captive orca has been repurposed endlessly to highly entertaining effect – I like one where it’s “singing” a <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorDaleyVT/status/1671237432493105152"> bespoke version of the Meredith Brooks classic</a>: “I’m a bitch / I’m an orca / Sinking yachts /Just off Majorca [sic] / I’m a sinner I’m a whale / Imma hit you with my tail.” We’re taking great pleasure in projecting extremely human narratives and motivations on orcas. But how wrong is that, and why does it appeal?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/11/the-orca-uprising-whales-are-ramming-boats-but-are-they-inspired-by-revenge-grief-or-memory">Continue reading...</a>
