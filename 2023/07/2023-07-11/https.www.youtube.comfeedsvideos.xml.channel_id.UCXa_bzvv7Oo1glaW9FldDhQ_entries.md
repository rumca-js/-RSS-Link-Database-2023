It’s been well over 2 years since Sony released the PS5, and fans have been treated to wonderful experiences like Horizon Forbidden West since its launch that serve as a great showcase for the power of the new hardware. 

But thanks to recent advancements in the consumer PC hardware space, owning a rig that’s comparable to the performance of PS5 has become a much more lucrative option than it was in the past.

We picked off-the-shelf brand new components to aggregate a 1:1 performance when compared with the PS5, and our total cost excluding software and peripherals came at around $770. It’s pretty cheap when you put in against our 2021 edition which cost around $1130, but the price gap is bound to get even lower as we progress deeper into this generation.

However - and you knew this was coming - some games haven't looked good. Several go from "uneven" to "downright awful" at times. Whether it's faltering on a technical level, the overall presentation, performance problems, or the art style, this year's dreadful-looking games are also some of its worst.

It isn't to say that you can't have fun even if the presentation is abysmal, but regardless, here are our picks for the worst-looking games of the year.
