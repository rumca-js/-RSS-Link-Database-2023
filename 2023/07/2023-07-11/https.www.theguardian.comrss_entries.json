His first sonata was the C major K279, the earliest to survive, but he had opened his recital with the Variations on Ah vous dirai-je, maman K265, perfectly striking a balance in both between muscular clarity and elegance, the exquisite and the down to earth, while never threatening to become precious or twee.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/mao-fujita-review-wigmore-hall-fresh-and-elegant-mozart-from-young-japanese-piano-star\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/mao-fujita-review-wigmore-hall-fresh-and-elegant-mozart-from-young-japanese-piano-star", "date_published": "2023-07-11T15:32:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Cut out the middlemouse: how Disney pop stars took control of their careers", "description": "<p>With Disney-championed stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter moving on from the company\u2019s own record label, it seems the house of mouse\u2019s power is waning</p><p>When Disney Channel star Hilary Duff released her debut album Metamorphosis in 2003, it marked a key shift in pop. Before her, the corporation\u2019s TV teen talent \u2013 Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake \u2013 had left Disney behind when they signed with major record labels en route to becoming superstars. But with Duff, who played her show\u2019s titular Lizzie McGuire, Disney saw an opportunity: instead of letting one of their biggest names find success elsewhere, they wanted to monetise whatever pop stardom their latest ingenue could deliver, and signed Duff to Disney\u2019s own Hollywood Records, reviving a label that had never really managed to get off the ground.</p><p>Hollywood could promote Disney pop stars across the Disney Channel, Radio Disney and ABC, also owned by the corporation. Soon, a 360-business model was in full operation, and the next generation of Disney Channel stars \u2013 the Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez all helmed shows and released music through the in-house label. To keep parents and preteens on side, Disney would supply the sound, the songs and producers, and potentially even dictate what artists wore and how they presented themselves.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/how-disney-pop-stars-got-back-in-the-driving-seat-olivia-rodrigo-selena-gomez\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/11/how-disney-pop-stars-got-back-in-the-driving-seat-olivia-rodrigo-selena-gomez", "date_published": "2023-07-11T15:31:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "And just like that, it got better: how the Sex and the City spin-off found its groove", "description": "<p>After bordering on unwatchable, the second season of And Just Like That has slowly found its way back to the magic that fans were missing</p><p>Sex and the City fans might remember the fictional Vogue editor Enid Frick, played by the inimitable Candice Bergen, for both her icy demeanor and immortal words of advice. \u201cThe key to having it all,\u201d she once told a young Carrie Bradshaw, is to \u201cstop expecting it to look like what you thought it was going to look like.\u201d By \u201cit\u201d, she meant both fall collections and the less-than-ideal realities of romantic partnership, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, would she say the same of television reboots?</p><p>And Just Like That, the sequel to the beloved HBO series, decidedly failed to meet SATC fans\u2019 expectations.

How you then make your topping is entirely up for grabs: \u201cHave it oat-based and add coconut oil for more of a breakfast crumble, or use sesame seeds, desiccated coconut or cornflakes for texture.\u201d Nuts, too, are very much encouraged: \u201cFlaked almonds go well with berries, as do cashews or pistachios with strawberries.\u201d (The latter, Pereira adds, \u201clooks really, really good\u201d.)</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

With his tourist visa about to run out, He Fei is first met frantically trying to convince the local police to look for her, but with little success.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/lost-in-the-stars-review-chinese-doppelganger-twist-a-thon-is-too-fun-to-resist\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/11/lost-in-the-stars-review-chinese-doppelganger-twist-a-thon-is-too-fun-to-resist", "date_published": "2023-07-11T06:00:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Retroland by Peter Kemp review \u2013 an author preoccupied with his past", "description": "<p>The veteran Sunday Times critic\u2019s survey of 50 years of British fiction rattles through titles, authors and genres, but often at the expense of insight</p><p><br />No violins please, but I don\u2019t think the day belongs to a literary critic who would dare to imagine their work between hard covers. Because \u2013 bluntly \u2013 who the hell buys a book of book reviews? True, publishers still find it worth their while to collect the odds and sods of a Zadie or Salman-tier novelist for \u00a320 a pop. And, yes, enough writers manage to house review-adjacent output under the sexed-up rubric of memoir (think of Joanna Biggs\u2019s recent <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-life-of-ones-own-9781474621229\">A Life of One\u2019s Own: Nine Women Writers Begin Again</a></em> or Rob Doyle\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/autobibliography-9781800750524\">Autobibliography</a></em>). Yet for entirely sensible reasons there\u2019s no great clamour to immortalise the rough and ready ephemera of the week in, week out yay or nay; otherwise DJ Taylor, a longstanding reviewer for <em>Private Eye</em>, probably wouldn\u2019t have brought out his recent collection <em><a href=\"http://www.shoestringpress.co.uk/\">Critic </a></em><em><a href=\"http://www.shoestringpress.co.uk/\">at Large: Essays and Reviews 2010-2022</a></em> (no sexing that up) with tiny Nottinghamshire outfit Shoestring Press, which unwary readers might well mistake for an invention of one of Taylor\u2019s Bookworm columns.<br /><br />All of which makes <em>Retroland</em>, a pell-mell survey of the past half-century of British fiction from veteran <em>Sunday Times</em> critic Peter Kemp, land as something of an intriguing oddity. Styled as honest-to-goodness lit crit for a mainstream audience (academic criticism being another game altogether), it sets out to argue that modern novels are overwhelmingly preoccupied by the past; a thesis that\u2019s persuasive enough, and one that possibly goes some way to explaining why, come Booker time, writers who buck the trend by staying in the here and now \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/04/my-phantoms-by-gwendoline-riley-review-broken-familial-bonds\">Gwendoline Riley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/29/sarah-moss-the-rhetoric-during-lockdown-was-terrifying\">Sarah Moss</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/a-hunger-by-ross-raisin-review-his-most-ambitious-novel-yet\">Ross Raisin</a> \u2013 seldom get a look in.<br /><br />Kemp\u2019s tantalising introduction sketches the extent of what his subtitle dubs the \u201cdazzling diversity\u201d of fiction in the period at hand, taking in \u201ca novel that uses only the 483 words spoken by Ophelia in <em>Hamlet</em>\u201d (<em>Let Me Tell You</em> by Paul Griffiths), another \u201cnarrated by the first edition of Joseph Roth\u2019s 1924 novel <em>Rebellion</em>\u201d (Hugo Hamilton\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/01/the-pages-by-hugo-hamilton-review-joseph-roth-rebellion-colm-toibin\">The Pages</a></em>), and another \u201cthat excludes the verb \u2018to have\u2019\u201d (<em>Next</em> by Christine Brooke-Rose). Yet you won\u2019t find any of them in <em>Retroland</em> proper, home, instead, to discussions of <em>Midnight\u2019s Children</em>, <em>Atonement</em>, <em>Possession,</em> et al \u2013 not so much off the beaten track as stuck on the M25.</p><p>But no matter; you read on eagerly, keen to know Kemp\u2019s explanation for the patterns he justly identifies: the \u201cpervasive[ness of] the dual-narrative, double time-scheme novel which juxtaposes a contemporary story with one set in an earlier era\u201d (yes! What\u2019s <em>with</em> that?); the ubiquity of the \u201ctrauma plot\u201d (ditto); and the enduring 90s revival of historical fiction, which the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/11/helen-dunmore-appreciation-by-amanda-craig-laugh-with-joy\">Helen Dunmore</a> attributed to pre-millennial anxiety about what lay ahead in \u201cthe blank, silent sheet of years around the corner\u201d.<br /><br />Kemp agrees that uncertainty seems a factor, \u201cbut... only one\u201d, as if there\u2019s some other killer analysis up his sleeve; there isn\u2019t. Despite the setup, <em>Retroland</em> is really a pretext for a whistlestop tour of dozens of novels loosely bunched into four groups \u2013novels of empire, novels of \u201cburied trauma\u201d, novels about history and novels built on older novels (such as Smith\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/on-beauty-9780141019451\">On Beauty</a></em>, pegged to EM Forster\u2019s <em>Howards End</em>, or Jeanette Winterson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/frankissstein-9781784709952\">Frankissstein</a></em>), all of which rush by in a largely contextless blizzard of titles, names and plots, with next to nothing by way of logical signposting (\u201cIt\u2019s to fiction about personal trauma... that we should now move\u201d, declares Kemp, and that\u2019s that).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/11/retroland-by-peter-kemp-readers-guide-to-dazzling-diversity-of-modern-fiction-review-an-author-preoccupied-by-his-past\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/11/retroland-by-peter-kemp-readers-guide-to-dazzling-diversity-of-modern-fiction-review-an-author-preoccupied-by-his-past", "date_published": "2023-07-11T06:00:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "World Architecture Festival 2023 shortlist \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>The World Architecture Festival\u2019s 2023 shortlist has been announced, revealing projects from around the world spanning categories such as religion, energy, transport and health.
