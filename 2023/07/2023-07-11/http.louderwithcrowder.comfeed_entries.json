Because this is 2023, the girl is being accused of hate speech and was kicked off the swim team. Did I mention the men identify as transgender women? The men identify as transgender women. Hence the teenage girl not wanting to be naked around them being in the \"wrong\" here.</p><p>16-year-old Abbigail Wheeler tried talking to the coach and the YMCA CEO about her concerns.  Neither cared and told her she would have to deal with it. So Wheeler and another girl put up signs to let the other FEMALE swimmers know there may be naked chicks with dicks wandering around. You know, in case anyone might think that was weird or inappropriate.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IWF/status/1678770542177038337\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>My head coach told our girls' team that there were hateful messages put up in the girls' lockerroom, that were considered hate speech and disrespectful. I then went to my coach and told him I was a part of this. He said it was probably not the best option for me to swim with the swim team. And that the YMCA staff would follow up with my family.</blockquote><p>What did the \"hateful\" signs say?</p><p>\"SafeSport\"</p><p>\"Women's rights\"</p><p>\"Biological women only\"</p><p>That's it. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/teen-girl-accused-hate-speech-protesting-transgenders-ymca-locker-room-report\" target=\"_blank\">And according to Fox News</a>, \"SafeSport\" is a U.S. nonprofit authorized by Congress that is dedicated to end physical, emotional, and sexual abuse in sports.</p><p>There are any number of things infuriating about this, least of all that it keeps happening at a YMCA. One trans was accused of exposing her female penis to minors, but a judge ruled <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ymca-ohio-trans-not-guilty\" target=\"_blank\">s/he was too fat for the penis to be visible</a>. Another elderly woman was taking a shower <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-activists-protest-ymca\" target=\"_blank\">when she spotted a dude helping little girls change</a>. </p><p>The most heartbreaking was a California girl who broke down in tears at a City Council meeting begging adults for help and to stand up for their daughters.</p><blockquote><em>I'm assuming all of you either have a wife, a sister, daughters, or granddaughters or are a woman yourself. Could you knowingly send an underage girl into a room where there was a naked man and say that she was not in danger? That she was safe? Or, more importantly, that this was right?</em></blockquote><p>There is a presidential race coming up. And Joe Biden has made it clear the most important plank in the Democrat Party's platform is making sure boys feel comfortable in girls' locker rooms as they dominate girls in sports. Let's keep things in pre-2021 terms.</p><p>One side of the argument is a teenage girl who feels uncomfortable getting undressed in a room where people who have male genitalia are also getting undressed. The other side of the argument says the feelings of the people who have male genitalia take precedence over the teenage girl. Don't vote for anyone who supports the other side of the argument.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

It means that the entertainment journalists have all finished tripping over themselves in a vain attempt to praise this film. And boy, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/indiana-jo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">have they tried</a>. </p>\n<p>Granted, this isn't a terrible film. I wouldn\u2019t call it \"good\" by any means, but it wasn\u2019t awful either. But it is boring, which I would argue is the greater crime a movie can commit. I can laugh at a bad movie, but I can't escape a boring one.</p>\n<p>When this movie was <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/03/steven-spielberg-harrison-ford-team-up-for-indiana-jones-5-disney-sets-july-2019-release-1201720725/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a>, my only thought was, \u201cWhy?\u201d Nobody asked for this. When I heard that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-5-james-mangold-harrison-ford-1203515698/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spielberg would not be directing</a>, I decided then and there I wanted no part of it. Then, I forgot about it thanks to the lack of solid marketing and my general disdain for all things Disney. And finally, the initial reviews and box office reports came out, all but confirming my initial fears.</p>\n<p>So I said, \u201cScrew it, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s as bad as everyone says it is.\u201d And it was. Spoilers below, if you care for such things.</p>\n<p>Good stuff first. Don\u2019t worry, there isn\u2019t much. The opening sequence was fun, if a bit long. The CGI de-aging on Harrison Ford was surprisingly good, at least until he spoke and an 80-year-old Ford's voice came out. Mads Mikkelsen was my favorite part of the movie by far. His character, villain J\u00fcrgen Voller, was delightful to watch. Antonio Banderas was\u2026 there\u2026 I guess? The film wasted him, but he was there.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s all the praise I have for this movie. I was ready to walk out of the theater less than forty minutes in. Lucasfilm once again tears down their beloved heroes of old. The film leaves Dr. Jones a sad, lonely, old man with nothing left to live for, waiting for his younger, female counterpart to replace him. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@josvchoi/the-last-jedi-on-the-character-assassination-of-luke-skywalker-38fe0190d01a\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sound familiar?</a> Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s performance as Helena Shaw left much to be desired. The character had few if any, redeeming qualities, and I found her incredibly annoying. She upstages Indy at almost every turn with no explanation for her skills, never reveals her motivations, and contradicts her own character traits throughout the movie. In short: I have no clue who she is. What\u2019s worse is the movie doesn\u2019t seem to know either. All the same, it wants us to accept her as the new Indiana Jones without argument or protest. </p>\n<p>Granted, I am harping on this move more than it probably deserves. It\u2019s not Lucasfilm\u2019s worst outing in the last few years by far, but I keep coming back to the same question: \u201cWhy?\u201d There was no reason for this movie's creation. And audiences seem to agree. Its 2nd-weekend drop at the box office could be <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/insidious-the-red-door-box-office-joy-ride-1235530838/#:~:text=The%20pic%2C%20from%20Lucasfilm%20and%20Disney%2C%20looks%20to%20fall%2058%20percent%20or%20more%20to%20%2425%20million%20to%20%2428%20million.%20That%E2%80%99s%20the%20biggest%20decline%20of%20the%20series.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as high as 58%</a> according to early estimates. That's even worse than \u201cKingdom of the Crystal Skull\u2019s\u201d <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2321253889/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">55% drop</a>, making it the worst drop in the series.</p>\n<p>The film currently has a generous 88% audience rating on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/indiana_jones_and_the_dial_of_destiny\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and a less-than-stellar 69% from critics. It has a 6.9/10 on <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462764/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IMDb</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metascore</a> of 57, the latter of which I would argue is more fair of a rating. </p>\n<p>So, whether to watch \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d is the question. If you\u2019re looking for a nostalgia-ridden film to turn off your brain for two hours, then by all means, go see it. But if you\u2019re looking to see Indiana Jones in action, you\u2019d be better off putting on \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d or \u201cThe Last Crusade\u201d instead of watching this sad pretender.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d Release Date: June 30, 2023.

Remember how we got here. </p><p>1. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light\">Controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a> announced he and/or she was a new brand ambassador for Bud Light as part of their March Madness campaign. An odd choice since in Dylan's portrayal of a woman he presented as someone too ditzy and basic to know what March Madness was, as opposed to any of the thousands of women who love college basketball.</p><p>2. A podcast appearance of now-former Bud Light VP Alissa Heinersceid came to light. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing\" target=\"_self\">The now disgraced marketing elitist lashed out at Bud Light customers as \"fratty\" and \"out of touch</a>. It was important to her to have another approach that included <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_self\">a San Francisco-based \"influencer\" marketing firm</a> setting her up with Mulvaney. There is a trend with progressives where the only way to be \"inclusive\" and \"for everyone\" is to sh*t on the people who currently enjoy a product. It's called the <a href=\"https://boundingintocomics.com/search/kathleen%2bkennedy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kathleen Kennedy</a> method.</p><p>Bud Light's role as the #1 beer in America was sabotaged by people who don't drink Bud Light and hate people who do drink Bud Light because they want their customers to be someone else entirely. Own it. Make Dylan Mulvaney the official Queen of Beers. Bring in former VP Melissa Weinerchild to say \"You're goddamned right I think you rubes are fratty and out of touch.\" And target to a niche audience of upper-class elitists and gender identity-obsessed progressive zoomers who demand their political worldview be validated by everything and everyone.</p><p>The company will never have the courage to apologize and admit they f*cked up. Might as well go all in the other way.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Screaming about forcing a woman to keep a baby after a rape. The crowd was quick to boo, but Vivek was quick to let her speak. She was angry about something. Let her have her moment.</p><p>As she spoke, she said how she was already a single mother because the father had left her to raise the kid all by herself and she was struggling. As Vivek engaged her more, she started to brag about her kid and how successful the kid was. It ended with Vivek talking about the importance of motherhood and being a parent.</p><p>Turns out the woman was not a pro-abortion activist. She was a voter who is having a tough go on it, probably read on the internet somewhere what an actual pro-abortion activist said about the GOP, and needed a place to vent. She went to an event where a GOP presidential candidate was.</p><p>What Vivek did was what the boss refers to as \"matching intensities.\" Had the woman been an activist looking to shut the event down, he would have dealt with her. If the woman had a question about Vivek's views on being pro-life, he would answer. This woman just needed to feel heard.

And I'm leery about comparing Vivek to other candidates from past races because people skip the analogy and then go to everything that candidate has ever said that they don't like. But I am VERY interested in seeing how Vivek Ramaswamy performs when the primary debates come around and a national audience starts to pay attention. </p><p>Third place is the sweet spot to be right now.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

What you\u2019re saying automatically in the argument\u2014you\u2019re sort of telling on yourself already\u2014is you don\u2019t believe these people are women. </blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ce7f2\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34311387&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>She then makes a nonsequitur to blame everything on Dave Chappelle. And that when people hear women such <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-12145459/Trans-women-sports-ESPNs-Sage-Steele-defends-colleague-Sam-Ponder-bigotry-claims.html\" target=\"_blank\">as Sage Steele</a> and <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2019/2/17/18227992/martina-navratilova-trans-athletes-are-men-competing-as-women-is-unfair\" target=\"_blank\">gay icon Martina Navratilova</a> speak out on behalf of fairness and biology, what they are really hearing are Chappelle's hilarious jokes.</p><blockquote>I don\u2019t want to mince words about it. Dave Chappelle making jokes about trans people directly leads to violence, whether it\u2019s verbal or otherwise, against trans people. When Martina or Sage or whoever are talking about this, people aren\u2019t hearing it just in the context of elite sports.</blockquote><p>It's not the first time Chappelle has been accused of violence by saying words. Even violence as silly as \"verbal\" violence, which isn't a thing. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-podcast-minneapolis\" target=\"_blank\">The comedian has addressed the matter before</a> and admitted that perhaps in a way, his words have led to violence. Violence FROM trans activists against his fans.</p><blockquote><em>One of the things that these people, the trans and their surrogates, always say is that my jokes are somehow gonna be the root cause of some impending violence. But I gotta tell you, as abrasive as [the activists] were \u2014 the way they were protesting, throwing eggs at people, throwing barricades, cussing and screaming \u2014 nobody beat \u2019em up.</em></blockquote><p>Rapinoe first entered the public eye when she complained that girl soccer players were not getting paid as much as boy soccer players. Apropos of nothing, the women's team averaged 7,894 attendees per game in 2022. The men's team averaged 21, 033 attendees.</p><p>It is unclear what Rapinoe plans to do in her post-soccer life. If I were to guess, she'll take a job as an analyst on MSNBC. Or a job with the Biden Administration. Joe Biden has made it clear the most important plank in the Democrat Party's platform is making sure boys feel comfortable in girls' locker rooms as they dominate in sports. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
