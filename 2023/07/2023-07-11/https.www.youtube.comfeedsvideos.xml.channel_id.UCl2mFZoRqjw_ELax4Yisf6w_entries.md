"As of January 1 2024, Steam will officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows."

More importantly - "In order to continue running Steam and any games or other products purchased through Steam, users will need to update to a more recent version of Windows."
