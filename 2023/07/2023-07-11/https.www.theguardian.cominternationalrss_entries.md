Tipped as a future world No 1 since he burst on to the scene a couple of years ago, the Italian had lost all of four previous grand slam quarter‑finals. Fifth time round, he was desperate to get everything right: 2hr 14min later, Sinner had completed the job, his 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 win against the 25-year-old Russian taking him into the Wimbledon semi-finals.</p><p>“It means a lot to me,” the softly spoken Italian said. “We put many hours of work in and many sacrifices off court for this moment.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/11/jannik-sinner-hails-sacrifices-as-victory-over-safiullin-sets-up-djokovic-rematch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brad Fittler’s Blues are desperate to regain some pride in game three after two defeats, but the Maroons look ready to continue domination</p><p>Usually, the “dead rubber” is as desultory as it sounds.

<p>Trump’s long-shot competitors had to have known that their entry into the race would only make his renomination more likely</p><p>Already in this early stretch of the Republican presidential primary campaign, there are nearly as many candidates in the field as there were in 2016, when Donald Trump bested a slew of the Republican party’s most prominent figures on his way to the White House. But unlike 2016, of course, Trump has been the race’s perhaps prohibitive favorite from the jump ⁠– over the last three months, Trump has moved from plurality to outright majority support from the Republican electorate in the polls.</p><p>Far from damaging his candidacy, his two indictments have, if anything, encouraged more and more Republican voters to rally to his side. And, unfortunately for those hoping he loses the nomination, the sheer size of the field will make it difficult for any one of his rivals to consolidate enough of the non-Trump vote to mount a real challenge to his candidacy. Each of his long-shot competitors had to have known that their entry into the race would only make his renomination likelier. Yet they jumped in anyway.

<p>As tickets become increasingly unaffordable, the experience of attending sport now seems to be reserved for a select few</p><p>Hold your nerve. Stick to the plan. We’re all in this together. Your rent is going through the roof and your bills are turning red, and your local supermarket has started putting security tags on the cheese, but the sunlit uplands are at hand. Desperate parents are stealing baby formula and corporate profit margins are fattening and there seem to be a lot more mattresses on the street these days, but trust the process. And in the meantime, try to avoid asking for a pay rise, buying branded goods or watching live sport.</p><p>Full disclosure: I’m probably not the best person to be writing about the rising cost of attending sport in this country. I get to do it for free. It’s the most pathetic excuse for a job yet invented. Likewise, among the sports media as a whole, ticket prices have always been something of a blind spot: a war we so rarely have to fight, a huge segment of the sporting experience to which, with a cheery wave of a lanyard, we remain largely oblivious. But really it’s time somebody started kicking up a fuss, because it’s getting ridiculous out there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/11/spiralling-costs-tear-though-notion-of-sport-as-a-communal-force-for-good">Continue reading...</a>

## Watch out food snobs: microwaves are now Britain’s hottest cookery gadget | Clare Finney

<p>It’s not all mug cakes and rubbery scrambled eggs. If you don’t own one, you’re missing out on ‘kokumi’ and low-GI lasagne </p><p>“Oh, I don’t have a microwave,” that person who doesn’t have a microwave will tell you, judgment dusting their words like icing sugar atop a microwave mug cake. Inevitably, this will be followed by a light <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2015/apr/28/dont-be-humblebragger-good-old-fashioned-boast">humblebrag</a> like: “Call me old-fashioned, but I’ve just never seen the need.” They bake their cakes in the oven, reheat their leftovers on the hob, and they <em>never</em> have ready meals, which is all they really believe a microwave is good for. No matter that last week’s <a href="https://www.johnlewispartnership.media/news/waitrose/06072023/-headline-news--2?brand=waitrose">cooking trends report</a> from Waitrose (no less) has revealed that microwave sales are up 13% at John Lewis compared to last year, and that it is this year’s most popular kitchen gadget among those surveyed; for that person, not owning a microwave is as fundamental to their personal brand as drinking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/14/cult-additive-free-natural-wine">natural wine</a> and riding a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/sep/06/fitness">fixie</a>.</p><p>As hot takes on household appliances go, this one intrigues me most. After all, no one gets het up over kettles. I don’t own a toaster for the same reason one might not own a microwave – my kitchen’s too small – but I don’t make a point of it, I just burn my bread under the grill. Sure, spiralisers and juicers were a bit divisive back in their day, but those furores were like the fads themselves, lighthearted and fleeting – as, I bet, will be the current must-have gadget, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/05/its-official-air-fryers-can-save-you-money-but-there-are-even-cheaper-ways-to-cook">air fryer</a>.
