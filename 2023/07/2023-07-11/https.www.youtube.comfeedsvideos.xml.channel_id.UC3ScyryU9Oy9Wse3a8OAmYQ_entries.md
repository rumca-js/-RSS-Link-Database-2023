“It reveals that it is conceivable to stand against him,” Baker says. “And if you’re Putin, you’re looking around that room and you’re saying, ‘Which of these people has a knife in his belt? Which of these people might be thinking about moving on me next?’”

“Putin’s Crisis” will be available to watch in full at pbs.org/frontline and in the PBS App starting July 11, 2023, at 7/6c.

Drawing on both new interviews and the team’s years of reporting on the Russian leader, the documentary tells the inside story of Putin’s rise, his clashes at home and abroad, and how his war on Ukraine led to unexpected new challenges to his power.
