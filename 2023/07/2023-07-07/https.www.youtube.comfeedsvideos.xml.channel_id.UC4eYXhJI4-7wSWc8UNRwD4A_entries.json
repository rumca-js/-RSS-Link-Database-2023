At least I do.\n\nI've been a fan of the edgy sonic traditions of the Meridian Brothers for a while now, and jumped at the chance to bring the duo's space age cumbia direct from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia to the Tiny Desk. And band leader Eblis Alvarez did not disappoint.\n\nRight from the start, the band's cumbia-infused grooves floated beneath almost otherworldly electronic keyboard sounds in \"Guaracha U.F.O.,\" eventually incorporating Alvarez's signature, sly \"I know something you don't\"-style vocals. It's easy to be tricked by the eccentricities of the instrumentation and the offbeat vocal stylings, but Alvarez is a man with a vision, using his vast knowledge of Colombian folk and pop music to do things like pay tribute to an imaginary salsa band that never existed, as he did on its last album.\n\nThings were very real during the group's turn behind the Desk, as he and his band challenged the audience to bring along what they knew to meet him in his world of recycled beats \u2014 played by his dedicated crew of Colombian musicians \u2014 off-kilter vocals and imaginative storytelling lyrics on \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1s Mar\u00eda?\"\n\nHe and his band pulled off a powerful version of \"Bomba At\u00f3mica\", a sort of calling card that speaks to Alvarez being influenced by the rich history of Colombian cumbia and surf rock guitar, for a song that is essentially a frantic warning of the end of the world. Alvarez acknowledged the audience's appreciation with two raised fists, as if to celebrate how the real world dipped their toes into his realm of the imaginary, and everyone was better for it.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Guaracha U.F.O.\"\n\"\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1s Mar\u00eda?\"\n\"Bomba At\u00f3mica\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nEblis Javier Alvarez Vargas: guitar, keyboard, cello, vocals\nAlejandro Forero: keyboards\nCesar Quevedo Barrero: bass\nMar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica Valencia Sanchez: saxophone, percussion \nMauricio Ram\u00edrez Echeverri: drums\nAlejandro Araujo Larrahondo: percussion, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras \nDirector: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora\nEditor: Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Brian Jarboe\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #MeridianBrothers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9jHZ_pa2PM", "date_published": "2023-07-07T09:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
