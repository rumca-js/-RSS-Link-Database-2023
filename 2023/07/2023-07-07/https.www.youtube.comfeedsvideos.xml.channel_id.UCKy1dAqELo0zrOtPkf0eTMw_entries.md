In today's Daily Fix:
Blizzard recently gave Diablo 4 players a slightly better chance of earning rare loot in the game...and then took it away. In fact, Blizzard disabled rare loot drops entirely. Don't worry, hopefully by the time you read this the latest hotfix will be out that should address the unnamed original problem. In Capcom news, Street Fighter 6 is a hit, both critically and commercially. The game recently passed 2 million copies sold, and a batch of new DLC characters are on the way. And finally, Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been sentenced to prison for insider trading.
