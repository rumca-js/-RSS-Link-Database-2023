<p>A new Which? survey reveals that visitors are starting to look beyond the old overcrowded favourites such as Barcelona and Málaga</p><p>Ask for a lineup of the most popular European coastal destinations and you might expect the usual suspects: Venice, Lisbon and Nice. Travellers from the era of the Grand Tour might have added Biarritz and Naples – but a survey of 3,500 readers by consumer organisation Which? suggests that visitors are starting to look beyond the old favourites and discover new destinations.</p><p>The Spanish Mediterranean port of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/valencia">Valencia</a> was the surprising winner in a recent poll that looked at 12 separate criteria, including quality of the beaches, seafronts and marinas; attractiveness; food and drink; and value for money. Respondents cited the city’s history, futuristic architecture and gastronomy, but also its peace and quiet. With traditional favourites such as Barcelona struggling with overpopularity – numbers there are heading back towards the 2019 high of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/772271/tourists-in-barcelona-spain-by-kind-from-accommodation/">13.9 million</a> overnight visitors – that seems significant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/08/which-poll-reveals-surprise-shift-in-travellers-favourite-european-coastal-towns-and-cities">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While Kazakhstani player is an extremely tough opponent, British No 1 is in fine form and will have fans on her side</p><p>It is remarkably easy to get carried away when following British players at Wimbledon. Perhaps it’s a bit of simple patriotism; maybe it’s the fact that, for many casual fans, this is the only time they see most British players all year.</p><p>Some players struggle with it, the expectations too much, the groan when they miss an easy shot so demoralising that their game goes to pot. Others, like Andy Murray, thrive, using the positive energy to produce their best when it matters most. It helps that Murray was, and still is, a world-class player, but many Britons rise to the occasion when the crowd is on their side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/07/katie-boulter-ready-for-test-against-incredible-champion-elena-rybakina">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This thriller follows four uproariously funny teenage girls on a banter-packed jaunt to Rotterdam. A drug gang chases them, a serial killer is on the loose and it all gets enjoyably terrifying</p><p>Then You Run appears to be a frenetic hybrid of Luther and The Hangover, with an added sprinkle of Scandi-noir bleakness – and four teenage girls as the lead characters. It follows four friends’ misadventures (and then some) on what was supposed to be a brief holiday in Rotterdam, and the violent, unholy mess that emerges. This eight-parter is an enjoyably chaotic thriller that looks the business, and doesn’t take its foot off the pedal for a second.</p><p>It begins in 2005, and, for the opening scene of each episode, it plays out like a particularly bleak mid-00s offshoot of The Killing. The deaths we witness are the work of a serial killer called The Traveller, who murders quite an astonishing amount of people, mostly in the middle of the night, in all manner of chilling scenarios: in snowbound traffic jams, roadside hotels and on sleeper trains. So thank you to the writers for the additional travel anxiety that this leaves in its wake.</p><p>Then You Run aired on Sky Max and is available on Now TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/07/then-you-run-review-like-derry-girls-but-with-a-lot-more-and-heroin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The single sorriest thing about watching England this summer has been so few of captain’s teammates have stood with him</p><p>The view must have looked pretty good from out there on the burning deck. The sky was brilliant blue in every direction, the grass checkered and parched, and the spectators all around roared and clapped and cheered and sang while Ben Stokes whistled sixes into their midst. You wonder whether Stokes had time to appreciate the moment as he stood out at the non-striker’s end, one leg cocked, one hand propped on his bat. He had promised that his team were going to “make memories” and everyone who loves the game will remember the way he has played in these last two innings.</p><p>Trouble is that unless his team win this Headingley Test, those same people may also recall them as the first England side in 22 years to go three-nil down in a home Ashes series. The match is turning into this England side’s last stand. It’s Bazball’s Little Bighorn, and Stokes and his ragtag team are surrounded on the little patch of high ground, Australians in Baggy Green caps swarming all around.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/07/ben-stokes-stuart-broad-ashes-cricket-england-australia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From staying up late to watch Match of the Day as a child, the coach has faced many obstacles on her journey to historic role</p><p>There is a reason Forest Green Rovers’ home, in Nailsworth, a market town in the Cotswolds, is on Another Way. The League Two club do things differently, whether wearing kits made of bamboo and coffee grounds, having a bee hive on the roof of their main stand to encourage pollination or travelling by zero-emissions vehicles. They even use away fans’ urine to fertilise their organic pitch. But on Wednesday evening they took another unprecedented step, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/05/hannah-dingley-makes-history-in-first-game-in-charge-of-forest-green">Hannah Dingley took caretaker charge of their first pre-season friendly</a>, becoming the first woman to lead a professional English men’s team and, inadvertently, a trailblazer for countless girls and women.</p><p>“I am the first and it’s great but I don’t want to be the first and the only,” Dingley said afterwards. A groundbreaking night, but it is still far from a level playing field. But Dingley, who became the first academy manager in men’s football with Forest Green in 2019, has long known that. As a child her gender meant she was unable to play the game she loved for a team for about five years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/07/i-dont-want-to-be-the-first-and-only-hannah-dingleys-forest-green-dream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It will not be easy to integrate a huge war-torn country into current European structures, which is why the work must start now</p><p>One of Vladimir Putin’s mistakes when plotting his invasion of Ukraine was to underestimate European solidarity. The Russian president’s territorial aggression moved the continent’s centre of strategic gravity, but not in the direction he had intended. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made an emergency application for EU membership within days of the invasion. The country’s candidacy was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/23/eu-leaders-ukraine-candidate-status-russian-attack" title="">formally accepted</a> within months.</p><p>At a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/03/ursula-von-der-leyen-wants-ukraine-and-moldova-in-eu-within-four-years" title="">summit in Kyiv last week</a>, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was impossible to conceive of a future for the EU without Ukraine. That would not have been said before the war. Candidacy for EU membership is less important to Mr Zelenskiy’s war effort than military hardware, but weapons have also flowed from European states. Military aid and institutional integration are two arms of the same embrace. That reflects a psychological adjustment in the west – a shaking off of complacency and belated recognition that Mr Putin is a tyrant who cannot be appeased.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-and-the-eu-kyiv-needs-a-credible-pathway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Traditionally looked down on by the poetry establishment, those specialising in performance deserve their new chance to shine</p><p>News that one of the UK’s leading poetry prizes is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/30/forward-prizes-for-poetry-add-new-award-for-performed-poems" title="">introducing a category for spoken word </a>artists is as welcome as it is overdue. The move by the Forward prizes signals that the poetry establishment is finally finding a way to honour a sector that it has traditionally regarded as a cuckoo in its nest, when in fact it has long been a fully fledged skylark. This prejudice has done poetry itself no favours, by excluding not only some of the most powerful voices of the last half century, but also those most likely to draw big new audiences into its thrall.</p><p>For three decades, the Forward prizes have stood alongside the TS Eliot awards as proof that poetry still matters. Each year, both sets of awards fill London’s 2,700-seater Festival Hall for winners’ ceremonies that are also performances, celebrating the art form in its most ancient iteration as something to be heard and shared. In this context, it has always seemed ironic that it has had no room for the culture-shifting polemics of, say, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/09/time-come-by-linton-kwesi-johnson-review-50-years-of-rhyme-and-rage" title="">Linton Kwesi Johnson</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/07/benjamin-zephaniah-coppers-were-standing-on-my-back-and-i-thought-ok-im-going-to-die-here" title="">Benjamin Zephaniah</a>, or of a younger generation who, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/15/in-conversation-with-benjamin-zephaniah-and-george-the-poet-pocast" title="">George the Poet</a>, are capable of reeling in a Glastonbury crowd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-spoken-word-poets-powerful-voices-that-are-needed-today">Continue reading...</a>

## Taylor Swift: Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) review – re-recording project starting to feel wearying and pointless

<p><strong>(Republic)</strong><br />The latest of Swift’s re-recorded albums suffers from the loss of her youthful voice – as well as her decision to alter lyrics out of step with today’s sensibilities</p><p>Originally released in 2010, Speak Now was the first Taylor Swift album to go studs up, foregrounding the combative spirit that would come to define her. It is to date her only entirely self-written record, her attempt to vanquish critics who had credited her co-writers with the success of her first two albums. (The sing-songily vindictive Mean called out one directly.) The fairytale romances of her first two records turned bitter as Swift turned 20 and experienced real heartache. In the bruised epic Dear John, one of her greatest songs, she rebuked musician John Mayer, 12 years her senior, for treating her poorly when they dated. Her country sound hardened accordingly, skewing towards pop-punk and gothic rock. Even the ballads expanded to an indomitable scale, primed to fill the vast rooms she was now selling out. Eleven of the original 14 tracks are classics, and Speak Now (the 2010 version) remains a five-star smash.</p><p>The album is premised on Swift saying the things she wished she had said: an extended fantasy about having the last word in heartbreak – but also, for the first time, her own narrative. (Innocent consoles Kanye West, who in 2009 invaded Swift’s acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music awards, instigating a pop-cultural paradigm shift that we’re still living through.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/07/taylor-swift-speak-now-taylors-version-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Billed as ‘a therapeutic novel’, the publisher’s first foray into fiction follows 29-year-old Anna’s mental health journey – with a view to helping the reader. But how useful can such clunky writing be?</p><p>At 29 years old, Anna is full of self-loathing. She hates her job, her boyfriend is having an affair and her parents’ response to her troubles is indifferent at best. This is the starting point for A Voice of One’s Own, the first novel to be published by The School of Life. In its pages, fiction and self-help make for uneasy bedfellows.</p><p>Co-founded by philosopher Alain de Botton in 2008, The School of Life broadly aims to teach its “students” how to lead calmer, more fulfilling lives. Its publishing arm, launched in 2016, disseminates self-help literature with pithy titles such as Reasons to be Hopeful and A Simpler Life, which purport to blend philosophical wisdom with practical advice. Like De Botton himself, the books are Marmite; while many <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/111550/alain-de-botton-school-of-life-how-to">critique the school</a> for peddling watered-down pop philosophy, its teachings have clearly found a market. The organisation has branches in seven major cities, and its most popular title, Big Ideas for Curious Minds, has sold over 120,000 copies globally, while its workshops on playfulness, confidence and self-awareness regularly sell out. The new book represents a departure, however. Through A Voice of One’s Own, The School of Life is showing, rather than telling, its readers how to live better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/07/school-of-life-a-voice-of-ones-own-therapy-novel">Continue reading...</a>

## All hail the smart coat revival – the puffer has finally puffed its last

<p>The padded jacket’s demise is big fashion news this week as brands showcase their autumn collections</p><p>The puffer coat is finally running out of puff. The quilted nylon outerwear that has dominated parks and playgrounds for five winters is set to be challenged by “the return of the smart coat”, according to some of the biggest names on the British high street.<br /><br />John Lewis, who caused uproar by calling time on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/10/john-lewis-declares-death-of-the-floral-midi-dress">the floral midi-length dress</a> in February, is once again leading the charge. “We are moving away from the puffer to the smart coat,” said Queralt Ferrer, fashion director of John Lewis, at a showcase of autumn collections this week. “Tailored coats are more flexible, because they can be dressed up or down – a puffer coat is always casual.”</p><p>A toffee-coloured, clean-lined wool coat with traditional button fastenings from the John Lewis Anyday range will be on sale in September for £68. “We know people are very conscious of budget right now – it is important to show that smart coats can be affordable.”<br /><br />There will still be five puffer coats on the John Lewis shop floor, “just like we still have floral dresses. It is not about cancelling what women want,” noted Ferrer. (John Lewis’s bestselling dress for spring was a floral print – but a bold, abstract graphic rather than a ditsy blossom.)<br /><br />The smart coat revival is also taking off at Boden, where bold tailored outerwear are winter’s scene-stealers. Silhouettes are classic, but styles include a pink and khaki dogstooth and a lemon and camel chessboard check. “We really leaned into our British heritage this season,” says Boden’s womenswear head, Lucy Rosenberg. “It felt the time was right for heritage wools, as well as velvets and cords in bright colours.”<br /><br />H&amp;M Studio, the high street giant’s limited-edition elevated range, which employs Savile Row pattern cutters in an all-female atelier, has made a full-length Italian wool tailored coat with sharp shoulders and a moulded waist a key piece for autumn. “It is constructed to hold a silhouette, not to slouch on to the body,” says H&amp;M’s head of design, Ann-Sofie Johansson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/07/all-hail-the-smart-coat-revival-the-puffer-has-finally-puffed-its-last">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Olive oil brine, which is usually reserved for dirty martinis and the like, takes this zingy, fruity mocktail to another level</p><p>Before we had TikTok dance challenges, we had the Macarena, a four-step dance routine that required little to no effort and could be performed by just about anyone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoUmyY6CQRo">The English vocal track to the song</a> we all know, love and now have stuck in our heads is pretty dirty if you stop dancing for a second to listen to the words: it tells the story of a woman who, bored with her boyfriend, fools around with two of his friends. Well, like music, some of the best cocktails are those that are secretly dirty, too. The hit of savoury from olive brine, which is usually reserved for dirty martinis, takes this mocktail from fruity and sweet to perfectly balanced, while the added science-nerd bonus is that the salt from the brine lowers the freezing point of the juices and makes the drink stingingly cold. It’s perfect for cooling off after an energetic dance.</p><p>This is an edited extract from Saved By the Bellini &amp; Other 90s-Inspired Cocktails, by John deBary, published by Union Square &amp; Co at £12.99.

<p><strong>Home, Manchester<br /></strong>This hugely eloquent show weaves together the awful mystery of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 with the tale of a father’s slide into dementia</p><p>This experimental drama takes us on two mysterious journeys, side by side. Both are meticulously sourced from life and plumbed to their depths. One is of the Malaysia Airlines flight that set off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing with 239 people on board in 2014 and disappeared along its flight path. The other is the psychic voyage of a father’s disappearance into dementia.</p><p>The parallels become more apparent as the German theatre company Rimini Protokoll perform this arresting, meditative piece, co-produced by Manchester international festival. There are lacunae at the centre of both narratives: “Where are you?” and “Where did you go?” are repeated questions in Helgard Haug’s spare yet immensely eloquent script. Around the central fog in both stories are those left behind – witnesses and mourners, from the relatives of those on the flight to Haug herself, as the daughter of her unnamed German father. Metaphysical inquiries around uncertainty and death intersect, leaving lingering mysteries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/07/all-right-good-night-review-home-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

## Unruly Bodies review – grotesque breasts, gaping orifices … but where’s the soul?

<p><strong>Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art, London<br /></strong>A show by 13 women and non-binary artists presents the body as abject, disgusting and objectified – to alienating effect</p><p>Bodies are porous, weird and gross, much as we might try to forget it. Unruly Bodies at Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) reminds us just how grotesque they can be. Working from the assumption that the “unruly” body is implicitly female, Black, disabled, queer or other, the exhibition is made up of work by 13 female and non-binary artists. They examine the ways in which bodies are the site of patriarchy, misogyny, racism and ableism. Bodies are not presented as empowering or reclaimable, but instead as abject, disgusting or objectified. Many of these works seem to want to discard or fundamentally alter the body, rather than embrace its weirdness. The CCA is a remarkably fitting space for this exhibition, given its skeletal, stripped back character. The building almost feels like a dissected, disembowelled body itself.</p><p>The most dramatic work in the show is Giulia Cenci’s series, dry salvages, which fills an entire room. It is a series of body parts cast from aluminium which have been hung from hooks in old shower stalls. Dried vines or clumps of roots descend from some of them, and one is being devoured by the figure of a wolf. It feels like the set of a horror movie, right down to the gallery space itself – the tank that once supplied the Victorian bathhouse which houses the CCA. These pieces of bodies are spooky, but they are also so far removed from living bodies that I found it hard to be horrified by them. Like most of the works here, it reminded me that my experience of living in a body among other bodies is only mine – it is not universal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/07/unruly-bodies-review-goldsmiths-centre-for-contemporary-art-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ex-007 plays a criminal father-in-law in an Adam Sandler-ushered action comedy that misses every time</p><p>Nothing strikes fear in the heart of a film critic more than pressing play on a new comedy and immediately seeing those ominous four words: “A Happy Madison Production”.

## Insidious: The Red Door review – shoddy horror sequel

<p>Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut with a labored legacy sequel that should hopefully close the door on the long-running franchise</p><p>Now in its fifth installment across more than a decade with The Red Door, the Insidious franchise boasts an impressive longevity, albeit in a way more damning than damned. The big horror series prolong their popularity on the strength of a monster (Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers and the rest of the Halloween costume perennials) or a narrative device (the self-inflicted torture of Saw, the Rube Goldberg inevitability of fate in Final Destination), but the Insidious pictures have yielded four windfalls over $100m despite a lack of any distinctive features. The unifying premise for hit factory Blumhouse’s reliable yet reliably uninteresting moneymaker dares viewers to wonder “what if there was a creepy thing that jumped out at you, then disappeared?” The closest it gets to a recurring mascot is a Darth Maul-looking phantom alternately referred to by fans as The Man With Fire In His Face, Lipstick-Face Demon, The Red-Faced Demon, or Sixtass, and in any case, he’s pretty light on charisma.</p><p>The first few chapters benefited hugely from the steady directorial hands of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, genre guys with strong fundamentals who knew how to use the camera to coax every iota of tension from material unremarkable on paper. This time around, star Patrick Wilson takes the reins and reveals just how little has held the property together up to this point. Without innovative blocking and framing, each scene follows a rote repetition as clichés of studio-horror storytelling cue up the oldest scares in the book. Some lumpy mumbling about repression and cycles of generational trauma, a figure appears out of focus in the background, a moment of silence to foster a false sense of security, and then the cinematic equivalent of grabbing someone’s shoulders and screaming “BOO!” in their ear. If these cheap tricks garner a reaction at all, it’s to their suddenness and loudness, a knee-jerk agitation nowhere near as affecting as true, unleaded terror.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/07/insidious-the-red-door-review-shoddy-horror-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

This time around, <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/top-gun-maverick-stunts-behind-the-scenes">rather than feeling the Gs</a> in an F/A-18 Super Hornet, he’s Base jumping off a cliff via a motorbike. (You’d think at some point he might like to have a nice extended sit down in a drawing-room comedy, but no, it seems not.) Cruise’s latest gambit is almost certainly the most heavily trailed stunt in movie history, so central to the marketing of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (in cinemas Monday) that a nine-minute video was released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw">showing exactly how it was done</a>.</p><p>Cruise is not the only one trumpeting his stunty wares. Dead Reckoning is joined in cinemas later this month by Oppenheimer, a film for which the notoriously visual effects-averse Christopher Nolan elected to recreate a nuclear explosion, rather than resort to CGI.

The dad jacket was an unforeseen necessity: 10pm in an open space in Brighton starts to feel less park, more parky.</p><p>And yet, there’s something charming about the city’s annual Comedy Garden, an outdoor event big enough to resemble a summer festival, and small enough not to need large screens beaming the performance to the cheap seats.

<p>Sausages up 31%, burgers up 64% … add your favourite foods to our visual tool to see how inflation has pushed up the price in the past five years</p><p>One of the biggest drivers behind the cost of the British barbecue is meat.

<p>The inn is doing a nifty dance, luring in the gastropub crowd without scaring off people who just want cod and chips</p><p><a href="https://theksi.co.uk/">The Kirkstyle Inn</a>, owned by industry veteran Nick Parkinson, is a gorgeously refurbished, 40-seater restaurant in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/slaggyford/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487da933e605d119:0x1e965fab4bb3f5c7?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV196Dx-j_AhW6T0EAHYsfBVMQ8gF6BAgMEAA&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV196Dx-j_AhW6T0EAHYsfBVMQ8gF6BAgQEAE">Slaggyford</a>, Northumberland. I’ll grant you, there are less alluring British placenames than Slaggyford, but you’ll be hard pushed to find them. You’ll also be hard pushed to find Slaggyford itself, because it’s set in the South Tyne valley, in what’s officially Northumberland, but sort of also on the edge of Cumbria, and along a remote lane that will make your satnav go “<a href="https://youtu.be/G2DCExerOsA">wibble</a>”.</p><p>Slaggyford and the whole of the North Pennines are the British countryside at its most beautiful. It’s lush, green, unpopulated and largely unvisited, because its purpose to tourists is unclear. All the pretty lakes and the shops selling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Jemima_Puddle-Duck">Jemima Puddleduck</a> figurines have given way to brooding stone circles and “jam for sale – leave money in box” signs. As a child in Cumbria, one of our most exciting days out over this way involved an ascent by car over <a href="https://www.visitcumbria.com/evnp/hartside-pass/#google_vignette">Hartside Pass</a>, a long, steep climb – pure Game of Thrones stuff. The cafe at the top sold rock buns, which was the peak of excitement, until one day it burned down and that was that. If Slaggyford feels like an odd place for Parkinson, son of Michael Parkinson (yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac0CJn0-6tE">Parky</a>), to set up shop, bringing his 50 years of hospitality experience, well, yes, it is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/07/kirkstyle-inn-slaggyford-northumberland-grace-dent-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

We don’t go out as much these days – we’ve a three-month-old baby to attend to – and so drinking cocktails in the garden is about as wild as it gets around here. Bottles of Suze and shakers appear on the worktop around 7pm, and if we’re lucky, the baby’s down around the same time a white negroni is plonked on the makeshift table outside.</p><p>The more his barkeeping skills advance, the worse mine become. I’m now barely aware of what’s in the fridge, and tend to invite guests to sort themselves out if I’m hosting them alone. But what I can offer are garnishes in the form of edible flowers – one of the great magic tricks of the garden at this time of year. They often have heartier flavours than their appearance might suggest, offering a hint of pepper (nasturtium) or spice (pinks) to an aperitif.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/07/blooming-tasty-garden-flowers-for-a-perfect-summer-cocktail">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Half a million Duolingo users are currently learning High Valyrian. But how do you make a language out of nothing? The linguists behind top fantasy TV shows and films explain</p><p>If a language offers clues to the culture of its speakers, then the experience of learning Game of Thrones’s High Valyrian on Duolingo conjures visions of a bustling historic civilisation in which owls stalk the skies, magic abounds, and the spectre of death forever haunts the imaginations of the living. You learn to say “The woman is sweating” before that most basic greeting, “Hello”. An incongruously cheerful cartoon asks you to translate “All men must die, goodbye.” And, of course: “Ñuhyz zaldrīzesse gevī issi.” (“My dragons are beautiful!”).</p><p>Described in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/george-rr-martin">George RR Martin’s books</a> as the language of the dragon-taming rulers of a once-great empire, Old Valyria has been compared to the Roman Republic, and High Valyrian to classical Latin. The language only assumed full life when linguist David J Peterson took it on for season three of the television series in 2012. Working from the few High Valyrian phrases mentioned in the book – names, places, and the infamous strapline, “Valar Morghūlis” (“All men must die”) – Peterson created an entire language.

<p>Mixing hazy ambience, gothic country, doom metal, and post-rock Preacher’s Daughter made this Baptist-raised trans woman an unlikely mainstream star. But with fame comes the downside of giving so much of herself on social media</p><p>A few weeks ago, Hayden Anhedönia fainted mid-show. The 25-year-old songwriter and musician, who in the past year and a half has found sudden fame under the stage name Ethel Cain, was performing at the Sydney Opera House. Halfway through the fan-favourite A House in Nebraska, she realised something was wrong. “Every time I belted, I felt a little bit dizzier,” she recalls. “Right as I was going into the second chorus, I was like: ‘<em>Here we go</em>.’” And then: lights out.</p><p>The Pittsburgh-based Anhedönia stresses that the incident was “nothing serious … I’m used to being alone in a quiet, isolated environment – I’m kind of a low-energy, low-vibration, low-stamina person to begin with – so let’s just say I’m very out of shape,” she says. But the incident sent a ripple through her huge fanbase, who had begun tweeting and posting footage shortly after it happened. “I kind of just sat in a room for six years making music, and then suddenly I was on the road all the time,” she says. “Usually I’m able to, like, grip the mic stand and kind of push through, but Sydney night two, it was like, ‘Nope, you flew too close to the sun with that one.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/07/ethel-cain-preachers-daughter-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Ghostly International)</strong><br />Recorded both before and after the death of a friend and collaborator, the US singer-songwriter’s new album feels as though it sits outside time and space</p><p>The US singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/julie-byrne-on-death-of-musical-partner-eric-littmann">Julie Byrne</a> recorded her third album amid a seismic life event: the death of her collaborator, friend and one-time lover Eric Littmann at the age of 31, while they were making The Greater Wings. With lyrics written before but the music finished after, its drifting, drumless songs seem to wander a bardo between this life and another.</p><p>Attuned to sun, moon and sky as she moves, Byrne deeply communes with herself and others. Whether singing about Littmann or any other human connection she’s made, she vividly conjures the vestigial feeling of someone gone, either to death or mere departure – a sense-memory so strong it becomes a physical encounter. “You are the family that I chose”, “Be with me now as the sun rises its flare” – these and so many others are heart-stopping statements of love. Sexual desire, itself a state of need and loss, suffuses the album, too: “That night at the old hotel / I’d been learning you by heart” is erotic and romantic all at once.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/07/julie-byrne-the-greater-wings-review-ghostly-international">Continue reading...</a>

There are many stunning ones here. On Queen of the Heather, Méabh Meir’s vocals, captured in her mother’s kitchen, are spectral, deep and misty. The brilliant Nell Ní Chroinín may remind some listeners of early Joanna Newsom, although her voice is less mannered, her delivery suggesting surprising extra textures to sadness and longing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/07/a-collection-of-songs-in-the-traditional-sean-nos-style-review-gaelic-nyahh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fantastical and the familiar merge in this energetic inquiry into class politics and cultural capital</p><p>It is 2024. In a city known simply as “the international capital”, writer Corey Fah’s life has taken a swerve. At a public online event, they have been declared the £10,000 winner of the Fictionalisation of Social Evils award for their “MIND-BENDING” debut novel. Sitting with their partner in a one-bed flat on a 1960s social housing estate that is overrun with knotweed and boasts a single shop selling stationery, toiletries, guns and meat, Corey can hardly believe it. “I’d not won an award before, and neither had anybody I knew.”</p><p>In 2021 at a public online event, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/19/isabel-waidner-different-doesnt-need-to-be-scary-it-can-be-fun" title="">Isabel Waidner</a> was announced the winner of the Goldsmiths prize for their third novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/15/sterling-karat-gold-by-isabel-waidner-review-subversive-satire" title="">Sterling Karat Gold</a>.

Because of lockdown, however, the Goldsmiths art department was closed, so no one was able to make the usual customised trophy. Waidner received the £10,000 prize money on its own. Corey Fah is less fortunate. They will only get the money if they can track down the missing trophy themselves. “Do it quickly,” the prize coordinator says, “before the judges change their minds.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/07/corey-fah-does-social-mobility-by-isabel-waidner-review-a-surreal-journey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many of those who drowned near Greece last month were escaping environmental crises in Pakistan. Across the world there is far worse to come</p><p>Before the Adriana, an overcrowded fishing trawler, left Libya on 9 June, Sajjad Yousef spoke to his father. His family had begged him not to make the treacherous journey from Pakistan to Europe. But Yousef wouldn’t listen. He wanted to leave the desolation of life in Pakistan far, far behind. It was hard, the journey would be rough, he knew that. His family had taken out loans in the millions of rupees to buy him space on that teeming trawler, and Yousef was ready to take his chance.</p><p>Most of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/scores-drown-refugee-boat-sinks-off-greece">750 people on board</a> the trawler were Pakistani. They were migrants, fleeing poverty and lack of opportunity but also the ravages of the climate emergency, which is felt acutely in Pakistan. The men and women who risked their lives on the Mediterranean were escaping floods, droughts, glacial melt, crop damage and locust plagues, all of which Pakistan has suffered in recent years. It is a cruel fate to endure disaster after disaster; they were once described as “biblical” but have since become mundane, everyday occurrences.</p><p>Fatima Bhutto, the author of books including The Runaways and New Kings of the World, is currently teaching a class on <a href="https://www.theshipmanagency.com/classes/uj154m2baly1u9nwmg539xt694ovuu">how to write about climate issues</a></p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>The journalist’s new book argues that men don’t share their problems. But modern masculinity is increasingly about opening up</p><p>It was a sudden death that brought my old friends together, and in retrospect maybe that unlocked something. We hadn’t seen each other for years but the morning after the wake, it all came tumbling out over breakfast: worries about parents getting older, teenage kids, toxic bosses, career frustrations. Doubts were confessed, advice sought. It’s the stuff of female friendship down the ages, but the reason it stuck in my mind is that everyone round the table bar me was a man, and these definitely weren’t the conversations we used to have in the pub after work back in our 20s.</p><p>In both private and public life, so much of men’s once suppressed interior lives now seems to be rising to the surface.

<p>The biggest assault on the West Bank in 20 years could herald a new phase of this old conflict, reports Bethan McKernan from Jenin</p><p>When the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, <strong>Bethan McKernan</strong>,<strong> </strong>received the news on Monday that a large raid had begun at the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, she scrambled for her flak jacket and headed across the border to the city. She found tyres burning, teargas, explosions and gunfire – the biggest Israeli attack on the West Bank in 20 years was under way.</p><p>As McKernan tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the Israeli forces pulled out on Tuesday night declaring the mission a success. Twelve Palestinians were killed, four of whom were under the age of 18. On top of the grief, the destruction left behind will take years to recover from. There is intense anger at the Israelis but also at the Palestinian Authority that runs the West Bank.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/07/raid-jenin-future-israel-palestine-west-bank">Continue reading...</a>
