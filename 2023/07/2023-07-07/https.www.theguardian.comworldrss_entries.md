<p>Robert Halfon says government cannot promise to accept pay review body recommendation, as NEU members strike again</p><p>Good morning. Teachers in England are on strike again today and Keir Starmer will shortly be holding his regular LBC phone-in where he is bound to be asked what Labour would do to end the dispute. In his Q&amp;A with journalists yesterday, he had what sounded like a reasonably good answer – keep negotiating every day until there is a deal – but it was an answer that obscured how far he might go to actually get a deal.</p><p>It has been reported that the pay review body will recommend <a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/pay-review-body-recommends-6-5-rise-for-teachers/">a 6.5% pay rise for teachers for 2023-24</a>. This morning <strong>Mary Bousted</strong>, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), told the Today programme that, if the government were to accept that, and if schools were to get the funding to pay that (without having to make cuts elsewhere), teachers would accept.</p><p>The message from the government is that we have to be as fair as possible, given the very difficult economic circumstances — don’t forget we still have £2 trillion in debt partly caused because of the £400 billion spent on Covid, we’ve got the billions of pounds that are being spent on helping people with the cost of living and reducing energy bills.</p><p>We have to be as fair as possible to teachers and support staff, I completely get that. But we have to be fair to the taxpayer and make sure we bear down on inflation as well, as that is the biggest tax on the cost of living — that would effect everyone, teachers and support staff included.</p><p>You are asking what is impossible to say at this point in time. The pay review bodies will publish, the government will make its decision in due course.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/07/teachers-strike-england-pay-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>
