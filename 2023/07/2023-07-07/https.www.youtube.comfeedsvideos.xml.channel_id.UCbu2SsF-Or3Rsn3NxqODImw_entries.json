While the result can often be fantastic, highly polished, and lavishly created gaming experiences, they do often do so with the sacrifice of trying new ideas that push the medium forward. Instead, that responsibility is shouldered by indie developers.\n\nOn this week's episode of Spot On, Tamoor is joined by Kurt to talk about whether enough is being done by big companies to ensure that the video game space is kept fresh with new ideas. They also discuss development teams that have taken risks in the past and had a major impact on the way we make and play games.\n\nSpot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOrSzdZbClE", "date_published": "2023-07-07T20:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
