  <p id="oLkcOL">Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence and fines of around $1.2 million (or 173 million yen) after he was found guilty of insider trading, <a href="https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2023070700144">according to a report from Japanese news outlet <em>Jiji</em></a> (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777423/sonic-the-hedhog-creator-yuji-naka-prison-sentence-insider-trading">via <em>Polygon</em></a>). While the court handed out a 2.5-year prison sentence, <em>Jiji</em> reports that it was suspended by four years.</p>
<p id="D6Dl5G">That means Naka shouldn’t wind up behind bars anytime soon, as judges typically waive the prison sentence if the defendant doesn’t commit any additional crimes during that period of time. Naka was arrested twice last year for his involvement in two separate insider trading incidents, both of which took place in 2020 when Naka was working at Square Enix. </p>

<p id="yB6GnZ">The additional scrutiny, negativity, and integrity risks that come with politics and hard news aren’t worth the “incremental engagement or revenue,” Mosseri wrote. “There are more than enough amazing communities — sports, music, fashion, beauty, entertainment, etc. — to make a vibrant platform without needing to get into politics or hard news.” (Mosseri’s strong point of view here is likely informed by his time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17902926/new-instagram-head-adam-mosseri-facebook-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-departure">running Facebook’s News Feed</a>.)</p>

However, instead of linking to the advertiser’s website, the busted ads link to <a href="http://Twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> and have “DPA_Placeholder” as the heading for the link. In advertising, DPA stands for “dynamic product ads,” which suggests there might be an issue affecting Twitter’s ability to display the right ads.</p>

They’re repackaging their shampoo and conditioner and lecturing you about “editing” your wardrobe. They’re explaining that you should <em>roll</em> your clothes, not fold them, to save space.

  <p id="YkAw5p">Many communities on Reddit have used the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) designation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767098/reddit-subreddits-porn-protest">in some form</a> to protest Reddit’s new API pricing, which forced apps like Apollo and rif is fun for Reddit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest">to shut down</a>, as well as a recent pattern of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14bwfai/moderators_voice_concerns_over_reddits/">behavior</a> toward its unpaid volunteer moderators that they find “threatening.” Subreddits, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/">r/PICS</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/">r/military</a>, had made the NSFW switch, pointing to language from Reddit websites to justify the change.</p>
<p id="xijvXg">The moderators of the r/military community said they switched their label to NSFW because “military content has a chance to be violent content” and argued that “this subreddit should have been NSFW already, but we’d never thought to change it until recently,” according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/14s9o8q/follow_up_on_next_chapter_of_rmilitary/">a public post on Thursday</a>. </p>
