When the weather's good we've been doing a lot of\nevening picnics at the beach.  It's not too crowded (making parking\neasier), there's less direct sun (don't need to deal with\nsunscreen), and it doesn't conflict with the toddler's nap time.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nOften we go to <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/locations/mystic-lakes-state-park\">Shannon\nBeach</a> (\"Sandy Beach\"), on the Mystic Lakes:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shannon-beach-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shannon-beach.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThey test bacteria levels, and when they get high they close the\nbeach.  Check the <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/dcr-park-alerts\">DCR Alerts\nPage</a> before going.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is the closer option for us, but when it's closed we often go <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revere_Beach\">Revere Beach</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/revere-beach-digging-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/revere-beach-digging.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is on the ocean, but it's sheltered enough that waves are\ntypically just a few inches.  It's also colder: I'll swim at Sandy\nBeach, especially in the late summer, but I'd need to go hundreds of\nmiles south of Boston if I wanted ocean water that didn't chill me too\nquickly to be fun.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBoth have free parking, and Revere Beach is on the Blue Line.\nNeither have lifeguards: at Sandy Beach there are ropes that keep the\nolder two within an area they can easily touch and we stay close to\nthe toddler; at Revere Beach if they want to go past their knees they\nneed an adult with them.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe older two often want to eat quickly just before leaving or in the\ncar because (a) they prefer hot food and (b) they want to play the\nwhole time we're there.  But it's still important to them that the\ntrip be a picnic, and Julia and I enjoy eating on the beach.
