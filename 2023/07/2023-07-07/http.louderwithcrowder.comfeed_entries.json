Carlson sat down <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v2yn47a-live-tucker-carlson-world-first-interview-since-leaving-fox-163-stay-free-w.html\" target=\"_blank\">for an EXCLUSIVE interview on Rumble</a> with host Russell Brand.</p><p>The political world was shocked when news broke in April that the news network fired its #1 star out of the blue. No one was more surprised by it than Tucker Carlson.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1677357485404090370\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I didn't expect to get fired that morning at all. So I was shocked.... but wasn't really shocked. I wasn't mad. I don't know why I was fired. I really don't. I'm not angry about it. You can believe me or not, but I think you can feel that I'm not. I wish Fox well.</blockquote><p>Everyone has their theories. His biographer says it was a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-biographer-shares-reason\" target=\"_blank\">combination of a planned January 6th monologue and the Dominion lawsuit</a>. Alex Jones <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-vanity-fair-show\" target=\"_blank\">said on our show</a> that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/04/tucker-carlson-fox-news-rupert-murdoch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the <em>Vanity Fair</em> story was closest to the truth</a>. That was where (and I'm oversimplifying) Tucker was having dinner with Rupert Murdoch and his fiance. Tucker talked about how much he loved God. Rupert's fiance agreed that she loved both God AND Tucker. Atheist Rupert Murdoch who is freaked out by religious talk... freaked out. He dumped his fiance, and Carlson suddenly no longer has a home at Fox News.</p><p>Tucker, to no one's surprise, didn't confirm any of it. Not when there is a tens of millions of dollar buy-out on the table. He seemed at peace with everything. There was only one thing that bothered him:</p><p>The only thing that bothers me is that I'm 54, and when you get a little bit older you could lose your drive. My only concern is that I've been a little too happy [and not engaged]. Live has got to be much more than that.\"</p><p>Rumors are Carlson is at work behind the scenes to launch a new media venture. </p><p><br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Stanford University announced they were teaching a class on Taylor Swift lyrics -- <a href=\"https://redstate.com/jerrywilson/2023/07/06/stanford-university-to-offer-course-on-taylor-swifts-lyrics-no-really-n771789\" target=\"_blank\">the prestigious Stanford University</a> -- would be the silliest T.

Then <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-has-reflected-on-metoo-groping-allegations-video\" target=\"_blank\">Justin \"I Feel Pretty\" Trudeau</a> came along fangirling on Twitter.</p><p>The pop star is embarked on a massive world tour. And in all sincerity, shout out <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/buzzfeed-trashes-taylor-swift-among-things-white\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift</a> for it. She's gonna <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/04/taylor-swift-eras-tour-set-to-earn-record-breaking-1-billion-dollars-in-sales.html\" target=\"_blank\">gross a billion dollars this year </a>doing marathon 4+ hours concerts. She's this generation's Springsteen (I mean that in a good way). Canada's walking pile of soy and hair goop wants a taste of the revenue. I'd normally chalk this up to a social media intern. But you know he wrote this himself ad he anxiously waited for his copy of <em>Speak Now (Taylor's Version)</em>.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1676761275483734020\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Look, I try to stay in a state of grace about things and I know we have bad blood with I.F.P. Trudeau. Frequent visitors to the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website know all too well that Trudeau is not the man. But dude, you need to calm down. And look what you made me do! I had to resort to Taylor Swift puns to make my point.</p><p>This is literally Justin Trudeau right now:</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cStanford University is offering a class on Taylor Swift lyrics, and I hope all of these incoming freshmen know Joe Biden can't bail out their student loans anymore...\\u201d</div> \u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@Louder with Crowder Dot Com)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1676980889354379266\">1688658375</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trudeau could not look any more pathetic if he started using \"band-aids don't fix bullet holes\" as his <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-tells-canadians\" target=\"_blank\">slogan to strip Canadians of their right to self-defense</a>. A point his fellow countrymen were quick to hammer him on.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1676822120314322944\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlumberAlberta/status/1676802602980478982\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatKanada_TM/status/1676817444898508802\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless this is all the beginning of an evil plan by Trudeau, who is also a fangirl of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Ticket prices are so silly for Taylor that you almost have to mortgage your house. Taylor comes to Canada. Trudeau has the Canadian government buy the homes so people can afford tickets. Then he can control citizens by turning them into a permanent renters class since the agenda for the WEF is for you to own nothing and like it.</p><p>Either that, or I.F.P. Trudeau has his \"Eras Tour\" outfit planned and he needs an excuse to wear it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
