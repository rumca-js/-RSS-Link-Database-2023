Yanni Ouahioune, 22, was handed the sentence on Monday in Paris following his call to authorities about a fake hostage situation in November 2020.</p><p>Police say Ouahioune called in the hoax because he was angry he had been banned several times from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-rainbow-six-mobile-announcement-130047665.html\"><em>Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege</em></a>. In response to the bogus call, a heavily armed squad of police officers surrounded the building. The officers secured the headquarters \u2014 and closed several nearby streets \u2014 before confirming there wasn\u2019t an active threat. Ouahioune allegedly called from his parents\u2019 house using Russian servers to mask his identity (unsuccessfully).

The convicted hoaxer will reportedly be required to \u201ccompensate victims, undergo treatment for a mental health problem and either work or undergo training\u201d in addition to the community service.</p><p>Magali Valence, Ubisoft director of external communication for Ubisoft Montreal, told <em>The Montreal Gazette</em> in an email that it acknowledges the court\u2019s decision. \u201cIn this trial we were committed to representing the interests of our employees who were affected by this false hostage-taking alert at our Montreal studio. It was important for us to denounce this violent and unacceptable incident. Out of respect for our employees who were affected by this event, we will not comment further.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/miffed-rainbow-six-seige-player-sentenced-for-swatting-ubisoft-montreals-offices-201200746.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/miffed-rainbow-six-seige-player-sentenced-for-swatting-ubisoft-montreals-offices-201200746.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T20:12:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate $1 deal is back for new users", "description": "<p>Microsoft might be raising the price of Xbox subscriptions <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-increasing-xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-prices-in-most-countries-182635680.html\">in most countries</a>, but it's sweetening the deal for newcomers.

The Saskatchewan-based judge made the ruling on the grounds that the courts must adapt to the \u201cnew reality\u201d of how people communicate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/06/canada-judge-thumbs-up-emoji-sign-contract\"><ins>as originally reported by </ins><em><ins>The Guardian.</ins></em></a></p><p>The case involved a grain buyer sending out a mass text to drum up clients and a farmer agreeing to sell 86 tons of flax for around $13 per bushel. The buyer texted a contract agreement to the farmer and asked for the farmer to \u201cconfirm\u201d receiving the contract. He issued a thumb\u2019s up emoji as receipt of the document, but backed out of the deal after flax prices increased.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The buyer sued the farmer, arguing that the thumb\u2019s up represented more than just receipt of the contract. It represented an agreement to the conditions of the contract, and a judge agreed, ordering the farmer to cough up nearly $62,000, likely causing a string of puke emojis.</p><p>The farmer, Chris Achter, said in an affidavit that he \u201cdid not have time to review\u201d the contract and the thumb\u2019s up was just acknowledgment of receipt. Justice Timothy Keene relied on <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/thumbs-up-emoji/\"><ins>Dictionary.com\u2019s definition of the emoji</ins></a> which notes the image is used to \u201cexpress assent, approval, or encouragement in digital communications, especially in Western cultures,\u201d ultimately siding with the grain buyer.</p><p>\u201cThis court readily acknowledges that a \ud83d\udc4d emoji is a non-traditional means to \u2018sign\u2019 a document but nevertheless under these circumstances this was a valid way to convey the two purposes of a \u2018signature\u2019,\u201d Justice Keene wrote.</p><p>The defense argued that giving this type of power to an emoji would open the \u201cfloodgates\u201d to enhanced interpretations of other emojis.

The two teams examined every aspect of the LP12 but couldn't change the turntable very much owing to concerns over impact to the sound quality. Still, LoveFrom &quot;saw a number of areas where there could be small improvements and gentle evolutions of the current design,&quot; Ive said.</p><p>The exterior of the special-edition Sondek LP12-50 looks largely the same as the standard LP12, though the tweaks include rounded off corners for some components rather than squared-off edges. There's a circular aluminum power button instead of a plastic rocker, while a new hinge seemingly enables the dust cover to easily remain open at any angle.</p><p>If you're interested in owning the first post-Apple hardware that Ive worked on, you'll have to dig deep into your pockets. <a href=\"https://www.linn.co.uk/ca/turntables/lp12-50\">The Sondek LP12-50 costs $60,000</a> and Linn is only making 250 of them.</p><p>At least for this project, Ive has moved on from digital audio hardware to an analog product.

Compared with other would-be Twitter challengers, Threads has absolutely exploded. By the morning after its launch, the Instagram offshoot had already attracted more than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/threads-gained-10-million-new-users-in-seven-hours-090838140.html\">30 million</a> new sign-ups, according to Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>The momentum seems to have spooked Elon Musk, whose personal lawyer has reportedly threatened <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-threatens-to-sue-meta-over-the-new-threads-app-191141961.html\">to sue</a> Meta over unspecified \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d But while the Meta vs. Twitter rivalry continues to play out, there are still some major questions about the new platform and how Meta intends to run it.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Why the relentless focus on brands and influencers?</h2><p>It\u2019s no secret that Meta began testing Threads with a relatively small group of creators and celebrities ahead of its official launch. The group provided some early feedback to the company, and helped ensure that when the floodgates did eventually open, new users were greeted with more than an empty feed.</p><p>The ploy worked. New Threads users found a lively feed filled with posts upon joining. But it\u2019s also led to the main feed feeling a bit\u2026 underwhelming. Finding posts from friends, particularly recent posts, can be difficult as the current feed algorithm seems to heavily favor influencers, celebrities, brands and other higher profile accounts. Which leads us to..</p><h2>What about a non-algorithmic feed?</h2><p>If you know anything about Twitter, it\u2019s that the original, reverse chronological feed is sacred to many longtime users. The same is true in some corners of Instagram, which <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-chronological-feed-is-back-150050596.html\">brought back</a> its chronological feed last year following a five-year hiatus.</p><p>So it can feel a bit jarring that Threads currently has a single algorithmic feed that seems to lean quite heavily on recommended posts from accounts you\u2019re not already following. Not only is there no chronological feed, but there\u2019s no way to view a feed of posts from only accounts you follow (though some have devised <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/thread-people-you-follow-feed\">a workaround</a> by messing with the app\u2019s notification settings.)</p><p>Both Instagram head Adam Mosseri and Zuckerberg have since said that a \u201cfollowing\u201d feed \u2014 that is a feed dedicated solely to accounts you follow \u2014 is in the works. Mosseri also <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/t/CuYvSTItD5L\">confirmed</a> there would be a chronological option. That should help address the <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2023/07/threads-app-meta-review-twitter-musk-facebook-winner.html\">\u201cgarbage hose\u201d</a> problem, as <em>Slate\u2019s</em> Alex Kirshner described the current algorithmic feed.</p><h2>How will Threads tie into the broader Fediverse?</h2><p>One of the more intriguing aspects of Threads is Meta\u2019s promise to integrate ActivityPub, the open-source protocol that powers Mastodon and other decentralized platforms that make up the \u201cFediverse.\u201d</p><p>Mosseri told <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor\"><em>The Verge</em></a> that Threads launched without ActivityPub due to the complexity involved. \u201cIt requires a bunch more work,\u201d he said. But the company seems committed to the idea.</p><p>In its announcement, the company suggested it was all-in on the open standard, and what it represents for the future of social networks. \u201cOur vision is that people using compatible apps will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era of diverse and interconnected networks,\u201d Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/\">wrote</a>.</p><p>But the prospect of eventual Fediverse integration raises all kinds of new questions as well. How will the app, which is currently an offshoot of Instagram, handle interoperability with other federated platforms? Right now, Threads requires an Instagram account, which is neither decentralized or open-source, much less compatible with ActivityPub. Users can\u2019t even delete their Threads account without also deleting their Instagram. So how will Threads users take their audience with them if they decide to leave? (Even on Mastodon, <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/\">the process</a> is far from simple.)</p><p>How will people on the thousands of Mastodon servers view and interact with posts on Threads? Mastodon CEO Eugen Rochko <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/\">has suggested</a> it will be up to individual server admins to enable compatibility, but it\u2019s still far from clear how this functionality would work. And that doesn\u2019t address what might be possible on other platforms that pledged to support ActivityPub, like Tumblr and Flipboard, which may be less enthused about their platforms\u2019 content being accessible a Meta-owned service.</p><p>Fediverse support also raises all kinds of questions about content moderation. Officially, Threads has the same community guidelines as Instagram, but federated platforms are free to set their own standards and norms. How will Meta keep content from other platforms that goes against its rules from Threads once posts are interoperable?</p><h2>What about content moderation?</h2><p>Speaking of content moderation, Meta hasn\u2019t really addressed how it plans to scale its content moderation operation to handle the sudden influx of new users to a brand new platform. Up to now, the company has been clear that Instagram\u2019s existing community guidelines apply on Threads and that it\u2019s hoping to foster a more \u201cpositive\u201d environment.</p><p>But it\u2019s unclear how the company is handling enforcement internally. And as much as Meta execs try to emphasize the good vibes, history has taught us that where there are millions of users there will inevitably be bad actors spreading hate speech, misinformation and all the familiar ills of giant social media platforms.</p><p>For now, it seems like Threads is largely relying on Instagram\u2019s moderation infrastructure. For example, the app will warn you before attempting to follow a user that\u2019s repeatedly shared misinformation. The company is also pushing users to carry over their block, restrict and word filtering settings from Instagram. But with more than <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23786108/threads-internal-activity-data-exclusive-instagram-meta\">95 million posts</a> on its first day of existence, Threads will at some point likely need its own moderation resources.</p><h2>Where are all the... other features?</h2><p>More immediately, the most pressing question for most Threads users is when Meta will start adding a bunch of basic features that could make Threads more functionally like Twitter and other services. For now, many have raised the absence of a number of basic capabilities.</p><p>Direct Messages: Unlike Twitter and Instagram, Threads has no private messaging. And so far, it\u2019s unclear if that could change. Mosseri seems <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor\">cautious</a> about the idea, telling <em>The Verge</em> he was hesitant to contribute to \u201cinbox fatigue.\u201d</p><p>Web interface: For a lot of Twitter power users, one of the more frustrating aspects of Threads is the lack of a proper web interface. For now, you can manually view Threads posts by navigating to user\u2019s public profiles, but there\u2019s no way to view your feed or interact with posts. Here, again, Mosseri says that\u2019s in the works. \u201cThe priority is the mobile apps, but we are working on www,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/t/CuWp3eMNE8h/\">wrote</a>.</p><p>Search and hashtags: While Threads makes it easy enough to find people from your existing social graph, Threads doesn\u2019t allow you to search posts or even use basic filtering tools like hashtags.</p><p>Accessibility: Unfortunately, as with so many other new platforms, Threads so far has ignored some basic accessibility features. There\u2019s no support for alt text for photos, for example, which feels like a pretty glaring omission given Threads ties to Instagram.</p><p>Ads: Most users (brands, aside) probably aren\u2019t clamoring for ads in their new feeds. But the launch of Threads has prompted questions about what Meta\u2019s eventual plan for advertising is. According to Zuckerberg, the ads won\u2019t be coming any time soon. \u201cOur approach will be the same as all our other products: make the product work well first, then see if we can get it on a clear path to 1 billion people, and only then think about monetization at that point,\u201d he wrote on Threads.</p><p>While we don\u2019t know exactly which features Meta is prioritizing first, it seems safe to say we won\u2019t have to wait too long for at least some of these features. One advantage Threads has over many of its upstart competitors is that Meta has infinitely more engineers it can dedicate to these issues. And new features will be key if the company wants Threads to be a long term success and not just a novelty.</p><p><strong>Update July 7th, 2023, 9:05 AM PT: </strong>This story has been updated to note Adam Mosseri confirmed the company is working on a chronological feed for Threads.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/all-the-questions-we-still-have-about-threads-153059430.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/all-the-questions-we-still-have-about-threads-153059430.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T15:30:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best early Prime Day deals for 2023", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/\">Amazon Prime Day 2023</a> is a few days away on July 11th, but you don't have to wait until then to get a good deal.

If nothing else, this deal makes it easier to figure out if it's worth paying for.&nbsp;</p><h2>Audible Premium Plus 3-month membership</h2><p></p><p>Similar to that Kindle Unlimited offer, Prime members who are new to <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9oei9hdWRpYmxlL21scC9tZW1iZXJzaGlwL3ByZW1pdW1wbHVzL21vbnRobHkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE0YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZpqgGCWvNcQw7ZFmuj-8XcFALCFtgJTwYa2OFHsZ9bU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Fmlp%2Fmembership%2Fpremiumplus%2Fmonthly%2F\">Audible Premium Plus</a> can get three months of the audiobook service for free. This membership usually costs $14.95 a month after a 30-day free trial, so you're saving about $30. Premium Plus is Audible's <a href=\"https://help.audible.com/s/article/what-is-included-in-audible-membership-plans?language=en_US\">upper tier</a>: Like the less expensive Audible Plus, it provides an assortment of audiobooks, podcasts and other audio content you can access on-demand. The main difference is that it also includes a monthly credit that you can use to buy any book in the Audible store permanently. As with Kindle Unlimited, Premium Plus will be most worth it if you burn through audiobooks and podcasts quickly, but this extended trial is a comfier way to see if it's useful. Again, be aware that the subscription will be set to auto-renew by default.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Dot</h2><p></p><p>Amazon has knocked the latest <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJGODcxU1pDLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xNGEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc5MTdjMjJhLTc4ODktNGMzMi1hMmQ5LTk1YWFjZGExZDIxMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXiJgRsE_gETR4Epf_fPtWK9jCodggZ58UiZeoH_86ON&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BF871SZC%2F\">Echo Dot</a> down to $23, which is roughly half off its typical street price, and is throwing in a Sengled color smart bulb for no extra cost.

These early machines will include safety drivers.</p><p>The German brand plans to both expand its Austin fleet and grow testing to &quot;at least&quot; four more US cities. If all goes well, VW will launch commercial self-driving service in Austin by 2026. It will court third parties, too, by offering fleets of driverless ID.Buzz EVs to other mobility and transportation companies. The company also expects to employ people who previously worked with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/autonomous-vehicle-startup-argo-ai-shutting-down-203250200.html\">defunct autonomous driving startup</a> Argo AI.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The deployment isn't surprising. Although Ford shuttered Argo to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-ceo-farley-explains-the-business-factors-behind-argo-a-is-shutering-230035350.html\">focus on semi-autonomous features</a> in the short term, full self-driving remains a hot category in the US.

It's adapting to an era where ridesharing and robotaxis will reduce the need for personal car ownership. Ride hailing and fleet deals could help VW thrive even if its car sales decline over time. Of course, that depends on driverless tech being ready in a timely fashion. Level 3 autonomy (hands-off motoring where the driver must be ready to take control) is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-becomes-the-first-automaker-to-sell-level-3-self-driving-vehicles-in-california-103504319.html\">only just reaching passenger cars</a> in the US, and then only in limited circumstances. It could be a while before these platforms are advanced enough that autonomous taxis are practical on a large scale.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vw-will-start-testing-self-driving-cars-in-the-us-this-month-135125310.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/vw-will-start-testing-self-driving-cars-in-the-us-this-month-135125310.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T13:51:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple may launch the Vision Pro headset with appointment-only sales", "description": "<p>Apple is planning to roll out its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html\">$3,500 Vision Pro</a> headset gradually, starting in the US with appointments for demos in designated Apple Store areas, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-07/apple-vision-pro-headset-to-launch-in-us-stores-by-appointment\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s Mark Gurman. The gradual rollout is in line with the &quot;niche and complex nature&quot; of the mixed reality headset, and resembles what Apple originally did with the Watch <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-10-apple-watch-shop-london.html\">when it launched</a> in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple will require appointments to try and buy the Vision Pro, much as it did with the Apple Watch, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It will also ask potential buyers to provide their eyeglass prescriptions. Special areas will be created in stores that offer demo Vision Pro devices, seating and tools to size accessories.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The primary aim is to make sure that customers leave with a headset that fits correctly and gives them a clear view. It has even developed an iPhone app and physical machine that will scan your head to ensure a tight seal that keeps light out. Apple may also be working on a second strap that will make the headset more comfortable for people with smaller heads.&nbsp;</p><p>Vision Pro demo spaces will only be available at Stores in major US markets like New York and Los Angeles to start with, before eventually rolling out across the US. It will come to other countries at the end of 2024, possible starting with the UK and Canada, followed by Europe and Asia soon after.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vision Pro is Apple's most important product in years, but also one of the most complex devices it has ever built. It's also much more expensive than other consumer VR headsets. To that end, Apple is no doubt counting on the Vision Pro to get mainstream consumers excited about the idea of mixed reality.</p><p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html\">hands-on preview</a>, we found that the device delivered an awesome experience, offering an &quot;unparalleled sense of immersion, with displays sharp enough to read text on websites, plus an intuitive gesture-based user interface,&quot; according to Engadet's Devindra Hardawar. He also had concerns, though, about the solitary nature of using mixed reality headsets, particularly for socially-oriented activities like movie watching.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple has reportedly had manufacturing issues as well, and only expected to sell a 900,000 units in the headset's first year. However, even that modest target has reportedly been slashed by over half to 400,000 units due to the tiny and costly OLED displays, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/632b4ffa-3637-4972-a525-0ddbcd50b463\"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reported yesterday.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-may-launch-the-vision-pro-headset-with-appointment-only-sales-124119032.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-may-launch-the-vision-pro-headset-with-appointment-only-sales-124119032.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T12:41:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Diving into Threads and Twitter's latest mess", "description": "<p>While Twitter encountered many self-inflicted wounds this week, users jumped to Blue Sky and Mastodon.

The 10.9-inch tablet will set you back $400 on the website, or $49 lower than its retail price of $449. That price applies to the blue, pink and yellow color options of the WiFi-only 64GB version of the 10th generation iPad. We gave the tablet a score of 85 in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html\">review</a> and praised it for having an updated modern design, which makes it look more like the iPad Air than the previous versions of Apple's basic tablet. It still costs more than the previous iPad, but it is larger than its predecessor, and this price cut makes it a more affordable and enticing option.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In addition to giving the 2022 iPad flatter edges and thinner bezels, Apple also give it a USB-C port like its more expensive siblings. Underneath the hood, you'll find an A14 Bionic chip \u2014 it's an older model that debuted with the iPhone 12, but it still represents upgraded performance for the tablet. The iPad has a solid battery life, as well. When we tested it out, we found that it could last up to 11 hours and 45 minutes while playing back a movie purchased from the iTunes Store.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But the best upgrade if you use your iPad for video conferences is perhaps its front facing camera that's now installed on the landscape edge of the device. The camera is no longer awkwardly placed to the side when you put the tablet on landscape mode, and your face will now finally be centered when you take a video call.

The minimum wage in the city is $15 per hour, but the extra amount accounts for the fact that delivery workers are usually paid as contractors, so have higher taxes and must pay work-related expenses out of pocket. According to an estimate from the DCWP (NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection), NYC has more than 60,000 food delivery workers who earn an average of $7.09 per hour.&nbsp;</p><p>However, DoorDash and GrubHub argued that the earnings estimate was based on flawed methodology.

Earlier this year, a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/court-rules-uber-lyft-keep-contractors-classification-drivers-california-054040457.html\">court ruled</a> that Uber and Lyft could keep treating drivers as contractors, rather than reclassifying them as salaried employees.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uber-doordash-and-grubhub-sue-new-york-city-over-18-minimum-wage-law-103531552.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/uber-doordash-and-grubhub-sue-new-york-city-over-18-minimum-wage-law-103531552.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T10:35:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta is working to stop deleted Threads accounts from nuking Instagram too", "description": "<p>So, you signed up for a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html\">Threads</a> account, because you wanted to see what the fuss was about with Meta's Twitter rival. If you decide that the new social network isn't for you or if you want to start fresh, deleting your Threads profile may not be the way to go \u2014 as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23786029/instagram-threads-profiles-deleted-removing\"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, doing so will also erase your entire Instagram account. When you open a Threads account, you can use your Instagram credentials to sign up if you want to bring over your profile and your circles from the photo-sharing app. But by doing so, your accounts on both platforms become inextricably linked.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/t/CuXRXDdNOtH\">post on Threads</a>, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said Meta is aware of the issue and is currently looking for a way to allow you to delete your Threads account separately. The company is also <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/t/CuW3CzRtm9z\">working on features</a> that are still missing from the app, including the following tab, hashtags, fediverse support and messaging. For now, you can deactivate your Threads account to hide your profile and content. You can also set your profile to private or simply just delete individual threads. To note, you can also sign up for a Threads account with an email or a phone number not linked to your Instagram account, so you can keep the two platforms completely separate.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meta couldn't have launched Threads at a better time. Twitter recently made changes that frustrated even the most avid users. It first <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-isnt-showing-tweets-unless-youre-logged-in-165254006.html\">prevented</a> people who aren't logged in from seeing tweets \u2014 though it quietly backtracked on requiring users to log in \u2014 and then <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html\">put a strict cap</a> on how many posts users can see per day. Around 10 million users signed up for a Threads account within its first seven hours, and in the first morning after it became available, the app already had <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/threads-gained-10-million-new-users-in-seven-hours-090838140.html\">30 million users</a>. Shortly after Threads launched, Twitter <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-threatens-to-sue-meta-over-the-new-threads-app-191141961.html\">threatened to sue Meta</a>, accusing it of poaching former employees and misappropriating trade secrets and intellectual property. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1677042708756439041\">response</a> to a tweet about the potential lawsuit, Elon Musk replied: &quot;Competition is fine, cheating is not.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-to-stop-deleted-threads-accounts-from-nuking-instagram-too-094423213.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-to-stop-deleted-threads-accounts-from-nuking-instagram-too-094423213.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T09:44:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's iRobot purchase is under investigation by European authorities", "description": "<p>Amazon's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-buys-irobot-roomba-creator-122257453.html\">$1.7 billion acquisition</a> of Roomba manufacturer iRobot is under scrutiny not only in the US, but also in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-irobot-purchase-reportedly-faces-eu-investigation-194049962.html\">Europe</a>. The European Commission has revealed that it has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3702\">opened an in-depth investigation</a> into the purchase out of concerns that the merger would restrict competition for robotic vacuum cleaners. In particular, the commission is concerned that Amazon might prevent iRobot's rivals from selling their robot vacuums on its marketplace. Amazon might favor iRobot's products in both paid and unpaid search results or charge competing products more to advertise their offerings, the commission said.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, authorities are worried about the possibility of Amazon preventing iRobot rivals from accessing future Alexa APIs and from getting the &quot;Works with Alexa&quot; certification, since voice control with the assistant is one of the most important selling points for robot vacuums. Finally, the commission has raised concerns about Amazon obtaining access to iRobot users' data, which it believes could provide the e-commerce giant &quot;an important advantage.&quot; Amazon could, for instance, use that information to better personalize and target advertisements. Bottom line is that the &quot;transaction may raise barriers to entry and expansion for Amazon's competitors to the detriment of consumers.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The commission will now look into these concerns in cooperation with other competition authorities and has until November 15th to finalize its results. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission launched a probe into the acquisition last year after politicians from both parties <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-irobot-purchase-reportedly-faces-eu-investigation-194049962.html\">asked</a> it to oppose the purchase.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/amazons-irobot-deal-eu-antitrust-crosshairs-2023-07-06/\"><em>Reuters</em></a> that the company will &quot;continue to work through the process with the European Commission and [is] focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage.&quot; They also told the news organization that Amazon could &quot;offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-irobot-purchase-is-under-investigation-by-european-authorities-054857108.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazons-irobot-purchase-is-under-investigation-by-european-authorities-054857108.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-07T05:48:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
