<p>Just when you think you'll never pick up those sai again, suddenly it's 20 years later, you're 51, and you get the call from Marvel--and you're right back in. Jennifer Garner will reprise her role as Marvel's Elektra in the upcoming Deadpool 3, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/deadpool-3-jennifer-garner-returning-as-elektra-1235530539/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Jennifer Garner played the role of Elektra Natchios in the 2003 Daredevil film, and again in 2005's Elektra. Now she'll return to the role for Deadpool 3. Deadpool 3 seems to be bringing a handful of actors out of superhero retirement. After years of goofing on each other on social media, Ryan Reynolds announced Deadpool 3 alongside Hugh Jackman, who confirmed that he'll be coming out of retirement to once again play Wolverine.</p><p>THR's report also comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/deadpool-3-ben-affleck-reportedly-160000531.html">rumors</a> that Ben Affleck himself would be returning as Daredevil for the movie, as well as rumors earlier this spring that James Marsden, Famke Janssen, and Halle Barry would return as Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm, respectively. These rumors are strictly that--rumors--but Garner's return seems to lend some credence to them potentially being true.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jennifer-garner-joins-deadpool-3-to-reprise-role-as-daredevils-elektra/1100-6515772/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>While all eyes are on Amazon ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day 2023</a>, a few other retailers are joining in on the summer fun with promotions of their own. Over at Newegg, the tech and gaming supplier has started the presale for its annual <a href="https://shop-links.co/1813296699336030952?u1=subid_value">FantasTech promotion</a> with big discounts on PC games and gaming hardware. If you were ever looking to get into PC gaming or you're looking to upgrade your existing rig, now's a great time to check out these specials. More deals will be available July 10-14, but the presale has some deals that are worth considering.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1813296699336030952?u1=subid_value">See all deals at Newegg</a> </div></div><p> </p><p>On the hardware front, some of the <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1813296889505280048?u1=subid_value">standout deals</a> </span> are focused on Nvidia's line of 30-series GPUs. While the 40-series line is newer, the previous line of GPUs arguably offer more bang for buck when it comes to 1080p and 1440p gaming, and with Nvidia's DLSS technology, you can easily maximize those pixel gains. Plenty of 8GB 3060 GPUs are on sale right now, and these cards are also superb for handling content creation workloads like video editing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prime-day-2023-neweggs-fantastech-sale-has-great-pc-gaming-deals/1100-6515717/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>AAA video games require millions of dollars and multiple years to make and market. While the result can often be fantastic, highly polished, and lavishly created gaming experiences, they do often do so with the sacrifice of trying new ideas that push the medium forward. Instead, that responsibility is shouldered by indie developers.</p><p>On this week's episode of Spot On, Tamoor is joined by Kurt to talk about whether big companies are doing enough to ensure that the video game space is kept fresh with new ideas. They also discuss development teams that have taken risks in the past and had a major impact on the way we make and play games.</p><div>          </div><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

<p>Yanni Ouahioune, the 22-year-old <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Rainbow Six Siege</a> player who swatted the Ubisoft Montreal offices in November 2020, has been sentenced to three years of community service for his crimes. "Swatting" is defined as making a prank call to emergency services to bring a dispatch of armed officers to a specific location. This is a serious crime, as swatting has led to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/california-man-sentenced-deadly-wichita-swatting-case">people being killed</a>.</p><p>This news comes by way of the <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/crime/man-sentenced-in-france-for-ubisoft-montreal-hostage-hoax">Montreal Gazette</a>, which notes that Ouahioune will also have to "compensate victims, undergo treatment for a mental health problem and either work or undergo training."</p><p>Ouahioune made a false claim that hostages were taken at the Ubisoft Montreal office on November 13, 2020, leading to an evacuation of the building. Armed officers were dispatched to the location before learning Ouahioune's call was, in fact, a hoax. Later, it was revealed that Ouahioune swatted the office due to being banned from the online shooter Rainbow Six Siege.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banned-rainbow-six-player-who-swatted-ubisoft-office-gets-sentence-but-no-jail-time/1100-6515770/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tom Cruise Is Mission Impossible's Hero, But Simon Pegg Is The Glue Holding The Series Together

<p dir="ltr">When you sit down in the theaters to watch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-mission-impossible-7/1100-6515683/">Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1</a>, you know what you're getting, more or less. There will be some kind of impossible mission that requires <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-hopes-to-keep-starring-in-mission-impossible-movies-in-his-80s/1100-6515676/">Tom Cruise</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-performed-mission-impossible-7s-biggest-stunt-on-the-first-day-of-production/1100-6515378/">jump off of something</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mission-impossible-filmmakers-built-a-train-and-then-destroyed-it-for-epic-action-scene-in-dead-reckoning/1100-6515723/">crash something</a>, or otherwise put his own life--and the lives of anyone around him--in immeasurable amounts of danger so he and his team can save the world. Oftentimes, one of those put in danger is none other than his sidekick Benji (Simon Pegg). Benji's more than a sidekick, though; he's the beating heart of the movies.</p><p dir="ltr">See, while Cruise's Ethan Hunt is an unstoppable spy machine, Benji is more often than not portrayed as the everyman in the series. We've seen him gaming at his desk, and even unknowingly stumbling into one of Ethan's catastrophes while taking in the opera. It's certainly nothing like the largely quiet life he must have dreamed of--and thank goodness for that. Without Benji to bring emotion and realism to the team, it could be argued that we would have tired of Mission Impossible a number of films ago. After all, while a series of movies with little more than Tom Cruise putting on masks and running around the world sounds fun, it would wear thin after a while.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, we have a well-rounded team, with Benji's existence feeling the most realistic of any of the franchise's characters. He's a person who doesn't hide the dream or emotion he's feeling, choosing instead to let his IMF team know the real him, whether that's cracking wise at the right moment to add a bit of levity or throwing himself in the line of fire, not just because the world is at stake, but because you love your friends. He's also prone to the occasional mistake, which typically ends up being one of the more entertaining moments in any Mission Impossible film as the rest of the team tries to fix it before they're discovered or killed. His presence helps to ground these films in a way that help to elevate them beyond action schlock.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-is-mission-impossibles-hero-but-simon-pegg-is-the-glue-holding-the-series-together/1100-6515769/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Inside Diablo 4's Season Of The Malignant Story, What To Expect In The Future

<p dir="ltr">The first of many seasonal content updates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> was officially revealed as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-and-character-reset-details/1100-6514821/">Season of the Malignant</a>, launching July 20. With that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-1s-new-malignant-villains-are-changing-the-game/1100-6515727/">comes a slew of gameplay changes</a> like new enemies, dungeons, gear, and socket items called Caged Hearts that seem to be legitimate game-changers. While nearly every game under the sun seems to have a seasonal model or battle pass to throw your way, as an ongoing RPG, Diablo 4 lends itself well to this type of structure. That extends to the upcoming narrative-driven questline--new characters, enemies, storytelling opportunities, and lore to explore are also on the table when it comes to seasonal updates.</p><p dir="ltr">We spoke with senior writer Ben Chaney and lead quest designer Madeliene James about the Season of the Malignant from a story perspective and how this affords them room to try new things with Diablo 4 as it evolves. This new threat is pitched as a plague that has spread across Sanctuary in the aftermath of the base game's main story, and at the heart of it is a newcomer named Cormond who calls on you to help battle the Malignant. But it appears to be more than just a mob-killing endeavor and perhaps another foray into Diablo 4's more human side amid the demon-hunting.</p><p dir="ltr">At the center of the seasonal questline is this newcomer: an ally who's a former priest from the Cathedral of Light. James mentions that Cormond is on the same level as a core character in the main campaign, with a fresh design and unique voice acting. Chaney describes him as a character who's an ordinary person trying to overcome an extraordinary situation. He's just a guy driven out of his small village who believes there's a cure for the Malignant corruption that's taken over, and we'll be helping him find his way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-diablo-4s-season-of-the-malignant-story-what-to-expect-in-the-future/1100-6515768/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Batman Forever's Darker "Schumacher Cut" Should Be Released, Writer Says

<p>Almost 30 years ago, Batman Forever changed the trajectory of the Batman movie franchise and became the biggest movie of 1995. It brought camp energy, became exponentially toyetic, and even expanded the DC film verse at the time with a quick mention of Metropolis. It also had a darker edit to the film that has yet to be officially released.</p><p>Batman Forever writer and Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman wants that edit of the film to have an official release, similar to that of Zack Snyder's Justice League and Richard Donner's Superman 2. "I saw [the "Schumacher Cut"] recently, and it's funny because there's been a swell on the Internet for it, and I stay out of it, mostly," he said on <a href="https://theplaylist.net/the-crowded-room-akiva-goldsman-on-tom-hollands-psychological-drama-his-constantine-i-am-legend-sequels-more-bingeworthy-p-20230707/">The Playlist's Bingworthy podcast</a>. "Although, it's got about 35% more psychological realism in it. You know, it's really more about guilt and shame."</p><p>Aptly nicknamed the Schumacher Cut, this Batman Forever film had an edgier take with more comic book-type moments, including the now infamous scene between Val Kilmer's Bruce Wayne having a somber moment between himself and a giant humanoid bat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-forevers-darker-schumacher-cut-should-be-released-writer-says/1100-6515767/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## 2023 Has Already Seen Almost As Many TV Shows Canceled As All Of Last Year

<p dir="ltr">The television landscape is undergoing an upheaval, with cancellations and uncertainty dominating the headlines. GameSpot's annual tracking of show cancellations reveals a troubling trend. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-110-tv-shows-canceled-or-ending-in-2022/2900-3928/">110 shows bid farewell</a> either by cancellation or coming to an end. As of Friday, July 7, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-tv-shows-canceled-or-ending-in-2023/2900-4618/">the tally this year so far stands at 90 cancellations</a>. The latest casualties include Netflix's Snowflake Mountain, canceled after one season as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/snowflake-mountain-canceled-netflix-1235431639/">Deadline</a> on Friday, and HBO's A Black Lady Sketch Show as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/hbo-black-lady-sketch-show-ending-1235663147">Variety</a> on Thursday not returning for Season 5.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the industry's woes is an ongoing writers strike that began on May 2. This strike has led to production delays and a shortage of new shows. Now, news of a potential strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has further heightened concerns. Talks between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are set to conclude on July 12. If an acceptable deal is not reached, SAG-AFTRA members, who overwhelmingly voted in favor of a strike, are poised to take to the streets on July 13.</p><p dir="ltr">The streaming landscape is increasingly experiencing a disconcerting trend of content removals. Stories about shows and movies being pulled from platforms have become frequent. Just this week, it was revealed that Crater, a sci-fi film produced by the team behind Stranger Things, had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-removes-new-movie-from-stranger-things-producers-and-people-are-upset/1100-6515673/">abruptly removed from Disney Plus</a>, sparking outrage given that it had been available for less than two months. Paramount+ also recently unceremoniously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paramount-plus-continues-with-content-purge-as-more-shows-removed-from-service/1100-6515511/">purged 10 titles from its streaming service</a> with no notice. Earlier this year, WB Discovery, led by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-more-hbo-max-content-has-been-removed/1100-6510281/">David Zaslav</a>, has been at the forefront of similar removals on Max, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-may-remove-more-movies-and-shows-from-disney-plus-or-hulu-soon/1100-6514785/">Disney+ and Hulu</a> have recently followed suit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023-has-already-seen-almost-as-many-tv-shows-canceled-as-all-of-last-year/1100-6515766/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## NBA 2K24 For PC Uses The Last-Gen Version Again

<p>The PC version of the upcoming NBA 2K24 will not have parity with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S editions. Instead, the PC edition takes a backseat to the current-gen versions and is missing features once again, just as it has for the past several installments.</p><p>On the features section of the official <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k24/features/">NBA 2K24 website</a>, a new animation system called ProPlay is revealed, but don't expect it to make an appearance on the PC version. "ProPlay delivers animations and movements via on-court NBA action for a generational leap in authenticity on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S," reads an excerpt from the ProPlay description, leaving out PC as a platform that supports the feature.</p><p>Likewise, the MyCareer mode will only feature the Neighborhood portion on the PC version of NBA 2K24, while cross-play will be absent, as well (which is only supported on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k24-for-pc-uses-the-last-gen-version-again/1100-6515761/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Does NBA 2K24 Have Cross-Play?

The game itself was a foregone conclusion, but that doesn't mean we're without surprises entirely. NBA 2K24 is finally getting cross-play--a feature increasingly common in games, and sports games in particular over the past year. However, it does have some details to be mindful of as you prepare to step onto the court for another season. Here's what you need to know about NBA 2K24 cross-play.</p><h2 dir="ltr">NBA 2K24 cross-play platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">NBA 2K24 marks the series' cross-play debut, but only if you're playing on particular systems. Cross-play works between PS5 and Xbox Series X|S only. That means those playing on PC, Switch, as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles won't be able to use cross-play. This is because Switch and PC still use the same version as PS4 and Xbox, for which cross-play has not been added this year.</p><h2 dir="ltr">NBA 2K24 cross-play modes</h2><p dir="ltr">2K confirmed with GameSpot that all modes will work with cross-play. With cross-play finally coming to NBA 2K this fall, one of the year's biggest games will likely benefit from those proverbial walls coming down, giving the massive community even more players to meet in The City, challenge in Pro-Am, or outbid in MyTeam.</p>

<p dir="ltr">NBA 2K24 is nearly here, which means it's time to start unpacking all it will have to offer. While the 2K team has just begun sharing details on the game, which will surely wind up as one of the year's bestsellers yet again, there's already enough to compile for the biggest fans to dwell on as we approach the game's presumed September launch. Here's everything we know so far about NBA 2K24.</p><h2 dir="ltr">NBA 2K24 release date</h2><p dir="ltr">2K and Visual Concepts have not yet revealed the official release date for NBA 2K24, but common sense points to a particular window. Historically, the game's latest installment launches in early September, with optional early access included in some of the game's more expensive versions sold in stores.</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, we can expect NBA 2K24 to launch sometime between Tuesday, September 5 and the following Tuesday, September 12. We'd be surprised if the final release date reveal doesn't confirm this estimation, but in either case, we'll update this story once we know for sure.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k24-release-date-window-mamba-moments-mode-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6515739/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sega is pulling back on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/segas-first-blockchain-game-is-on-the-way/1100-6507907/">its commitment to blockchain gaming</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/sega-joins-blockchain-games-pullback-as-crypto-winter-persists">a report by Bloomberg</a>. In the past, the developer showed significant support for blockchain-based gaming, as did other major developers and publishers like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reaffirms-commitment-to-blockchain-gaming-despite-crypto-winter/1100-6510257/">Square Enix</a> and Bandai Namco. But now, it seems the owner of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-origins/">Sonic The Hedgehog</a> franchise is pumping the brakes on its blockchain endeavors--especially when it comes to the publisher's most popular IPs.</p><p>According to statements made to Bloomberg by Sega co-COO Shuji Utsumi, the company is also putting any plans to develop new IP for blockchain games on hold for the time being. This is likely a result of the "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-crypto-winter/">crypto winter</a>" that began earlier this year and saw many investors lose both their money and their faith in blockchain gaming. Many gamers have also been quite vocal about their preference for non-blockchain, NFT-free games.</p><p>Still, Sega isn't entirely pulling out of the crypto scene--NFTs featuring characters from lesser-known Sega franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/total-war-three-kingdoms/">Total War: Three Kingdoms</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/virtua-fighter-5-final-showdown/">Virtua Fighter</a> are still in the pipeline. But it seems that, for the most part, Sega isn't banking on a blockchain-based future, and that statement also applies to the publisher's upcoming "super game" series--a lineup of heavily financed online multiplayer games that are set to begin releasing in 2026.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-mostly-hits-the-brakes-on-nfts-in-games/1100-6515756/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The weird tale of an iconic former Sega developer who used insider information at Square Enix for stock trading has come to a close. Yuji Naka, co-creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and most recently the director of Balan Wonderworld, was given a two-and-a-half year prison sentence that's suspended for four years.</p><p><a href="https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2023070700144">Jiji Press</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-given-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">IGN</a>) reports that Naka--who also worked on Nights Into Dreams and Phantasy Star Online--was found guilty of insider trading while employed at Square Enix. That means he broke the law under Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. His suspended sentence gives Naka the chance to avoid jail time by staying out of trouble during the four-year probation period.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Naka was fined twice for an estimated $1.2 million (after converting from yen). This stems from the Sonic co-creator actually being arrested twice late last year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-has-been-arrested-for-alleged-insider-trading/1100-6509282/">He was first apprehended for insider trading at Square Enix</a> by purchasing stock in a developer named Aiming that was working on an unannounced Dragon Quest mobile game at the time.

<p>Xbox Game Pass is officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stock-up-on-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-before-the-price-goes-up/1100-6515387/">a little bit more expensive as of this week</a>, but for anyone looking to grab a killer deal on Microsoft's service, you can once again get a month of Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass for a single dollar if you're a new subscriber.</p><p>This $1 deal previously also included Xbox Game Pass for console, but your only options now are PC Game Pass and the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate, which grants access to both the Xbox and PC versions of the service. After your $1 month, your subscription reverts to the standard pricing. On PC Game Pass that remains $10 per month whereas, as noted above, Game Pass Ultimate's price recently increased to $17 per month.</p><p>The one big change here is that upgrading from Xbox Live Gold to Game Pass Ultimate no longer has a 1:1 conversion ratio, as this deal now applies a 3:2 ratio instead. For example, if you have 90 days remaining of Xbox Live Gold or PC Game Pass, this will convert to 60 days of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate time <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-faq">according to Microsoft</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal-is-back-with-some-changes/1100-6515753/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Deadpool 3 is the first entry in the foul-mouthed series since Disney acquired 20th Century Fox. Fans might be happy to hear that the family-friendly Disney doesn't appear to be throttling the third film when it comes to content. Karan Soni, who plays Dopinder in the series, explained that Deadpool 3 is another "hard R" movie that should feel familiar to fans of the franchise.</p><p>"I have begun working on that one, so I can say that it is the same as the other two. It's like hard R. There's a lot of that stuff. So it does not feel different," Soni told <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/deadpool-3-karan-soni-return-dopinder-ryan-reynolds-rated-r-disney-mcu-fox/">ComicBook.com</a>. "The only thing that, for me, is different is that I have not gotten the script this time. The other two, we did get it, it's a big difference, at least for me, the MCU part of it vs. the Fox/Marvel part of it. They're so strict. So I've only seen glimpses of what I'm in."</p><p>Soni went on to say that Ryan Reynolds, who plays Deadpool, is only interested in making a movie that he wants to make.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-3-first-under-disney-feels-the-same-as-first-two-and-earns-its-hard-r-actor-says/1100-6515751/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Mid-Season Weapons Update Will Tweak Shotguns, Bows, Pulse Rifles, And SMGs

<p>Like previous seasons in Destiny 2, a few updates for the weapon pool will soon be made in the mid-season patch. Bungie has detailed which weapon archetypes are in its crosshairs, and so far, you can expect a few changes to pulse rifles, bows, submachine guns, and shotguns. For pulse rifles, these tweaks will be minor at best.</p><p>Bungie feels that this weapon category is in a good place right now, but pulse rifles with low base Aim Assist stat values will be less forgiving of near misses after the update goes live and reduces that stat by 10%.</p><p>For bows, a more substantial rework is on the way for lightweight models. Bungie says that it will substantially increase the range at which they can deal full damage and will improve their accuracy, and in Season 22, more changes will affect their reload perks and how well their shots register at longer ranges.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-mid-season-weapons-update-will-tweak-shotguns-bows-pulse-rifles-and-smgs/1100-6515747/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's Groovy Graviton Lance Is Getting a Huge Buff In PvE

<p>Change is on the horizon for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, as a mid-season patch will tweak several weapon archetypes and fine-tune some of the game's Exotics. Right now, Bungie has Graviton Lance, No Time to Explain, and Fighting Lion prepped for an update, one that'll scale back the effectiveness of these weapons in certain scenarios.</p><p>Graviton Lance received a major overhaul--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cool-dubstep-gun-and-several-other-exotics-are-getting-an-upgrade-next-season/1100-6514292/">alongside several other Exotics</a>--this season, shifting its design to provide a more even spread of damage across its two-tap build. "While it is nice to see that Graviton Lance has been returned to glory after a long hiatus, at its current strength the gun is too easy to use for how rewarding it can be, and the Cosmology explosion pushes it too close to 'primary ammo Cloudstrike' for comfort," <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_s21_mid_season">Bungie explained</a>.</p><p>Later this season, Graviton Lance will be buffed to be better in PvE, but its catalyst Cosmology explosion will do reduced damage against Guardians and have less aim assist to rely on. Another Exotic pulse rifle, No Time to Explain, is getting a small nerf to prevent it from usurping Graviton Lance's position in this weapon archetype's hierarchy. Players can expect a reduced range stat of 10 with this weapon once the update goes live.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-groovy-graviton-lance-is-getting-a-huge-buff-in-pve/1100-6515748/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Of course, Overwatch dabbles in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-overwatch-cartoon-and-diablo-anime-are-in-the-w/1100-6473776/">animation</a>. However, perfecting its signature three-dimensional cartoon style in gameplay and trailers isn't quite the same as a 2D animated series. Overwatch's first animated short, Part One: Dawn, just came out. You can watch it now on the official Overwatch YouTube channel.</p><div>          </div><p>Last week, the official <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1674837783532171265?s=20">Overwatch Twitter</a> introduced Genesis as a three-part animated series composed of short lore-stuffed episodes about the origins of Overwatch and the Omnic Crisis. Part One: Dawn tells the story of how humanity's relationship with machines evolved and how Omnica Corp scientists were involved, including Overwatch founder Dr. Mina Liao. Some scientists supported pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence, while others called it "arrogance."</p><p>Mina Liao was only one of Overwatch's founders. She's survived by her cofounders: Jack Morrison, Gabriel Reyes, Ana Amari, Reinhardt Wilhelm, and Torbjörn Lindholm. Unfortunately, she was killed in an invasion during the war. She was in the middle of developing <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23356245/?blzcmp=app">Echo</a>, the playable Damage hero and Liao's pride and joy.
