Ukrainian novelist who became a war crimes investigator following the Russian invasion, and fought to uncover the true stories of her compatriots’ experiences under occupation<p>Victoria Amelina, who was wounded in a Russian missile attack in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine on 27 June and died, aged 37, of her injuries four days later, knew that being a writer made her a target for Russia.

The town (whose unlikely name is thought to have been originally Neu Jork and to have come from 19th-century German settlers) was occupied by the Russian army in 2014 and has been on the frontline ever since.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/07/victoria-amelina-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

But there’s no demand for novels translated from Urdu, so she spends her time subtitling Bollywood movies. Given the chance to attend the mysterious “Centre” for 10 days, she emerges from its immersive regime fluent in German.

<p>Today’s fluff is emotionally charged</p><p>If you like your moves to be shocking, then you might be knocked over by a feather after reading that <strong>Chelsea</strong> are in talks to sign Arsenal striker <strong>Folarin Balogun</strong>. The forward spent last season out on loan at Reims, where he banged in the Ligue 1 goals, but that has not done enough to guarantee him a place in Mikel Arteta’s side. Chelsea have already signed a couple of strikers, which would not help Balogun’s prospects at Stamford Bridge, but hey-ho. Balogun does seem to have options, however, with <strong>Milan</strong>, <strong>Internazionale</strong>, <strong>Marseille</strong> and <strong>Monaco</strong> all keeping tabs on the 22-year-old USA international.</p><p>With Mason Mount through the door, <strong>Manchester United</strong> are looking to kick on with their summer transfer business. The Atalanta striker <strong>Rasmus Højlund</strong> is next on their hitlist. The 20-year-old Dane will cost a pretty penny, estimated to be around £50m, although the United hierarchy will be hoping to bring that down. United are also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/06/manchester-united-increase-andre-onana-bid-granit-xhaka-seals-bayer-leverkusen-move-arsenal">negotiating a deal for </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/06/manchester-united-increase-andre-onana-bid-granit-xhaka-seals-bayer-leverkusen-move-arsenal">Internazionale’s André Onana</a></strong>, forcing the Italians to search for a replacement between the sticks. One man they have identified is Shakhtar’s <strong>Anatoliy Trubin</strong> but they could also go in for Bayern Munich’s <strong>Yann Sommer</strong> (or both).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/07/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-to-sign-arsenal-striker-folarin-balogun">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Season six of the US pro league ends on Saturday. Executives from the two finalists are bullish about what comes next</p><p>In rugby union, a team goes “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L60gYj4MhFo">coast to coast</a>” when it runs from its own line to score a try at the far end of the field. In American rugby, the phrase – and the evocation of risky ambition – applies before kick-off to Saturday’s championship game, in which the New England Free Jacks will face the San Diego Legion.</p><p>At SeatGeek Stadium, outside Chicago, Major League Rugby final will set the beasts of the east against the best of the west, the winners first-time champions.

## The Horror of Dolores Roach review – this serial killer drama is a sloppy mess

<p>Why does this mild-mannered woman suddenly murder at the slightest provocation? How come her friend becomes a cannibal butcher at the drop of a hat? This baffling show has no idea</p><p>The story of Sweeney Todd has been around since Victorian times, perhaps because it is as simple and adaptable as pastry and filling. Someone kills people. Someone else chops them up and puts them into pies. That template can be turned into visceral folk terror, broad black pantomime, or a complex piece on revenge, obsession and trauma. However in The Horror of Dolores Roach, it’s something a lot less interesting: one of those half-hour hangout dramedies about kooky New Yorkers that isn’t bad, but isn’t really about anything, the sort of binge-watch you don’t bother to finish.</p><p>Justina Machado is Dolores, who was once a weed dealer’s devoted other half in Washington Heights. She was at home on the day her boyfriend’s business got busted, took the rap – refusing to rat on her beloved – and dutifully served a 16-year prison sentence. Now on her return to the neighbourhood, she finds her old world has gone. Her hangouts have been replaced by chichi cafes and white trust-fund couples occupy the apartments where Dominican-Americans used to live. Some poser has even got a shih tzu in a pushchair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/07/the-horror-of-dolores-roach-review-this-serial-killer-drama-is-a-sloppy-mess">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 23-year-old Bronx rapper is the year’s breakout star, has Nicki Minaj on speed dial and a gift for coining slang. On the path to outright superstardom, she’s dodging controversies and finding her footing with fame</p><p>Late last summer, not long after she released her viral megahit Munch (Feelin’ U), the New York rapper Ice Spice was scrolling Instagram and was taken aback to see an ad featuring a photo of her taken in her house, hawking the clothes that a stylist had brought over for her to try. “I was so mad – why am I seeing an off-guard photo of me, with a sock in the background?” she says. “That was the first time I was being annoyed about getting famous.”</p><p>But even as she recalls the embarrassingly candid shot, she doesn’t sound bothered. This insouciant persona has inspired fervent devotion in young rap fans. It’s less than a year since Ice, born Isis Gaston, released Munch – the title referring to the kind of man who is good for oral sex and not much else – and became an instant icon, with her orange afro and deep vocals. Initially known for her avowedly feminine take on the hypermasculine sub-genre drill – an early single sampled the hook of Zedd and Foxes’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxxstCcJlsc" title="">yearning EDM hit Clarity</a>; other songs flip sexist rap tropes on their head – the 23-year-old has become the New York scene’s biggest star since Pop Smoke, the Brooklyn upstart who was murdered at 20 in February 2020.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/07/it-feels-like-anything-is-possible-ice-spice-on-swapping-rap-virality-for-pop-stardom-privacy-and-finding-a-peer-in-taylor-swift">Continue reading...</a>
