keyboards. Since mechanical designs came back into fashion we&rsquo;re awash in an incredible variety of styles, capabilities, customization options, and price points. And naturally, Amazon&rsquo;s smorgasbord of deals on Prime Day will have more than a few of them available at steep discounts. Most of these will require an Amazon Prime account (which you can get free for 30 days if you don&rsquo;t have it already), but competitors like Best Buy will join in the bargains, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why wait? Retailers all over the web, Amazon included, are already ramping up the discounts well in advance of the actual Prime Day(s), July 11 and 12. Here are the best deals we&rsquo;ve been able to find from all over, handily separated into standard and gaming mechanical models, as well as a selection of other boards. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2

class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-kind-of-keyboard-should-i-buy\">What kind of keyboard should I buy? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>That depends on what you&rsquo;re doing with it. If you have a laptop and you like typing on it, you&rsquo;re good to go. But if you have a desktop, or you just don&rsquo;t feel good typing for long periods of time on the keyboard you&rsquo;re using now, it might be time for an upgrade. Most of the high-quality keyboards on the market are mechanical now, with big, chunky builds and long, loud key presses, because that seems to be what people prefer. But there are still slim, quiet boards available from companies like Logitech, Microsoft, and Apple. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-kind-of-mechanical-switch-do-i-need\">What kind of mechanical switch do I need? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Again, that comes down to what you want to do with it. There are broadly three kinds of switch: Linear (smooth from the top of the key press to the bottom), tactile (a small &ldquo;bump&rdquo; where the key press registers), and clicky (a loud &ldquo;click&rdquo; where the key press registers). These are generically color-coded to Red, Brown, and Blue switches, respectively, though that&rsquo;s not universal &mdash; if you want to be sure, look for the linear, tactile, or clicky terms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of individual taste, but gamers tend to prefer linear switches, because they can be pressed and released quickly. Those who type for long stretches of time like tactile switches thanks to their finger feedback. And if you want even more feedback, along with a bit of noise, go witch a clicky switch. Just be aware that the noise might not be so well-received by other people in your home or office! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to experiment with different kinds of switches without needing to buy multiple keyboards, get a board with hot-swap sockets. These let you pull out the switches and replace them with a different type. You can even mix and match the switches you put on a single board, if you have enough of them &mdash; Reds for WASD and Browns for the rest, for example. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-layout-keyboard-should-i-get\">What layout keyboard should I get? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Keyboards come in a shocking variety of layouts these days, from full-sized (with the number pad on the left) to 60%, which is just the main alphanumeric section between the two CTRL keys with the Function row cut off. Tenkeyless, or TKL, is a good middle ground that doesn&rsquo;t shrink any keys but chops off the number pad, and 75% preserves the function row and arrow cluster by shrinking a few of the less-used keys. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>60% is great for travel keyboards, or those who don&rsquo;t have a lot of space. Full-size is almost a must if you do a lot of data entry, and rely on rapidly inputting long strings of numbers. Everything else is a balancing act between space and comfort. But keep in mind, the smaller you go, the more often you&rsquo;ll need to use a function key modifier &mdash; a standard 60% keyboard doesn&rsquo;t have arrows or a Delete key on the main later, for example. Smaller boards include a learning curve if you&rsquo;re not used to them. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-i-get-a-wireless-keyboard\">Should I get a wireless keyboard? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>That depends on what&rsquo;s important to you. If your keyboard sits in front of your desk and never moves, it&rsquo;s probably not important. But if your keyboard is constantly on the go with you in a bag, or needs to connect to multiple devices over Bluetooth, wireless is the way to go. The latest boards can connect to three or four computers (or phones or tablets) easily, and last for months and months on a charge&hellip;as long as you take it easy with the backlighting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s one exception: gaming. If you&rsquo;re playing PC games with your keyboard, you want to use a wireless connection with low latency, and that means a dongle you plug in. Unlike some older wireless keyboards, and just like newer kinds of mice, modern wireless gaming boards have almost zero latency. That means you&rsquo;ll never notice a gap between when you press a button and when your character reacts on screen. Just don&rsquo;t use Bluetooth (even if it&rsquo;s an option), as the high latency and crowded wireless bands can cause performance issues. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">5.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-i-need-a-gaming-keyboard\">Do I need a gaming keyboard? </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Most of the time, no, you don&rsquo;t. You can play PC games on pretty much any keyboard. Gaming keyboards offer a few nice perks, though, including fast polling rates (so even less lag time between key press and on-screen action) and custom programming tools. They also tend to be flashier, with rainbow lights and exotic case materials&hellip;not that any of that will really make a difference to how you play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, if you want a wireless keyboard that&rsquo;s also good for gaming, look for a gaming-specific model that uses a dedicated wireless dongle and not Bluetooth. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nKeyboards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1984400/early-prime-day-keyboard-deals-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-07T18:10:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best early Prime Day deals on Thunderbolt docks and USB-C hubs", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon Prime Day offers an opportunity to find the best deals on Thunderbolt docks, a powerful, pricey accessory to expand your PC&rsquo;s capabilities.

Both use a USB-C output from your laptop. The difference is that some laptops use this port as a generic USB-C port, and others route the high-speed Thunderbolt 3 or 4 protocol through the USB-C socket. The former allows for typically 10Gbps of throughput, useful for USB keys, external storage, and perhaps an external display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt (either Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4) allows for 40Gbps of throughput, designed for high-speed external SSDs and multiple displays. Our roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">best USB-C hubs</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">best Thunderbolt docks</a> explain further in much greater detail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, USB-C hubs and dongles are relatively cheap, rarely climbing over $60. Prime Day is an opportunity to pick up a USB-C hub with inputs for USB expansion, Ethernet, SD cards, and more for very little &mdash; all ports that your laptop might lack. Just don&rsquo;t go too crazy: All of the devices that the USB-C connects to will transfer data over the same 10Gbps port. That&rsquo;s fine for a keyboard, mouse, and a hard drive which will power on, send data, and turn off. But sending a fire hose of simultaneous Ethernet, storage, and display data won&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;ll need a Thunderbolt dock (and a laptop port) instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt docks require more care. Here, consider what you want to do: connect a pair of 4K displays with HDMI? Look for Thunderbolt docks with a pair of HDMI ports. DisplayPort connections will work, but you&rsquo;ll need a cheap intermediary cable. Thunderbolt docks have historically been in short supply, so this is an opportunity to pick up a pricey accessory at a discount. However, they&rsquo;re almost a must for a home office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nComputer Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1983354/early-prime-day-thunderbolt-docks-and-usb-c-hubs-deals-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-07T17:53:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best early Prime Day deals on SSD & storage", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Another summer, another Prime Day sale&mdash;in just a few days, Amazon&rsquo;s big shopping event begins.

But if you&rsquo;ve been waiting for a deal on a high-end OLED gaming monitor, there&rsquo;s no need to wait any longer. The Alienware AW3423DWF, one of the first OLED ultrawides on the market and one of the best gaming displays available in general, has a deep discount right on Dell&rsquo;s site. Normally $1100, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dwf/apd/210-bfrp/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;xcust=2-1-1984208-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alienware OLED is on sale today for just $899.99</a>, which also makes it the first OLED gaming monitor we&rsquo;ve seen to go for under a grand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AW3423DWF is the cheaper of Alienware&rsquo;s 34-inch OLED monitors, though &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; is a relative term in this case. The 3440&times;1440, 0.1-millisecond curved panel is ever so slightly slower at 165Hz versus the 175Hz of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alienware AW3423DW</a> (note the missing F), and it&rsquo;s rated for AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync Premium Pro instead of Nvidia&rsquo;s GSYNC, which requires extra hardware. Other than that and some black plastic, the two screens are identical, complete with double DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, four USB ports, a headphone jack, and a little RGB lighting in the rear for the bling factor. For a full breakdown of this monitor (and the differences between it and the $1300 original model), <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out PCWorld&rsquo;s review</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike some other early OLED monitor deals, this is a new model, not refurbished. It comes with a 3-year warranty that covers OLED burn-in for the whole period (a particular point of concern for some of these early gaming designs). It&rsquo;s likely that Dell will keep this deal going through Prime Day, or until its supplies run out, whichever happens first. That being the case, you might want to get an order in early if you&rsquo;re ready to make the jump to OLED.

Getting started with PC security", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As our lives become more and more digital, keeping our information and devices secure has become more important than ever. And that starts with good security software. An antivirus program is a piece of software that keeps your computer (or phone, tablet, etc.) safe from other software that tries to attack it. This includes detecting and blocking viruses, a very specific type of program, but also a wide variety of other digital threats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCWorld is constantly covering the latest news in viruses and other threats, and how to defend against them. For the best antivirus software in 2023, be sure to check out our extensive <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html\">roundup of the best antivirus programs</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-computer-virus\">What is a computer virus? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand what antivirus software does, you need to know what a computer virus is. &ldquo;Virus&rdquo; in this context has a broad definition, but to put it simply, it&rsquo;s a program that gets installed on your computer, then automatically spreads itself to other computers across a network or the internet, mimicking the spread of a biological virus spreading through an organism&rsquo;s cells. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What precisely a virus does depends on the specific virus, but it&rsquo;s never good. In the early days of personal computers, a lot of viruses were designed merely to damage your computer for the sake of pure mischief. The famous &ldquo;ILOVEYOU&rdquo; virus spread through email downloads and merely overwrote files on the hard drive with junk data, until the computer became unstable and had to be completely wiped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are viruses designed to take remote control of your computer, often without you realizing it, in order to create a secret network called a &ldquo;botnet.&rdquo; Botnets like MyDoom can be used to spread spam or scams, or attack other computers with distributed traffic designed to shut down web services. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Someone using a desktop PC\" class=\"wp-image-920996\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/windows-virus-false-positive.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most insidious and personally dangerous type of virus, and the more common one in the modern world, is designed to steal from users themselves. This can be done several ways. A &ldquo;spyware&rdquo; or &ldquo;spybot&rdquo; program searches the files on your computer for your personal information like login passwords or bank accounts, while &ldquo;ransomware&rdquo; locks down your files and instructs you to send money to criminals to get them back. Often these will be sent as emails or websites pretending to be something they&rsquo;re not, like a crucial software update you need to click on, a process called &ldquo;phishing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these cases, the self-replicating viral factor might not even be present, so the software isn&rsquo;t even technically a virus. Other terms, like &ldquo;worm,&rdquo; &ldquo;trojan&rdquo; (as in the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)&amp;xcust=2-2-1974484-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trojan Horse</a>) or the more all-encompassing &ldquo;malware&rdquo; might be more accurate. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-antivirus-software\">What is antivirus software?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The types of threat are wide and varied, but antivirus software is designed to detect and stop them all. These security packages might be called simply &ldquo;antivirus,&rdquo; but also a &ldquo;protection suite,&rdquo; or just &ldquo;defender.&rdquo; Regardless, they all use a few straightforward methods to identify, contain, and neutralize viruses and other kinds of malware before it can infect your system. Antivirus software also continuously scans both your computer and your network traffic to identify threats. Currently, our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393283/norton-360-deluxe-antivirus-review.html\">top pick for an all-encompassing security package is Norton 360 Deluxe</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-does-antivirus-software-do\">What does antivirus software do? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most straightforward way an antivirus program can protect against viruses is by scanning your files. The antivirus software taps into a huge database of known viruses, trojans, and other kinds of malware&mdash;thousands and thousands of different kinds, constantly being updated&mdash;and searches for them on the files in your computer. The antivirus program even scans new files that you download immediately, including installable programs that might hide viruses behind other programs like games or tools. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"AVG ANtivirus for Mac\" class=\"wp-image-1429084\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/avg-antivirus.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When the antivirus program finds a file that it&rsquo;s identified as malware, it immediately isolates the file from the rest of your computer and prevents it from running any operations that might affect other files or programs. With the threat isolated, it then thoroughly deletes the dangerous files. Usually it will display some kind of alert letting you know that it&rsquo;s found and neutralized the danger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method of protection has proven to be extremely effective, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. A virus or a piece of malware has to be identified before it can be added to the detection database&hellip; which means that for at least some amount of time, it has to be active &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; of the internet before the database gets updated. That&rsquo;s a good reason to practice basic computer security at all times, for example, not downloading unknown programs or opening email attachments from untrusted sources. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-the-difference-between-antivirus-and-a-firewall\">What&rsquo;s the difference between antivirus and a firewall? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Antivirus software primarily scans your computer&rsquo;s files and programs. A firewall is a piece of software that directly scans traffic going in and out of your computer on both your local network and the internet. This is important for your security, because firewalls can be used to block malicious data from coming in or going out. This can be used to prevent a program from sending your personal information out, or prevent a program from outside your computer&rsquo;s network from controlling it remotely. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows Firewall screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-1976287\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-firewall.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"959\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some antivirus software includes at least some kind of basic firewall functionality to supplement its file and program scanning tools. For example, Windows Defender, a standard antivirus checker, and Defender Firewall, are both part of the built-in Windows Security system. Bundled firewalls are enough for basic security for most users, while dedicated firewall software (or even more advanced hardware-based firewalls) are generally for large corporations or organizations, requiring dedicated management by security professionals. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"are-there-any-computers-that-dont-need-antivirus\">Are there any computers that don&rsquo;t need antivirus?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a Windows desktop or laptop that&rsquo;s connected to the internet, you need an antivirus program. Personal computers have been connecting to the internet for over 50 years at this point, and viruses and other malware designed to infect them have been spreading for just as long. Browsing the web without some kind of protection in place is kind of like swimming in sewage: sooner or later, you&rsquo;re going to get an infection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Windows PCs have built-in protection in the form of Windows Security, a basic antivirus and firewall suite that&rsquo;s included free with the operating system. So, as long as you can keep that updated (which it does automatically through Windows Update), you&rsquo;re covered at the basic level. But what about other devices that connect to the internet, like your phone, tablet, your smart TV, or even connected devices like your security cameras or smart lights? </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Bitdefender App Anomaly Detection Android\" class=\"wp-image-1925532\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitdefender-app-anomaly-detection.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Smartphones have become so ubiquitous that, yes, there are viruses and malware out there designed to infect them. They&rsquo;re especially tempting for criminals because so much personal information is stored on them. But unlike desktops and laptops, iOS and (most) Android phones can&rsquo;t download just any program out there, they have to go to the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Apple App Store or Google Play Store to get apps and games. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple and Google control the security for these programs on the server end. It&rsquo;s not a perfect system &mdash; viruses, spyware, and malware have <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/443943/report-malwareinfected-android-apps-spike-in-the-google-play-store.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gotten through their detection filters before</a>. But for the vast majority of users, this basic level of protection is enough that they don&rsquo;t need to run extra anti-virus software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Android phones are a bit of a special case here. Unlike iPhones, most Android devices can install programs that haven&rsquo;t been pre-approved by Google in a process called side-loading. This is similar to installing a third-party program on Windows. And just like Windows, you need to be careful that you trust the source of the download if you install this software. Even here, Google has implemented a system called <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398335/google-play-protect-app-defense-alliance.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Play Protect</a> that performs basic antivirus and anti-malware scanning for all apps, even those that are sideloaded. If you want even more protection, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/694614/best-free-antivirus-for-android.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it&rsquo;s available</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same general principle applies to any device that gets its content and apps from managed sources, and doesn&rsquo;t include open-ended access to the web, like smart TVs, e-readers, smart watches, et cetera. So long as the company managing the content keeps an eye on it, you really don&rsquo;t have to worry about viruses made specifically for those devices, especially since there&rsquo;s not much personal information at stake. That&rsquo;s not a universal rule&mdash;it&rsquo;s possible for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/home-security-cameras/wyze-didnt-completely-fix-security-camera-flaws-for-3-years-a3726294358/&amp;xcust=2-2-1974484-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">almost any connected device</a> to be compromised&mdash;but these gadgets are much lower priorities for malefactors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-windows-defender-a-good-antivirus-solution\">Is Windows Defender a good antivirus solution? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The default security settings that came with Windows weren&rsquo;t always up to snuff. Twenty years ago, you&rsquo;d be called reckless for running Windows without any kind of add-on security software. But Microsoft has made a dedicated and admirable effort to make Windows much safer without needing any extras, paid or otherwise. So the simple answer is, yes, Windows Defender is pretty great. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows Defender virus scan\" class=\"wp-image-1976823\" height=\"749\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-defender-virus-scan.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The antivirus scanner built into Windows is constantly updated with the latest threat detection, and said updates are baked right into Windows itself. Most of the time you won&rsquo;t even notice it running in the background, unless it directly detects and neutralizes a threat. Ditto for the basic built-in firewall in Windows Security: Aside from the occasional tweak necessary to grant network access to third-party apps and games, you&rsquo;ll probably forget it&rsquo;s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re running Windows and you don&rsquo;t have any cash to spare for more robust security, relax. You&rsquo;ll still be fine as long as you keep your computer updated through Windows Update, and don&rsquo;t go seeking out especially sketchy software. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-norton-360-a-good-antivirus-solution\">Is Norton 360 a good antivirus solution? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Norton is a great choice if your store important or sensitive data on your PC, or you share it with other users who may not have the best judgment. In addition to standard file scanning, the subscription includes access to a VPN, dark web monitoring to alert you when your accounts have been compromised, free cloud storage, and a password monitor. It&rsquo;s pricey, but a good choice for a &ldquo;total package&rdquo; security solution for up to five devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393283/norton-360-deluxe-antivirus-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Norton 360 Deluxe review here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-avast-antivirus-any-good\">Is Avast antivirus any good? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avast has been in the game for a long time, and it remains a solid choice that&rsquo;s less expensive than Norton.

I don&rsquo;t really game much on PC currently (and when I do, it&rsquo;s with a controller), so when it came time to assign <em>something</em> to those macro keys, I realized they could help me in my daily tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not already familiar with macro keys, they allow you to assign commands or an app to a single key. While a keyboard shortcut is fast, a macro key is even faster. Just strike one key and a whole wealth of key presses can be relayed to Windows. Here are some examples of ways you can put a macro key to work:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Instant mute and unmute in Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet calls</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Insertion of text or symbols you use often (e.g., email signature, em dash, table flip kaomoji)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open an often-used program (e.g., Calculator, Photoshop, etc)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>String together multiple commands</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Gaming keyboard with macro keys (Keychron Q11 QMK)\" class=\"wp-image-1955636\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2973.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Macro keys have made my daily work more efficient.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Alaina Yee / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>More expensive models (like the Keychron Q11 and those that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html\">my colleague Michael Crider reviews regularly</a>) let you program the whole board, but you don&rsquo;t need to go that luxe.

At that price, they&rsquo;re soldered on, so what&rsquo;s offered is what you get&mdash;and a good number of budget boards come with red switches, which are more easily activated. While ideal for gaming, some typists can find them to be too sensitive, so you may have to hunt around to find something that you&rsquo;ll like. (For example, if you&rsquo;re fine with membrane switches, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-K55-RGB-PRO-Backlighting/dp/B09ZVLBP4M/&amp;xcust=2-2-1955631-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Corsair K55 variant</a> may feel more familiar and thus more comfortable when tapping away on it). You can go for a keyboard with hot-swappable switches instead, which opens up a huge range of switch options, but expect to pay for the privilege.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to move to a gaming keyboard if you like your current keyboard, of course&mdash;you can instead buy a macro deck like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407162/elgato-stream-deck-review.html\">Elgato Stream Deck</a> instead. But the Stream Deck costs at least three times as much as the cheapest gaming keyboard with macro keys. It can also be overkill if you only want a handful of macro keys, and it takes up additional space on a desk. Alternatives exist like creating your own virtual macro deck with Touch Portal&rsquo;s excellent software, but you have to have your phone or tablet nearby with that app open. I prefer the more streamlined approach of having an extra inch on my keyboard dedicated to macro keys.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"elgato-stream-deck\">Elgato Stream Deck</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Elgato Stream Deck\" class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41lknlGU7RL.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407162/elgato-stream-deck-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>As for what I have my macro keys set to?

The good news is that the drive set a record in our 48GB transfers, blasting its way past the previous record holder&mdash;the PCIe 4.0, host memory bus <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966808/wd-blue-sn580-nvme-ssd-review.html\">WD SN580</a>.

Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;low&rdquo; points were that FireCuda 540 lost to both PCIe 5.0 competitors by a hair in the synthetic benchmarks (CrystalDiskMark 8 and AS SSD 2.0) and lagged considerably behind them in the 450GB write. Of course, those fifth-gen competitors were both 2TB drives, while Seagate sent us the 1TB version of the 540. That means less secondary cache and slower times in that test.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Seagate provides a very generous TBW rating, and also provides data rescue for three years should something monstrously evil befall the drive.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Seagate FireCuda 540 48Gb\" class=\"wp-image-1976954\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Seagate-FireCuda-540-48GB-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>The Seagate FireCuda 540 trounced the competition in our 48GB transfers.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The FireCuda also behaved a bit oddly during the 450GB write. Normally, we see the top speed sustained until the secondary cache runs out, then a drop to the NAND&rsquo;s native write speed (usually 250Mbps to 450Mbps). The 540 on the other hand started out at top speed (over 3GBps), then about a quarter of the way in dropped to around 1.7GBps and stayed there until the write was completed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overall time was acceptable in the grand scheme, but not on par for fifth-gen, with the aforementioned caveat concerning capacity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Seagate FireCuda 540 450GB\" class=\"wp-image-1976955\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Seagate-FireCuda-540-450GB-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>The Seagate FireCuda 540 didn&rsquo;t fare particularly well in the 450GB write.

Some of the latest HMB PCIe 4.0 designs such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966808/wd-blue-sn580-nvme-ssd-review.html\">WD Blue SN580</a> listed in the charts or the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933516/sabrent-rocket-q4-nvme-ssd-review.html\">Sabrent Rocket Q4</a> are also very fast at our 48GB transfers.

When Xbox Game Pass Ultimate first launched, early adopters discovered that if you activated one month of Game Pass Ultimate on an account, it converted existing Xbox Live Gold and standard Xbox Game Pass subscriptions to Ultimate at a 1:1 rate.

Currently, the conversion rate is 3:2. You&rsquo;ll now pay about $8.20 per month using this conversion hack. Not as good as $5 per month (the old deal), but still a sizable discount nonetheless. The list price for Ultimate is $17 per month, and even standard <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/397595/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-games-price.html\">PC Game Pass</a> costs more at $10 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>Looking to load up on Xbox Live Gold at a discount?

We also explain <em>why</em> you should buy our recommendations at the end of this story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on what we saw at last year&rsquo;s Prime Day, many of Amazon&rsquo;s deals were exclusive to Prime members. You may want to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402239/how-to-get-amazon-prime-for-free.html\">sign up for Amazon Prime (for free</a>) to take advantage of all of Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day Chromebook deals. We&rsquo;ll update this page frequently through July 11 and 12, when Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"best-early-prime-day-chromebook-deals\">Best early Prime Day Chromebook deals </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-14-chromebook-intel-celeron-4gb-memory-64gb-emmc-modern-gray%2F6513217.p%3FskuId%3D6513217&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP 14-inch Chromebook (14a-ne0013dx)</a>, Celeron N4120/4GB RAM/64GB SSD, 14-inch 768p display, <strong>$149.00 (50% off at Best Buy)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Acer-317-17-3-Celeron-4GB-64GB-Chromebook-Full-HD-IPS-Display-Intel-N4500-4GB-LPDDR4X-64GB-eMMC-Wireless-Wi-Fi-6-AX201-802-11ax-Bluetooth-5-1-Chrome-/992069312&amp;xcust=2-1-796384-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acer 317</a>, Celeron N4500/4GB RAM/64GB SSD, 17.3-inch 1080p display, <strong>$189.99 (16% off at Walmart)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/samsung-chromebook-celeron-processor-xe350xba-k02us/dp/b07xqqrcg5&amp;xcust=2-1-796384-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samsung Chromebook 4+</a>, Celeron N4000/4GB RAM/64GB SSD, 15.6-inch 1080p display, <strong>$219.00 (32% off at Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Chromebook-MediaTek-Processor-81JW0000US/dp/B07GLV1VC7&amp;xcust=2-1-796384-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lenovo Chromebook S330</a>, MediaTek MT8173C/4GB RAM/64GB SSD, 14-inch 1080p display, <strong>$194.00 (~30% off at Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Chromebook-i3-1115G4-Processor-82M7000SUX/dp/B08YKFTZH6&amp;xcust=2-1-796384-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lenovo Flex 5i 13</a>, Core i3-1115G4/8GB RAM/64GB SSD, 13.3-inch 1080p display, <strong>$365.00 (~26% off at Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-15-6-full-hd-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ufs-mineral-silver%2F6535995.p%3FskuId%3D6535995&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP 15.6-inch Chromebook (15a-nb0023dx)</a>, Core i3-N305/8GB RAM/128GB SSD, 15.6-inch 1080p display, <strong>$369.00 (26% off at Best Buy)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We generally expect Chromebook deals to be priced between $170 to $250 or so, depending on the configuration. Keep in mind that retailers will dump older Chromebooks for less than $100 &mdash; we take a close look at these to determine whether they&rsquo;re trash or treasure. We&rsquo;ve factored in the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394216/google-is-working-to-solve-the-chromebooks-support-problem.html\">Chromebook support window</a> to our recommendations, which tends to extend for between two to five years on discounted Chromebooks. We prioritize modern, more powerful Chromebook processors, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the Chromebooks listed here are just slightly more expensive than their Prime Day 2022 lows; the Acer 317, for example, is just $20 more, and the Lenovo Chromebook S330 is essentially the same price. We like the S330&rsquo;s price, but be wary: support runs out in June 2025. It&rsquo;s also unusual for HP&rsquo;s 15.5-inch Chromebook to receive a discount, as its up-to-date i3 chip was released in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"what-to-think-about-when-buying-a-chromebook\">What to think about when buying a Chromebook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, Chromebooks tend to fall into three categories: ultracheap models at about $100, which can offer solid discounts but can hide gotchas like a subpar screen; midrange $200-$350 Chromebooks, the typical price point; and premium Chromebooks at $500 and above. The latter are essentially PC laptops with Google&rsquo;s Chrome OS on top, and might be too expensive for your tastes. Our story recommending <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1976934/why-you-should-choose-a-chromebook-over-a-laptop.html\">Chromebooks over laptops</a> may help you decide, as might our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">recommendations for the best Chromebook</a>. We have a more detailed comparison of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html\">laptops versus Chromebooks</a>, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discounted Chromebooks used to cut corners, like using 768p screens. We try to highlight more eye-pleasing 1080p screens, but smaller Chromebooks may look just fine with an older screen instead. Unlike a laptop, you should worry less about the processor: an Intel Core chip guarantees solid performance, but Celerons are much more common. Don&rsquo;t snub either a Qualcomm Snapdragon or Mediatek Arm chip, either. Instead, Chromebooks with more memory generally perform a bit better. Consider a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">USB-C dongle</a> to connect to an external display, if it doesn&rsquo;t already come with an HDMI port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated on July 7, 2023 to reflect early Amazon Prime Day 2023 sales.</em></p>\n\nChromebooks</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/796384/early-prime-day-chromebook-deals-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-07T00:02:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
