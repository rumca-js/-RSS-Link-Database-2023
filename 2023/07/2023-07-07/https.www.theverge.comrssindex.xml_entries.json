While the court handed out a 2.5-year prison sentence, <em>Jiji</em> reports that it was suspended by four years.</p>\n<p id=\"D6Dl5G\">That means Naka shouldn\u2019t wind up behind bars anytime soon, as judges typically waive the prison sentence if the defendant doesn\u2019t commit any additional crimes during that period of time.
