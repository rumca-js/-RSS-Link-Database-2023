You folks asked for it last, week, and here it is: how to get into wargaming for CHEAP - less than $100! From paints to tools to models to rules, all for less than 100 bucks.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
