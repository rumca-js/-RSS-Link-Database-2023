<p>Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic will be the founding members of the Frontier Model Forum, an umbrella group for the generative AI industry. The group plans to focus on safety research, as well as the identification of best practices, public policy, and use cases for the rapidly advancing technology that can benefit society as a whole.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">statement issued by the four companies</a> Wednesday, the Forum will offer membership to organizations that design and develop large-scale generative AI tools and platforms that push the boundaries of what’s currently possible in the field. The group says those “frontier” models require participating organizations to “demonstrate a strong commitment to frontier model safety,” and to be “willing to contribute to advancing the Forum’s efforts by participating in joint initiatives.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703509/major-generative-ai-players-join-to-create-the-frontier-model-forum.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Work management company monday.com has announced the initial rollout of its new mondayDB data infrastructure, built to underpin the company’s Work OS platform and help boost customers’ usage of the system.</p><p>Described by the company as having a schemaless architecture — meaning that it has no predefined structure for how data is organized and stored — mondayDB strengthens the Work OS platform on top of which all of monday.com’s suite of products are built. This will allow the Work OS system to better cope with the technical challenges associated with the flexibility that the company wants to offer its customers.</p><p>“With traditional project management tools… each task or project has a rigid structure with a due date, assignees, and so forth,” said Daniel Lereya, the newly appointed chief product and technology officer at monday.com. “But, with monday, one customer can decide to use the platform for bug reporting, while another might use it to track shipments or assign people to shifts.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703228/new-mondaycom-data-infrastructure-to-speed-platform-performance.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>When you talk about <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700795/google-pixel-fold.html">Google's Pixel Fold</a>, it's tough not to focus mostly on the phone's form.</p><p>I mean, this is a device whose screen <i>folds in half</i>, for cryin' out loud! It may not be the first Android phone to feature that feat, but still: It's without a doubt the device's defining characteristic. And it's quite a sight to see, even in passing, and even more so to experience in your own pockets and person-paws.</p><p>While it's easy to obsess over the Fold's fold, though, we've <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700795/">been there and done that</a> at this point. And now that I've personally been totin' the Pixel Fold around in my pantaloons for a solid month (somehow!), I want to move beyond the surface and focus a little more closely on what might actually be the Fold's most significant innovation from an Android-wide, platform perspective.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703214/google-pixel-fold-android.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
