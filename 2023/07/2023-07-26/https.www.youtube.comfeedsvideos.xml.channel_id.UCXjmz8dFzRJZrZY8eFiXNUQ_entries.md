Sacha Baron Cohen, known for his roles as Ali G, Borat, and Bruno, was one of the pioneers of the modern prank show.  Of course shows like Candid Camera existed before Ali G took screens by storm, but Sacha Baron Cohen was able to master the art from and inspire countless others like Eric Andre, Punkd,  or the cast of Jackass.  Even transitioning to the big screen with all three characters, Ali G, Borat, and Bruno cemented Sacha Baron Cohen as the king of the prank show.
