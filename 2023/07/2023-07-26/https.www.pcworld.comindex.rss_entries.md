## Vivaldi, Mozilla raise alarms over Google’s proposed ‘DRM for the Web’

<p>A proposed Google specification for ensuring trust on the Web has come under fire for potentially giving websites control over which browsers have the right to access them &mdash; and potentially blocking an unwanted browser from accessing a site owned by Google or Microsoft.</p>



<p>At issue is what Google calls Web Environment Integrity, described in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this explainer</a> uploaded to GitHub by several Google engineers. The proposal has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">drawn fire by both Vivaldi</a> as well as Brian Grinstead, a senior principal engineer at Firefox developer Mozilla, who <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/852#issuecomment-1648820747&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a> that his company opposes the proposal as well.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what Web Environment Integrity would do, according to Google&rsquo;s proposal. WEI assumes that users want to interact with real people on websites, and verify that any software downloaded from a site is legitimate. Those sites, by contrast, want to ensure that the visitors visiting the sites are &ldquo;real,&rdquo; not bots, but without applying a multitude of analytical signals that can identify the user.</p>



<p>What Google proposes doing is allowing sites to ask for a WEI token that describes &ldquo;key facts about the environment their client code is running in,&rdquo; such as whether or not the user is surfing from a secure Android device. It&rsquo;s up to the website to decide whether they trust the token, and therefore the user.</p>



<p>The issue is what would happen if a website rejected a user&rsquo;s token, thereby blocking them. A site like PCWorld might accept all browsers; what smaller browser makers like Vivaldi and Mozilla fear is that a large Web service like Gmail, Google Search, or other sites owned by Google might block users arriving there via a small, alternative browser. </p>



<p>Vivaldi explained its concerns in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. &ldquo;Simply, if an entity has the power of deciding which browsers are trusted and which are not, there is no guarantee that they will trust any given browser,&rdquo; Julian Picalausa, a software developer at the company, wrote. &ldquo;Any new browser would by default not be trusted until they have somehow demonstrated that they are trustworthy, to the discretion of the attesters. Also, anyone stuck running on legacy software where this spec is not supported would eventually be excluded from the web.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;While this seems like a noble motivation, and the use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has already been equated with&nbsp;DRM&nbsp;for websites, with all that it implies,&rdquo; Picalusa added.</p>



<p>This issue has cropped up before, in a different context. Mozilla, for example, has published <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://research.mozilla.org/browser-competition/&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">research</a> noting how operating systems steer users to their own browsers. Microsoft threw up roadblocks to moving away from Edge in Windows 11 before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/557321/microsoft-addresses-windows-11s-browser-choice-problem.html">changing its browser-choice approach</a>. Vivaldi has previously complained about <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vivaldi.com/blog/microsoft-back-to-its-old-tricks-to-get-an-edge-on-the-competition/&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft throwing up ads</a> when you try to download an alternative to Edge. </p>



<p>Both browser companies, therefore, are sensitive to a company like Google potentially sidelining them. As it is, companies like Vivaldi, Mozilla and Opera provide browsers to just a few percent of users on the Web. </p>



<p>WEI&rsquo;s controversy doesn&rsquo;t appear to be ending anytime soon. One of the Google developers, Ben Wiser, noted that the backlash has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/28#issuecomment-1651129388&amp;xcust=2-2-2009730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">shown</a> that a &ldquo;bigger discussion needs to take place.&rdquo; Proponents of an Open Web hope that it will.</p>

<p>Most computers and storage drives still use the common SATA or PCIe 3.0 interfaces to sling your bits of data around, but if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to own a relatively modern PC, you might be able to upgrade to a solid-state drive (SSD) built on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3400176/pcie-40-everything-you-need-to-know-specs-compatibility.html">insanely fast PCIe 4.0 protocol</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve tested several PCIe 4.0 SSDs and the best one to cross our labs thus far is the&nbsp;WD Black SN850X&nbsp;in a field of tough contenders, though it&rsquo;s neck-and-neck with the rival Seagate FireCuda 530. Ultimately, due to its better overall performance, the WD Black SN850X takes our top spot.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more, including what to look for in PCIe 4.0 SSD.</p>



<p><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong>Updated 07/19/2023:</strong> </em></strong></em></strong></em></strong><em><em>We&rsquo;ve added the WD Blue SN580 SSD as our new choice for best budget option.

<p>The WD Black SN850X is a screaming-fast drive and ranks right up next to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394957/seagate-firecuda-530-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FireCuda 530</a> at the top in terms of speed. The reason we chose the WD Black SN850X at <em>the best</em> PCIe 4.0 is that it offers better value for the money&mdash;not only does it give you the same great speed as the FireCuda, but it does so at a lower price per GB. </p>

<p>Also, in terms of overall performance, the SN850X stands out with its excellent real-world transfer rates and outstanding random write performance. In the crowded field of great PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the WD Black SN850X holds it own at the top despite stiff competition.</p>

<p>The FireCuda 530 is a fast drive. We&rsquo;re talking <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> hit the NOS kind of fast. It&rsquo;s still the only drive to write our 450GB test file in less than 200 seconds. Not only that, but it is the fastest drive in both synthetic benchmarks as well as real-world transfers. It also comes with a very high TBW longevity rating, which means you can write more for longer at those breakneck speeds.</p>

<p>The only reason it doesn&rsquo;t take our top spot is that it&rsquo;s a bit pricey compared to the WD Black SN850X which comes close to the FireCuda&rsquo;s speed. Still, if you&rsquo;re main concern is speed and you have some money to burn, the extra cash will give it to you in droves.</p>

<p>Now with the very first signs of PCIe 5.0 drives coming to market, we&rsquo;re finally starting to see companies offering budget PCIe 4.0 NVMe drives at compelling prices. The best of the affordable bunch? The WD Blue SN580 NVMe SSD. At just $50 for a 1TB model at the time of writing you can get your hands on the excellent SN580&mdash;you won&rsquo;t likely find any PCIe 4.0 drives with storage that cheap. And even with the low price you won&rsquo;t be sacrificing any performance here either. In our testing, the SN580 turned out both stellar benchmark and real-world results. Admittedly, it slowed down considerably in the large 450GB transfer test, but seeing as how it&rsquo;s unlikely anyone will write that much contiguous data it likely doesn&rsquo;t matter. When all is said and done, the SN580 is a super-affordable wonderfully high-performing PCIe 4.0 SSD. It simply can&rsquo;t be beat at this price point.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t need a 1TB capacity drive like the Crucial P3 Plus above, or you&rsquo;re just looking to get your hands on a blazing-fast PCIe 4.0 for as little money as possible then the 512GB Adata Legend 850 is worth considering. For only $50 at the time of this writing, you can get the solid Legend 850. The drive scored very well in synthetic benchmark numbers for read scores, and in our real-world 48GB reading and writing test, it scored better than a lot of its peers. The 512GB capacity probably isn&rsquo;t enough to be the main drive in a high-end gaming or content creation PC, but for the average budget gaming PC or laptop it would be a solid foundation or great upgrade.</p>

<p>In the past, you were out of luck if you wanted to upgrade your storage in a smaller-sized device such as a handheld gaming console where the longer 2280 NVMe SSDs wouldn&rsquo;t fit. Luckily, Sabrent has set out to change all of that with its line of Rocket half-sized 2230 small form-factor SSDs, and its latest Rocket Q4 is our favorite. It comes with up to 2TB of capacity and shockingly excellent real-world performance. Its unique feature is that it&rsquo;s only 30mm long, meaning you&rsquo;re able to use it in small devices such as a Steam Deck. </p>

<p>The Rocket drive has great everyday performance and truly impressive real-world transfer speed. During our testing, it cruised through the 48GB and 450GB transfer tests, beating out other zippy full-sized PCIe 4.0 drives. While the Rocket Q4 provides decent enough capacity-to-cost, if your device is able to handle the longer, standard-sized 2280 drives, you&rsquo;ll likely have more options to choose from and might be able to find even better price-for-performance. Regardless, we love this compact SSD and the Sabrent Rocket expertly fits a niche that is only likely to grow more common with devices such as the Steam Deck in the future. </p>

<p>Sure, PCIe 4.0 is great and all, but what if you want to upgrade to PCIe 5.0? If your system features a PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot, and you can afford it, then there is no question you&rsquo;ll get significantly faster read and write speeds. And if you do decide to upgrade, there is currently no better PCIe 5.0 SSD than the Crucial T700. It practically shattered all of our benchmarks for both synthetic and real-world tests. How fast is it? Well, in a side-by-side comparison with the WD Black SN850X, our top pick for best PCIe 4.0, the Crucial T700 almost doubled it in sequential read and write benchmarks, was around 30 percent fast in the 48GB transfer test, and about 25 percent faster in the 450GB transfer tests. Currently, the T700 is undoubtedly the king of the hill by a fair margin when it comes to PCIe 5.0. So if and when you decide to make the change, the Crucial T700 is your best bet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-an-ssd">What to look for in an SSD</h2>



<p>There are a few things to look out for, but most importantly you&rsquo;ll want to focus on capacity, price, and warranty length. Three-year warranties are standard, but some nicer models are guaranteed for up to five years. And unlike the olden days of SSDs, modern drives won&rsquo;t wear out with normal consumer usage, as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-SSD-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead&amp;xcust=2-1-394512-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tech Report</a> tested and proved years ago with a grueling endurance test.</p>



<p>Another crucial thing to watch out for is the technology used to connect the SSD to your PC. For more details and buying advice you can read our in-depth guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3605356/what-type-of-ssd-should-you-buy.html">which type of SSD you should buy</a>.</p>



<ol class="productChart">
<li><strong>SATA</strong>: This refers to both the connection type and the transfer protocol, which is used to connect most 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard drives and SSDs to your PC. SATA III speeds can hit roughly 600MBps, and most&mdash;but not all&mdash;modern drives max it out. (More on that in the next section.)</li>



<li><strong>PCIe</strong>: This interface taps into four of your computer&rsquo;s PCIe lanes to blow away SATA speeds, to the tune of nearly 4GBps over PCIe gen 3. Those sort of face-melting speeds pair nicely with supercharged NVMe drives. Both the PCIe lanes in your motherboard and the M.2 slot in your motherboard can be wired to support the PCIe interface, and you can buy adapters that allow you to slot &ldquo;gumstick&rdquo; M.2 drives into a PCIe lane. PCIe 4.0 drives are significantly faster, but require an AMD Ryzen 3000-series or Intel Core 11th-gen (or newer) processor, along with a compatible PCIe 4.0 motherboard.</li>



<li><strong>NVMe</strong>: Non-Volatile Memory Express technology takes advantage of PCIe&rsquo;s bountiful bandwidth to create blisteringly fast SSDs that blow SATA-based drives out of the water. Check out PCWorld&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2899351/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvme.html">Everything you need to know about NVMe</a>&rdquo; for a nitty-gritty deep-dive.</li>



<li><strong>M.2</strong>: This is where things get tricky. Many people assume M.2 drives all use NVMe technology and PCIe speeds, but that&rsquo;s not true. M.2 is just a form factor. Sure, <em>most</em> M.2 SSDs use NVMe, but some still stick to SATA. Do your homework. Many modern Ultrabooks rely on M.2 for storage.</li>



<li><strong>U.2 and mSATA</strong>: You may also stumble across mSATA and U.2 SSDs, but both motherboard support and product availability are rare for those formats. Some older Ultrabooks included mSATA before M.2 became popular, and drives are still available if you need them.</li>
</ol>



<p>Speed matters, of course, but as we said most modern SSDs saturate the SATA III interface. Not all of them, though.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-ssds">How we test SSDs</h2>



<p>We test SSDs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks (such as CrystalDiskMark 6&rsquo;s various tests) and real-world tests, including 48GB transfers that showcase how a drive performs during common tasks, and also a demanding 450GB transfer test that pushes an SSD&rsquo;s cache performance to the limit. </p>



<p>The PCIe 4.0 testing was done on an MSI MEG X570 motherboard socketing an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-core CPU, using the same Kingston DRAM, cards, and software. All testing is performed on an empty, or nearly empty drive. Note: performance will decrease as the drive fills up.</p>

<p>As soon as your Windows drive runs out of space, the operating system starts to delete files that are probably no longer needed from the recycle bin and your downloads folder. That said, if you want to optimize your storage before running out of free space, you can change the configuration so that older files and folders are automatically removed after a certain time.</p>



<p>Open &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; in the Windows 11 Start menu, select &ldquo;System,&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;Storage&rdquo; on the right-hand side. On the next page, make sure that &ldquo;Storage Sense&rdquo; is active, then click the box. Ensure that the switch for &ldquo;Automatic user content cleanup&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;On,&rdquo; and select the setting &ldquo;Every month&rdquo; in the drop-down menu for &ldquo;Run Storage Sense.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For the &ldquo;Delete files from in my recycle bin if they have been there for over&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delete files in my &lsquo;Downloads&rsquo; folder if they haven&rsquo;t been opened for more than&rdquo; options, select &ldquo;30 days&rdquo; in each case (or another length of time if you prefer). If you want to kick off a clean up immediately, click the &ldquo;Run Storage Sense now&rdquo; button towards the bottom of the options.</p>

## The FCC wants broadband internet speeds to quadruple

<p>The US Federal Communications Commission defines &ldquo;broadband internet&rdquo; as 25 megabits down, 3 megabits up, a standard that hasn&rsquo;t been updated since 2015. If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, the internet looks a bit different than it did eight years ago, with a huge expansion of high-definition streaming video, gameplay, and massive amounts of connected tech filling every home. The FCC is putting forth a proposal to update its definition to a more modern 100mbps down, 25mbps up. </p>



<p>The brief, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-395473A1.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-2009098-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three-paragraph announcement</a> comes directly from the FCC&rsquo;s Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, noting that the much longer notice of inquiry &ldquo;discusses a range of evidence supporting this standard.&rdquo; If adopted, service providers in the United States would need to make sure that their networks can reliably hit that 100/20 target in order to advertise internet speeds as &ldquo;broadband.&rdquo; </p>



<p>As anyone on a restricted or congested network can tell you, 25mbps can feel pretty pokey, especially during peak hours when everyone and their dog is streaming the latest bingeable shows and hopping on their buddy&rsquo;s <em>Minecraft </em>server. Upload speeds in particular are a point of pain for anyone who streams from their own hardware, or has the occasional Zoom meeting from home. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/fcc-chair-proposes-raising-the-broadband-definition-to-100mbps-down-20mbps&amp;xcust=2-1-2009098-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As PCMag points out</a>, while fiber optic connections should be able to hit 100/20 easily, older cable networks might struggle with the upload speeds of a more demanding definition.</p>



<p>Seeing the standard updated would be a boon to the often patchy connections in the United States. The news brief says that a future national goal of one gigabit per second down, 500mbps up may be considered, though there&rsquo;s no timeline for that change or mention of how it might be encouraged. </p>

</div>


<p>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it&rsquo;s SuperDock! But what makes Sonnet&rsquo;s latest Thunderbolt 4 laptop docking station so super?</p>



<p>The super-ness is not the 19 top-end ports, although these are certainly impressive. It&rsquo;s not the 2.5x faster Ethernet connection. And it&rsquo;s not the backward-compatible Thunderbolt 4 technology that is certified to the very latest Intel standards.</p>



<p>What makes the Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock so super is its built-in M.2 NVMe SSD slot which means you can add up to 8TB of SSD storage to your system without connecting an external storage device to the dock or computer.</p>



<p>But first, let&rsquo;s look at the abundance of ports this dock boasts to connect devices at top speed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock ports" class="wp-image-1978721" height="607" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonnet-Echo-20-Thunderbolt-4-SuperDock-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="specs-and-features">Specs and features</h2>



<p>The Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock has a copious 19 ports. The &ldquo;20&rdquo; in the Echo 20&rsquo;s name includes the power supply port, which we don&rsquo;t usually count in our port countdown.</p>



<ul>
<li>One upstream Thunderbolt 4 port (40Gbps, 100W)</li>



<li>Two downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports (40Gbps, 15W)</li>



<li>One HDMI 2.1 video port</li>



<li>Four USB-A ports (10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>



<li>Four USB-C ports (10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>



<li>Internal M.2 NVMe SSD slot</li>



<li>2.5 Gigabit Ethernet</li>



<li>UHS-II SD card reader (312MBps)</li>



<li>3.5mm combo audio jack (front)</li>



<li>3.5mm microphone jack (back)</li>



<li>Two (right and left channels) line out RCA jacks (back)</li>



<li>150W power supply</li>
</ul>



<p>The Echo 20 has more ports than we&rsquo;ve seen with any docking station. Even the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/723026/caldigit-thunderbolt-station-4-ts4-review.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2007704-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Caldigit TS4 Dock</a> has only (!) 18, and it&rsquo;s this kind of Thunderbolt 4 docks that Sonnet is gunning for. Read our fuller roundup of our other recommendations for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="thunderbolt-4-usb-c-and-usb-a-ports">Thunderbolt 4, USB-C and USB-A ports&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>



<p>All the Echo 20&rsquo;s USB ports are at least 10Gbps (twice the bandwidth of the many docks&rsquo; USB ports). The TS4 has as many (8) but the Echo 20 has one more USB-C, while the TS4 has the extra USB-A. As more devices eschew Type A for Type C, we applaud Sonnet for having as many USB-C as USB-A.</p>



<p>You can daisy-chain up to six Thunderbolt devices via the two downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, although the devices connected will be sharing the 40Gbps bandwidth upstream to the laptop.</p>



<p>Rather than add the maximum possible three downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, Sonnet includes two plus a high-end HDMI 2.1 video port so the user can add a direct external display without the need for an adapter. </p>



<p>If you plan to connect an HDMI display, that makes more sense than a third Thunderbolt 4 port.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock SSD slot" class="wp-image-1978587" height="735" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonnet-Echo-20-Thunderbolt-4-SuperDock-SSD-slot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="adding-internal-storage">Adding internal storage</h2>



<p>The Echo 20 doesn&rsquo;t ship with an SSD, so you need to purchase one yourself. A 1TB SSD can be found for under $50, 2TB for around $100, 4TB for $250. 8TB SSDs can cost between $800 and $1,000.</p>



<p>It must be an M.2 NVMe SSD. With the right SSD, transfer and access data rates are up to 800MBps.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock SSSD installation" class="wp-image-1978677" height="748" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonnet-Echo-20-Thunderbolt-4-SuperDock-SSD-install.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>SSD installation is simple if you know how to use a screwdriver and don&rsquo;t have shaky hands. Unscrew the two screws securing a panel cover on the back panel of the dock. Insert the SSD and re-secure the bottom cover.</p>



<p>However, we would have preferred Sonnet to include the correct screwdrivers with the dock as what you need&mdash;a tiny crosshead&mdash;may not be in the average toolbox.</p>



<p>The Echo 20 isn&rsquo;t heavy but even with its compact power supply it&rsquo;s not particularly portable, so what you store on that SSD isn&rsquo;t going with you when you disconnect the laptop from the dock. It&rsquo;s great for backups, archiving, and for large files you don&rsquo;t need with you on the road.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also a fast SD card reader for more portable storage&hellip;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="portable-storage">Portable storage</h2>



<p>The Echo 20 features just one SD card reader for portable storage, while the TS4 has both SD and MicroSD readers.</p>



<p>Having both formats offers more flexibility, and the two slots can be used at the same time, so the TS4 wins if you prefer portable storage to be installed.</p>



<p>Most MicroSD cards come with an SD adapter so the lack of MicroSD doesn&rsquo;t stop you from choosing between the two memory-card formats on the Echo 20. MicroSD cards are usually cheaper than full-size SD.</p>



<p>Tiny memory cards were once the preserve of professional users such as photographers who use them to quickly transfer files. However, anyone can buy a quality 512GB card for around $75/&pound;75, and they offer an inexpensive way of upping the storage in your laptop and are super portable, too.</p>



<p>The Echo 20&rsquo;s UHS II SD card reader is rated fast at 312MBps&mdash;the same as the TS4&rsquo;s.</p>



<p>As with other docks, if you prefer portable storage there are other options, too. For example, you could add a pocketable SSD enclosure, such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Enclosure-External-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B08DNR22Q7&amp;xcust=2-1-2007704-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ugreen&rsquo;s M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure Adapter</a>, available for around $30 (also not including the SSD itself).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock 4K display" class="wp-image-1978722" height="856" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonnet-Echo-20-Thunderbolt-4-SuperDock-4K-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dock-display-options">Dock display options</h2>



<p>You can connect an external display via the HDMI 2.1 port (without the need for an adapter), and another screen via one of the Thunderbolt ports, or two via both the downstream Thunderbolt ports.</p>



<p>Dual-display support means M1/M2 Pro, M1/M2 Max and M1/M2 Ultra Macs can hook up either a single 4K/5K/6K screen or two HD/4K/5K/6K displays.</p>



<p>A Mac with an M2 Pro/Max/Ultra chip can support up to a single 8K display at 60Hz, or two HD/4K/5K/6K displays (both 4K at 60Hz).</p>



<p>Windows PCs and Chromebooks sporting Thunderbolt 4 can support up to a single 8K display at 60Hz, or two HD/4K displays at 60Hz.</p>



<p>An interesting difference between the Echo 20 (HDMI 2.1) and the Caldigit TS4 (DisplayPort 1.4) is the choice of video port.</p>



<p>HDMI is the more popular port on displays but DisplayPort has traditionally been superior on the specs front. However, HDMI 2.1 has more than caught up with DP 1.4 so is a fine option even for high-end pros. HDMI 2.1 is a big leap up from HDMI 2.0, which is found on most other docking stations with a video port.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="audio-ports-front-and-back">Audio ports front and back</h2>



<p>Visuals aren&rsquo;t the Echo 20&rsquo;s only strength. There are four audio ports available. At the front is a 3.5mm combo jack for either wired headphones or a microphone, and at the back are separate left/right channel RCA line-out jacks that can deliver a clean signal to powered speakers or an amplifier, plus an extra 3.5mm microphone jack.</p>



<p>The TS4&rsquo;s three audio ports are all 3.5mm. While there is no noticeable difference in sound quality between RCA and 3.5mm connectors, a lot of consumer A/V equipment still supports RCA connectors, which also provide a more secure connection than 3.5mm connectors.</p>



<p>Audio enthusiasts would prefer a Digital Audio port to connect directly to their amplifier, speakers, or home theatre receiver for the highest-quality, pure audio playback, but the audio ports on the Echo 20 will be good enough for most users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="super-fast-ethernet">Super-fast Ethernet</h2>



<p>Another bid for &ldquo;Super&rdquo; status is the Echo 20&rsquo;s super-fast 2.5Gb Gigabit Ethernet, which has the potential to be 2.5 times faster than standard Gigabit Ethernet. This again matches the wired-network port on the TS4.</p>



<p>To take advantage of the 2.5GbE speed, you need a connected device&mdash;such as a router/network switch&mdash;that is 2.5GbE or above</p>



<p>The 2.5Gb Ethernet port is backwards and forwards compatible with other speeds of Ethernet, so will work with a standard Gigabit Ethernet network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="docking-power">Docking power</h2>



<p>With 100W Power Delivery (PD), the Echo 20 can keep even the largest connected laptop powered up in full use.</p>



<p>Each USB port on the Echo 20 has a minimum charging power of 7.5W, and the downstream TB4 ports can offer 15W to power connected devices.</p>



<p>While this is impressive, it&rsquo;s one area where the Caldigit TS4 has more muscle. Its 230W power supply is the most powered-up docking station we&rsquo;ve ever tested, and one of the front USB-C ports can charge at a generous 20W&ndash;enough, for example, for fast-charging an iPhone via USB-C.</p>



<p>The Echo 20&rsquo;s 150W power supply should, however, be powerful enough to charge a 100W laptop and have enough left for a few connected devices.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock design" class="wp-image-1978724" height="662" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonnet-Echo-20-Thunderbolt-4-SuperDock-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="design">Design</h2>



<p>Docking stations either lie horizontally, like the Echo 20, or stand vertically, like the TS4. Vertical docks save desk space but horizontal docks can offer a cleaner look.</p>



<p>Personally, I prefer the vertical design, but most docks, if doing their job correctly, soon blend into their desktop environment anyway.</p>



<p>Most docks place the upstream Thunderbolt 4 port (to the host laptop) at the front, which means a trailing cable messing up your desk. Both the Echo 20 and TS4 handily position the upstream port at the back of the dock.</p>



<p>The Echo 20 is jet black, while the TS4 is metal gray, although this is unlikely to be a decider when choosing between these two excellent two docking stations.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock USB" class="wp-image-1978727" height="459" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonnet-Echo-20-Thunderbolt-4-SuperDock-USB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sonnet</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="price">Price</h2>



<p>The Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock costs $299.99, which measures up very favorably against the Caldigit TS4&rsquo;s $399.99 and other Thunderbolt 4 docks such as Kensington&rsquo;s SD5700T ($369.99).</p>



<p>Given its top-end specs, this is easily the best-value Thunderbolt 4 dock we have tested.</p>



<p>Note that there&rsquo;s no SSD included with the Echo 20 so you need to factor in this if you want to add the internal storage, but it&rsquo;s not even an option with other docks so doesn&rsquo;t spoil the comparison.</p>



<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t need the SSD enclosure now, the Echo 20 still represents great value for money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>We didn&rsquo;t think that Caldigit&rsquo;s TS4 could be beaten but the Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock is a very close match for the number and quality of ports but for $100 less.</p>



<p>It lacks a MicroSD card reader and doesn&rsquo;t offer as much multi-device power, but it has other benefits&mdash;most noticeably the internal storage enclosure&mdash;and is specced high enough for most users.</p>



<p>The 19 ports are all top-end&mdash;Thunderbolt 4, 10Gbps USB-C and USB-A, 2.5Gb Ethernet, HDMI 2.1&mdash;and the inclusion of the onboard M.2 NVMe SSD slot gives the Echo 20 our crown as the new Thunderbolt 4 docking station of choice.</p>

## OpenAI’s ChatGPT is too good for its own AI to detect

<p>OpenAI has shut down Classifier, its AI tool to detect AI-written work, because of what we discovered at its launch: It stinks.</p>



<p>When OpenAI launched Classifier in January, it was supposed to have been smart enough to detect when a user (say, a student) used ChatGPT or another AI program to author a work. OpenAI pitched Classifier as a way for a teacher to identify if an essay, for example, had been authored by AI instead of as an original work.</p>



<p>But the tool <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499149/chatgpts-creator-releases-tool-for-detecting-ai-text-and-it-stinks.html">struggled when we tested it</a>, including identifying famous works as AI-authored. Instead of fixing the problems, OpenAI has apparently just shut it down. The Classifier page is blank, and OpenAI added this to the original announcement of the Classifier tool:</p>



<p>&ldquo;<em>As of July 20, 2023, the AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy. We are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text, and have made a commitment to develop and deploy mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated.</em>&ldquo;</p>



<p>At the time Classifier launched, OpenAI said that the classifier identified 26 percent of AI-authored text as authentically human, and deemed 9 percent of text written by a human as AI-authored.</p>



<p>Our tests previously found that a rival service, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection&amp;xcust=2-1-1499149-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499149/chatgpts-creator-releases-tool-for-detecting-ai-text-and-it-stinks.html">Hive Moderation</a>, seemed to work. The tool is a free AI detection tool which performs the same function, but returns a confidence percentage, or the likelihood that the text sample contains AI text.</p>



<p>Students have loudly complained online that even when they do write original essays, flawed AI detection apps can trip them up. With honor codes at universities and high schools allowing little latitude for plagiarism, one false positive can doom a student&rsquo;s academic career. It&rsquo;s possible that Classifier&rsquo;s demise will be used as a reason to reconsider how educational institutions deal with the issue.</p>

## Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab S9 tablets should control your PC

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Samsung has launched its new Galaxy Tab S9 series of tablets at its Unpacked conference in Korea, with an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset and the Dynamic AMOLED 2X display that has graced Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy line of PCs. But there&rsquo;s a potential feature that got our hopes up: remotely controlling your PC via the new Tabs.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: though Samsung executives implied that the new Galaxy Tab S9 series would be able to remotely-access your PC, they unfortunately don&rsquo;t. But it prompted us to wonder: why not?</p>



<p>Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab S9, S9+, and S9 Ultra at its Unpacked event in Korea. The 11-inch Tab S9 will be priced at $799.99 on up; the 12.4-inch Tab S9+ will start at $999, and the 14.6-inch S9 Ultra will be priced at $1,199.99 and up. (If you preorder a Samsung Tab S9 Ultra or S9+ with 256GB of storage, you&rsquo;ll get a 512GB upgrade.) Samsung will also offer an S9+5G, a 5G-connected tablet that will be priced starting at $1,149.99.</p>



<p>For years Samsung has tried to assemble the Galaxy lineup of watches, tablets, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486723/samsung-reveals-galaxy-book3-oled-laptops.html">Galaxy PC laptops</a> and phones into a coherent ecosystem, with apps and services connecting them together. Though all of the devices save the PC lineup use the Android operating system and can tap Google&rsquo;s own apps, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1536118/samsungs-pc.html">Samsung has authored its own Galaxy software</a> to connect them together, including Multi Control, Samsung Flow, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831794/how-to-use-samsungs-galaxy-tab-as-a-second-pc-display.html">connecting your Tab to your PC via Second Screen</a>, Quick Share, and more.</p>



<p>Being able to connect a second screen to your PC has been a feature of Windows for years dating back to Windows 8. People can use it to connect to a projector &mdash; or, in this case, a tablet. To date, though, it&rsquo;s usually been a one-way street: you can connect your tablet to your PC, and use the tablet as a second screen for your PC. According to a presentation by Tabitha Baltimore, senior director of product management for Samsung Electroncis America, though, it initially appeared Samsung might allow you to go in either direction.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 series" class="wp-image-2006541" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/094_Galaxy_T9UB5S_pen_pro_2_hands-on_beigegraphite_LI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Samsung has positioned its Tab S9 series as entertainment as well as productivity devices.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Samsung</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;And now, [a] one-click Second Screen makes it even easier to pair with your devices,&rdquo; Baltimore said. &ldquo;Easily launch and view your PC on Tab S9 without the need to toggle on both devices.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That certainly sounded to us like Samsung might be designing its own remote-access control for the PC, but&hellip;nope. A Samsung representative clarified that Samsung&rsquo;s Second Screen feature normally requires the user to toggle on the service on both the Galaxy Book PC and the Tab tablet. Now, the new Tabs don&rsquo;t require Second Screen to be switched on, as it can all be controlled via the PC.</p>



<p>But it does beg the question: why can&rsquo;t you?</p>



<p>There have been apps that allow you to do this: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/627906/chrome-remote-desktop-free-versatile-remote-control-for-google-ites.html">Chrome Remote Desktop</a>, for example, or the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448160/hands-on-with-microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mobile.html">Microsoft Remote Desktop app</a> for Android that Microsoft debuted during the Windows 8.1 era. But Samsung hasn&rsquo;t really thrown its hat in the ring. And that&rsquo;s sort of crazy, because even if you&rsquo;ve never used any of the Samsung-authored sharing apps on its Galaxy Phones, tablets, or PCs, there are just a ton of them. A Galaxy Remote Desktop app kind of sounds like a no-brainer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 edit" class="wp-image-2006544" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/023_Galaxy_Tab_S9_Feature_KV_Multi-tasking_1P_Graphite_LI-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1181" width="1181" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Samsung</p></div>



<p>Otherwise, Samsung doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s improved sharing content between devices by that much; Baltimore claimed that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s now easier&rdquo; to initiate Multi Control, which allows you to treat your tablet and phone(s) as screens that you can control with your PC. you can drop items like texts or images directly between devices.</p>



<p>On the plus side, maybe Samsung&rsquo;s enthusiasm for sharing apps will provide a remote-access app sooner than later?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="whats-new-in-the-galaxy-tab-s9-series">What&rsquo;s new in the Galaxy Tab S9 series</h2>



<p>Samsung&rsquo;s new Galaxy Tab S9 lineup includes Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, which offers slightly higher CPU and GPU clock speeds compared to the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; version Qualcomm offers other vendors. Android 13 is also standard across all of the variants as well, as is quad stereo speakers, on-screen fingerprint authentication, and the option to buy each tablet in either Beige or Graphite.</p>



<p>The new Tab tablets also support <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552421/wi-fi-performance-matters-more-than-you-think.html">Wi-Fi6E, the faster Wi-Fi alternative</a>. Samsung ships an S Pen inside the box, which can charge as it&rsquo;s magnetically connected, in either orientation.</p>

## Wi-Fi 7: A deep-dive into the blistering new wireless standard

<p>A Wi-Fi standard is like a blueprint for technology companies. It defines the specifications according to which Wi-Fi routers and networking gear transmit wireless data to PCs, smartphones, and more. Each standard intends to achieve two goals: Faster Wi-Fi speeds for every connected device and a smooth connection to as many devices as possible.</p>



<p>The new <strong>Wi-Fi 7</strong> (with an official name <strong>802.11be Extremely High Throughput)</strong> aims to achieve this by building on the groundwork of the last two WI-Fi standards and extending them. From Wi-Fi 6, it borrows functions such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) and BSS Coloring, which ensure that even in very large networks every device can transmit data without delay. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcwelt.de/article/1194281/wi-fi-6e-tempo-router.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2005997-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wi-Fi 6E</a> also contributes the 6 GHz transmission frequency, which enables Wi-Fi WLAN speeds.</p>



<p>The advantages of Wi-Fi 7 are already wooing device manufacturers; many companies already offer Wi-Fi 7 devices on the market. Some, such as AVM in Germany, are even skipping Wi-Fi 6E and immediately opting for Wi-Fi 7 in new products. </p>



<p>We explain the advantages of the new Wi-Fi 7 standard, present the first devices, and say for whom and when the switch to 802.11be will prove worthwhile.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Wi-Fi 7 erh&ouml;ht die Bandbreite f&uuml;r WLAN-&Uuml;bertragungen: Wie Wi-Fi 6E unterst&uuml;tzt der Standard die Frequenz 6 GHz, kann dar&uuml;ber aber 320-MHz-Kan&auml;le nutzen." class="wp-image-1999639" height="255" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wifi7-bandwidth.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Wi-Fi 7 increases the bandwidth for Wi-Fi transmissions: Like Wi-Fi 6E, the standard supports the frequency 6 GHz, but can use 320 MHz channels above it.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="the-advantages-of-wi-fi-7">The advantages of Wi-Fi 7</h2>



<p>The IEEE standardization body has been working on Wi-Fi 7 since 2019. The new standard is scheduled to be ready in May 2024, but manufacturers of Wi-Fi chips and the routers, repeaters, and modules equipped with them aren&rsquo;t waiting for the official release. The first Wi-Fi 7 products are based on a highly developed preliminary version of Wi-Fi 7, and the manufacturers will deliver details that are still changing via later firmware updates.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 7 is compatible with the predecessor standards so you can be sure that all existing devices in your home network will connect to a new router. In many cases, it also provides faster speeds for Wi-Fi connections than Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 5 because it uses better antennas or more powerful hardware than your current router.</p>



<p>Every new Wi-Fi standard promises<strong> faster data transfers</strong> and <strong>more stable connections</strong>: These improvements seem more urgent than ever because even in private homes, more and more devices rely on a powerful wireless network &mdash; not only mobile ones like smartphones and notebooks, but also PCs and peripherals as well as devices for smart homes, TVs, and audio systems. </p>



<p>And all those connected devices need ever greater bandwidth for current and future applications; to be able to use an internet connection with gigabit speed or more without breaking, for example, or for uninterrupted video calls in the home office and the wireless connection of AR and VR glasses. Fast, low-latency Wi-Fi also enhances cloud gaming or virtual collaboration on large files in real time. </p>



<p>To achieve all this, Wi-Fi 7 offers a comprehensive set of tools: Wider radio channels, more and faster MIMO streams, as well as numerous features that ensure that many devices transmit simultaneously without interfering with each other.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="more-space-6-ghz-with-320-mhz-channels">More space: 6 GHz with 320 MHz channels</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Zahlreiche L&auml;nder (dunkelgr&uuml;n markiert) haben einen gro&szlig;en Frequenzbereich im 6-GHz-Band freigegeben. In Europa (dunkellila markiert) gibt es weniger Platz und weniger Funkkan&auml;le." class="wp-image-1999640" height="635" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wlan_frequenzbereich_laender.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="849" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Many countries (marked in dark green) have released a large amount of spectrum in the 6 GHz band. In Europe (marked dark purple), there is less space and fewer radio channels.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>As with Wi-Fi 6E, Wi-Fi 7 allows devices to use a third frequency for wireless transmission: In addition to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies, they also operate at <strong>6 GHz</strong>. Since only a few Wi-Fi products have been designed for this frequency so far, a 6 GHz connection usually runs without interference and thus faster. </p>



<p>Wi-Fi 7 accelerates the 6 GHz frequency by allowing radio channels with <strong>320 MHz</strong> over this frequency &mdash; twice as wide as the 160 <strong>MHz</strong> channels over 5 GHz, and thus twice as fast. Devices for the European market can use a single 320 MHz channel because the EU has only released the frequency range from 5945 to 6425 MHz for 6 GHz wireless. In the USA, the spectrum is wider at 5925 to 7125 MHz, which is why three Wi-Fi connections with a 320 MHz channel can transmit side by side over 6 GHz without interference. </p>



<p>An advantage of the European solution? Since no other radio technologies operate in this frequency range, a Wi-Fi 7 router can use 6 GHz without restriction and does not need DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection).</p>



<p>Routers with Wi-Fi 7 must support a channel bandwidth of at least 160 MHz over 6 GHz: This means that three Wi-Fi products can transmit simultaneously on this frequency without interference, even in Europe. At 5 GHz, only two 160 MHz channels are possible &mdash; if a router supports this channel bandwidth at all.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Die zus&auml;tzliche Frequenz 6 GHz bietet genug Platz f&uuml;r Funkkan&auml;le mit 320 MHz Bandbreite &ndash; das ist doppelt so viel wie beim Standard Wi-Fi 6." class="wp-image-1999644" height="379" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7_ghz_frequenz.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="892" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The additional 6 GHz frequency offers enough space for radio channels with 320 MHz bandwidth &ndash; twice as much as Wi-Fi 6.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="wi-fi-7-transmits-up-to-46-gbit-s">Wi-Fi 7 transmits up to 46 GBit/s</h2>



<p>The speed of a Wi-Fi connection depends primarily on the number of data streams (MIMO streams) going from the transmitter to the receiver. With Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6, there are a maximum of eight per frequency; Wi-Fi 7 offers twice as many. This results in a theoretical transmission rate of around 46 GBit/s if a Wi-Fi 7 connection uses 16 MIMO streams and a 320 MHz channel over 6 GHz &mdash; almost five times as much as with Wi-Fi 6.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to see other Wi-Fi 7 devices try to hit those maximum throughput speeds, however; even with Wi-Fi 5 and 6, manufacturers did not develop routers with eight streams per frequency. Some providers claim that their top models support eight or even twelve streams. Similar to advertised Wi-Fi speeds, however, this information refers to the sum of the streams over all frequencies &mdash; for example, in the case of a tri-band router with four streams each for 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz frequencies.</p>



<p>In practice, this information is irrelevant, because wireless transmission between two devices only takes place over one frequency, not simultaneously over several. So far, in any case, because that too is changing with Wi-Fi 7 &mdash; more on that later.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Auch AVM setzt voll auf Wi-Fi 7: Die Fritzbox 6670 Cable mit Kabel-Modem nutzt den neuen WLAN-Standard, arbeitet aber nicht mit der 6-GHz-Frequenz." class="wp-image-1999645" height="560" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fritzbox_6670_cable.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="934" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>AVM is also fully committed to Wi-Fi 7: Germany&rsquo;s  Fritzbox 6670 Cable with cable modem uses the new WLAN standard, but does not work with the 6 GHz frequency.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>As with previous Wi-Fi standards, the top routers for Wi-Fi 7 therefore support a maximum of four MIMO streams per frequency, and notebooks and smartphones will mostly be equipped with Wi-Fi modules that use two MIMO streams. </p>



<p>Compared to similar Wi-Fi 6 devices, however, the new Wi-Fi 7 products can be more than twice as fast in the best cases. For one thing, they can use the 320 MHz channel over 6 GHz, which is twice as wide. In addition, Wi-Fi 7 works with the improved 4096-QAM modulation. This allows data that passes over the radio link to be packed more tightly, which increases the transfer rate. A MIMO stream from Wi-Fi 7 therefore also works faster than a Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 5 stream with the same channel width. </p>



<p>But the higher the modulation, the better the radio quality must be for the tightly packed data to arrive reliably. Wi-Fi-7 devices can therefore only use 4096-QAM in practice under optimal conditions and at short distances.</p>



<p>Top routers with Wi-Fi 7 manage a maximum data rate of 11.5 GBit/s with four MIMO streams (4&times;4) and the 320 MHz channel. In contrast, the fastest routers with Wi-Fi 6 achieve only up to 4.8 GBit/s with 4&times;4 MIMO and 160 MHz channel. </p>



<p>Wi-Fi 7 clients in smartphones and notebooks achieve a similar speed advantage. They work with 2&times;2 MIMO streams and a 320-MHz channel, which results in a maximum data rate of 5.8 GBit/s. That&rsquo;s more than twice as much as the 2.4 GBit/s of Wi-Fi 6 clients with 2&times;2 and a 160-MHz channel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="multi-link-operation">Multi-Link Operation</h2>



<p>With Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Wi-Fi 7 debuts a completely new feature never been seen before in any Wi-Fi standard. </p>



<p>MLO overrides a basic rule that used to apply to every Wi-Fi transmission: data transfer between two devices takes place via exactly one connection (link), i.e. a specific radio channel on a specific frequency. </p>



<p>If, for example, you have given the Wi-Fi connections over 2.4 and 5 GHz different names on a dual-band router, you can only select one for a client like your notebook, although both radio networks establish a connection between the same devices &mdash; router and notebook. This also happens if the client only displays a Wi-Fi SSID because you&rsquo;ve activated functions such as mesh or band steering in your router. In this case, the router decides whether the link to the client is via 2.4 or 5 GHz.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Multi-Link-Operation macht eine WLAN-Verbindung schneller und stabiler, weil zwei Ger&auml;te gleichzeitig &uuml;ber mehrere Frequenzen &uuml;bertragen k&ouml;nnen." class="wp-image-1999648" height="460" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/multi_link.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="691" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Multi-link operation makes a Wi-Fi connection faster and more stable because two devices can transmit simultaneously over several frequencies.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>With MLO, both devices can establish multiple links at the same time. Two tri-band devices, for example, then communicate in parallel over the frequencies 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz. To use MLO, both devices must support this function.</p>



<p>Then they can send data simultaneously over all links to increase the overall Wi-Fi speed. Alternatively, MLO reduces latency and stabilizes the Wi-Fi connection because the devices can flexibly switch to the link with the least interference. If the sender sends the same data over each link, it arrives at the receiver with greater reliability and without interference. If router and client have several radio units, they can also send and receive data simultaneously via MLO: The router then sends data via 5 GHz to the notebook, for example, which in turn sends other data to the router via a 6 GHz link.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="multi-ru-wi-fi-even-more-efficient">Multi-RU: Wi-Fi even more efficient</h2>



<p>If the Wi-Fi on your smartphone or PC seems slow, this is often not because it cannot transmit faster, but because it<em> should not</em> transmit faster. That&rsquo;s because Wi-Fi transmission only takes place when the radio channel is free: the devices fight for access to it, and whoever doesn&rsquo;t get it first has to wait. Since these waiting times are only fractions of a second, this is hardly noticeable for extensive downloads, normal web surfing, or sending e-mails. </p>



<p>On the other hand, it becomes problematic if many Wi-Fi devices in your home network always have to transfer only small amounts of data, but in the shortest possible time &mdash; like for for video calls, for online gaming, for smart home devices, or for working together on files via Teams, One Drive, or Google Docs.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 already addressed this problem with the OFDMA function: This allows the router to divide the radio medium into small units &mdash; so-called resource units (RU) &mdash; which it assigns to different clients. With this, it transmits data to several clients at the same time to make efficient use of the Wi-Fi connection. Think of it like a mail-order company that doesn&rsquo;t deliver orders from three customers in three barely filled trucks, but packs all the orders into one truck.</p>



<p><strong>Wi-Fi 7 improves OFDMA with multi-RU:</strong> Routers with the new standard can then assign more than one RU to individual clients. This increases the transfer rate for these clients and the radio channel can be used even more efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="power-saving-wi-fi-operation">Power-saving Wi-Fi operation</h2>



<p>Devices with a battery or rechargeable battery can use a wireless connection even more economically with Wi-Fi 7. Here, too, the new standard extends a function of Wi-Fi 6: 802.11ax introduced the <strong>Target Wake Time (TWT)</strong>, which the router uses to agree on fixed transmission times with mobile devices. They must only be reachable at this time. Otherwise, they remain in the power-saving sleep state.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 7 introduces the <strong>Restricted Target</strong> Wake Time to ensure that the radio channel is always free for transmissions that absolutely must take place at a fixed time. It stipulates that only the designated client may transmit at this time, all others must vacate the radio channel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="new-routers-with-wi-fi-7">New routers with Wi-Fi 7</h2>



<p>To be able to use the numerous innovations packed into Wi-Fi 7, you need fresh hardware &mdash; i.e. routers and repeaters with Wi-Fi 7 as well as notebooks and smartphones that have a suitable radio module. Numerous manufacturers have announced routers and mesh systems for Wi-Fi 7, and you can already buy some. The available offerings will increase significantly by the end of 2023, including for repeaters as well as notebooks and smartphones.</p>



<p>Switching to Wi-Fi 7 is particularly worthwhile if you rely on high Wi-Fi speeds&ndash; for gaming, for example, but also if you frequently transfer large amounts of data in your home network for backups or video editing. Since Wi-Fi 7 also makes Wi-Fi transfers more stable, devices with the new standard are also a good choice if you have a home network with a large number of Wi-Fi clients or want to cover a large home wirelessly.</p>



<p>Last but not least, a router with Wi-Fi 7 is also a prerequisite for bringing online connections beyond the gigabit limit into your home network without restrictions: Most models have a WAN connection with 2.5 or even 10 GBit/s for this purpose.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>TP-Link announced seven mesh systems and routers with Wi-Fi 7 earlier this year, and two models are already available: The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Archer-BE900-Performance-Supported/dp/B0BRD3P4XV&amp;xcust=2-1-2005997-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$700 Archer BE900</a> is a quad-band router that can establish four Wi-Fi connections over 6 GHz, twice 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz. It can use four MIMO streams on each frequency, which allows data transfers with up to 11.5 Gbit/s over 6 GHz, just under 5.8 Gbit/s each over 5 GHz, and just under 1.4 Gbit/s over 2.4 GHz. </p>



<p>Its two 10-GBit ports can be used for wireless or LAN connections; you can equip one with an adapter module (SFP+) to connect a fiber optic cable for internal networking. Other extras include an LED display that can show the time, Wi-Fi speed, or self-created graphics, among other things, as well as a small touchscreen that shows visitors the QR code for accessing the guest Wi-Fi network.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Deco-BE85-AI-Roaming-HomeShield/dp/B0C4W1L4B3&amp;xcust=2-1-2005997-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$900 Deco BE85</a> is a mesh system for Wi-Fi 7 with two base stations. Each has two 10-GBit and two 2.5-GBit connections, which can be used for Wi-Fi connections to a modem, for LAN connections to home network devices, and for direct connections between the stations (backhaul). Wi-Fi transfer takes place via four MIMO streams per frequency (6 GHz, 5 GHz, 2.4 GHz), resulting in maximum data rates of around 11.5 GBit/s, 5.8 GBit/s and 1.4 GBit/s respectively. According to TP-Link, the high-end mesh system achieves around 9 GBit/s over the 6 GHz link in practice, provided the stations use the 10 GBit link for backhaul. TP-Link also promises a firmware upgrade in autumn that will upgrade the smart home standard Matter.</p>



<p>The Deco BE85 will be followed by cheaper TP-Link mesh systems, such as the Deco B75 and the Deco BE65. Both are tri-band systems. The B75 uses four MIMO streams over 6 GHz and two over the other frequencies, while the BE65 uses two MIMO streams for all three frequencies and uses Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 7 over 2.4 GHz.</p>

<p>The advantages of Wi-Fi 7 can only be fully utilized if your client devices support it, too But you still have to be patient.</p>



<p>There are already some high-end smartphones available with suitable hardware for Wi-Fi 7, such as the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-256gb-unlocked-phantom-black%2F6529723.p%3FskuId%3D6529723&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>, the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fasus-rog-phone-7-cell-phone-6-78-fhd-2448x1080-165hz-6000mah-16gb-ram-512gb-storage-5g-lte-unlocked-dual-sim-storm-white-ai2205-16g512g-wh%2F-%2FA-89409951&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-2005997-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Phone 7</a>, and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-11&amp;xcust=2-1-2005997-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">OnePlus 11.</a></p>



<p>They use Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, which understands the new standard. That said, until recently, Wi-Fi 7 was not activated on any smartphone. Some manufacturers promise to activate the new standard soon via firmware upgrade, while others haven&rsquo;t committed to doing so. The range of Wi-Fi 7 smartphones will increase by the end of the year, as CPU manufacturer Mediatek has also announced Wi-Fi 7-compatible hardware in the form of the Dimensity 9200.</p>



<p>The first notebooks with Wi-Fi 7 should also be available for purchase at the turn of the year. Intel will probably present a suitable Wi-Fi module together with its 14th Core generation Meteor Lake processors, possibly under the model name BE200.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-wi-fi-standards-are-still-to-come">The Wi-Fi standards are still to come</h2>



<p>It takes a long time to develop Wi-Fi standards, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that the corresponding working groups at the IEEE already have many plans for the successors to Wi-Fi 7. The next standard, for example, should include multi-AP operation, which was already planned for Wi-Fi 7. It should enable several routers or access points to transmit data jointly to a Wi-Fi client. This would make data transfer significantly faster and more stable. Furthermore, data rates of over 100 GBit/s are being discussed for a possible Wi-Fi 8 standard, as well as the additional frequency 60 GHz, on which extra-large radio channels with 640 MHz could be used.</p>



<p>The 802.11bf standard is currently being developed as &ldquo;Wi-Fi Sensing.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s intended to evaluate the propagation and deflection of Wi-Fi signals in order to detect, for example, whether people are in a room or moving around. This technology could be used to build Wi-Fi-based alarm systems or smart home devices that automatically switch on or off when someone is nearby or leaves.</p>

</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s 2023 and things are a little dystopian in the laptop space. Users, more concerned with flashy design and light weight than functionality, are flocking to devices that can&rsquo;t be repaired or upgraded. That&rsquo;s what makes the Framework Laptop 13 something unique. It&rsquo;s from a small startup that wants you to have a reliable, long-lasting device that you can use for years to come. If some competitors are fast fashion from Shein, then Framework&rsquo;s aiming to be the American Giant hoodie of laptops&ndash;not the cheapest, but built for the long haul.</p>



<p>To that end, the Framework includes a screwdriver in the box, and has a unique system of modular ports that can be swapped out and changed as needed. It also has RAM and an SSD that can be exchanged for commodity parts in minutes instead of requiring new chips need to be soldered onto the motherboard.</p>



<p>All of this sounds good on paper, but aside from its marketing bullet points, is it a good laptop? Let&rsquo;s find out.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="framework-laptop-13-design-and-build-quality">Framework Laptop 13: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Framework laptop design" class="wp-image-2005959" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-laptop-13-hero-2-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>From photos, the Framework Laptop 13 looks generic. It&rsquo;d win at least runner-up in a MacBook Air lookalike contest, with its black chiclet keyboard and silver, tapered design. The Framework gear logo on the back of the screen seems like some kind of optical illusion&ndash;you can see but it&rsquo;s so inoffensive you&rsquo;re unlikely to recall it. Going hands-on with the device, I was struck by how much it looks like the renders, but thankfully what&rsquo;s kind of a meh design is backed up by robust engineering.</p>



<p>A part of the Framework Laptop&rsquo;s design is its aforementioned repairability. This machine has been designed to be opened quickly, with only 5 screws holding the keyboard down, and magnets helping the rest stick together. That could have been a recipe for flimsiness, but not in the case of the Framework Laptop 13. Not only is this relatively thin device easy to pop open, but it also feels like it could survive long enough to get repairs and upgrades down the road. At this point, Framework has made three generations of compatible Intel Framework 13 motherboards, and is throwing an AMD Ryzen-based motherboard into the mix later this year. Based on this level of support, we&rsquo;re hopeful that you have a chance at upgrading this Framework 13 with a more performant motherboard in the years to come.</p>



<p>And if the design is a little generic-looking to you, you can at least add a few custom parts into the mix. Framework themselves offer up replacement display bezels in transparent, and a few colors that should add a nice pop to your system. There are also alternative keyboards in black and clear for you 1337 users who don&rsquo;t need legends on your keycaps. The entire computer uses a blend of new and pre- or post-consumer materials, which is nice to see.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="framework-laptop-13-connectivity">Framework Laptop 13: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Framework ports" class="wp-image-2005962" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-laptop-13-expansion-modules.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>More than with any other laptops, you&rsquo;ll need to plan ahead when selecting a Framework system. You see, these computers don&rsquo;t have physical ports by default, instead giving you four small bays that can fit a range of different &ldquo;Expansion Cards&rdquo;. On paper, this setup is more flexible than other competing laptops, letting you decide what ports you&rsquo;ll need when. It could also make a repair easier, if, for instance, a USB port is acting flaky, the module slides neatly out of the machine and can be swapped in seconds.</p>



<p>But realistically, this design still leaves you with only three port choices, since one of which will always need to be a USB-C module for charging (there&rsquo;s no DC-in barrel jack on the Framework Laptop 13, even though there is a headset jack). Additionally, some ports cost more to add to your laptop at purchase, with an extra $10 fee per HDMI, microSD (where&rsquo;s the full-size SD option?), or DisplayPort, and $30 extra dollars for ethernet. Competing systems like a super thin Asus ZenBook 13 OLED I tested recently crams in a far better array of ports (2x USB-C, HDMI, USB-A) and even Apple&rsquo;s 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros come with more ports now (3x USB-C, HDMI, MagSafe for charging, with an SD card slot too)&ndash;and you don&rsquo;t have to pay extra for the privilege. Modularity has some benefits here, but the tradeoffs are real, too.</p>



<p>For wireless, the Framework Laptop 13 has an Intel WiFi 6E AX210 card by default, but can be configured with the AX210 with vPro if your company needs that kind of management. Both cards come with Bluetooth 5.3 standard. The antennas inside gave me consistent, reliable connection both in my apartment and in a couple of local cafes, one of which occasionally has WiFi that is flaky when a lot of users jump on the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="framework-laptop-13-keyboard-and-trackpad">Framework Laptop 13: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Framework keyboard" class="wp-image-2005973" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-laptop-13-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>If you need to type long papers or code for days at a time, the Framework Laptop 13 has a keyboard that can keep up with you. Thanks to its comfortable key throw, satisfying actuation, and pillowy keycaps, I was up and typing on the Framework Laptop 13 in no time whatsoever. The layout is fairly normal, but has a forward slash and an enter key that are right next to each other, probably to accommodate international keyboard layouts in the same chassis, often which use an inverted-L shaped enter key. If I had any minor quibble with this keyboard it&rsquo;s that there is no light to indicate whether or not the function lock is enabled, but the default behavior is to have the function keys act as their labelled shortcut (volume, screen brightness, multimedia etc.) rather than F1-F12.</p>



<p>The trackpad is big, smooth, and generally nice to use. Like with some other modern PC laptops, I find that occasionally the palm rejection goes haywire, skipping my cursor around while I position my hands over the keyboard to start typing. When you go to click, you&rsquo;ll feel a tactile button instead of a haptic linear motor, which can let you click more consistently across the surface instead of along the bottom half.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Framework display" class="wp-image-2005980" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-laptop-13-matte-screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>On paper, the Framework Laptop 13&rsquo;s new matte screen doesn&rsquo;t seem that exciting. After all, competing laptops have higher resolutions, cooler display technologies like OLED or microLED, or aesthetic tweaks like rounded corners and notches for the webcam. I&rsquo;m here to tell you that you should get excited for the vivid, constrasty, bright 3:2 IPS panel in this computer, because it&rsquo;s super nice to use. At 2256&times;1504, you&rsquo;ll have a tough time seeing pixels, and I found that I had plenty of room at 150% scaling in Windows 11 to see a lot of content at a time. The only time when this tall screen falls flat is when you pull up a widescreen streaming show or YouTube video, since big black bars will show up on the top and bottom. If you&rsquo;re working a lot on the go, there still is no replacement for a glare-cutting matte screen.</p>



<p>Framework made some noise (get it?) about the 2023 Laptop 13&rsquo;s improved speakers, and I have to say that they&rsquo;re better than I expected. While you won&rsquo;t get thumping bass from these two small down-firing drivers, they get nice and loud, while keeping midrange sounds clear and easy to hear. I found that the Framework Laptop 13 has good enough volume for enjoying human voices and dialogue, but didn&rsquo;t do the booming sounds of the <em>Oppenheimer</em> trailer justice like multi-speaker systems in competing computers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Framework webcam picture" class="wp-image-2005989" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WIN_20230715_09_08_14_Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;re the type of person who slaps on a webcam cover the minute your new laptop is out of the box, you&rsquo;re going to love the Framework Laptop 13. This computer goes further than others, not just putting a little shutter or a deactivation button on the keyboard, but by including a physical switch that disconnects the camera and microphones independent of the operating system. The camera itself is a 1080p unit that&rsquo;s nothing to write home about (I found it to produce a soft image in a decently-lit cafe), flanked by the aforementioned security switches, an ambient brightness sensor, two microphones, and a webcam indicator light.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="framework-laptop-13-performance">Framework Laptop 13: Performance</h2>



<p>The Framework Laptop 13 justifies its higher price by including only spicier P-rated chips inside the Intel-powered version. The Intel Core i7-1360P inside the version I tried is the mid-tier chip for Framework&rsquo;s lineup. That said, it&rsquo;s surprisingly powerful with its blend of four performance cores with eight efficiency cores, for a total of 16 threads. In our tests, it performed very well, albeit with a bit of fan noise and heat when the chip puts all its cores to work.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Framework PCMark chart" class="wp-image-2006000" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-13-pcmark10-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="902" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>We benchmark every laptop we try with PCMark 10. This software gives us a realistic baseline, using everyday tasks in a gauntlet. We saw mid-pack performance for a performance-minded thin laptop. The Framework Laptop 13 will definitely perform well in everyday tasks like web browsing, video chats, and in office applications.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Framework Cinebench chart" class="wp-image-2006001" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-13-cr15-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="902" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In this performance test, we use Cinebench R15 to get a sense for how well all a laptop&rsquo;s many processor cores team up for intensive rendering tasks. In our tests, the Framework Laptop 13 performed only about as well as last generation&rsquo;s Intel P-class parts, but it&rsquo;s an admirable result nonetheless.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Framework 3DMark chart" class="wp-image-2006003" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-13-3dmark-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>3D tasks, not just games, are an important part of modern PC life and that&rsquo;s why every laptop we review gets tested with 3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy benchmark. In this test, the Framework Laptop 13 did decently for a machine with Intel&rsquo;s integrated Xe Graphics, but it was embarrassed by the GPU cores included with the AMD Ryzen-based HP Dragonfly.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Framework 3DMark chart" class="wp-image-2006003" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-13-3dmark-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>We test every laptop by reencoding a high-res video file into a file meant for a small-screened tablet. Thanks to its powerful cores, the Framework Laptop 13 turned in great results in this test, crunching through the video file in a little over 22 and a half minutes, almost keeping pace with the otherwise more performant AMD Ryzen-based HP Dragonfly Pro.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="framework-laptop-13-battery-life">Framework Laptop 13: Battery Life</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Framework battery life chart" class="wp-image-2006013" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/framework-13-battery-life-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="902" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>The biggest drawback of an Intel P-class chip in a laptop like the Framework Laptop 13 is a hit to battery life. We measured only a little past six and a half hours in our looping video test, which is definitely behind laptops based around U-class Intel processors and far from the mobile-centric Snapdragon chips. Even with a bigger 61Wh battery in this model, you&rsquo;ll need to keep a close eye on the battery gauge throughout the day. In our experience, we saw a drop of 18 percent per hour under light usage with a handful of apps open while browsing the web and running YouTube in the background.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="framework-laptop-13-should-you-buy-it">Framework Laptop 13: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>While its sustainable marketing and repairable design are certainly noteworthy, the Framework Laptop 13 is itself a solid laptop. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop&amp;xcust=2-1-2004407-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">This level of documentation</a> and smart design is usually reserved for enterprise-grade notebooks in the ThinkPad, Latitude, or EliteBook series from the big manufacturers, it&rsquo;s refreshing to see Framework make repairability a mainstream feature, in a laptop that&rsquo;s mainstream-friendly. Framework gives individuals the power to repair or upgrade, and even throw a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case-and-mainboard-kit&amp;xcust=2-1-2004407-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">still-working motherboard into a case for use on a desktop</a>. All of this is not just begrudgingly accessible to hardware hackers, but easily done by anyone with the (included) screwdriver.</p>



<p>If the environment and sustainability are top of mind for you, buying a previous-gen or refurbished model from Framework&rsquo;s store is likely a greener way to grab one of these devices. And I would have preferred to see a design that by default has more than four of a single kind of port&ndash;the Expansion Cards feel more like a gimmick right now, and force you to spend more money for specialized ports that would otherwise be included in the price. All my gripes aside, with its faster chips and great new matte display, the Intel 13th gen-based Framework Laptop 13 is very nice, and a computer that actually has a chance at serving you for years to come with repairs and upgrades.</p>
