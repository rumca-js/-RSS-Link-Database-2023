This week on Breakout, we discuss the games that took a while to click for us, our closing thoughts on Final Fantasy 16 and anything else we come up with. You know the drill.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
