<p>Sinéad O’Connor has died at the age of 56, prompting grief and tributes for a singer who enchanted and at times shocked the world. O’Connor’s family issued a brief statement on Wednesday evening announcing the death of an artist and activist who remained in the spotlight – often against her wishes – after topping the charts in 1990 with the single Nothing Compares 2 U. She later became just as well known for her outspoken views. The Irish singer abjured conventional stardom for most of her career, and some never forgave her for ripping up a picture of the pope on American TV, but the Dubliner enjoyed something of a renaissance in recent years</p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/sinead-oconnor-dies-aged-56">Sinéad O’Connor dies aged 56</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2023/jul/26/sinead-oconnor-the-turbulent-career-of-the-irish-sensation-video-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Can the Earth be saved? Can there be peace between Skrulls and humans? It doesn’t matter – not even a super showdown can save such a limp series</p><p><em>This is a recap of </em><em>Secret Invasion </em><em>on Disney+. Do not read ahead unless you have seen episodes one to six …</em></p><p>We picked up in the aftermath of Priscilla (Charlyane Woodard) and G’iah’s (Emilia Clarke) bloodbath. As Scilla inspected dead bodies, her phone rang and it was Fury (Samuel L Jackson). Presumably sensing that he was heading to Russia to meet his death, he wanted to call his (estranged?) wife one last time – the old romantic – still sweet on his wife despite the fact she revealed that their entire marriage had been an undercover Skrull op. The next we saw of him, he was rolling an empty car at the gates of New Skrullos and killing a couple of goons. Fury by name, ice-cold killer by nature. Roll weird AI credits.</p><p>The DNA contained in the Harvest that we saw on the computer monitor were: Ghost, Captain America, Corvus Glaive, Thanos, Outrider, Proxima Midnight, Captain Marvel, Abomination, Mantis, Cull Obsidian, Drax, Korg, Ebnony Maw, Frost Beast, Hulk, Chitauri, Valkryie, Thor, Gamora, Flora Colossus and Winter Soldier. Of course, it would have been impossible to collect Ebony Maw’s DNA from the aftermath of the Endgame battle because the Maw was killed after being ejected from Thanos’s ship by Iron Man while saving Doctor Strange. Perhaps that DNA came from somewhere else? I don’t recall Ghost and Abomination being in Endgame’s final battle, either.</p><p>Nice use of the various powers in Gravik and G’iah’s fight. A Drax arm here, a Hulk punch there, Ghost phasing, Captain Marvel energy, Ebony Maw magic, some Groot, Cull Obsidian and crucially, some Mantis when it mattered … The original comic-book Super-Skrull only had enhanced versions of the Fantastic Four’s powers; G’iah’s version is way more powerful.</p><p>Good to see the real Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), Rhodey, the arms/art dealer (Uriel Emil), Dr Rosa Wilton Dalton (Katie Finneran), Pamela Lawton and whichever military officer Pagon (Killian Scott) had been impersonating, among others, in the New Skrullos basement.</p><p>If the radiation was so strong at New Skrullos, will all the real versions of the people we’ve seen impersonated by Skrulls throughout the series be sick from it? Just how good are those iodine pills?</p><p>What now for Emilia Clarke’s Super-Skrull G’iah? If great responsibility comes with great power, how much responsibility comes with having ALL the powers? Too much responsibility, as David St Hubbins nearly said. We see her enter into a deal with Falsworth just as her dad, Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), had done with Fury, but with the caveat that they’ll leave love and friendship out of it and do the best for their respective people. I will believe that when I see it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/secret-invasion-recap-episode-six-its-hard-to-care-about-this-jeopardy-free-finale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>France forward’s potential move would effectively be a deal between states – with the player trapped by his own success</p><p>At the time of writing, officials from Al-Hilal are in Paris <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/kylian-mbappe-al-hilal-world-record-300m-bid-psg-saudi-arabia">negotiating the transfer of Kylian Mbappé</a>, who will be expected to replace some of the 26 goals provided last season by Odion Ighalo. With forward Luciano Vietto also leaving in the summer, the Blue Waves have joined the list of clubs in the Saudi Pro League looking for a proven goalscorer who can also play out wide. Although you also wonder how Mbappé’s arrival will impact the club’s current left winger and star of the recent World Cup, the veteran Salem al-Dawsari. What a way to treat a club legend.</p><p>Perhaps on reflection this is the only respect in which the signing of Mbappé from Paris Saint-Germain makes any kind of sense: as a footballing solution to a footballing problem, the missing piece of the Al-Hilal jigsaw. Will defenders be wary of fouling Mbappé on the edge of the penalty area, given the presence of Rúben Neves on free-kick duty? Will Neves even be allowed to take the free-kicks? How will Mbappé adapt to the pace and intensity of the Pro League? Will he gel with Moussa Marega? And if not, who will be the one to make way? The new coach, Jorge Jesus, may end up with a dilemma on his hands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/26/kylian-mbappe-to-saudi-talk-shows-football-is-now-poker-for-worlds-richest">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on climate science: warming oceans are a warning of the chaos ahead

<p>While the timetables are debatable, there is no doubt that extreme weather disruption is cause for alarm</p><p>What was long predicted is now happening. Earth’s weather systems are increasingly disrupted and destructive, as a consequence of the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to devastating heatwaves in the northern hemisphere, and their role in igniting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/26/northern-hemisphere-heatwaves-mediterranean-fires-croatia-portugal" title="">forest fires</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/26/accelerating-ocean-warming-earth-temperatures-climate-crisis" title="">high sea temperatures</a> over recent months have led scientists to reiterate their warnings that we are moving fast into uncharted, dangerous territory.</p><p>Climate models have always allowed for uncertainty. For decades, scientists have been certain of the direction of travel: towards increased heat, risk and instability. But how precisely the crisis would manifest, in what order systems would break down, and how the knock-on effects would unfold, remains a subject for research and discussion. Currently, there is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/19/climate-crisis-james-hansen-scientist-warning" title="">debate between experts</a> about whether the pace of global heating is accelerating or stable. The likelihood of vital ocean currents, known as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, collapsing this century is also contested. One new study has suggested that a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/25/gulf-stream-could-collapse-as-early-as-2025-study-suggests" title="">tipping point</a> could be approaching, and that the analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has, in this respect, been too conservative.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/26/the-guardian-view-on-climate-science-warming-oceans-are-a-warning-of-the-chaos-ahead">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Nigel Farage and Coutts: this row is more about the politics of Brexit than banking

<p>The former Brexit party leader was done a disservice, but the frenzy of Tory outrage is mostly a symptom of political cowardice </p><p>Not everyone can afford to bank at Coutts, an exclusive bank, nor is everyone entitled to an account there. But Nigel Farage is not just anyone. He is arguably the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/nigel-farage-claim-credit-forcing-government-poll-eu-referendum-ukip-slogans" title="">influential British politician</a> of his generation. It is questionable whether Mr Farage’s role has been to the benefit of public life, but if not, the detriment does not disqualify him from access to financial services. It is possible to despise the xenophobic strain of nationalism carried into the political mainstream by Ukip, while accepting that its former leader has civic rights.</p><p>Mr Farage was, reasonably, aggrieved to learn that Coutts had factored <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/03/banks-accused-of-closing-accounts-such-as-nigel-farages-on-political-grounds" title="">his political opinions</a> into a decision that he was no longer entitled to their services. His wealth had also dipped below the commercial threshold of eligibility for an account – a factor that may also rankle. But by far the strongest grievance is the way Mr Farage’s story found its way to the ear of a BBC journalist via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/26/who-is-alison-rose-the-natwest-ceo-forced-to-quit-over-nigel-farage-row" title="">Dame Alison Rose</a>, chief executive of NatWest, which owns Coutts. Worse still, the information was incomplete. The political component in the decision was only revealed in documents obtained and published by Mr Farage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/26/the-guardian-view-on-nigel-farage-and-coutts-this-row-is-more-about-the-politics-of-brexit-than-banking">Continue reading...</a>

## Zoey 102 review – Jamie Lynn Spears returns for unwanted nostalgia reboot

<p>The long-gestating movie follow-up to the mid-aughts Nickelodeon show gets mired in a familiar ongoing adolescence</p><p>If I were a television executive, particularly one at a large streaming platform that contains a teen network, I would certainly consider a reboot of Zoey 101. The tween series, which ran from 2005 to 2008 and starred Jamie Lynn Spears as a boarding school student in Malibu, is remembered fondly by a certain slice of Nickelodeon-raised late millennials. Its ending felt premature and tinged with sadness, as the series finale aired a few months after Spears, the younger sister of Britney, revealed that she was pregnant at 16. Though the show had already wrapped production before Jamie Lynn became a too-young tabloid fixture, the popular impression was that her off-screen shock pregnancy torpedoed the cutesy, very PG series. (As a 14-year-old at the time, this was a brain-searing event.)</p><p>In other words, there’s an on-paper case for Zoey 102, the new Paramount+ movie reboot of the series, in the sense that there was a lingering feeling of unfinished business to the show and that streaming service logic demands anything once popular be tried again. But it’s a fool’s errand. The revisionist happy ending for Zoey 101 feels at best strange and too overdue to work. (The logline bills the reboot as Zoey finding herself in her 20s, though the cast “graduated” high school 15 years ago and are almost entirely in their mid-30s; Spears herself is 32.) At worst, as often is the case with the finished product, it’s so focused on recapturing long past, hazily remembered magic as to be cringe-inducing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/26/zoey-102-review-jamie-lynn-spears-reboot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Missing Black women receive less news coverage than white women, making it harder to gain resources to solve their cases</p><p>On 13 July, as the US fixated on the disappearance of Carlee Russell, a 25-year-old Black nursing student who went missing on an Alabama highway, Derrica Wilson saw hope for other families whose loved ones had also gone missing.

Such attention is vital, Wilson told me, particularly in the first couple of days of a person’s disappearance, because it amplifies public awareness and puts pressure on law enforcement to invest in these searches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/26/carlee-russell-missing-black-women-girls">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A trend for single-file bar queues snaked into our beloved drinking establishments during the pandemic. It is time to return to free-for-all chaos</p><p>It was my round at my local pub, so I wandered in and joined the queue for the bar. With precious minutes to kill, I checked my phone to find an email from a colleague despairing at this new thing, “queueing up for a pint like it’s Pret”. Huh? Oh yeah, I’m standing in one. Funny that. I’d dimly registered as much without really noticing. And, come to think of it, yes, it has become a thing.</p><p>And why not? I know it’s not traditional, but tradition isn’t everything. What’s worth preserving about ye olde practice of large, shouty blokes like me, two-deep at the bar, all a-clamour for the barkeep’s attention? What of smaller, quieter, less determined, less ruthless people? Their pride and patience and nerves risk a shredding as their thirsts remain unslaked. A friend of mine, tall and handsome but somehow a little ashamed of being both, was never equal to the struggle. “I’ll just for ever be ignored by barmen of all nations,” he once said to me, sadly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/26/orderly-queues-in-pubs-theyre-extremely-civil-but-need-to-end-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Republic of Ireland’s first Women’s World Cup campaign ended in heartbreak as Canada came from behind to beat Vera Pauw’s side in Perth. Katie McCabe’s stunning opener gave Ireland an early lead in front of a partisan crowd of more than 17,000.

## ‘Everyone wanted to get one over on Thatcher’ – the artists who raided the Enterprise Allowance Scheme

<p>Forty years ago, the Tories launched a scheme to foster entrepreneurs – but artists from Jarvis Cocker to Rachel Whiteread saw another way to use it. So did a government seen as hostile to the arts kickstart Britpop and the YBAs?</p><p>In the summer of 1983, British politics was in a fractious place. In June, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government roared to re-election after victory in the Falklands, eviscerating Michael Foot’s Labour party. Within weeks, new chancellor Nigel Lawson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/aug/22/archive-chancellor-cuts-his-budget-to-the-bone-1983">announced swingeing spending cuts</a>, despite the fact that more than <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22070491">three million people were out of work and the number was rising</a>. Plans for large-scale privatisation of national industries – the PM’s second-term obsession – were in the works. Britain was about to become Thatcher’s Britain.</p><p>That same month, a new government initiative was rolled out nationwide. The <a href="https://www.thersa.org/blog/2017/12/the-peculiar-story-of-margaret-thatcher-and-basic-income">Enterprise Allowance Scheme</a> was the brainchild of a Treasury civil servant called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/03/whitehall.past">Peter Kemp</a> and had been trialled over the previous two years. Despite its bland name, it was a daring concept. If citizens wanted to set up a small business, the government would guarantee an income of £40 a week for up to 12 months, and an escape from dole checkups. If your business plan and a savings test passed muster – and for three-quarters of applicants it did – you were good. For the decade or so that it ran, <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1990-05-22/debates/4c554882-c424-4d42-b315-5b89971a4702/Employment">more than half a million people ended up using it</a>.

<p>People on the tourist island fear the impact of the loss of summer trade after fires that ravaged businesses and homes</p><p></p><p>Anastassia Pissaka, a pharmacist, was sitting outside the blackened remains of a cafe in Kiotari, ready to volunteer in case local people needed medicines. Her pharmacy had survived, even as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/25/rhodes-wildfires-wake-up-call-greek-island-climate-uk">flames completely destroyed</a> the neighbouring business, causing what many in the local area view as needless damage. <br /><br />Local people on the Greek island of Rhodes who spoke to the Guardian felt let down by their local government, which they considered too slow to react when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/25/deadly-global-heatwaves-undeniably-result-of-climate-crisis-scientists-attribution">fires started early last week</a>, with the result that when the winds picked up they spread into the populated tourist areas that fuel the local economy. The landscape was ravaged, some buildings were destroyed, and local people and tourists were evacuated. <br /><br />“The majority of the island is supported by tourism; even if you’re not directly affected [by the fires], everyone is,” Pissaka said. “Our income is based through the summer season, let’s say six months. There will be a big problem if tourists don’t come back because how will we pass the winter? I don’t know what the government will do. We need support.”<br /><br />She expressed a view shared by many local people: “The government did not respond immediately to Rhodes. The news only showed us the fires after the sixth day. My friends were calling TV channels asking them to show it. Here the fire was not stopping.”</p><p>The owner of the damaged cafe next to Pissaka, Giorgos Papageorgiou, was anxious about whether his insurance would pay out, and uncertain about the level of government support he could receive. His cousin had lost his livelihood, as he had failed to keep up with insurance payments and his restaurant had burned down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/26/rhodes-locals-anger-grows-at-chaotic-government-response-to-wildfires">Continue reading...</a>

<p>HBO’s After the Bite focuses on a community’s response to rising numbers of a creature often demonized on screen</p><p>Despite its potentially sensational subject matter, the HBO documentary After the Bite is not an official part of Shark Week. It’s a thoughtful and multifaceted documentary covering the proliferation of sharks off the Massachusetts coast, and the specific aftermath of a tragic 2018 shark-bite death that shocked and rattled a Cape Cod beach town.</p><p>Director Ivy Meeropol is aware that her movie has been positioned as (quite literally) Shark Week adjacent. “It’s kind of like a bait and switch,” she admitted. “I’m drawing people in who just are interested in sharks … and maybe they’ll get swept up in the story and find themselves thinking, wow, there’s something a lot scarier than sharks.” Even as broader issues like us-versus-them resistance to science and climate change loom in the background, the movie doesn’t indulge in scaremongering. Instead, it performs a delicate balancing act, acknowledging that there have been more sharks closer to Cape Cod shores in recent years while not giving in to the kind of panic that has informed public perception of sharks since Jaws became an all-time smash hit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/after-the-bite-shark-documentary-hbo">Continue reading...</a>

## Drag Me to Dinner review – so stressful and chaotic, it makes The Bear look like a picnic

<p>There are far too many chefs in the kitchen for this new cooking show – if you can call it that – following drag queens. I couldn’t stomach more than a couple of episodes</p><p>“Oh, this is stressful,” says Drag Me to Dinner host Murray Hill. For a show that is so over the top, this is quite the understatement. The high-stress kitchen chaos of The Bear has nothing on this hybrid reality show, which appeared in the US earlier this year. It is “the best show about duelling parties thrown by pairs of drag queens that the world has ever known,” as one of its many co-hosts, Neil Patrick Harris, quips. He and Hill are joined by Broadway star Haneefah Wood, actor, chef and “life of the party” David Burtka, and the acidic drag queen Bianca Del Rio. With five hosts/judges, it continues to greedily pile on the elements, cherry-picking parts from different reality competitions: it’s Come Dine With Me, it’s Interior Design Masters, it’s the performing challenges on Drag Race, it’s MasterChef and it even has a brief quiz show element. Clearly, its maxim is more is more.</p><p>There might be a reason nobody in television has thought to try this particularly intense combination of ingredients before. The first half of an episode, which works pretty well, tasks the pairs of drag queens with making the food and drinks for a dinner party, to a specific theme. The first is “Tropical Kiki”, with BenDelaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon opting for a“dessert island” concept, and Jackie Beat and Sherry Vine choosing to showcase talking birds and a cheese volcano. The cooking part is fun and anarchic, though I pity the poor crew who had to clean up the mess afterwards. “This is the first time I’ve really cooked,” says Dela, though to call it cooking is pushing it a little. This is puns, gags, wisecracks and a bit of throwing stuff around the kitchen. Burtka occasionally steps in to help, though he has a drag alter ego, Sue Chef, who can also step in to cause havoc if the queens lose the quiz round.</p><p>Drag Me To Dinner is on Disney+</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/drag-me-to-dinner-review-so-stressful-and-chaotic-it-makes-the-bear-look-like-a-picnic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>House committee will hold hearing after former intelligence official David Grusch alleged the US had encountered ‘malevolant’ alien pilots</p><p><strong>Tim Burchett</strong> and <strong>Anna Paulina Luna,</strong> Republican members of Congress from Florida and Tennessee, respectively, are leading the House oversight committee investigation.</p><p>In a briefing last Thursday, Burchett said he and Luna had been “stonewalled” by federal officials when asking about UFOs, and prevented from accessing some “information to prove that they do exist”.</p><p>We’ve had a heck of a lot of pushback about this hearing.

## Bite the air in Britain and you can taste the prejudices that haunt us. I’m sorry I became part of it | Martin Rowson

<p>After drawing a cartoon including antisemitic tropes, I am trying to respond in the best way I can: to apologise, to learn and to be vigilant</p><p>I have been a political cartoonist my whole adult life, and I believe what I do is important. Satirical cartoons weave together humour and weird kinds of sympathetic magic to damage, and thereby try to curb the excesses of, powerful people through caricature and mockery, by means of metaphor and symbols: things signifying things other than themselves; allegories and allusions; tropes, if you like. They also require a lot of deniable ambiguity, because they undermine power by laughing at it, and power has a huge armoury of weapons with which to answer back.</p><p>Nonetheless, instead of the rather pompous definition of satire as “puncturing pomposity”, I’ve always preferred the punchline of the great joke where a son comes home from work complaining to his mother about his new boss. She replies, with the wisdom of mothers: “If he’s so special, how come he shits and he’s going to die?”</p><p>Martin Rowson is a cartoonist and author</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## I made upskirting illegal. This is why I don't want to change any more laws | Gina Martin

<p>I don’t want more prisons and punishment for men – I want to help prevent sexual assault so women are safer in the first place</p><p>“In 2017, at British Summer Time Festival, a man stuck his hands between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/jun/15/upskirting-happened-to-me-and-now-im-changing-the-law-video">Gina</a>’s legs and took a photo of her crotch.” This is how most people begin to write about me, regardless of the context. Interviews often start like this. Events I am hosting for the release of my new book will begin like this. And I get it: the campaign I led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/12/upskirting-law-comes-into-force-england-and-wales-cases-rise">change the law</a>, making upskirting a specific offence in England and Wales in 2019, was a big news story. It also had a global impact; Gibraltar<strong> </strong>and France changed their laws in response and it was even featured on Saturday Night Live. I knew it had changed my life when I was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/01/number-of-people-rejecting-queens-honours-doubles-in-past-decade">nominated for an OBE</a>.</p><p>Since I was 26 I have been known as “the upskirting girl”. I still receive emails from those who’ve used the law and get stopped on the street by people thanking me. Sometimes they pass me a note with their story hastily jotted down, because repeating it will make what’s happened to them feel too real. I cherish these interactions and I’m proud that my political activism has had a lasting positive impact, but I also have a complex relationship with it.<br /><br />The upskirting campaign was my first campaign. I see it as part of my work, not the extent of it, and it’s also intimately tied to pain. For the public, being upskirted was an exciting origin story, but for me it was trauma. I was assaulted in public, and everyone knows the details. They want to hear the story from my mouth so they can enjoy the triumph at the end.

<p>Sacked foreign minister’s rise was linked to his ties to president; his disappearance and dismissal have caused a scandal</p><p>The dismissal of Qin Gang, a key Xi Jinping loyalist, from the post of Chinese foreign minister is shaping up to be one of the country’s biggest political scandals in years. Qin spent just seven months in the role, the shortest tenure of any to have served, and mysteriously disappeared from view last month.

## The Spin | Why Ashes? The burning issue of ‘obituary’ behind great rivalry

<p>Reginald Shirley Brooks’s wry dig at English cricket also backed a cause that was close to his late father’s heart: cremation</p><p>A few weeks ago I was walking down the Harleyford Road on the way to the Oval when I saw a man daubing the famous Ashes “obituary” on the outside of the ground. You likely know the one: “In Affectionate Remembrance of English cricket, which died at The Oval on 29th August 1882 …” This was no spontaneous piece of street art. A professional muralist was painting a perfect facsimile on the wall outside the Bedser Stand, just opposite Archbishop Tenison’s School. Next to it in bold lettering was written “THE KIA OVAL – BIRTHPLACE OF THE ASHES”.</p><p>I stopped and stared as the traffic whizzed by. Looking at the increased size of the “obituary”, two things struck me. First, that there is something satisfying about its simple yet effective design. Rather than being off-putting, the different style and sizes of font draw the eye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/26/why-ashes-the-burning-issue-of-obituary-behind-great-cricket-rivalry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An American fruit farm is the setting for a bittersweet tale of family heartbreak and hope during the pandemic</p><p>Ann Patchett’s fourth novel, the hostage drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/14/fiction.reviews1">Bel Canto</a>, propelled her to literary fame in 2001, winning the Women’s prize for fiction. Two solid novels followed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview16">Run</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/24/ann-patchett-state-of-wonder-review">State of Wonder</a>, but Patchett has produced the best fiction of her career in recent years, with the magnificent family dramas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/16/commonwealth-by-ann-patchett-review">Commonwealth</a> (2016) and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/25/dutch-house-ann-patchett-review">The Dutch House</a> (2019), a finalist for the Pulitzer prize. There has been nonfiction, too, with two essay collections, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/18/these-precious-days-by-ann-patchett-review-a-reckoning-with-loss">These Precious Days </a>(2021), the centrepiece of which is a Harper’s magazine piece that went viral about Patchett’s lockdown friendship with Tom Hanks’s assistant, Sooki Raphael. Raphael moved into Patchett’s Nashville home to start a clinical trial for the recurrent pancreatic cancer that would ultimately end her life, and Patchett turned this into a deep exploration of kindness, death and resilience.</p><p>The key to Patchett’s appeal, both in essays and novels, is her very particular tone: decent, steady, unthreatening, with a low hum of intelligence that is somehow rooted in the old-fashioned, friendly but steely American decorum that spawned Louisa May Alcott – and, indeed, Tom Hanks (who, incidentally, narrates the audiobook of The Dutch House). A solid determination to see the good in people, even those who behave badly, generates a feeling that humanity may be salvageable after all. Throw in impressive storytelling skills and an ability to harness and control narrative and thematic complexities, and the result is transporting, intelligent, accessible fiction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/26/tom-lake-by-ann-patchett-review-homespun-happiness">Continue reading...</a>

Lots of them. So many in fact that it was laughably tragic how easy it had been for me to study the history of philosophy completely oblivious to their existence.</p><p>I also discovered, unsurprisingly, that like their male counterparts, female philosophers were interested in all sorts of topics and represented a rich variety of intellectual sensibilities and temperaments. But I was drawn especially to the messier types. Those who didn’t respect the distinction between the abstract and the everyday, and whose experience of being a woman in the world bled into her work – in some cases just a little and in others consuming her entire opus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/26/top-10-books-by-neglected-female-thinkers">Continue reading...</a>

## We can’t afford to be climate doomers | Rebecca Solnit

<p>It often seems that people are searching harder for evidence we’re defeated than that we can win</p><p>Stanford engineering professor and renewable energy expert Mark Z Jacobson <a href="https://twitter.com/mzjacobson/status/1681346960136216576">tweeted</a> the other day, “Given that scientists who study 100% renewable energy systems are unanimous that it can be done why do we hear daily on twitter and everywhere else by those who don’t study such systems that it can’t be done?” A significant percentage of the general public speaks of climate change with a strange combination of confidence and defeatism: confidence in positions often based on inaccurate or outdated or maybe no information; defeatism about what we can do to make a livable future. Maybe they just get their facts from other doom evangelists, who flourish on the internet, no matter how much reputable scientists demonstrate their errors.</p><p>They’re surrendering in advance and inspiring others to do the same. If you announce that the outcome has already been decided and we’ve already lost, you strip away the motivation to participate – and of course if we do nothing we settle for the worst outcome. It often seems that people are searching harder for evidence we’re defeated than that we can win. Warnings are a valuable thing, given with the sense that there’s something we can do to prevent the anticipated outcome; prophesies assume the future is settled and there’s nothing we can do. But the defeatists often describe a present they assert are locking in the worst outcomes.</p><p>Rebecca Solnit’s most recent books are Orwell’s Roses and the climate anthology Not Too Late: Changing the Climate Story from Despair to Possibility, co-edited with Thelma Young Lutunatabua</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/26/we-cant-afford-to-be-climate-doomers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A yearly convention brings together superfans for shopping, fashion shows and workshops on making doll-sized tropical drinks – if you can score a ticket</p><p>It started in April, with the <a href="https://ruggable.com/collections/barbie-rugs-and-doormats?gclid=Cj0KCQjw2eilBhCCARIsAG0Pf8ucpv7wwKez-NJjyjJG4Pw6_UJYm57DzbDs5VKGDqKYswTrw9MXfpcaAq-yEALw_wcB">Barbie x Ruggable washable rugs</a>.

Soon, Barbie was on Gap apparel, Starbucks cups, Superga shoes and Funboy pool floats; she was at Primark, Bloomingdales, a dedicated Amazon store, two pop-up cafes in New York and Chicago, an immersive museum in Los Angeles and a Barbie boat cruise around the Boston Harbor.</p><p>By July, the media rollout for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie<em> </em>had unleashed a torrent of press photos, TikTok filters, promotional interviews, trailer footage and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/01/from-airbnb-to-xbox-brand-barbie-goes-for-big-bucks-with-100-partnerships">more than 100</a> Barbie-licensed products onto the internet. The $145m Warner Bros blockbuster is Gerwig’s attempt, as she told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/magazine/greta-gerwig-barbie.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">New York Times</a>, at “doing the thing and subverting the thing” – where the subversion is a sardonic twist on the famous doll’s saga, and the thing is boosting sales. To aid the latter, Mattel has spared no expense getting out the word. “It’ll be very hard to be on planet Earth,” its CEO, Ynon Kreiz, has said, “and not know this movie’s coming out.” The campaign was so thoroughly pink, so omnipresent, so peppered with product tie-ins, that jokes about Barbie’s marketing briefly seemed to outnumber those aimed at the doll itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/26/barbie-doll-fan-convention-orlando-mattel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Baked beans done the Greek way, using the fattest butter beans you can find</p><p><em>Gigantes plaki</em>, or (very) big baked beans, occupy a similarly beloved place in the Greek heart to our own baked beans. However, though they are also available in tins, they’re rather more likely to be made from scratch. They pop up on restaurant menus as well as at home, both as a warm stew – which, because it’s vegan, is particularly popular during Lent – and served at room temperature as part of a meze selection.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, few Greek cookbooks are without their own version: <a href="https://app.1000cookbooks.com/people/rena-salaman">Rena Salaman</a> sells her gigantes plaki as “a sensational dish, splendidly vegetarian, luxuriously rich”, while<a href="https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/books/taverna/"> </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgina-hayden">Georgina Hayden</a> calls the dish an “absolute classic” <a href="https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/books/taverna/">in her book Taverna</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/christossourligas/?hl=en">Christos Sourligas</a> admits he “can eat bowlfuls” of the stuff (me, too, after this week).

<p>Shoppers could save 50p to £10 for every £100 spent with these money-saving schemes. But are they always worth handing over your personal details?</p><p>Loyalty cards have been around for decades, but over the past couple of years there has been something of an evolution in the biggest UK schemes. While previously shoppers would rack up points on their spending that they could later cash in for rewards, several major retailers have switched to offering upfront benefits. The loyalty schemes of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Boots are among those that have effectively become clubs and, if you’re a member, you get products cheaper when you do your shopping online or in-store. Other retailers still offer conventional schemes, where you can earn vouchers to use on shopping or other treats. At a time when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-cost-of-living-moneys-too-tight-to-mention">money is tight and bills are rising</a>, it’s worth considering any opportunity to save.

## NFL running backs are angry – and peace seems a long way off

<p>As the passing game has grown to dominate the league, rushers have been devalued. That leaves some players feeling they’ve been given a raw deal</p><p>The running back market has flatlined. On Tuesday, Saquon Barkley <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38067192/sources-saquon-barkley-giants-agree-1-year-11m-deal">agreed to a fresh one-year $11m contract</a> with the New York Giants, ending any talk of a training camp holdout.</p><p>Barkley is back in New York. But his signing represents a thaw around the issue of running back pay rather than a final resolution. Barkley’s new deal did <em>not </em>include a clause that would prevent the Giants from using <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/nfl-franchise-tag-what-it-is-how-it-works/">the franchise tag</a> – which teams can use to keep hold of players due to become free agents – on him for next season, a provision a number of quarterbacks have included in their deals. Unless there’s a wink-wink deal over a long-term contract, it’s likely he will find himself in the same situation again next summer. Likewise for Jonathan Taylor, who is due a contract extension next offseason. Ditto for Nick Chubb, whose long-term contract options are also uncertain and will be 30 by the time he’s due for a new deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/26/nfl-running-backs-are-angry-and-peace-seems-a-long-way-off">Continue reading...</a>

## The Visionaries by Wolfram Eilenberger review – four women who changed the world

<p>The complicated lives and questing minds of Ayn Rand, Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir and Simone Weil</p><p>In the summer of 1933, four women, all in their 20s, were busy contemplating the meaning of their own existence and the importance of others to it. The word existentialism had not yet been invented, but the quartet were intrigued by the idea of finding a new philosophy, using their own intelligence to change themselves and the world, while working out how the individual and the collective played into the malaise of modern times. Over the next decade, as Wolfram Eilenberger writes, they all crossed paths intellectually, sometimes agreeing, more often not, though it seems that they never actually met.</p><p>The eldest was an uncompromising and astute 28-year-old Russian who had got herself to Hollywood and changed her name from Alisa Rosenbaum to Ayn Rand. Through screenplays and fiction she set out to convey what she saw as the struggle for the autonomy of the soul, with “enlightened egoism” as her new vision for the world. Thus Spoke Zarathustra became “something like her house bible” and phrases such as “Nietzsche and I think …” peppered her philosophical notes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/26/the-visionaries-by-wolfram-eilenberger-review-four-women-who-changed-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I felt Ingmar Bergman was looking over my shoulder, laughing at me’: my month writing at the maestro’s desk

<p>An invitation to be a writer-in-residence at the Swedish director’s remote Baltic island house seemed too good to miss. Would some of his genius rub off?</p><p>An eerie kind of peace came over me as I sat in my battered Toyota rental car on the quayside at Fårösund. This is the gateway to the Gotland archipelago’s farthest flung outpost, the island of Fårö, better known as Bergman Island since the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/film-director-mia-hansen-love-ingmar-bergman">Mia Hansen-Løve’s 2021 film</a> of that name. The Baltic lay as flat as the hundreds of placid lakes you fly over in the little island hopper from Stockholm Bromma airport. It was 10pm on 1 June, and the sky showed no sign of getting dark. The whole scene, including the rocky outcrops down in the bay, felt very … er … Bergmanesque.</p><p>I was coming to Fårö on a mission. In January, I had been invited to be writer-in-residence at the Fårö home of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. I had a screenplay to write, having just published my debut novel, Istria Gold. In the depths of a depressing winter, it was easy to say yes to something six months away and on an idyllic Baltic island. After 20 years carrying the Bergman baton as a board member of his brainchild, the European Film Academy (EFA) – including four as chair, and six as deputy to Agnieszka Holland – it was about time I got to know the man a little more. What better way of doing it than an extended stay at his home, on his estate. However, the reality of what the following month would hold began to dawn on me as I drove the last few desolate kilometres to the Bergman homestead. “Where have all the people gone?” I wondered.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/26/ingmar-bergman-faro-baltic-island-house-writer-in-residence">Continue reading...</a>

How can we improve our emotional and physical connection?</p><p><strong>I got married nearly a year ago to a man who</strong><strong> is supportive and kind. </strong><strong>I</strong><strong> have also been sober for the </strong><strong>past four months</strong><strong> and realised in that time </strong><strong>that I don’t actually enjoy </strong><strong>my husband’s moves</strong><strong> in bed. We used to have sex while drunk or hungover, so I didn’t notice as much, but I don’t really enjoy his foreplay, </strong><strong>as he</strong><strong> is quite rough and doesn’t have good rhythm. I try to tell him: “That hurts,” or: “Do this,” but he gets upset easily and we </strong><strong>get frustrated and annoyed. I asked him to pay for the website </strong><strong>OMGYes</strong><strong> to learn some new moves, which he did</strong><strong>, but </strong><strong>he hasn’t </strong><strong>looked at it</strong><strong>. Now I </strong><strong>find myself avoiding sex with him, or </strong><strong>playing with my vibrator as foreplay instead of allowing him to touch my clitoris. He</strong><strong> is fine about me using my vibrator, but it </strong><strong>feels </strong><strong>difficult to connect emotionally when that happens. I love sex and want to connect, emotionally and physically</strong><strong>, but I don’t want to pretend that things feel good when they don’t.</strong></p><p>“New moves” aren’t necessarily your moves.

<p>Set against the tumultuous backdrop of modern Syria’s birth pangs, this saga of friendship, freedom and tragedy celebrates Aleppo’s lost past</p><p>During the twilight years of the Ottoman empire at the end of the 19th century, as ethnic tensions flare between the groups that inhabit its vast territories, a young boy flees a massacre and finds shelter in Aleppo with a wealthy Muslim family. Like his hosts, Hanna is part of the empire’s wealthy elite. Unlike them, he’s a Christian. Almost immediately, he becomes best friends with Zakariya, the son of his protectors. Over the next 70 years, Hanna and Zakariya’s friendship will be tested by every conceivable challenge: war, flood, ethnic conflict, intolerance, extremism, famine and the tensions between their religious faiths.</p><p>Hanna and Zakariya’s youth and early manhood are spent entirely in pursuit of pleasure. They carouse in the red light district of Aleppo, have a memorable encounter with one of the city’s most notable courtesans, run away to Europe and spend time in Venice. On their return, they commission a friend, a Jewish architect, to build them a pleasure palace on the outskirts of the city. They call this the “citadel”. It’s part brothel and part casino – a kind of Ottoman Animal House<em> </em>where anything goes and they can drink, gamble and sleep with prostitutes. There’s even a special room set aside in which gamblers who have lost everything can kill themselves. (Luckily or not, it never appears to be used.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/26/no-one-prayed-over-their-graves-by-khaled-khalifa-a-syrian-epic">Continue reading...</a>

He was a very adventurous boy when he was younger, but then later he became interested in money. It always struck [me] as odd. Money doesn’t usually interest little boys, but it did Mike.”</p><p>2. <strong>Mick Jagger was always Mick Jagger.</strong> In 1959, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_pQa0TGYCw">he appeared on ATV’s Seeing Sport</a>, in a sequence on climbing for young people, filmed in Tunbridge Wells, The presenter, John Disley, holds Jagger’s (“Michael’s”) foot up to show his footwear.

<p>Sunlit suburban calm masks the shocking nature of the story itself: a horrendous tragedy in the guise of a teenage coming-of-age movie</p><p>Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Sofia Coppola made her feature directing debut with this adaptation of the literary sensation of its day: Jeffrey Eugenides’s novel about five teen sisters in 70s suburban Michigan who take their own lives. Now it is rereleased with a solemn trigger-warning disclaimer at the beginning about certain historic attitudes which might now cause offence; these are unspecified, but appears to mean the entire premise of the film, up there in the title, but which is treated more circumspectly nowadays in the context of new ideas around self-harm and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation">“suicidal ideation”</a>.</p><p>This was a movie which mystified as many as it entranced, and it would be honest of me to admit that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/19/culture.reviews">I didn’t quite understand it</a> back in 2000, and maybe don’t quite now. But I can perhaps appreciate with more clarity its artistry and poise and the confident way Coppola allows her film to be serenely mysterious and almost affectless in its sunlit suburban calm, a reticence which appears to mask the shocking nature of the story itself: a horrendous tragedy in the guise of a teenage coming-of-age movie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/26/the-virgin-suicides-review-sofia-coppolas-debut-rereleased-with-solemn-trigger-warning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Terrestrial television may sometimes seem old-fashioned – but this only enhances its ability to tease and surprise its audience. This week, Channel 4 brought back satire with a bang</p><p>Few people will have been happier yesterday with headlines such as “Channel 4 fans fume as Gregg Wallace ‘ends career’ after eating ‘human meat’” than Gregg Wallace. Taking advantage of his overbearingly cheery persona, the presenter has pulled off one of the best hoaxes in media history with his bogus documentary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/25/the-anger-of-it-will-linger-for-years-is-the-british-miracle-meat-the-most-disturbing-tv-satire-ever" title="">The British Miracle Meat</a>.</p><p>Success in these cases is usually measured by tabloid outrage, feigned or otherwise, and threatened complaints to Ofcom, but Wallace’s sting operation successfully fooled, provoked or at least surprised nearly everyone. Perhaps it is proof that, although it is losing ground to streaming services and social media, broadcast television still has the power to move the dial – but let’s not be too hasty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/british-miracle-meat-story-behind-one-best-hoaxes-tv-history">Continue reading...</a>
