<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170707-secretinvasionfinaleemiliaclarke.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Fortunately for all of us, Marvel's Secret Invasion has finally wrapped after six episodes. There's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159xzrl/secret_invasion_s01e06_discussion_thread/">a lot of grumbling</a> among the MCU fanbase today about this series, and deservedly so--this series was completely incoherent, and as has been the case so often in the MCU since Avengers: Endgame, it's hard to tell if there was any point in watching it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers about the finale episode of Marvel's Secret Invasion.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Recently, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the MCU is having a bit of a downturn because all these movies and TV shows "diluted focus and attention." While that is true, the real rot is deeper: Almost every MCU show and movie since Endgame has felt like it had its part of the MCU's overall plot removed during post-production, and the result is a franchise with no story that anybody can see.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret Invasion might be the single most egregious example of this yet. This series told us that Nick Fury had been using the shapeshifting Skrulls to do all sorts of clandestine missions since the 1990s, and yet it couldn't manage to retroactively place them in any past movie. Secret Invasion ends with a cliffhanger that might never be addressed, and we learned nothing new about Nick Fury except that he has a secret Skrull wife--Fury certainly didn't learn any lessons or change in any way, and he wasn't developed as a character any further than he had been in movies.</p><p dir="ltr">So what's going on here? I don't know, and like many of you I ended up with far more questions than answers from the Secret Invasion finale. So let's get to asking.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Is Emilia Clarke in The Marvels?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170706-themarvels.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In a particularly egregious part of the finale, Fury and Gravik finally have their big heart-to-heart when Fury brings the Harvest vial to New Skrullos. But then Gravik fires up his superpower machine with Fury inside it with him, and that emotional moment is completely undercut by the reveal that Fury was actually Gi'ah in disguise, and now she has the power of all the Avengers and Carol Danvers. Meaning she's one of those Marvels now.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's been no indication that Clarke is in The Marvels or any other future MCU project, meaning it's not likely that she would have a major role in the film even if she manages a cameo or gets some scenes in reshoots. The Marvels <em>was</em> delayed earlier this year from summer to fall, so reshoots are possible. But we also just got the first trailer and she wasn't in it, so there's no reason to expect her to appear--which is funny, because Gi'ah would seem to be the most powerful being in the universe right now.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. What was Secret Invasion setting up?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170710-secretinvasionfinalemoreskrulls.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">With Fury ending Secret Invasion in the same place he started it--in space with the Skrulls--and with no indication that Clarke will be in The Marvels, there's no reason to think this story will matter in that film. We'll probably just get a single offhanded mention from Fury about what he was up to on Earth, akin to Doctor Strange's single offhand reference to the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p><p dir="ltr">Since there's no perceivable overall MCU plot right now, it's hard to tell what the follow-up will be. But the two most obvious candidates aside from The Marvels are Armor Wars and the fourth Captain America film. Armor Wars will star Don Cheadle as War Machine after that character spent Secret Invasion in Skrull captivity, and it would be difficult not to address this whole thing after a Skrull spent this show doing high treason while wearing his face.</p><p dir="ltr">Captain America: Brave New World is also a candidate just for subject matter reasons--Secret Invasion ended with the president of the United States declaring war on all aliens living on Earth, and that seems like a thing that would come up in a Captain America movie that's coming out next summer. It would certainly be weird to ignore it, anyway. But it wouldn't be surprising if it did, because creating new dangling plot threads is the only thing the MCU has done the past four years.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Is America about to bomb Norway?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170720-secretinvasionnewasgard.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Let us not forget there's a prominent settlement of Asgardians who have been living on Earth in Norway since Thanos snapped his fingers. They haven't been living in secret. Instead, New Asgard has become a tourist attraction, per Thor: Love &amp; Thunder. But the president declared war on <em>all</em> aliens living on Earth, and that would include these guys. That's probably not the wisest fight to pick.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Is Gravik actually dead?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170725-secretinvasiongravik.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">I'll admit I don't really have any idea how exactly the Super Skrull machine works, and so it's hard to gauge exactly how much of a boost Gravik and Gi'ah got from it. For example: Do they have the full power of those whose DNA they're borrowing, or just a portion of it? Did it dilute the process to have them both in the machine at the same time? If it's the full power, then that means that Gi'ah and Gravik were two of the most powerful beings in the universe when they fought. And when you consider that potential context, he went down pretty easily.</p><p>Sure, a large hole in the torso was <em>exactly </em>how Iron Man killed one of the Extremis guys in Iron Man 3--that's likely the reason they went with that method of death--but Gravik had just gained the powers of more than a dozen other super-folks. He was a lot more than just an Extremis guy at that point. Considering Secret Invasion already pretended to kill Gi'ah herself a couple episodes ago, it makes this ending a little bit difficult to buy.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. How long was Rhodey a Skrull?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170729-secretinvasionrhodeyskrull.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Colonel James Rhodes aka War Machine has apparently, according to the end of Secret Invasion, secretly been a Skrull operative for a long time while the real Rhodey was a captive of the Skrull rebels. But we don't know how long it's been. It would be outrageous to suggest that the War Machine who went on the Avengers: Endgame time heist was actually a villainous Skrull, so it has to have happened after that. But even though they managed to make a character actually ask out loud how long he was held captive, the show didn't tell us the answer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. What is Sonya's deal?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170730-secretinvasionwhatissonya%27sdeal.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Olivia Colman was delightful as the scene-stealing Sonya Falsworth, but we never end up learning a single thing about her as a person, and Sonya never demonstrates that she can play any notes except for the one that she's stuck on for the entirety of Secret Invasion. And no, having her like rap music is not character development.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonya is a fascinating piece of this series because nothing about her makes sense. She knows about both the Skrulls generally and the rebel Skrulls specifically at the start of the series and no one ever explains why, and she manages to remain a protagonist character despite gleefully violating the Geneva Conventions multiple times (torture is bad). But since we know zero things about her beyond her job and her cheerful demeanor, she ends up being inscrutable.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Where did all the other rebel Skrulls go?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170732-secretinvasionrebelskrulls.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Gi'ah, disguised as Nick Fury, arrives at New Skrullos to confront Gravik, she sees a few murdered Skrulls and no one else around. And when she actually meets Gravik, he says the others are "locked away." But then Gi'ah kills Gravik, and we never see any of the other rebels or hear about them at any other point during this episode. Did Gravik kill them all? Nobody cares, I guess.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Was this show supposed to have mysteries?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4170834-secretinvasionwherewerethemysteries.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the hallmarks of spy thrillers is you don't know what's going on until everything comes together at the end. Secret Invasion didn't bother going this route for some reason--we know who the good guys and bad guys are from the start, and there are no meaningful story twists or secret betrayals or any of the kind of stuff that people like in spy stories. It's so bizarre that I have a hard time imagining it was always like this--was there a previous version of this show, maybe one where the episodes were longer than those of a sitcom, where it was actually a thriller?</p></h3></p><br />

## No, Ratchet And Clank: Rift Apart Could Not Run On PS4, PC Port Shows

<p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> just launched and it marks another PlayStation exclusive making its way to Windows. This is a particularly interesting case because the game was specifically a PS5 exclusive, and before launch, it was a showcase for the platform's high-performance tech, namely the super-fast NVMe SSD the PS5 uses for storage. Over at Eurogamer, the folks of <a href="https://youtu.be/I71u7j1Izww">Digital Foundry did extensive testing</a> on the newly released PC port of Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and found interesting results with various specs and setups, including an old mechanical hard drive--and even a PS4 hard drive.</p><p>Straight up, the game does not run properly and eventually crashes on a PS4 HDD, which is a SATA II 5,400 RPM drive. Digital Foundry's Richard Ledbetter used a system close to minimum specs and with a PS4 drive ripped from an old console and installed on his PC. Based on the playthrough, you can see that once the game enters the portal sequence that shoots Ratchet through multiple worlds, <a href="https://youtu.be/I71u7j1Izww?t=1140">the game stutters immensely before eventually freezing</a>. This was the slice of the game often used to show off the seamless transitions with minimal load times despite all the assets that needed to be pulled, which is made possible by using an NVMe SSD--and for Sony, the PS5 in particular. It doesn't come as a surprise given that the PS4 storage drive was dated even during its lifecycle. But these tests reaffirmed why Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart had to skip the PS4.</p><div>          </div><p>But that's only part of the hard drive story. John Linneman of Digital Foundry also tested out a 7,200 RPM SATA HDD on a high-end rig, and said it performed "surprisingly well," but noted that loading screens lasted significantly longer, especially with the game's portal-jumping sequences. He did say it falls "well within the realm of playability," despite stutters and hitches during gameplay.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-could-not-run-on-ps4-pc-port-shows/1100-6516325/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">After bringing Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Godzilla to the big screen, director Gareth Edwards will next present an original idea rather than another entry in a massive franchise. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rogue-one-director-pits-mankind-against-a-killer-ai-in-the-creator/1100-6514282/">The Creator</a>, set in the future, essentially boils down to a war between humanity and AI, with John David Washington starring as a former special forces operative enlisted to hunt down a potentially war-ending weapon. That plan goes awry when he learns the weapon in question is actually an AI made to resemble a child.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to argue this movie could have been timed better, given the current WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and the role artificial intelligence plays in the negotiations. Still, this is an idea Edwards first started putting together back when he was still working on Rogue One.</p><p dir="ltr">"I got the idea, actually, it was on the publicity tour for [Star Wars: Rogue One]," the co-writer/director revealed to GameSpot at San Diego Comic-Con.

<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are headed back to the theaters for the first time in almost 20 years with next week's debut of TMNT: Mutant Mayhem. Co-directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears with Rowe sharing screenplay credit alongside Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit, Mutant Mayhem does something movies usually don't do with the Turtles: actually treats them like teenagers.</p><p>Speaking with GameSpot at Comic-Con in San Diego, Rowe (a self-described Donatello who wants to be a Michelangelo) discussed why he thinks the Turtles are still with us and why he wanted to channel that authenticity by hiring actual teenagers for the first time in their respective roles--played by Micah Abbey, Shannon Brown Jr., Nicholas Cantu, and Brady Noon.</p><p>"I think it makes them more emotionally resonant, you're able to because we were chasing authenticity and really making them feel like real teenagers," Rowe explained. "We're trying to give them teenage problems and emotions and ways of dealing with their issues. It gives it a level of emotional grounding and relatability that hopefully, the audience more so than ever is able to really connect with these characters."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-director-talks-about-why-the-turtles-still-resonate-almost-40-years-later/1100-6516330/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Outlaws Will Be A "Manageable" Length, Dev Assures

<p>Star Wars Outlaws will feature a large open world, but the developers have set goals to make it a reasonable, finishable length, i.e. "not... 200 or 300 hour[s]."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-interview">IGN</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-wont-be-a-300-hour-epic-unfinishable-rpg">Eurogamer</a>), developers discussed their design goals vis-a-vis length and size. Creative director Julian Gerighty said, "Too big is a game that people don't manage to play, enjoy, and finish. And our objective is to really get people into a very dense, rich adventure, open-world adventure that they can rhythm the way that they want." In some sense, this sounds like other Ubisoft games, a core adventure with plentiful side activities. However, many of the publisher's titles, like the last few Assassin's Creed games, have reached into truly epic lengths, even if you are sticking to the main path.</p><p>Gerighty continued, "So it is absolutely not a 200 or 300 hour epic unfinishable RPG. This is a very focused action-adventure RPG that will take people on a ride and is very manageable." What manageable means, and how that relates to the game's promised multi-planet scale, was not exactly specified.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-will-be-a-manageable-length-dev-assures/1100-6516327/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Not only will the game be playable at Evo--the largest fighting game tournament in the world--next week, but it will show off one of its key modes: Duo Play.</p><p dir="ltr">Duo Play builds on Project L's 2v2 match format with a simple concept: Instead of one player controlling both members of a team, Duo Play will allow two players to team up, with each one assigned to only one member of the team. This means that a two-player fighting game will now open up to four players in a Duo Play match.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Executive producer Tom Cannon hosted a new explainer video which goes over the new gameplay mode in detail, which includes a Fuse system for extra synergy.

As highlighted and tested live by streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1881427453">DatModz</a>, though the blessing can earn players up to 20% more gold from selling items, it appears a bug is making it so repairing items and re-rolling Legendary item affixes also costs 20% more.

Go to the right up a small set of stairs and then pass through the cross-shaped doorway. You'll see a portal here that changes where you'll teleport every few seconds. Wait for it to change to a location that looks as though you'll fall to your death, then pass through to begin falling.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/remnant-ii/">Remnant II</a> is designed to be a challenging game regardless of which difficulty you choose to begin your journey. However, once you're out exploring the deadly biomes of this Souls-like experience, you may find that things are a bit too easy or hard for you, prompting you to want to change things up a bit. If so, we've got some good and bad news about changing the difficulty, so read on to find out more.</p><h2>Can you change the difficulty in Remnant II?</h2><p>There are four difficulties to choose from in Remnant II: Survivor, Veteran, Nightmare, and Apocalypse (an ultra-hard mode that can only be unlocked after beating the game).</p><p>Let's get the bad <strong>bad news</strong> out of the way first: You can only change the campaign difficulty <strong>at the beginning of the game</strong> or by <strong>rerolling the campaign altogether</strong>--the latter of which will reset your story progress while allowing you to keep any Scrap, upgrades, and gear you've found along the way. The <strong>good news</strong>, however, is that you can change the difficulty of any unlocked biomes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-how-to-unlock-adventure-mode/1100-6516128/">Adventure Mode</a> without having to reset your campaign progress.

<p dir="ltr">Sonic Superstars is changing up the Chaos Emeralds a bit, as now each individual emerald will have a unique power-up.</p><p dir="ltr">In the original Sonic the Hedgehog games, a single Chaos Emerald was mostly useless, as you'd need all seven of them to turn Sonic into Super Sonic. The Super form is back with Sonic Superstars, but in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2023/07/25/exclusive-look-at-every-emerald-power">Game Informer</a>, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka spoke of the new powers that come with each of the Chaos Emeralds. Speaking of how you'd only get something from the Chaos Emeralds through collecting all of them, Iizuka said, "We wanted to say, 'How can we reward someone for getting just one?' And if we reward someone for getting just one, that will motivate people to get each individual one and see what they are."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Iizuka, the idea for Emerald Powers took some inspiration from the Wisp mechanic introduced with Sonic Colors. The big difference between Wisps and Chaos Emeralds is that you'd need to use the Wisps to beat the game. "But we didn't want that to be a part of the Superstars game," Iizuka said. "We wanted the Classic Sonic gameplay to still remain true, so when we were looking at the Emerald Powers and the Wisps, we wanted to make sure you could still beat Superstars without having to use any of the powers, which is what we needed to balance during game design."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-superstars-emerald-powers-freshens-up-some-classic-gameplay/1100-6516310/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">This year's San Diego Comic-Con was a different experience, as without any of the Hollywood star power that has defined the show over recent years, SDCC felt like it had returned to its roots. With no Hall H takeovers from Marvel and striking actors canceling their appearances, SDCC was focused on comic books, cosplay, toys, and anime.</p><p dir="ltr">That made for a more balanced convention experience, as over several days, the showfloor was packed with fans looking to soak up the SDCC experience. We've rounded up some of the best announcements below, ranging from video games being represented by Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, to all-out mutant mayhem in the next Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, anime making a big splash, and a glimpse at some of the amazing merchandise that was on sale during the event.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat expands its roster with more character reveals</h2><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sdcc-2023-comics-games-movies-and-the-biggest-announcements/1100-6516308/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Leave it to a demake of Resident Evil 4 to prove that the Chainsaw Man is just as terrifying in 2D as he is in the original. That's right: A fan is recreating the survival-horror classic from a new side-scrolling perspective that looks like it's blending SNES and PlayStation eras.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-fan-creates-side-scrolling-shooter-demake">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcanNT5iQg">DooMero on YouTube</a> has released gameplay video for this 2D demake of Resident Evil 4. While cinematics from the original game are utilized, the actual action shows Leon Kennedy running from side to side in the Spanish village from the title's opening. He has his trusty handgun and looks more flexible than ever roundhouse kicking the rural town's inhabitants.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The demake is apparently made with a Doom mod called GZDoom. There is no time window given yet by DooMero on when his Resident Evil 4 demake will be playable by the public. It's not the first time the survival-horror series has gotten this treatment.

<p>Sea Of Thieves' upcoming Season 10 has been delayed to October. Developer Rare announced the move in a <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/season-ten-update">blog post</a> and a video that was posted to Twitter, with members of the game's team stating that the update has run into "unforeseen issues" that have made development more difficult than anticipated.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Pirates: we've made the difficult decision to move the launch of Season Ten back to October 19th. While we know delays are disappointing, our team needs a little more time to get this substantial new update ready for you. More on our revised plans here: <a href="https://t.co/NiDDSBpf0P">https://t.co/NiDDSBpf0P</a> <a href="https://t.co/phIbFPTIwm">pic.twitter.com/phIbFPTIwm</a></p>  — Sea of Thieves (@SeaOfThieves) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeaOfThieves/status/1684175849430429697?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 26, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In a blog post, head of community Christina McGrath said that "it's not a decision we take lightly," citing the well-being of the team and a desire for quality as two of the main reasons behind the delay. McGrath also said that Season 10's headline feature has presented problems for Rare, as adding "new systems" to a game like Sea Of Thieves is quite challenging. Though the official release date for Season 10 was not known, fans expected it to release in <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/community/forums/topic/160198/season-10-release/5">early August</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's not all bad news for Sea Of Thieves fans. McGrath noted that three new Tall Tales will be released in July, August, and September as part of an ongoing collaboration with the Monkey Island franchise. There are also several limited-time events coming up, including Gold &amp; Glory Weekend from August 4-7 and Legends Week on dates that have yet to be announced. There will also be some sort of community weekend in September.

<p>Disney's Haunted Mansion is a theme park staple across the world. Most Disney parks have its own version, even though they vary slightly in aesthetics and narrative--except Disney Shangai as they view the afterlife as something entirely different.</p><p>The first Haunted Mansion movie came out 20 years ago with Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Tilly, and Terrence Stamp which was more of a murder mystery, and more in line with the actual ride's narrative. It was coming off the heels of the success of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl which was released the same summer and in the midst of Disney making films about their rides and attractions. The new Mansion movie has no ties to the first, outside of it being set at Gracey Manor, the Haunted Mansion located in Disneyland.</p><p>Speaking with director Justin Simean at San Diego Comic-Con about why it was important he wanted to set the film at the original Disneyland New Orleans manor and how they wanted to show the funny side of the afterlife while still showcasing a level of grief.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haunted-mansion-director-on-balancing-grief-death-and-humor-for-new-film/1100-6516315/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-3-season-4-battle-pass-all-rewards-and-cosmetics/2900-4334/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3</a> has been heavily focused on its new Wilds theme, and that trend continues with the addition of the brand-new Mammoth Pistol, which sounds exactly like something you'd expect to be wielded by brave adventurers exploring ancient jungle ruins. We'll tell you where you can find this single-shot pistol and how it works below.</p><h2>Mammoth Pistol location and how it works</h2><p>The Mammoth Pistol can be found on the ground, in standard chests and Holo-Chests, and even in flying drones. In other words, if you're wanting to use this powerful pistol, you shouldn't have any issues rounding one up in most matches.</p><p>If you score a Mammoth Pistol, be prepared to dish out substantial damage at the expense of fire rate. This deadly gun is extremely accurate--even at long ranges--and deals a lot of hurt to anyone you land a shot on, but it also can only fire once before needing to be reloaded. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-find-the-mammoth-pistol-and-how-it-works/1100-6516301/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The massively popular zombie apocalypse franchise The Walking Dead is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. To commemorate the event, another popular zombie franchise is paying tribute to its predecessor: Dying Light 2 Stay Human is introducing a set of limited-time Walking Dead-themed challenges beginning today.</p><p dir="ltr">The Dying Light 2 Stay Human Walking Dead event is broken up into three segments. First, a set of seven daily challenges--one per day between July 26 and August 2--will award players a different digital comic book cover for each completion, with those who complete all seven challenges receiving a weapon charm resembling Walking Dead hero Rick Grimes's sheriff's hat.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Players can also participate in a separate weekly challenge, where those who take down 850 enemies in the July 26-August 2 timeframe will receive Lucille--Negan's infamous barbed wire baseball bat--and a blueprint to rebuild it whenever they like. Finally, if all Dying Light 2 players manage to kill over 160 million enemies total, everyone will receive a wearable version of Rick's hat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-2-celebrates-20-years-of-the-walking-dead-with-new-challenges-and-rewards/1100-6516302/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite: Where To Get Bender's Shiny Metal Raygun And How It Works

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s ever-expanding world of crossovers continues with the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/futurama-fortnite-event-sees-fry-leela-and-bender-drop-onto-the-island/1100-6516289/">all-new skins</a> from the popular animated show Futurama--but there's a little something more from the series in-game, too. You can now find and use Bender's Shiny Metal Raygun against your foes, and we'll tell you where to find this Mythic weapon and how it works below.</p><h2>Bender's Shiny Metal Raygun location</h2><p>Bender's Shiny Metal Raygun is a Mythic rarity gun that can be found on the ground and in chests as part of the normal loot pool. However, you can also buy this new weapon for a whopping 600 gold bars from Bender himself, who can be found wandering around the lower part of Mega City. Note that you can also hire Bender for 200 gold bars if you'd like to take on your opponents with everyone's favorite smart-mouthed robot.</p><figure style="width: 1181px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4170506-bender.jpg"><img alt="Find Bender in the southern section of Mega City." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4170506-bender.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Find Bender in the southern section of Mega City.</figcaption></figure><p>Adding Bender's Shiny Metal Raygun to your loadout can yield devastating results for your foes, as it's an accurate weapon that fires deadly plasma and doesn't have to be reloaded. It does, however, overheat after using it for a few seconds without breaks, so you'll need to keep an eye on the meter that shows up beside your reticle. The fact that you never have to worry about whether it's reloaded, though, makes it an excellent choice to break out to finish off opponents who are low or trying to escape.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-get-benders-shiny-metal-raygun-and-how-it-works/1100-6516300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>CD Projekt Red has laid off 100 people, citing a need to undergo "several deep transformations" as it reduces its workforce by 9%. These layoffs will happen over several months, with some employees departing the company by March 2024.</p><p>"After reshaping our development process and incorporating Agile methodologies, we're now focusing on refining the shape of our team," CD Projekt CEO Adam Kicinski said in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-red-organizational-update/">blog post</a>. "To meet our own high expectations and ambitions to create the best role-playing games, we not only want to have the best people but also the right teams. What we mean by that is having teams that are built around our projects' needs; teams that are more agile and more effective. At this point in time, we're certain that for CD Projekt Red to grow, we need to be consistent in implementing that approach."</p><p>According to Kicinski, CDPR is "overstaffed" and those staff members affected by the layoffs will receive a "comprehensive" severance package. "We want team members to have ample time to process and adjust to the change, and we've also made sure to offer everyone a comprehensive severance package," Kincinski added.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-is-laying-off-almost-10-of-its-workforce/1100-6516299/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
