<p>Meta just had its best quarter since 2021, even as it continues to lose massive amounts of money on the metaverse. In fact, the company said it expects to lose even more money on its efforts in the year to come.</p><p>Reality Labs, the Meta division overseeing its virtual and augmented reality projects, lost $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2023 and generated just $276 million in revenue, according to the company’s latest <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2023/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2023-Results/default.aspx">earnings report</a>. And the company, once again, said it expects its metaverse spending to accelerate. CFO Susan Li said that Meta is expecting Reality Labs’ losses to “increase meaningfully” compared with last year, when it lost more than $13 billion on the efforts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to downplay the significance of the losses. “We remain fully committed to the metaverse vision,” he said during the company's earnings call. When pressed for more details on the company’s metaverse spending, he pointed to the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-meta-quest-3-is-a-499-mixed-reality-headset-with-full-color-passthrough-141204527.html">Quest 3</a> headset, which he said would launch at Meta’s Connect event in September. “This is going to be the biggest headset that we've released since 2020,” he said. “There are just a lot of expenses related to bring that to market.”</p><p>Aside from the metaverse, it was an otherwise a strong quarter for Meta, which reported $32 billion in revenue, an 11 percent increase from last year. Zuckerberg touted Reels, which are now drawing 200 billion views a day across Facebook and Instagram, thanks to the company’s renewed emphasis on AI-driven recommendations. He also highlighted the recent launch of Threads and the company’s Llama 2 large language model.</p><p>Though early analytics data has suggested Threads engagement has declined substantially since its launch, Zuckerberg said the company is “seeing more people coming back daily than I'd expected” and that he sees a path for the app to eventually reach “hundreds of millions” of users.</p><p>Meta also confirmed that the bulk of its layoffs, which resulted in the company shedding more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-laying-off-employees-for-the-third-time-in-less-than-three-months-174112198.html"><ins>20,000 jobs</ins></a> since last fall, have been “substantially completed.” Zuckerberg previously dubbed 2023 as Meta’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-still-growing-amid-metas-year-of-efficiency-222320433.html"><ins>“year of efficiency”</ins></a> as he cut staff and attempted to streamline the company’s management structure. Zuckerberg pointed to Threads’ launch, which he said was overseen by a relatively small team, as proof that “cultural changes” at Meta are working.</p><p>Zuckerberg didn’t, however, offer a timeline of when he thought the company’s metaverse spending might start to pay off. “This is a very long term bet,” he said, “You know, on a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it. And look, I mean, I can't guarantee you that I'm gonna be right about this bet —I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-had-its-best-quarter-since-2021-despite-losing-more-money-on-the-metaverse-231925266.html?src=rss

## The $9,995 Fuell Fllow electric motorcycle is available for pre-order today

<p>Erik Buell, best known for founding Buell Motorcycles, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billroberson/2019/04/26/forbes-interview-why-has-go-fast-guy-erik-buell-moved-his-startup-fuell-into-the-slower-lane/?sh=f5a251161a4d">announced</a> Fuell, his new electric motorcycle venture, back in 2019. In that same announcement, he said that Fuell would begin work on its first electric motorcycle: the Fuell Fllow. Following though a few years later, Fuell is giving us more details on the Fllow and opening pre-orders today.</p><p>The Fllow is a mid-sized motorcycle that claims to have the capacity of a larger bike, with 10 gallons of total storage in addition to space for a passenger. It features 150 miles of city range on a full charge and uses the CCS connector for charging. You can expect to fully charge in about 30 minutes with a Level 2 charger and between one and a half to two and a half hours for a standard home charger. In a pinch, you’re looking at around eight hours when plugged into a standard 110/220V home outlet. While the bike’s standard CCS connector is widely available in North America, we’ve seen a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-owners-will-be-able-to-use-tesla-superchargers-starting-in-2024-141546633.html">recent uptick</a> in major car brands <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-drivers-will-get-access-to-12000-north-american-tesla-superchargers-next-spring-221752191.html">adopting Tesla’s NACS connector</a> – fortunately, adapters are common. The bike has a top speed of 85 miles per hour with a speedy 0-60MPH time of 3.5 seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Buell says that one of the main focuses with the Fuell brand is integrated and interchangeable battery packs. This technology would enable the ability to swap some components as the technology improves in the future. The company calls it the “battery pack module” and enables components such as the charger, rear wheel motor and fast charging socket to be swapped out and upgraded over time.</p><p>While Buell has a history with Harley-Davidson, Fuell is its own independent company, separate from the Buell Motorcycles brand. Founded in 1983, the brand ran for a decade before Harley-Davidson acquired 49 percent of the company in 1993, followed by full ownership in 2003. In 2009, Harley-Davidson announced the discontinuation of the Buell product line. While the brand <a href="https://www.motorcyclenews.com/news/new-bikes/buell-hammerhead-1190rx-/">has been resurrected</a> since then Buell himself is solely focused on Fuell going forward.</p><p>Harley-Davidson hasn’t been sitting quietly on the sidelines, either. The company’s LiveWire division announced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidsons-livewire-s2-del-mar-electric-motorcycle-costs-14999-174545955.html">S2 Del Mar</a> electric bike in early 2023. The bike features a 110 mile range and a 0-60MPH time of 3.1 seconds. While the S2 Del Mar has a faster 0-60 time, the Fuell has longer range and faster charging. The Fllow is also prioritizing cargo capacity and modularity in its design.</p><p>The Fuell Fllow is available now for pre-order at $9,995, with an MSRP of $12,995.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-9995-fuell-fllow-electric-motorcycle-is-available-for-pre-order-today-220016821.html?src=rss

## Waymo pushes back its self-driving truck efforts to focus on ride hailing

<p>Don't expect to see many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-waymo-autonomous-truck-tests-texas-new-mexico.html">Waymo-powered autonomous big rigs</a> in the near future. Waymo <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/07/doubling-down-on-waymo-one.html">now plans</a> to &quot;push back&quot; its driverless trucking efforts and shift its attention toward its One ride-hailing service. The move will help the company concentrate on making these self-driving taxis a &quot;commercial success,&quot; according to co-CEOs Dmitri Dolgov and Tekedra Mawakana.</p><p>Waymo justified the decision by pointing to &quot;significant&quot; growth in demand for its robotaxis in Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco. It also noted rapid upgrades to Driver, the AI system that handles its autonomous cars. There's &quot;tremendous momentum&quot; in One, the co-chiefs say, and the new strategy will help make the most of this trend.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Alphabet-owned brand still intends to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-daimler-self-driving-truck-partnership-142519288.html">work with Daimler</a> on self-driving semi trucks. It's shifting most of its technical development toward Waymo One, but believes work on Driver (particularly for highway driving) will indirectly benefit trucking. There's no updated timeline for when trucks may reach the roads, but <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/26/waymo-puts-the-brakes-on-self-driving-trucks-program/">understands</a> only a handful of workers will lose jobs as a result of the transition. Most have taken other positions at Waymo.</p><p>Waymo started testing autonomous big rig trucks in 2017, with rapid expansions in 2019 and 2020 that included the launch of its Via cargo transportation division. The firm won the attention of major partners, including UPS and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-freight-waymo-via-long-haul-autonomous-trucking-173218101.html">former rival Uber Freight</a>. However, there's no doubt that Waymo One was the star and won the most interest. Uber even expects to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-will-offer-waymo-robotaxi-rides-and-deliveries-in-phoenix-starting-later-this-year-163435980.html">offer Waymo rides and deliveries</a> in Phoenix later this year.</p><p>The change isn't guaranteed to pan out. While Waymo is closer to offering paid rides in multiple markets, it's still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-asks-california-regulators-to-halt-or-slow-driverless-vehicle-testing-083906662.html">facing opposition from officials</a> who are concerned about safety issues. Driverless cars have blocked traffic, interfered with first responder vehicles and otherwise caused problems, and there's a call for regulators to limit just where and when robotaxis can operate.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/waymo-pushes-back-its-self-driving-truck-efforts-to-focus-on-ride-hailing-211355559.html?src=rss

<p>Amid its rebranding to X, Twitter is reportedly hardballing advertisers in an effort to increase its bottom line. Reports earlier this month suggested that Twitter’s revenue had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitters-ad-revenue-has-dropped-by-50-percent-202600398.html">dropped by a staggering 50 percent</a>.

The company claims that the point of these discounts is to allow advertisers to "gain reach during crucial moments" such as sporting events.</p><p>While the $1,000 monthly rate is unlikely to be an issue for larger brands, the new change could hurt smaller businesses that don’t want to or don’t have the extra budget to commit.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-tells-advertisers-to-spend-1000-per-month-or-risk-losing-verification-status-201528621.html?src=rss

## Indonesia is blocking Elon Musk's X domain for its gambling and porn history

<p>Elon Musk's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-begins-its-transition-to-x-100901444.html">rebranding of Twitter as X</a> is... not going according to plan. Indonesia has temporarily <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/7/26/elon-musks-x-com-blocked-in-indonesia-under-curbs-on-porn">blocked</a> X.com due to the country's laws forbidding gambling and porn. Officials don't think the site is suddenly going downhill, though. Rather, it's that the web domain's previous owners broke the country's content laws. In other words, X didn't check to see if the the predecessors had done anything leading to national bans.</p><p>The impasse likely won't last long. Information director general Usman Kansong tells the press that X has already been in touch about the issue, and is sending a letter to indicate that Twitter is taking ownership of X.com. This is more a formality than a major legal hurdle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, this is another indicator of just how unplanned the Twitter-to-X transition was. Meta, Microsoft and numerous other companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-rebrand-to-x-could-worsen-its-legal-and-financial-problems-233914973.html">already own trademarks on X</a>, opening the door to lawsuits. X may have trouble registering and protecting trademarks, too. The company has even had problems changing its signage — a crew pulling down the Twitter sign in San Francisco <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/police-halt-removal-twitter-sign-company-hq-elon-musk-rebrands-x-rcna96166">had to stop over permit issues</a>, leaving the &quot;er&quot; and old bird logo intact.</p><p>Musk announced the sudden transition as part of a broader plan to turn Twitter into a &quot;super app&quot; like China's WeChat. In theory, you could use X for payments, messaging and other tasks that go well beyond social media. The service has also lately tried to steer users toward $8 per month Blue subscriptions by both offering perks (such as much longer posts) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-limiting-the-number-of-dms-unverified-users-can-send-120035602.html">limiting existing features</a>.</p><p>The momentary Indonesia ban isn't a major roadblock. However, it still means that roughly 24 million users can't even try X.com at the moment. That may be welcome news for competitors that don't face similar restrictions, including Meta's recently launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-adds-a-chronological-feed-as-twitter-burns-to-the-ground-152817251.html">Threads</a> (already available in Indonesia).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/indonesia-is-blocking-elon-musks-x-domain-for-its-gambling-and-porn-history-195551771.html?src=rss

## SEC: Public companies must report cyberattacks within four days

<p>In a move to prevent public companies from delaying news about cyberattacks, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-139">US Security and Exchange Commission </a>has set a four-day deadline to disclose "material cybersecurity incidents." A US attorney general could potentially delay that disclosure if doing so would lead to "substantial risk to national security or public safety." Otherwise, the rules will serve as a stiff new guidepost — albeit, one that's slightly less restrictive than the EU's GDPR cyberattack <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/">deadline of just three days</a>.</p><p>The news comes after Microsoft was criticized by security experts for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-june-outlook-and-onedrive-outages-were-caused-by-ddos-attacks-173431319.html">taking weeks to confirm an attack against Outlook</a> and other online services. “We really have no way to measure the impact [of the attack] if Microsoft doesn’t provide that info," Jake Williams, a cybersecurity researcher and former NSA hacker, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGUzN2I5Yy04OTc1LTQ4ZGEtYWEzOS1kZjhiY2Q1YmFkYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xNy9taWNyb3NvZnQtc2F5cy1lYXJseS1qdW5lLWRpc3J1cHRpb25zLXRvLW91dGxvb2stY2xvdWQtcGxhdGZvcm0td2VyZS1jeWJlcmF0dGFja3MuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjBhYzgwOGEtYzYyNy00Y2M5LThhODAtOWM0MTc0NTIxOWMzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXHyS1BHXX8_Whc_yww-taFJbW_PMys1lpjwBf4hbiKW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F06%2F17%2Fmicrosoft-says-early-june-disruptions-to-outlook-cloud-platform-were-cyberattacks.html">told the <em>AP</em></a> in June.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While GDPR rules are more about protecting the public, the SEC appears to be more focused on investors: “Currently, many public companies provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors," SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. "I think companies and investors alike, however, would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful way."</p><p>Technology companies have pushed against the SECs rules since they were initially announced last year, which ultimately led to the inclusion of a delay clause, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-26/companies-have-4-day-deadline-to-report-hacks-in-final-sec-rule?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>. Additionally, the Information Technology Industry Council argued that the four-day deadline is too short, since companies may not know enough about the cyberattack by then.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sec-public-companies-must-report-cyberattacks-within-four-days-193713534.html?src=rss

<p>Deconstructeam announced today that its upcoming divination-based game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/build-tarot-decks-and-seduce-a-god-in-the-cosmic-wheel-sisterhood-150023513.html"><em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em></a>, arrives on August 16th. The player-choice-driven narrative adventure will be available for PC and Nintendo Switch. In addition, a new launch trailer gives us a closer glimpse at the title’s tarot deck building and weighty decision-making.</p><p>In <em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em>, you assume the role of Fortuna, a witch imprisoned for 1,000 years on a remote asteroid after foretelling an unwelcome prediction of doom. (You join her 200 years into her sentence, although the game includes plenty of pre-exile flashbacks.) However, Fortuna’s stay isn’t as lonely as you may expect: She’s accompanied by Ábramar, a god summoned by Fortuna to help her escape and serve cold revenge on the coven. You’ll also receive a surprising number of visitors for someone floating on a space rock in the middle of nowhere.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b7a0cd09b08f46a6ae22684a050e4a23"></div><p>Following Deconstructeam’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-05-gods-will-be-watching-review-morality-after-math.html"><em>Gods Will Be Watching</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-09-red-strings-club-transhumanism-morality-gods-will-be-watching.html"><em>The Red Strings Club</em></a>, its latest entry expands on the studio’s tendencies toward philosophical and narrative experiences in dystopian settings. Much of the gameplay revolves around the narrative forks you choose (primarily through dialog trees) and the building and deployment of tarot decks, presented intricately in vibrant pixel art. You can customize the cards’ backgrounds, symbols and supporting elements, crafting a magical repertoire that feels distinctly yours. (However, you can keep the deck-creation process relatively simple if you prefer a more straightforward playthrough.) “At its core, <em>Cosmic Wheel</em> is a visual novel with narrative paths dictated by the player’s choices,” Jessica Conditt wrote in Engadget’s April preview.</p><p><em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em> will cost $18 when it launches on August 16th for Switch and PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/">pre-order it on Steam</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9nYW1lL3RoZV9jb3NtaWNfd2hlZWxfc2lzdGVyaG9vZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTY3YTk2NTgtYmZiNC00ZTMxLWJkNWQtMmM1MmFiOWM5YThjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYbGCHsvOtPWRk8UqA901TLNE3PMdcge5DyF1a5J2XQT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fgame%2Fthe_cosmic_wheel_sisterhood">wish-list it on GOG</a> ahead of its arrival.

<p>Microsoft isn't done refining the interface on your Xbox console. The company is <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/26/welcome-to-your-new-xbox-home/?ocid=Platform_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Link_lrn_7.26.1">rolling out</a> an updated home screen for Xbox Series/X and One users that theoretically puts games within closer reach while giving you more room to customize the experience. There's now a quick access menu that helps you jump to your collection, Game Pass, the Microsoft Store and common functions like search and settings. You can pin favorite games and groups, and there are curated lists of games to help discover titles. The update should reach everyone within a few weeks.</p><p>At the same time, a simpler layout creates more room for your custom background. An option can change the background to match the game you've selected in your recently played list, somewhat like PlayStation's carousel. A refreshed community row helps show what friends are doing, while media spotlights and lists help you find new content to see or hear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's easier to buy games, too. At the same time, PayPal has <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-07-26-Microsoft-Deepens-Relationship-with-PayPal-to-Offer-Simple,-Flexible-Payment-Options">revealed</a> that you can &quot;soon&quot; use Venmo to buy games, apps and subscriptions in the Microsoft Store on Xbox in the US. This will help you make use of spare Venmo funds, of course, but it will also give you a way to split payments if you can't justify an up-front purchase.</p><p>The rethink comes eight months after Microsoft began publicly experimenting with a new Xbox interface. The company has a history of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-ui-094634618.html">frequent UI redesigns and tweaks</a>, particularly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-07-xbox-one-completely-new-customizable-interface.html">in the Xbox One era</a>. Sony, in contrast, is relatively conservative and rarely makes major changes to the PlayStation front end in the middle of a console cycle. Microsoft's iteration may be frustrating if you're hoping for a consistent experience, but it does suggest the company is responding to gamers' feedback and hoping to stand out in the market.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/xbox-home-screen-revamp-provides-quicker-access-to-games-173010398.html?src=rss

## Major automakers team up to create new North American EV charging network

<p>Seven major automakers have banded together to create a new charging network in North America, with an eventual target of 30,000 high-powered charge points near urban and highway locations. The companies involved with the venture include BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes and Stellantis. The venture issued a statement on the move, saying they are trying to “accelerate the transition to electric vehicles” and “make zero-emission driving even more attractive.”</p><p>The goal of this venture is 30,000 new charging points, and the companies say they will “leverage public and private funds” to get there. After all, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the country will need <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2023/building-the-2030-national-charging-network.html"><ins>around 182,000 fast chargers</ins></a> to accommodate the massive influx of EVs hitting the roads by 2030. This venture represents a good portion of these needs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These stations will use the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard and the North American Charging Standard (NACS). It’s worth mentioning that Tesla’s superchargers use the NACS charging type and the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-open-up-7500-charging-stations-to-other-evs-by-2024-115527953.html"><ins>recently opened up the technology</ins></a> to other EV manufacturers.</p><p>This new joint program will formally begin operations sometime this year, assuming it clears regulatory approval conditions, and it plans on opening up its first stations next summer. Each site will boast multiple chargers and plenty of amenities, like canopies, restaurants, restrooms and integrated brick-and-mortar retail stores.</p><p>EV sales are expected to contribute to more than 50 percent of total automobile sales by 2030, so the more charging stations available, the better. To that end, some of the companies involved in this venture are also striking out on their own to build more charging stations. GM, for instance, promises to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-launches-its-community-charging-program-in-two-states-130001577.html">build 40,000 charging stations</a> at car dealerships throughout the US and Canada.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/major-automakers-team-up-to-create-new-north-american-ev-charging-network-171532385.html?src=rss

## NASA picks Lockheed Martin to build the nuclear rocket that’ll take us to Mars

<p>NASA and DARPA have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-darpa-experts-to-discuss-nuclear-rocket-program-developments">chosen</a> aerospace and defense company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lockheedmartin/">Lockheed Martin</a> to develop a spacecraft with a nuclear thermal rocket engine. Announced in January, the initiative — in which BWX Technologies will provide the reactor and fuel — is dubbed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-darpa-nuclear-thermal-engine-crewed-missions-mars-200827580.html">Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO)</a>. The agencies aim to showcase the tech no later than 2027 with an eye toward future Mars missions.</p><p>Nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) has several advantages over chemically propelled rockets. First, it’s two to five times more efficient, allowing ships to travel faster and farther with greater agility. In addition, its reduced propellant needs leave more room on the spaceship for storing scientific equipment and other essentials. It also provides more options for abort scenarios, as the nuclear engines make it easier to alter the ship’s trajectory for a quicker-than-expected return trip. These factors combine to make NTP (perhaps) the ideal Mars travel method.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“These more powerful and efficient nuclear thermal propulsion systems can provide faster transit times between destinations,” said Kirk Shireman, VP of Lunar Exploration Campaigns for Lockheed Martin. “Reducing transit time is vital for human missions to Mars to limit a crew’s exposure to radiation.”</p><figure><img alt="Artist concept of a nuclear powered rocket. The craft, which looks somewhat like an upside down flashlight, is primarily white with US, DARPA and NASA logos emblazoned on its side. Blue propellant emerges from its tail as a slice of the Earth is visible below." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c76fd110-2bd0-11ee-95ec-6b0e11ef1e6c" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA / DARPA</div></figure><p>The NTP system will use a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen propellant rapidly to extremely high temperatures. That gas is funneled through the engine’s nozzle, creating the ship’s thrust. “This nuclear thermal propulsion system is designed to be extremely safe and reliable, using High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel to rapidly heat a super-cold gas, such as liquid hydrogen,” BWX <a href="https://www.bwxt.com/news/2023/07/26/BWXT-to-Provide-Nuclear-Reactor-Engine-and-Fuel-for-DARPA-Space-Project">said</a> today. “As the gas is heated, it expands quickly and creates thrust to move the spacecraft more efficiently than typical chemical combustion engines.”</p><p>To help quell concerns about radioactive leaks in the Earth’s atmosphere, NASA and DARPA plan not to power up the reactor until the ship has reached a “nuclear safe orbit,” where any tragedies would occur outside the zone where it would affect Earth. The agencies aim for a nuclear spacecraft demonstration by 2027, launched from a conventional rocket until it reaches “an appropriate location above low earth orbit.”</p><p>Nuclear reactors will also likely play a key role in powering future Martian habitats, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-02-nasa-completes-full-power-tests-small-nuclear-reactor.html">NASA testing small and portable versions</a> of the tech as far back as 2018.</p><p>Before NTP propels the first humans to Mars, it could find use on much shorter flights, as nuclear-powered spacecraft could also make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-program-explained-moon-mars-colonization-video-143013129.html">transporting material to the Moon</a> more efficient. “A safe, reusable nuclear tug spacecraft would revolutionize cislunar operations,” said Shireman. “With more speed, agility and maneuverability, nuclear thermal propulsion also has many national security applications for cislunar space.”</p><div id="e88ca7adfb4448c1ab388a6b9e1eae16"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasa-picks-lockheed-martin-to-build-the-nuclear-rocket-thatll-take-us-to-mars-170035659.html?src=rss

<p>Over-ear noise-canceling headphones typically offer the most comprehensive set of features we want for our listening pleasure. The best of these wireless options combine stellar sound quality with powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) and other handy tools to create as complete a package as possible. Of course, some companies do this better than others. For Engadget’s best wireless headphones guide, we tested out a number of different models with a variety of features, including noise cancellation, customization options and sound quality.

In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.&nbsp;</p><h3>How do I choose the best quality headphones?</h3><p>“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?</p><h3>Which brand has the best headphones?</h3><p>Sony consistently tops our list with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">its 1000X line</a>. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">like Bose</a>, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.</p><h3>Do expensive headphones sound better?</h3><p>Exorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">Bowers &amp; Wilkins’</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html">headphones</a> are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html">Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2</a> is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html?src=rss

The "alpha" set includes worldwide info for over 59 million places, 780 million unique buildings, road data from OpenStreetMap and borders.</p><p>The map layers are packaged in a recently-launched Overture map format that's meant to be standardized and interoperable between platforms. The group is mainly sharing the data at this stage to get public feedback, rather than to support complete products.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The foundation was formed in December last year by a range of companies that include geospatial and mapping firms in addition to tech giants. While open map data isn't a new concept, Overture believes the collective effort is necessary to deliver accurate, up-to-date info that's no longer practical for any one organization to provide. Ideally, a newcomer won't have to worry about supplying outdated or incomplete directions.</p><p>Overture is quick to warn that there's still a lot of work left before its material is truly ready. Upcoming releases will include more open data, greater interoperability and the use of a stable ID system that will help map builders consistently add content. You might not see apps relying much (if at all) on the alpha dataset, but it serves as a starting point that gives app creators an idea of what's possible.</p><p>Google has historically dominated the mobile navigation app market, with Google Maps and Waze together <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVyaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLmNvbS9jaGFydC8yMzQ4MzEvbGVhZGluZy11cy1tYXAtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi1zbWFydHBob25lLWFwcHMtcmFua2VkLWJ5LW1vbnRobHktdW5pcXVlLXVzZXJzLWF1Zy0yMDE5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMWU4ZmQxMC1kODdkLTRiMzktYTIxYi1lNDgyMjQyZWQyZjMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfbmue9Mray995QjRM-ms4CdxuOj4AFXoOUwiNB9Hs1-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insiderintelligence.com%2Fchart%2F234831%2Fleading-us-map-navigation-smartphone-apps-ranked-by-monthly-unique-users-aug-2019">claiming</a> a clear majority of use in recent years.

## The best WiFi extenders in 2023

<p>A reliable home internet connection has never been more important. Many of us work from home part-time or full-time now, and others increasingly have more of their home powered by smart devices. Also, we all just have more connected devices in general — phones, tablets, consoles, TVs and more, all connected simultaneously to our home’s wireless network. In setting up and maintaining all of your tech, you might have discovered you have a dead spot or a weaker WiFi signal in some corners of your home, or spotty coverage in your makeshift home office. And depending on the size of your abode, your WiFi’s strength might be abysmal on its outskirts.</p><p>This is where WiFi range extenders come in. These relatively affordable gadgets, as their name suggests, extend your home network to provide more widespread coverage. These WiFi boosters can give you connectivity in places you may have never had it before like garages, backyards and the farthest corners of your property. And they are available for low prices compared to many of the latest mesh network systems you’ll find today. Let’s break down how these gadgets work, what you should consider before picking one up and the best WiFi extenders we tested.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>How do WiFi extenders work?</h2><p>These handy wireless devices do exactly what their name suggests: extend your WiFi network so it covers more areas of your home. Most WiFi extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing network so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix.</p><p>One important thing to note about WiFi extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new WiFi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved coverage, some will be more inconvenienced than others.</p><p>If you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh WiFi. Mesh systems come with a main router and access points that, by default, create one large WiFi system that should be accessible throughout your entire home. But that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh systems are, by far, more costly than a simple WiFi extender, plus you may have to work with your ISP to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.</p><h2>What to look for in a WiFi extender</h2><h3>Speed</h3><p>Extenders today can support single, dual or tri-band WiFi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a WiFi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more).</p><p>However, it’s important to remember that WiFi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to <em>increase</em> speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the WiFi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones.</p><h3>Range, and number of supported devices</h3><p>With the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.</p><p>Similarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your extender’s network, rather than directly to your WiFi router.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>There isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the WiFi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard AC outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable antennas that companies claim provide even better WiFi coverage.</p><p>Aside from that, there are the scant few standalone WiFi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.&nbsp;</p><p>Another convenient feature you’ll find on most WiFi extenders is an extra Ethernet port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a WiFi access point if you connect it to your router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet.

I tested the 705X, so I’m basing my recommendation off of my experience with that model, specifically.</p><p>Setting up this extender was as easy as plugging it in and following instructions in TP-Link’s Tether mobile app. All of the devices I tried followed the same basic setup process: first, plug the extender in close to your router, follow instructions in a mobile app or on a setup webpage, and once the connection is established, move the extender to your desired location.</p><p>It took all of five minutes to pair the 705X with my Verizon FiOS router – probably the most time-consuming bit was deciding what I wanted to name the new 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks. I went with the same name for both because I didn’t want to manually choose from two different bands when connecting things like my phone or laptop. The device will automatically pair your device with the appropriate band — for example, connecting most smart home gadgets to the 2.4Ghz network.</p><p>The permanent location where I moved all of the extenders I tested was in my basement, since that’s where we can get the spottiest signal. I first ran speed tests on my iPhone and MacBook using Speedtest.net and Speedcheck.org so I could compare them with the standard speeds I got when connected to my router’s main network. Unsurprisingly, the speeds generated by TP-Link’s extender were much slower than those from my router’s network, but that was the case with all of the devices I tested. Only our premium pick (see below) got close to my router’s standard speeds, but I expected this. WiFi extenders aren’t going to make your connection <em>better</em> – they’re just going to give you a wider area of coverage. From a spec perspective, both the 705X and the 700X are rated for speeds up to 2402 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 574 Mbps on 2.4GHz band.</p><p>Despite the results of my tests, I was happy to discover that I wasn’t held back by the 705X’s seemingly slower speeds. I worked as normal for hours with my phone and laptop connected to the extenders network, answering emails, messaging in Slack, streaming YouTube videos and otherwise maintaining a few dozen tabs in Chrome, without any hiccups or noticeable slow-downs.</p><p>I was not surprised to find TP-Link’s Tether companion app to be easy to use, if a little simple, because that was my experience with TP-Link’s smart home app. Tether is specifically used with the company’s networking devices, and you probably won’t spend a ton of time in it after initial setup. I especially like that you can name wireless devices that are connected to your extenders network like your phone and smart TV. That makes it much easier to know which things in your home are constantly paired with the extender rather than your router’s default network.</p><p>One important thing to note with these TP-Link extenders is that they both support <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=79539c2e-109d-49c3-a6ab-ddd018132f09&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TP-Link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3OTUzOWMyZS0xMDlkLTQ5YzMtYTZhYi1kZGQwMTgxMzJmMDkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHAtbGluay5jb20vdXMvb25lbWVzaC9wcm9kdWN0LWxpc3QvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNTM3YzBjMi1iY2U1LTQyODEtOGQyNy03MDY0ZjVjZmE4YTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWwf_d75L4j9h3fxGIY3iGt9EfZqMMSDc0A_MFnGVKjV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tp-link.com%2Fus%2Fonemesh%2Fproduct-list%2F">OneMesh</a>, which is the company’s feature that allows you to create one seamless mesh network if you have a compatible router. Since I’m still using the router provided to me by my ISP, I wasn’t able to test out this feature, but it works like this: if you have a OneMesh router and OneMesh-compatible extenders, you can link them all together under the same network name. So rather than having a router network and an extender network under the same roof, everything would be linked and filed under your main network’s name.</p><p>It’s a small perk that becomes not so small if you have a spotty extender, or even just an awkwardly laid-out home. In my testing, I found my phone disconnecting from some extenders’ networks when I went upstairs to the main floor of the house from my basement. It would then attempt to reconnect to the extender network, when really I would have preferred it to default back to my router’s network. That thankfully didn’t happen with TP-Link’s RE705X, but it’s something to keep in mind when considering buying a WiFi extender at all. If you can get one that has a feature like OneMesh, it’ll make your life much easier.</p><p>Coming in at $130 and $120, respectively, the RE705X and RE700X may not be the cheapest WiFi extenders out there, but their coverage range, WiFi 6 support and max speeds make either of them a good pick. If you know exactly where you want to put an extender and it’s not in an awkward or hard-to-reach location, the slightly cheaper, antenna-free RE700X may work just fine for you. But if you want that extra ability to tweak antennas to suit your needs, the RE705X is the way to go.</p><h2>Best budget: TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender (RE315)</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XaWZpLUV4dGVuZGVyLUJvb3N0ZXItV2lyZWxlc3MtUmVwZWF0ZXIvZHAvQjA4UkhEOTdRWT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1xYS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjUzN2MwYzItYmNlNS00MjgxLThkMjctNzA2NGY1Y2ZhOGEyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARAk7Y6VLJJUh3LCl0ra0KfYKakt-UEKAQbDtvzsfmF7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWifi-Extender-Booster-Wireless-Repeater%2Fdp%2FB08RHD97QY">TP-Link’s RE315 WiFi extender</a> is physically very similar to the RE705X, but with lower specs and that’s what makes it a $50 device. You’ll get up to 867 Mbps speeds on the 5GHz band and 300 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band, and it only provides coverage for up to 1,500 square feet. That won’t be as much of an issue for most people as max speeds will, but if you have a particularly large property, you’re better off going with a more expensive extender that can cover more space.</p><p>There’s also no WiFi 6 support on the RE315, which may be a dealbreaker for those who recently invested in a WiFi 6 router. This model does support OneMesh, though, which is nice if you already have a OneMesh system in your home.</p><p>I’m focusing on specification differences because my experience with the RE315 wasn’t that far off from the RE705X. Setup was just as plain and simple since the RE315 also uses the Tether mobile app, and while speeds were slightly lower in my testing, I didn’t notice too much of a difference in real world use. For $50 normally, and often closer to $30 when on sale, the RE315 is an easy pick for anyone who wants a budget-friendly way to fill WiFi dead zones in their home.</p><h2>Best premium: Netgear AX6000 WiFi 6 mesh range extender (EAX80)</h2><p></p><p>Having more than one WiFi network in your house is par for the course when it comes to adding an extender into the mix. But that’s not so with the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ORVRHRUFSLU5pZ2h0aGF3ay1SYW5nZS1FeHRlbmRlci1FQVg4MC9kcC9CMDdUODlZWldEP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcWEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY1MzdjMGMyLWJjZTUtNDI4MS04ZDI3LTcwNjRmNWNmYThhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcTeNyO4rDRAy7Tnip7keUi0BAgrJnfCddrOqMQo6z2f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNETGEAR-Nighthawk-Range-Extender-EAX80%2Fdp%2FB07T89YZWD%3Fth%3D1">Netgear EAX80 mesh range extender</a> – it has “seamless smart roaming,” which allows you to set it up under your existing SSID name. So instead of disconnecting from your main network and reconnecting to the extender’s network when you move from your living room to your basement, all you have to do is… move from one room to another and let Netgear’s device do the heavy lifting.</p><p>That’s one of the premium features included on the EAX80, but its $250 price tag can be attributed more so to some other perks. It’s a dual-band, WiFi 6 mesh range extender that will work with pretty much any router you may have. It supports speeds up to 6 Gbps and can have more than 30 devices connected to it at once. As far as square footage goes, it’ll widen your WiFi’s coverage by up to 2,500 square feet, which should be plenty for small and medium-sized homes. It performed well in our speed tests, coming very close to the upload/download speeds I got when being connected to my main network before installing the extender.</p><p>There’s nothing out of the ordinary about the Nighthawk mobile app, which is what you’ll use to initially set up the EAX80 extender. After that, you can use the app to troubleshoot, check WiFi speeds and see which devices are on your network. It’ll likely be a big list since you’ll see everything that’s paired to your router’s network as well. My only gripe is that you can’t edit device names. For example, my den’s TV shows up as “LGwebOSTV” and our soundbar in our basement shows up as “sonyaudio” — but there are a number of connected devices with no name at all, and we’re just stuck with that.</p><p>Aside from its fast speeds and reliable connection, two things set this Netgear extender apart from the other devices I tested. First is that seamless smart roaming feature – not having to switch between WiFi networks when going around my home was super convenient. I never had to worry about my laptop losing connection to a dedicated extender network when I moved from my basement to my second floor, which is something I frequently had to deal with when testing other devices.</p><p>The second differentiating factor is the EAX80’s design. Unlike other range extenders that are chunky blocks that plug directly into an AC outlet, Netgear’s model looks more like a standalone router. While that does mean it has a larger footprint than other devices I tested, it was actually easier to find good spots for it in my home because it didn’t have to be chained to the wall right above an outlet. Most people, especially those tight on space, will probably prefer the standard extender design, but the EAX80 gave me a bit more flexibility. I also appreciated that the EAX80 has four built-in Ethernet ports for physically connecting things like TVs, consoles and more, plus one USB-A port for hardwiring a printer.</p><p>Netgear’s EAX80 range extender is a solid option if you don’t mind dropping a bit of money to get a bunch of convenient features on top of stellar speeds and WiFi 6 support. But it’s worth noting that Netgear has a few options that are similar to the EAX80, but with various differences in speed, coverage and feature set. The most similar is the $130 <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ORVRHRUFSLU5pZ2h0aGF3ay1SYW5nZS1FeHRlbmRlci1FQVg4MC9kcC9CMDgyWDE0VzVQP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcWEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY1MzdjMGMyLWJjZTUtNDI4MS04ZDI3LTcwNjRmNWNmYThhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZcnbuwX_Ltn1plqLAQnXCITtcXc8NU-G3byoYW4LwWb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNETGEAR-Nighthawk-Range-Extender-EAX80%2Fdp%2FB082X14W5P%3Fth%3D1">EAX20 extender</a>, which includes 1,500 square feet of coverage, support for WiFi 6 and up to 1.8Gbps speeds, plus seamless smart roaming capabilities.

<p>This year's summer edition of Samsung Unpacked was busy, to put it mildly. The company not only introduced its latest wave of foldable phones, but major updates to its smartwatch and tablet lineups. But don't worry if that's a lot to take in — here's everything Samsung introduced at its event.</p><h2>Watch the highlights of Galaxy Unpacked summer 2023&nbsp;</h2><div id="4751ebb98fb2489c8c10e80163379d08"></div><p>If 7AM Eastern was too early for you to watch live, don't worry.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-hands-on-a-larger-external-display-holds-promise-110059050.html">new model</a> has a much larger 3.4-inch external display than its predecessor, letting you reply to messages, use Wallet and otherwise handle tasks that previously required opening the phone. A new hinge design also eliminates the gap when the handset is closed. You can also expect a speedier custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and double the storage.

<p>Finding a suitable TV for your PlayStation or Xbox used to require a careful look at spec sheets. Today, however, the best TVs for gaming are usually the best TVs you can buy, period. While nobody <em>needs</em> a fancy TV in their living room to enjoy a good video game, the right set can help you maximize your gaming experience. If you’re unsure of where to start, we’ve laid out some helpful advice for buying the right model below, along with a few top picks for the best gaming TVs you can buy today.</p><h2>What to look for in a gaming TV</h2><p>Whether you use it for gaming or not, all good TVs are built on the same foundations. You want a 4K resolution (which is standard nowadays), sufficient brightness, high contrast ratios with deep and uniform black tones, colors that find the right balance between accuracy and saturation, and wide viewing angles. For video games specifically, you want a TV with minimal input lag and fast motion response, with no blur or other unwanted artifacts behind quick-moving objects. Of course, finding a set that ticks all those boxes and fits into your budget can be tricky.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, a top OLED TV will offer the best picture quality for gaming or otherwise. Good OLED TVs still tend to cost more than LED LCD alternatives, however, and some may not get bright enough for those who have their TV set in a particularly well-lit environment. If you opt for an LCD TV, an advanced backlight with mini-LEDs and effective <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/742183/what-is-full-array-local-dimming/">full-array local dimming</a> will usually improve contrast and lighting detail, while a quantum dot filter can enhance colors.</p><p>One thing you don’t need to worry about is 8K support. Although the PS5 and Xbox Series X are technically capable of outputting 8K video, very few games are made for that resolution, and 8K’s practical benefits are <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship">extremely minimal</a> unless you plan on sitting unreasonably close to a massive TV. The few 8K TVs on the market are also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2023-8k-mini-led-tv-starts-at-5000-163559445.html">very expensive</a>.</p><p>All that said, there are a few terms you should look for in particular when buying a TV for your new game console or high-end graphics card.</p><h3>HDMI 2.1</h3><p>To get the most out of a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, your TV should have full HDMI 2.1 support. This is the latest major update to the HDMI spec, enabling a higher maximum bandwidth – 48 gigabits per second, up from HDMI 2.0’s 18 Gbps – and a handful of features that are beneficial for gaming specifically. These include variable refresh rate (VRR) and automatic low latency mode (ALLM), which we detail further below.</p><p>Beyond that, perhaps the chief perk of HDMI 2.1 is its ability to transmit ultrasharp 4K video at up to a 120Hz refresh rate with modern consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X, or up to 144Hz with a powerful gaming PC. Not every <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/all-ps5-games-that-support-120-fps-the-smoothest-games-on-playstation-5/">PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-with-120fps-support">Xbox Series X/S</a> game supports frame rates that high – and some only do so at lower resolutions – but those that do will look and feel especially fluid in motion. HDMI 2.1 also brings support for <a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/enhancedaudioreturnchannel">Enhanced Audio Return Channel</a> (eARC), which allows for higher-quality 5.1- and 7.1-channel audio from a source device connected to the TV to a compatible soundbar or receiver.</p><p>The more full HDMI 2.1 ports your TV has, the better. “Full” is the key word there. As reported by <a href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/articles/when-hdmi-2-1-isnt-hdmi-2-1"><em>TFT Central</em></a>, because HDMI 2.1 is backwards compatible with HDMI 2.0, TV and monitor manufacturers have been allowed to brand HDMI ports as “HDMI 2.1” even if they lack full (or any) support for the spec’s upgraded features. We recommend a few TVs below that have true HDMI 2.1 ports, but if you’re buying a new TV for gaming, make sure your chosen set isn’t trying to hide any capabilities you may consider essential.</p><h3>HDR — High Dynamic Range</h3><p>HDR refers to a TV's ability to display a wider range between the darkest and brightest parts of a picture. This broader range can bring out details that would otherwise be missing on a standard dynamic range (SDR) TV, in both the very dark and, especially, the very bright areas of an image. HDR typically comes with an improvement to color reproduction as well, displaying a larger palette of more vibrant colors that brings content closer to its creator’s original vision.</p><p>To get an HDR picture, you need both content that is mastered to take advantage of the tech and a TV capable of displaying that content. HDR also comes in a variety of formats, which are generally split between those that utilize static metadata (e.g., HDR10) and those that utilize dynamic metadata (e.g., HDR10+, Dolby Vision). In short, the latter allows a TV to optimize its brightness and colors on a per-scene or even per-frame basis, while the former uses one set of optimized settings for the entirety of the given content. Support for these formats can differ depending on the TV, content and game console you use. The Xbox Series X and S, for example, support <a href="https://www.dolby.com/experience/xbox/#gref">Dolby Vision for gaming</a>, while the PS5 does not.</p><p>The good news is that most TVs you’d buy in 2023 are HDR-ready in some fashion, even on the budget end of the market. The catch is that some TVs are much better at getting the most out of HDR than others. The same goes for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-26-disney-the-mandalorian-hdr-quality.html">actual content</a> mastered in HDR. With video games in particular, there aren’t as many games designed to take advantage of HDR as there are movies (though the number is growing), and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-31-red-dead-redemption-2-not-true-hdr.html">variance in quality</a> tends <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-105-015615945.html">to be wider</a>.</p><h3>HGiG — HDR Gaming Interest Group</h3><p>HGiG stands for the <a href="https://www.hgig.org/">HDR Gaming Interest Group</a>. Sony and Microsoft are both members, as are many TV makers and game developers. What this means is that, ideally, all the groups communicate information so that you can start up a new game on a console or PC and have it automatically recognize your display. Once that happens, the game can adjust the internal settings to adjust for that display's capabilities and give you the best picture quality possible, without losing details in the brightest or darkest areas of the screen. For example, daylight at the end of a dark tunnel may portray a brightly lit environment instead of looking like an overexposed white blob.</p><p>This is a good thing, but the reality is a bit more complicated. Not all TVs highlight HGiG compatibility in their settings menu, while only some PlayStation and Xbox games recognize and follow the guidelines. If an HGiG option is listed in your TV's tone mapping settings, you should turn it on prior to running the console's HDR settings. Then, if you're playing a game that supports HDR and HGiG, you should be in good shape without having to adjust the various luminance levels again. Still, how all of this looks to <em>you</em> might differ depending on your TV and the game you’re playing. Owners of certain LG OLED models, for instance, may prefer their TV’s Dynamic Tone Mapping setting. Use whatever settings you think look best.</p><h3>ALLM — Auto Low Latency Mode</h3><p><a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/autolowlatencymode">ALLM</a> allows a source (like your PS5 or Xbox) to tell the display to switch into a mode that reduces lag between receiving each frame of an image and displaying it on the TV. This cuts out additional processing that could be the milliseconds of difference between landing a precise input or not. A good modern TV can automatically switch to game mode, then back out when you'd rather watch a movie or TV show.</p><h3>VRR — Variable Refresh Rate</h3><p><a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/variablerefreshrate">VRR</a> is a familiar feature to PC gamers, but it’s still relatively new for most TVs. Most players  have experienced slowdown, screen tearing or stuttering as a system struggles to render each frame at the target speed, which is most commonly 30 or 60 fps on a TV. With VRR, everything stays in sync — your display won't show the next frame until it's ready, which can make things feel smoother and more responsive, even if the system fails to deliver on its target frame rate.</p><p>With VRR, however, everything stays in sync — your display won't show the next frame until it's ready, which can make things feel smoother and more responsive, even if the system fails to deliver on its target of 30, 60 or even 120 fps.</p><p>There are a few different implementations of VRR available, including <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTIzNDhmNi0yMzA0LTQxNWUtYjE2Yy0xZmIyNTI3OTQwNjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnZpZGlhLmNvbS9lbi11cy9nZWZvcmNlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2ctc3luYy1tb25pdG9ycy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY1ODQzYTUwLTFjMTEtNDllZS1iZjg2LTJmYTVkNDIxOTQ0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW-0GsAVE8eGkzSggX3VcDBHrBy1gmYQ4YocWtXb-8wc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fproducts%2Fg-sync-monitors%2F">Nvidia’s G-Sync, </a><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync">AMD’s FreeSync</a> and the HDMI Forum’s VRR spec, which is part of the full HDMI 2.1 standard. Both a TV and an input device need to support the same VRR tech for it to work, and different devices may only support VRR within a specific refresh rate window. On a 120Hz display, for instance, the PS5’s VRR only works between 48Hz and 120Hz.</p><p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-variable-refresh-rate-vrr-release-date-193228613.html">PS5 supports</a> HDMI Forum VRR, the Xbox Series X/S support HDMI Forum VRR and FreeSync, while gaming PCs may support G-Sync or FreeSync depending on whether they use a Nvidia or AMD graphics card. A great gaming TV supports all the big VRR formats, but missing, say, G-Sync, isn’t a killer if you only game on a PS5 or Xbox.</p><h2>The best gaming TVs you can get right now</h2><p>We’re updating this guide during a transitional period for the TV market, as most of the major brands began selling their newest TVs for 2023 relatively recently. That means the new sets’ prices are generally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lgs-2023-oled-tvs-arrive-in-late-march-starting-at-1299-175513466.html">still higher</a> than last year’s models, which manufacturers are selling for less to clear out inventory. Because some of those 2022 TVs are still excellent, they can offer strong value while they’re still available at a discount.</p><p>If you don’t care about paying more for the latest and greatest set, most 2023 TVs are technically better than their predecessors, as you’d expect.. If you want the most bang for your buck, however, a good set from <em>last year</em> should provide greater value while it’s still in stock.

## Bumble spins its BFF friend-finding feature off into a standalone app

<p>Seven years after Bumble launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-04-bumble-now-lets-you-to-find-a-new-bff.html">Bumble BFF</a>, the company is finally giving users their own app for making friends. Bumble has announced the release of Bumble For Friends, an app dedicated solely to finding friends in your area. The company started testing the app earlier this year in the United Kingdom and select regions of Asia, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-bff-standalone-app"><em>Mashable </em>reported</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Bumble For Friends will function almost exactly like Bumble BFF (which makes up 15 percent of Bumble's monthly active users, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/21/bumble-is-testing-a-separate-bff-app-for-finding-friends/">Bumble spokesperson told <em>TechCrunch</em></a>). However, there will be no need to download a dating app — something coupled-up users will likely be happy about. Like a dating app, though, you create a profile with a mix of photos, information about yourself and responses to prompts. It can include things like if you drink, your political affiliation, your relationship status and why you're looking to make friends. Your Bumble For Friends profile will also have space to share some of your interests, like dogs or dancing — one of the things <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bumble-private-detection-open-source-192530832.html">Bumble</a> uses to help match you with potential friends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There is one new feature on Bumble For Friends: the option to create a group chat. Basically, if you think any of your matches would also get along, you can add two or more of them to a group chat. To use this option, go into the conversations tab and pick a Bumble-suggested activity or add your own. You can also just give the group chat a name (which you can edit later on) if you don't want to pick what to do. From there, you can invite matches and get talking. Invitees will receive a notification about the chat showing them your chosen title or the potential activity.</p><p>Bumble For Friends is free to download on Apple's App Store or the Google Play Store. You can create a new account or log into your existing one and have your profile and matches transferred over. At that point, your Bumble BFF account will disappear from the original app, but you can still use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bumble-virtual-dating-coronavirus-165215408.html">Date</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-02-bizz-bumble-app-for-networking.html">Bizz</a> modes. Bumble doesn't seem to be forcing anyone to switch to the new app, so you can still keep all your accounts in one place if you prefer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bumble-spins-its-bff-friend-finding-feature-off-into-a-standalone-app-130040779.html?src=rss

## The man behind the USB-C iPhone rebuilt the AirPods Pro case to make it repairable

<p>Robotics engineer Ken Pillonel, known for creating a makeshift <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-usb-c-i-phone-becomes-a-reality-thanks-to-a-robotics-engineer-113556672.html">USB-C iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/an-engineer-just-made-the-first-airpods-that-charge-with-usb-c-141540375.html">AirPods</a>, has revealed his next project. The modding wunderkind has deconstructed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html">Apple’s AirPods Pro</a> case and built a custom repairable version. Pillonel is sharing the design for free, allowing enterprising self-repair enthusiasts with a knack for engineering to make their own.</p><p>Pillonel has already tackled the AirPods Pro with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-robotics-engineer-is-trying-to-make-the-airpods-pro-easier-to-repair-184249580.html">custom replaceable printed circuit board (PCB)</a>. However, his new project attempts to dissect the earbuds’ entire case, offering a complete blueprint for others to do the same — with 3D-printed sections and a few (cheap) afterparty parts. “Most gadgets are designed without repairability in mind, unlike the durable technology of the past that seemed built to last,” Pillonel wrote, noting that <em>iFixit</em> gave the second-gen AirPods Pro a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/66194/apples-new-airpods-are-telling-users-to-replace-the-batteries-already-too-bad-thats-impossible">dismal zero repairability score</a>. “It is troubling to see design choices like non-replaceable batteries, glued-in components, and a lack of transparency in public information leading to the rise of ‘fast electronics.’”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In response, the engineer took on this latest project “to demonstrate how one of the most popular gadgets today — Apple’s AirPods Pro — could have been easily made repairable with minimal effort.” His stated goal is to inspire consumers and multi-billion-dollar corporations <em>(ahem, Apple)</em> to treat technology less like a locked-down disposable commodity and more like something one can tinker with, learn from and — with the right skills — repair themselves. Of course, a central component is using screws and nuts instead of adhesives to create a makeshift case you can crack open and fix down the road.</p><figure><img alt="Engineer Ken Pillonel working with a 3D printer. He is to the right / front of the printer, looking inside of it." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/7e3d06a0-2b0a-11ee-9cf7-c6a13c62df3d" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ken Pillonel / Exploring the Simulation</div></figure><p>Pillonel says this was one of his most challenging custom projects yet, as he had to create precise scans of the case’s every component. As he explains in the video below from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ExploringTheSimulation">YouTube channel</a>, some of the case’s parts proved especially difficult with complex curves that a simple caliper and basic 2D scans couldn’t quite nail down. He even detailed his quest for finding the right spring-loaded contact pins to charge the buds and an affordable 3D scanner to capture some of the more oddly shaped parts. I recommend a quick watch to anyone curious about sustainability and the nuts and bolts behind iconic consumer tech gadgets. (Remember that such tinkering will void your warranty, and you should probably only give it a shot if you’re experienced with electronics repairs.)</p><p>“I am thrilled to make these repairable designs available to the public at no cost, encouraging individuals and manufacturers alike to prioritize repairability in their product development,” Pillonel wrote today. “Together, we can work towards a circular economy that not only minimizes electronic waste but also fosters a culture of conscious consumption and responsible tech innovation.” You can peruse Pillonel’s designs and storefront for replacement parts on <a href="https://shop.kenp.io/">his website</a>.</p><div id="075698e99c6f40ae9cf69c74023da671"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-man-behind-the-usb-c-iphone-rebuilt-the-airpods-pro-case-to-make-it-repairable-130008565.html?src=rss

## The best cheap Windows laptops for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html?src=rss)

<p>If you’re a regular Engadget reader, you probably don’t think of cheap Windows laptops when you think of daily drivers. But it would be a big mistake to ignore these devices — if not for yourself, then for others. Lots of people have financial restrictions to adhere to and others just don’t need all the power of a flagship laptop — they just need the best budget machine they can get. There’s a good reason  companies like Acer, ASUS, Dell and the like make Windows devices under $500.</p><p>Affordable Windows notebooks are great options for people that only use a computer to check email, shop online or post on Facebook. (Hello, mom and dad?) They’re also good for kids who have no business putting their sticky little hands on a $2,000 gaming rig. And, depending on what you need them for, these devices can be decent daily drivers, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What about Chromebooks and tablets?</h2><p>Now, you may be inclined to recommend a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebook</a> or a tablet to all of the people listed above. Those instincts aren’t wrong, but Chromebooks and tablets aren’t the best buy for everyone. Tablets will only work for the most mobile-competent users like kids who have been grabbing smartphones out of their parents’ hands since they’ve been dexterous enough to do so. Tablets can also be just as expensive as some of the cheapest Windows laptops, and that’s without a mouse or keyboard.</p><p>Chromebooks are a good alternative for those that basically live in a browser, the trade-off being you must give up the “traditional desktop.” And Chrome OS is a more limited operating system  than Windows when it comes to the programs you can install and run.</p><h2>What Windows laptops do well</h2><figure><img alt="Bangkok, Thailand - August 20, 2020 : Computer user touching on Microsoft Edge, a web browser developed by Microsoft, icon on Windows 10 to open the program." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/843ff380-b255-11eb-bddf-b4000d3cf728" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wachiwit via Getty Images</div></figure><p>So what can you realistically accomplish on a cheap Windows laptop? Quite a bit, especially if you’re doing one thing (or a limited number of things) at a time. They’re great for web browsing, checking email, video streaming and more — but, yes, all of those things can be done on Chromebooks as well. Windows laptops have a big advantage, though, in Microsoft Office. While yes, there is a browser based version, the native, desktop apps are considered a must have for many and will run smoothly on even the most bare-bones budget laptop. The only caveat is that you may run into some slowdown on low-powered devices if you’re multitasking or working with large data sets in Excel or a lot of photos and graphics in Powerpoint.</p><p>When it comes to specs, a bright spot for Windows laptops is storage. Even the most affordable devices tend to have at least 128GB SSDs. That will come in handy if you prefer to keep your most important files saved locally on your laptop. In contrast, cheaper Chromebooks often have less storage because they’re built on the assumption that you’ll save all of your documents in the cloud. Not only is that less convenient when you need to work offline, but it also limits the size of programs and files that you can download. So, not great for hoarding Netflix shows before a long trip or using a Chromebook as a gaming laptop.</p><p>Windows also has thousands of apps that you can download from its app store. Chromebooks have some Chrome apps, numerous browser extensions and the ability to download Android apps, but quality control is… inconsistent. Android apps, in particular, often haven’t been optimized for Chrome OS, which makes for a wonky user experience. Windows may not have as many apps as Android, but at least the experience is fairly standard across the board.</p><p>Windows also gives you the ability to download and use programs from other sources, like direct from the developer. You can run things like Adobe Creative Suite, certain VPNs and programs like GIMP, Audacity and ClipMate on a Windows device, which just isn’t possible on Chrome OS. Chromebooks limit you to the apps and programs in The Play Store and the Chrome Extensions store, reducing any others to unusable, space-sucking icons in your Downloads folder.</p><h2>What to look for in a cheap Windows laptop</h2><p>While you can do a lot even when spending little on a Windows laptop, you must set your expectations accordingly. The biggest downside when purchasing a budget laptop (of any kind, really) is limited power. Many Windows laptops under $500 run on Intel Celeron or Pentium processors, but you can find some with Core i3/i5 and AMD Ryzen 3/5 CPUs at the higher end of the price spectrum.</p><h3>Specs to look for in a sub-$500 Windows laptop</h3><ul><li><p>Intel Core i or AMD Ryzen 3 processors</p></li><li><p>8GB of RAM</p></li><li><p>An SSD with at least 128GB of space</p></li><li><p>1080p display</p></li><li><p>Mostly metal designs</p></li></ul><p>We recommend getting the most powerful CPU you can afford because it will dictate how fast the computer will feel overall. RAM is also important because, the more you have, the easier it will be for the laptop to manage things like a dozen browser tabs while you edit a Word document and stream music in the background. However, with sub-$500 laptops, you’re better off getting the best CPU you can afford rather than a laptop with a ton of RAM because the CPU will have enough power to handle most tasks that cheap laptops are designed for (If you’re editing RAW images or 4K video, you’ll want to invest in more RAM… and a laptop well above $500).</p><p>When it comes to storage, consider how much you want to save locally. If you primarily work in Google Docs or save most things in the cloud, you may not need a machine with a ton of onboard storage. Just remember that your digital space will also be taken up by apps, so it may be worth getting a little extra storage than you think you need if you know you’ll be downloading big programs. A final side note: SSDs are ubiquitous at this point, not to mention faster and more efficient than HDDs, so we recommend getting a laptop with that type of storage.</p><p>You also don’t have to settle for an entirely plastic notebook either. There are options in the sub-$500 price range that are made, at least in part, with metals like aluminum. Those will not only be more attractive but also more durable. As for screens, there’s a healthy mix of HD and FHD options in this price range and we recommend springing for a notebook with a 1080p display if you can. Touchscreens aren’t as common in the under-$500 space as standard panels, but you’ll only really miss one if you get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">2-in-1 laptop</a>.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html"><strong>Best Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html"><strong>Best Gaming Laptops</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html"><strong>Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html"><strong>Best Chromebooks</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html"><strong>Best Laptops for College Students</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>A final note before we get to our picks: The best cheap laptop models change all the time. Unlike more expensive, flagship machines, these notebooks can be updated a couple times each year. That can make it hard to track down a specific model at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart or any other retailer. Also, we’ve seen prices vary widely depending on the configuration and retailer you’re looking at. We’ve listed some of our current favorite models below, but if you can’t find any of them available near you, just keep in mind our list of specs to look for in a cheap laptop – they’ll guide you to the best machines available at the moment.</p><h2>Best overall: Acer Aspire 5</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BY2VyLUE1MTUtNTYtMzJESy1EaXNwbGF5LWkzLTExMTVHNC1Qcm9jZXNzb3IvZHAvQjA5UjVWWVJWTi8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tYXAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYwZTIwZmI3LTc4MzEtMzRmYS1iMTQ3LTVkNzM3ZTM1MTlhZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARUzvVgY-GIyOZ8dPM6Z_KgmrJ35Mk08erDuK8LjUyYP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAcer-A515-56-32DK-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor%2Fdp%2FB09R5VYRVN%2F">Acer’s Aspire 5</a> series has been a reliable pick for quite some time now. Most recently, we tested out a model that had a 14-inch 1080p display and runs on an 11th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and has 256GB of storage. Currently, you can pick up a model with a 15.6-inch display, an 11th-gen Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD for around <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BY2VyLUE1MTUtNTYtMzJESy1EaXNwbGF5LWkzLTExMTVHNC1Qcm9jZXNzb3IvZHAvQjBCTDg2Vk03Ri8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1hcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjBlMjBmYjctNzgzMS0zNGZhLWIxNDctNWQ3MzdlMzUxOWFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQNLmnG6oANrIlUhxb-Wbgjjes3k4QMKRTXqdsHv_r5a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAcer-A515-56-32DK-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BL86VM7F%2F%3Fth%3D1">$300</a>.</p><p>Performance on our review unit was similar to the previous Aspire 5 model that we tested, the display is good and the keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience. The latest Aspire 5s support WiFi 6, and most models have a nice variety of ports including one USB-C (that’s separate from the power back), three USB-A, an HDMI connector and a (gasp) Ethernet port. Battery life is solid as well: this model gets an average of 10 hours of battery life. On the previous version, we were clocking in roughly six, so this is a much-needed improvement.</p><h2>Runner up: Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvTGVub3ZvLUlkZWFQYWQtRmxleC01LTE0LUZIRC1Db252ZXJ0aWJsZS1BTUQtUnl6ZW4tMy00MzAwVS00R0ItUkFNLTEyOEdCLVNTRC1HcmFwaGl0ZS1HcmV5LVdpbmRvd3MtMTBTLTgxWDIwMDBIVVMvODI5MTM2MDk2PyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjBlMjBmYjctNzgzMS0zNGZhLWIxNDctNWQ3MzdlMzUxOWFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAecnDejVG1BEUgYIDDCD7YW8HH4jrBT47sYuhH_ofY0I&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-IdeaPad-Flex-5-14-FHD-Convertible-AMD-Ryzen-3-4300U-4GB-RAM-128GB-SSD-Graphite-Grey-Windows-10S-81X2000HUS%2F829136096%3F">Lenovo’s Flex 5 14</a> is a good alternative if you want a more portable cheap laptop with a battery life that will keep you going all day long. It runs on an AMD Ryzen 3 4300 processor, with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, and it’s accompanied by a 14-inch 1080p IPS display and an array of ports that includes one USB-C connection. If you care about future-proofing, that USB-C port will be critical. You may not have a lot of USB-C accessories right now, but that will most certainly change in the coming years.</p><p>The typing experience is also top-notch: while it doesn’t have a number pad, its keys have that rounded-bottom shape that’s similar to keys on Lenovo’s ThinkPad machines. They make a satisfying clicking sound while you’re typing, but they’re not loud enough to bother those around you.</p><p>And despite being a budget laptop, the Lenovo Flex 5 14 isn’t flimsy. The palm rests don’t creak under pressure and it’s easy to carry this machine one-handed around a room. I also appreciate its convertible design, which gives you more flexibility. And like most Lenovo machines, the Flex 5 14 has a webcam that you can cover with a physical shutter.</p><p>The Flex 5 14 also has the upper-hand over the Aspire 5 when it comes to battery life: The former lasted about 16.5 hours in our testing, whereas Acer’s machine lasted roughly 10 hours. That makes the Lenovo option the clear winner if you’re looking for a laptop that can last all day and then some.</p><h2>Another good option: Surface Laptop Go 2</h2><p></p><p>We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Microsoft's <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NaWNyb3NvZnQtU3VyZmFjZS1MYXB0b3AtR28tVG91Y2hzY3JlZW4vZHAvQjA5WDIxWE02TT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1hcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjBlMjBmYjctNzgzMS0zNGZhLWIxNDctNWQ3MzdlMzUxOWFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVdFgegUHwID_W13gzjV8IN1jQmM5d1acL7man6BsELz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Laptop-Go-Touchscreen%2Fdp%2FB09X21XM6M">Surface Laptop Go 2</a> here, even though it starts at $600. It’s certainly a decent option to consider if you’re really into the Surface Go line. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-go-2-review-basic-but-in-a-good-way-specs-price-133047655.html">Laptop Go 2</a> has one of the best designs you’ll find on any cheap Windows notebook, with a minimalist aesthetic, thin bezels surrounding its display and a relatively like 2.5-pound weight. It’s 12.4-inch PixelSense touchscreen has 1,536 x 1,024 resolution, and it’s still pretty crisp despite not being an FHD panel. You’re also getting a 720p webcam, a fairly comfortable keyboard (albeit with no backlight) and a port array that includes one USB-A connection, one USB-C socket, a headphone jack and a power slot.</p><p>In addition to the attractive design, another reason why you may want to spring for the Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2 is that even the base model runs on an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 processor. We found it to provide snappy performance, and you’ll probably notice a difference if you’re coming from a machine with a Core i3 processor or something even less powerful. We were also impressed by the Laptop Go 2’s battery life – it lasted nearly 15 hours in our testing, and since Microsoft improved the interior thermal system, you shouldn’t hear excessive fan noise when you’re using it.</p><p>There are two big downsides to the Laptop Go 2: the higher starting price and the base model’s 4GB of RAM. You’ll pay $600 for a machine with a Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, and while those specs aren’t terrible, we usually recommend spring for a machine with at least 8GB of RAM. It’ll make multitasking much easier and more efficient, thereby improving your experience using the notebook in the long run. You’ll have to spend $700 to get that amount of memory in the Laptop Go 2, which is still cheaper than flagship notebooks, but not as affordable when compared with the other laptop computers we picked.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-go-2-review-basic-but-in-a-good-way-specs-price-133047655.html"><strong>Read our Full Review of Surface Laptop Go 2</strong></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon has teamed up with Boost Infinite, a wireless carrier owned by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-acquires-boost-mobile-wireless-carrier-171217646.html">Dish Wireless</a>, and has launched a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hbWF6b24uY29tL2Jvb3N0aW5maW5pdGU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXI3LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxZTVkZjE4YS0yNmZiLTQ0NWUtOTI1OS1jOTRkYzgwNDcwYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfF7RtcsLpL0C5FEcdAekiIaXR6Qq1BZ3KcNIMFL3dsd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fboostinfinite">storefront</a> to make the latter's SIM kits more accessible. While Amazon sells SIM cards from a variety of providers, this is a genuine tie-up that automatically pre-qualifies Prime members for the carrier's $25-per-month postpaid wireless plan. Subscribers can purchase Boost Infinite's Unlimited $25 SIM kit from the Amazon store with a 20 percent discount. And if they do, they're also getting a $25 bill credit that will go towards their first month of service, provided that they've activated their SIM within 30 days of receiving it.&nbsp;</p><p>Dish first introduced Boost Infinite in mid-2022 with a plan that offers "unlimited data, talk and text." The plan also provides users with 5G internet, which uses AT&amp;T's, T-Mobile's and Dish's own network, though it will get throttled after the first 30GB of the month. Subscribers can add up to five lines per account, as well. Boost Infinite promises a wireless service with no surprise, or even planned, price hikes. It says members can expect to pay $25 a month for as long as they're active.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Customers who purchase a SIM kit from Amazon don't have to walk into a store to activate their account. They simply need to complete their registration via the carrier's app, after which it will pair them up with a customer support rep — a "real person," the company emphasizes — to help them with setup and activation. To note, new subscribers can bring in their (unlocked) phones or get a new one from Boost Infinite, and they can keep or change their number. Boost Infinite's network is compatible with both unlocked iPhones and Android devices, and it also comes with eSIM support for Apple's mobile phones.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve Downer, Vice President of Consumer Electronics at Amazon, said:</p><p>"Amazon has always been about providing convenience, value, and selection to customers. Part of that is making it easier for customers to access wireless plans that are compatible with a variety of devices and can be set up from home. The Boost Infinite Unlimited SIM kit gives Prime members an exclusive deal to access affordable postpaid wireless service on one of the top networks in the U.S. at a great value."</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-members-can-now-get-pre-approved-for-new-boost-infinite-plans-120058552.html?src=rss

<p>Samsung has taken the wraps off its latest clamshell-style foldable smartphone, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMmM4ZjgwNy02YTZiLTQxNjctYWMyNi1iNDZlMTBjMzk0YjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcFeNsDxmgOusBJ8_edvhoGjkzq5fZktda7B9I7-H_q-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The new handset's biggest change is a 3.4-inch cover display that is significantly larger than the 1.9-inch outer panel on last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a>. This should generally make the device more convenient when it's folded up, as there's now more space to reply to texts, check notifications, take selfies and the like. Other upgrades include a faster Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and a redesigned hinge that makes the whole package slimmer when folded.</p><p>The larger external display brings the Galaxy Z Flip 5 much more in line with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=673991f4-9b22-4608-a813-f4cbfa1518a1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Motorola&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzM5OTFmNC05YjIyLTQ2MDgtYTgxMy1mNGNiZmExNTE4YTEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW90b3JvbGEuY29tL3VzL3NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzLXJhenItcGx1cy9wP3NrdUlkPTkxNyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzJjOGY4MDctNmE2Yi00MTY3LWFjMjYtYjQ2ZTEwYzM5NGIwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAddZ2lirWgf_jxSOHcMPPRvKmYO4_pNHOi6WED6-VWz_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-razr-plus%2Fp%3FskuId%3D917">Moto Razr+</a>, another flip-style foldable that arrived earlier this year.

<p>Samsung followed through on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-unveil-its-new-foldables-on-july-26th-230053235.html">promise</a> to reveal its two latest foldables during its Unpacked event in Seoul today. We now know that the new flagship foldable, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NzA2NzU0MS0zMzA0LTRlZGItODVhOS1lOWZiMjU3MThkNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf8EU2sBkXOuylPOQGBujAiHoRggCUZPiQLLLlXmTS_m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2F">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, indeed uses a new Flex Hinge to narrow the gap between the two halves of the screen, shaving more than two millimeters off the folded thickness. The new model also employs the second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 processor and the internal screen got a brightness boost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As our reviewer Sam Rutherford notes in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-hands-on-specs-price-is-samsung-squandering-its-head-start-110009600.html">hands-on</a>, that's where the big differences end. The Z Fold 4 and 5 have the same cameras, same screen sizes and resolutions, and the same batteries — though the new processing tricks and more efficient chipset may allow this year's model to make better use of that hardware. The new phone also carries the same $1,800 MSRP, so if you're deliberating between this model or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">previous</a> one, you may as well go for the latest.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But how does the latest Z Fold compare to Google's Pixel Fold? For a long time, Samsung was the only major player on the foldable pitch, until Google released its entrant and brought some serious <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html">competition</a>. Both phones have the same size internal screen, but Samsung's orientation is taller and skinnier than Google's. The Z Fold 5 has a little bit bigger battery and three of the five cameras boast more megapixels than the ones on the Pixel Fold.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the specs for Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Google's Pixel Fold side-by-side so you can see which one makes the most sense for you. We also included specs for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 so you can see what changed (and what didn't) this year.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 5</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Pixel Fold</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 4</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Pricing</strong></p></td><td><p>Starts at $1,800</p></td><td><p>Starts at $1,799</p></td><td><p>Starts at $1,800</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Release date</strong></p></td><td><p>August 2023</p></td><td><p>June 2023</p></td><td><p>August 2022</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Open Dimensions</strong></p><p><strong>(H x W x D)</strong></p></td><td><p>6.1 x 5.1 x 0.24 in</p><p>(154.9 x 129.8 x 6.1 mm)</p></td><td><p>5.5  x 6.2 x 0.23 in</p><p>(139.7 x 158.7 x 5.8 mm)</p></td><td><p>6.1 x 5.1 x 0.25 in</p><p>(155.1 x 130.1 x 6.3 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Folded dimensions</strong></p><p><strong>(H x W x D)</strong></p></td><td><p>6.1 x 2.6 x 0.53 in</p><p>(154.9 x 67.1 x 13.5 mm)</p></td><td><p>5.5 x 3.1 x 0.47 in</p><p>(139.7 x 79.5 x 12.1 mm)</p></td><td><p>6.1 x 2.6 x 0.62 in</p><p>(155.1 x 67.1 x 15.8mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td><p>8.9 oz</p><p>(253 g)</p></td><td><p>10 oz</p><p>(283 g)</p></td><td><p>9.3 oz</p><p>(263 g)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen size (internal)</strong></p></td><td><p>7.6 in</p><p>(193 mm)</p></td><td><p>7.6 in</p><p>(193 mm)</p></td><td><p>7.6 in</p><p>(193 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen size (external)</strong></p></td><td><p>6.2 in</p><p>(157 mm)</p></td><td><p>5.8 in</p><p>(146.7 mm)</p></td><td><p>6.2 in</p><p>(157 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen resolution (internal)</strong></p></td><td><p>2176 x 1812 at 374ppi</p></td><td><p>2208 x 1840 at 380ppi</p></td><td><p>2176 x 1812 at 374 ppi</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen resolution (external)</strong></p></td><td><p>2316 x 904 at 402ppi</p></td><td><p>2092 x 1080 at 408ppi</p></td><td><p>2316 x 904 at 402 ppi</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen type (internal)</strong></p></td><td><p>Dynamic AMOLED (120Hz)</p></td><td><p>OLED (120Hz)</p></td><td><p>Dynamic AMOLED (120Hz)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen type (external)</strong></p></td><td><p>Dynamic AMOLED (120Hz)</p></td><td><p>OLED (120Hz)</p></td><td><p>Dynamic AMOLED (120Hz)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</p></td><td><p>Google Tensor G2</p></td><td><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td><p>4,400 mAh</p></td><td><p>4,821 mAh</p></td><td><p>4,400 mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td><p>12GB</p></td><td><p>12GB</p></td><td><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Internal storage</strong></p></td><td><p>256GB, 512GB or 1TB</p></td><td><p>256GB or 512GB</p></td><td><p>256GB, 512GB or 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Rear cameras</strong></p></td><td><p>Three cameras:</p><p>Main: 50MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture</p><p>Ultra wide: 12MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p><p>Telephoto: 10MP, ƒ/2.4 aperture, 3X optical zoom</p></td><td><p>Three cameras:</p><p>Main: 48MP, ƒ/1.7 aperture</p><p>Ultra wide: 10.8MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p><p>Telephoto: 10.8MP, ƒ/3.05 aperture, 5x optical zoom</p></td><td><p>Three cameras:</p><p>Main: 50MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture</p><p>Ultra wide: 12MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p><p>Telephoto: 10MP, ƒ/2.4 aperture, 3X optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Front Camera</strong></p></td><td><p>10MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td><td><p>9.5MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td><td><p>10MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Internal camera</strong></p></td><td><p>4MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture</p></td><td><p>8MP, ƒ/2.0 aperture</p></td><td><p>4MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Water resistance</strong></p></td><td><p>IPX8</p></td><td><p>IPX8</p></td><td><p>IPX8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td><p>5G, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td><p>5G, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td><p>5G, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Charging</strong></p></td><td><p>25W fast charging</p><p>12W wireless</p></td><td><p>30W fast charging</p><p>7.5W wireless</p></td><td><p>25W fast charging</p><p>12W wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td><p>Icy Blue, Phantom Black, Gray, Blue or Samsung-exclusive Cream</p></td><td><p>Obsidian or Porcelain</p></td><td><p>Graygreen, Phantom Black, Beige or Samsung-exclusive Burgundy</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-galaxy-z-fold-5-vs-pixel-fold-did-samsung-rise-to-googles-challenge-113709671.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Netflix lists $900,000 AI job to help ‘create great content’

<p>It looks like the big entertainment powers are digging in for a long battle with striking actors and writers. Not that they don’t have money to use. Here’s an example: Netflix’s recent job posting for a machine learning platform product manager, with a heady annual salary of $300,000 to $900,000 (that’s a range). That’s compared to many actors who make around $200 a day, according to this SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/files/20202023TVWages_Year3WageDiversion.pdf">contract</a>. AI's role in creating future entertainment is a key item of debate for both striking parties.</p><p>The job listing indicates AI will be used to “create great content” and not just develop new algorithms to recommend shows and movies. The posting also alludes to integrating artificial intelligence in “all areas of the business.” The first tentative steps have already been made: Netflix currently airs a Spanish reality dating series called <em>Deep Fake Love</em>, which scans contestants’ faces to create AI-generated deepfakes, while its gaming studio employs generative AI to compose narratives and dialogue.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>You can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox. </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em>Subscribe right here!</em></a></p><p>​​</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html">The best password managers for 2023 </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-arc-personalized-web-browser-is-now-available-to-everyone-140015020.html">The Arc personalized web browser is now available to everyone </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-this-weeks-congressional-ufo-hearing-164546251.html">How to watch this week's Congressional UFO hearing </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-is-taking-his-sec-fight-to-the-supreme-court-161255874.html">Elon Musk is taking his SEC fight to the Supreme Court </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-chips-act-just-received-its-final-approval-114524113.html">The EU Chips Act just received its final approval</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-chatgpt-app-is-now-available-for-android-163607202.html">ChatGPT app is now available for Android </a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/orange-amps-portable-bluetooth-speaker-shines-by-sticking-to-the-basics-180021381.html">Orange Amps' portable Bluetooth speaker shines by sticking to the basics</a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-3-review-a-high-quality-zoom-adds-new-creative-options-130020261.html">DJI Air 3 drone review</a></h2><h3>A high-quality zoom adds new creative options.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-3-review-a-high-quality-zoom-adds-new-creative-options-130020261.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/d1b02870-2b8d-11ee-9cbf-df48f5e8a6cc" style="height: 380px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>DJI is one of the most innovative gadget companies out there, constantly trying new things with its drones, like a triple-camera setup on the Mavic 3 Pro.

That means the telephoto camera has the same specs as the main one, rather than being relegated to lesser quality like it was on the Mavic 3. That opens up new possibilities for pilots, giving them two ways to create cinematic shots. Further highlights include long battery life, reliable obstacle protection and an extensive feature set.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 hands-on: A larger external display holds promise

<p>After I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html"><ins>reviewed the Motorola Razr+</ins></a> earlier this year, I grew besotted with its external screen. Not only was its 3.6-inch outer panel larger than the 1.9-inch version on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 4, it was also more useful. Since then, I’d been hoping that Samsung would adopt a bigger outer display on its next-gen Flip foldable, and today, my wish has been granted. The Galaxy Z Flip 5, which the company launched today, sports a 3.4-inch window on the outside that’s 3.78 times larger than before.</p><p>It also has a new “Flex Hinge” that allows the device to fold shut without leaving a gap between the two halves of the internal screen. Throw in the typical processor upgrades, double the base storage and some software enhancements, and the Z Flip 5 appears to be a small, but meaningful step up for the same $999 starting price as last year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>A larger external screen with lots of potential</h2><p>The highlight of the Z Flip 5 is clearly its larger external display, which Samsung has infuriatingly decided to rename the Flex Window. I don’t know why, since this panel doesn’t fold and the old name of “Cover” screen still makes sense. Confusing name aside, it’s easy to see why the bigger panel is more useful. Widgets like Calendar or Weather can show data for multiple events and days. Buttons are larger, so you can more easily skip songs in the media player, start or stop timers and more.</p><div id="b46e1a0b567b4a79b0032bacb59bf250"></div><p>With more room, Samsung was able to squeeze two additional shortcut buttons in the Quick Settings drawer that appears when you swipe down from the home screen. Dragging up opens Samsung Wallet, so you can quickly pay for your morning coffee.</p><p>To be clear, the Flip 5’s 3.4-inch panel doesn’t stretch across the entire back half of the phone. It’s shaped like a file folder, sort of like a rectangle that’s been awkwardly cut to avoid the pair of cameras at the bottom right. This makes for a very strange aspect ratio that many apps might struggle with, but for the most part, the software sees the screen as a rectangle. The little tab at the bottom left is largely ignored and is devoted to a Samsung Pay shortcut or a space for any ongoing activities to show their progress. If you have a timer running or a song playing, for example, a small progress bar appears there.</p><p>Because Samsung now supports more widgets on the cover, getting through all of them can become a slog. I saw about a dozen of them on the demo unit, and having to swipe 10 times to get to the one I want would suck. Thankfully, the company introduced a new gesture that lets you pinch out to access Multi Widgets view, and from there you can quickly jump to the tile you want. Don’t confuse this with the All Apps page on Android — it may look similar, but it only shows you the widgets that Samsung has made available on One UI 5 for the Flip 5.</p><figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 folded and held in mid-air, with its cover screen facing the camera. On the screen are five apps -- Maps, Messages, Netflix, WhatsApp and YouTube." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/a5bac680-2b60-11ee-9eff-8cf4f41da2f1" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><p>Another thing that may have you thinking the Flex Window can give you the full Android experience is that it supports a handful of apps like Message, YouTube, Google Maps, WhatsApp and Netflix. In countries like Korea, you’ll also find popular options like Kakao Talk. These aren’t widgets — they run like the full-fledged versions of themselves on the outside screen. I watched some YouTube videos, drafted messages and looked up restaurants in the area on the smaller panel and found them to be pretty much identical to the larger versions.</p><p>Though the practicality of using full Android on the external display is debatable, I still find it questionable that Samsung limits what apps can run natively on the Flex Window. That’s not to say you can’t find a workaround. The company itself offers an <a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock?langCd=en"><ins>app called Good Lock</ins></a> that will let you run any Android app on the tiny panel. Still, it’s different from the Moto Razr+, which basically runs Google’s whole operating system up front.</p><p>Samsung’s approach is meant to ensure that only users who are invested enough to install a separate app to mimic the full Android experience on the Flex Window can. This way, if things break or look weird, you only have yourself to blame.</p><p>Another area where Moto and Samsung differ on the cover screen is the QWERTY keyboard. Both companies let you respond to messages and notifications with a full-sized keyboard, and Moto takes up the entire canvas to give you bigger buttons. Meanwhile, Samsung only uses about the bottom two thirds of the space, while retaining the message or input field at the top so you can see what you’re entering or responding to.</p><p>I like having larger keys, but Moto’s layout adds a step where, after typing your reply, you have to back out of the keyboard to the app and hit the submit button. On the Flip 5, the Send button is right above the keyboard and you can tap it when you’re done. I’ll have to spend more time with a review unit to better evaluate the two approaches and see which I prefer.</p><section><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 folded in half, with the camera preview appearing on its cover screen facing the camera. In the viewfinder is a man using a DSLR to take a photo of the phone." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/d05fad10-2b60-11ee-b1fe-467d8d92770c" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /></section><h2>Cameras and Flex Mode</h2><p>One of the best things about having a larger cover screen is how much more useful it is as a viewfinder. Most foldable phones let you use the secondary display to preview shots you take with the rear cameras, which are almost always superior to the interior sensors. On the Z Flip 4’s tiny sliver of a panel, it was hard to see what I was recording. This year, you’ll actually be able to view your entire shot before taking it. Like before, you can also swipe to change modes and lenses, as well as pinch to zoom in on your subjects.</p><p>The camera hardware hasn’t really changed. Samsung applied a different coating to the primary lens and tweaked some of the software to enable greater digital zoom. But on paper the Flip 5 has the same pair of 12-megapixel main and ultra-wide cameras as its predecessor. Inside, the 10-megapixel selfie camera has a slightly larger aperture of f/2.2 (compared to last year’s f/2.4), which should make for brighter, clearer shots. Without a side by side comparison, though, it’s tough to tell how noticeable of a difference it will make.</p><p>It’s not like you’ll want to use the internal camera much, since you can easily frame up shots with the outside sensors now. But it could come in handy for video calls or livestreams, in which case you might find it handy to prop the phone up by folding it at a 90-degree angle and sitting it up on a table.</p><p>When you fold the Flip 5 but don’t completely shut it, Flex Mode kicks in (on compatible apps). We’ve seen this on older models — apps like YouTube, Camera and Gallery will adapt their layouts by presenting content on the top half and controls on the bottom. This year, though, Samsung added more shortcuts to the Flex panel that appears on the lower half (if you enable the feature). When the Flip 5 is flexed, a small icon shows up on the bottom left that will bring up the navigational panel and move the rest of the app to the top portion of the screen.</p><figure><img alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5 folded slightly and propped up on its bottom half, with its internal display facing out." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/31403e60-2b61-11ee-beeb-b81ce399cf9b" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><p>Here, you can have settings that make one-handed use slightly easier. You can press a button to bring down the notifications shade instead of having to reach your thumb all the way to the top. You can also take a screenshot using a shortcut or bring up a touchpad for exploring the top half of the screen with a cursor. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with the updated Flex Mode at the hands-on session, but I know I was less than impressed when I reviewed the Flip 4 last year, after initially being excited about the feature. This time around, I won’t be so easily fooled (I hope).</p><h2>New hinge, old crease</h2><p>One of the more significant changes to the Z Flip line is Samsung’s new “Flex Hinge.” I’m still a little miffed about the obsession with calling everything “Flex” this and “Flex” that and honestly “Flex Hinge” sounds like a dating app exclusively for people showing off their biceps. But it’s just a marketing name for Samsung’s redesigned hinge with a dual-rail structure that is supposed to help diffuse impact.</p><p>Putting aside my distaste for the name (once more), I have to admit the new mechanism seems solid. The phone closes, without a noticeable gap like the Flip 4. It still felt as sturdy as older models, holding itself up at various angles from about 20 degrees to 160 degrees or so. Those of you who found the gap irritating should be relieved.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 laid flat on a blue surface, with a crease visible in the middle of its internal display." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/5602cbf0-2b61-11ee-bfaf-6130a519134e" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><p>People who hated the crease in the middle of the internal screen, though, will be disappointed. When I held up the Flip 5 next to a Flip 4 that I brought, the degree to which their flexible displays wrinkled was pretty much identical. But in my years of testing foldable phones, creases have never been anything more troublesome than an aesthetic quirk. It won’t get in the way of actually using the device.</p><h2>Processor, storage and other specs</h2><p>In fact, you’ll probably enjoy the Flip 5’s internal screen, which is a 6.7-inch Full HD AMOLED panel that refreshes at 120Hz. The 22:9 aspect ratio is slightly taller than your average smartphone, but most apps run fine. Powering everything this year is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset that’s also in the Galaxy S23 series. Samsung doubled the storage for the Flip 5, so the base model gets 256GB (instead of last year’s 128GB) while costing the same. That’s a nice touch, and might even make me forgive the company’s overuse of the word Flex.</p><p>Also in Samsung’s favor is this year’s selection of colors. You can choose from the standard black (graphite), cream, lavender or this generation’s signature color — mint. It’s a similar shade of green to the one Apple used for the iPhone 12, which is still one of my favorite colors ever used on a handset. Plus, I was beginning to find the Flip 4’s Bora Purple a little dated.</p><figure><img alt="Four Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 units in graphite, lavender, cream and mint, laid out on a wooden stool. Two stick-it notepads are also on the surface." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/78e94680-2b61-11ee-b5fc-ea3a9c8f69ac" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><p>Pretty much everything else about the Flip 5 is the same as its predecessor. The battery size is the same at 3,700mAh, and it recharges at the same rate as well. That’s a little disappointing, considering the Flip 4 already struggled to last an entire day. But, perhaps the new larger cover screen is useful enough that you can conserve battery life by using the internal display less.</p><p>The Flip 5 also retains the same IPX8 water-resistance rating as the Flip 4, though it uses the newer Gorilla Glass Victus 2 covering on the outside. The handsets didn’t feel very different to me, so any changes here are pretty subtle.</p><p>Frankly, the biggest difference to the Flip 5 is its Flex Window, followed by its Flex Hinge. Some tweaks to Flex Mode round up the set of upgrades Samsung is bringing to its smaller foldable this year. Though I’m a fan of roomier screens on the outside of flip-style foldables, I can’t help but wonder: is Samsung limiting the Flip 5’s potential with its reluctance to run full Android on the small display?</p><p>That’s a question I can only answer after spending more time with a review unit and evaluating things like camera quality, battery life and real-world performance. For now, Samsung has brought us hardware that holds a lot of promise.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-hands-on-a-larger-external-display-holds-promise-110059050.html?src=rss

## Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 hands-on: The spinning bezel’s triumphant return

<p>While Samsung’s latest Galaxy Watches might not be the highlight of its second Unpacked event this year, they’re arguably the most anticipated Android smartwatch launch every year. One of the most conspicuous absences from the last model was the fan-favorite spinning bezel that’s long been a hallmark of Samsung’s wearable. With the announcement of the Galaxy Watch 6 series today though, the bezel is back. Specifically, Samsung has unveiled two new models — the Galaxy Watch 6 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, and the latter sports a smaller rotating bezel than the last generation that did. That, along with some physical refinements, are the most obvious changes on the hardware front, while health-tracking continues to be a focal point for the Galaxy Watch series.</p><h2>Physical and hardware changes</h2><p>Samsung reps had a Galaxy Watch 5 at the event and when I held it next to a Watch 6, I could see how much cleaner the design was. While the company did shave some fractions of an inch off the case, that’s not as noticeable as the fact that the screen now lies flush with the lugs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adding to the sleeker appearance is the Watch 6’s display, which is now 20 percent larger than the previous model, thanks to a bezel that’s 30 percent slimmer. On the Classic, Samsung managed to make the physical spinner 15 percent smaller, too, so it also has a 20 percent bigger display.</p><div id="de3cd2e353484c8882fd74f3316b4ebe"></div><p>Despite its smaller size, the mechanical bezel on the Watch 6 Classic seems just as easy to use as before. I could still feel individual grooves under the frame as I jumped through apps and widgets by rotating the wheel, using each notch as a tactile cue to figure out what page I was on. And credit to Samsung for bringing back this glorified fidget spinner without making the Classic too bulky, although it comes in larger sizes (43 and 47mm) than the standard model (40 and 44mm).</p><p>In addition to getting bigger, the Watch 6s’ panels are sharper and brighter than before too, going up 2,000 nits this year. You can also adjust the brightness of the Always On Display, which is nice on a sunny day or when you’re running low on juice.</p><p>As with each smartwatch launch, the company has also added faces and straps for the Watch 6 series that older generations can use too. But what’s intriguing this year is a new “one-click” mechanism for some bands that should make swapping them easier. It took a few tries to figure out, but once I did I found it simpler than the Pixel Watch’s version. All you need to do is push down on a button then lift the strap up out of the lug. Putting it back in is a matter of holding down the button and aligning the screws to the lug, then letting go.</p><p>Other physical changes to the Watch include an updated processor and larger battery. Samsung says you can get eight hours of juice on eight minutes of “fast charge,” so if you’re running low and still want to track your sleep, you should be able to plug in and quickly get enough power to last all night.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic on plastic stands, showing their lugs and buttons. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/9445d490-2b4b-11ee-bf38-7f7f6b7fbc2e" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><h2>Sleep tracking and insights</h2><p>Speaking of, some of the biggest updates to the Galaxy Watch series are coming to its sleep-tracking and coaching features. For those who wear the watch to bed, more insights are coming. Samsung says the Watch 6 will give users “in-depth analysis of Sleep Score Factors” like total sleep time, cycles, awake time and new parameters the company is calling “physical and mental recovery.”</p><p>Samsung also worked with the National Sleep Foundation to co-develop “more individualized Sleep Messages” that give users feedback each morning about their night. The Watch 6 can also recognize patterns around your sleep and wake times to see how consistent you are, and assign a “Sleep Animal Symbol” to represent your style. This is very similar to what Fitbit and Google offer with the Pixel Watch, but Samsung is not locking this behind a paywall.</p><p>Sadly, I wasn’t able to test any of these new sleep-related features (I’ve been asked to stop napping on the job), and some of them take at least seven days of wear to kick in, so we’ll have to wait till we get in a sample for testing before I can evaluate these.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic on a person's wrist, with a finger pushing on the bottom button. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c60ac440-2b4b-11ee-bbfd-ea0f14d928c7" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><h2>Fitness, heart rate and other updates</h2><p>Other updates I wasn’t able to truly gauge include the new Samsung Wallet app (instead of just the Pay widget), personalized Heart Rate Zone calibration for running workouts and irregular heart rhythm notifications. But I can tell you what they’re supposed to do.</p><p>The Samsung Pay feature on the watch has been replaced by the Wallet, which means you can use digital IDs (where compatible), boarding passes, event tickets and loyalty cards on the watch. There’s also a new Track Run workout type that logs the number of laps you complete, while the personalized Heart Rate Zone tool requires you to go through a ten-minute calibration session before it gives you five “optimal running intensity levels” so you can exercise to activate processes like fat-burning.</p><p>When the Galaxy Watch 6 detects heart rhythms that might suggest atrial fibrillation, it will prompt you to run an electrocardiogram test. It’ll monitor your pulse in the background for such patterns, including when you’re asleep. Overnight, the Watch 6 series’ onboard skin temperature sensor will also kick in to gather data that can help determine what stage of your menstrual or ovulation cycle you might be entering.</p><figure><img alt="The back view of the Galaxy Watch 6, with its bottom strap detached." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/f7a52180-2b4b-11ee-b4ff-0501e971b1b2" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford</div></figure><p>Samsung also introduced a Skin Temperature API under its “Privileged Health” software development kit (SDK) that will allow third parties to create different applications for the Watch’s LED infrared sensor or the temperature data that it gathers. One example is a new Thermo Check app that lets you measure water temperature before you have to dip into a pool. (Of course, if you’ve stuck your whole hand in the water, you probably already know if it’s too cold.)</p><p>A number of third-party apps have also been brought over to or optimized for the Watch 6, as well as other watches running Wear OS 4. These include WhatsApp, Google Calendar, Gmail, Audible, along with updated versions of Peloton and MyFitnessPal. Samsung also tweaked its Camera Controller app to let you remotely snap pictures, switch modes and zoom from the latest foldable phones (in addition to boring ol’ regular handsets). Find My Phone on the Galaxy Watch will now show where your misplaced device is on a map, as well.</p><p>For obvious reasons, I wasn’t able to test most of these updates — given I couldn’t simply go running for ten minutes at a hands-on, and it probably would have been a bad idea to load my credit card on the demo units. But I don’t feel as if I missed out on much. The most significant changes appear to be cosmetic and many of the software updates might eventually trickle down to older models. I’m intrigued by the sleep insights Samsung looks set to deliver, but that will take at least seven days for me to start seeing results. Stay tuned for our full review to see how the Galaxy Watch 6 performed on that front, but also for the details on battery life and real-world experience. Until then, if you’re ready to get a new Android smartwatch, you can already pre-order <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvd2F0Y2hlcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU0MzU3NjA1LTkzNmUtNDZkZC04MzMyLTEzMWFjYTE0NzUwNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVUuNkfUegzxnGJMJI9g4yHdOiqWFQbjKMVPx_WQ1Hbf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fwatches%2F">the Galaxy Watch 6 from $300</a> and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvd2F0Y2hlcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU0MzU3NjA1LTkzNmUtNDZkZC04MzMyLTEzMWFjYTE0NzUwNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVUuNkfUegzxnGJMJI9g4yHdOiqWFQbjKMVPx_WQ1Hbf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fwatches%2F">Watch 6 Classic, which starts at $400</a>.

## Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra hands-on:  A premium tablet with water protection

<p>This year’s Galaxy Unpacked foldable showcase is more of a Samsung eco-system barrage. Two foldables, two wearables, and no fewer than three tablets are here to tempt you to stick with the Galaxy family (or jump ship from rivals like Apple and Google.) While the fourth-generation foldables are arguably the big reveals, Samsung’s latest flagship tablet, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, is making its case for a premium Android tablet.</p><p>The flagship Galaxy Tab S9  is only the company’s second “Ultra” tablet, and there are many similarities to last year’s Tab S8 Ultra, with its 16:10 screen, dual-camera array on the back and magnetized stylus holster. This time, you can attach the stylus in either direction on the holster, and it’ll still charge – an odd oversight on the previous model.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c0ce2504-2a36-11ee-b17e-88a6329c5680" style="height: 2400px; width: 3600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Design-wise, it’s more of the same for Samsung’s tablet: More smooth aluminum frames but with slimmer bezels. They’re still thin and feel incredibly premium, especially the wide-screen Ultra. The Tab S9 Ultra feels a little unwieldy in my hands, partially due its taller screen ratio, which I’m not used to. Also because it’s almost 13 inches wide.</p><div id="386f3ccbb85a4660bd0785c474677029"></div><p>At least it’s gorgeous. Samsung has evolved the displays on its tablets even further, with the ninth-generation tablets all using Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays, like those found on its most powerful (and expensive) Galaxy S phones and Galaxy Book Ultra laptops. The Tab 9 Ultra has a 14.6-inch AMOLED display, capable of reaching 120Hz and supporting HDR 10+. While I’ll focus on the Ultra model,  the Galaxy Tab S9+ with its 12.4-inch display and Tab S9 with its 11-inch screen also get the same beefed-up AMOLED tech.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the screens are all vivid and high-contrast – it’s Samsung’s strength right here. I had to reduce the screen's brightness pretty substantially just to capture images of the Tab S9 Ultra.  Once again, the Galaxy Tab Ultra model comes with a notch – gasp – which appears to be dual 12-megapixel cameras. (There are a few specs we’re double-checking with Samsung.) The tablets also pack four AKG-tuned speakers, and if you’re planning to watch a lot of movies, shows or games, there’s also support for Dolby Atmos.</p><p>Beyond the display, Samsung has made two other major upgrades to the Tab S9 series. First up is IP68 dust and water protection to all the new tablets. Samsung says this means it should survive depths up to 1.5 meters of water, while it’s also launching a ruggedized cover (pricing TBD) to make the most of the tab’s new hardy bona fides.</p><figure><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c0a08550-2a36-11ee-bdfc-bfa31a7d8936" style="height: 2400px; width: 3600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung has also improved the processor for 2023 and its tablets all use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. The company claims some major performance improvements compared to last year’s Tab S8, including up to 32 percent improved CPU and 41 percent better GPU performance. Both the Tab S9+ and Tab S9 Ultra will be able to fast-charge at up to 45W, although only the Tab S9 Ultra will come with the compatible charging brick. That’s why it’s the Ultra, people. Both of the larger tablets have a dual-camera array on the rear, with 13- and 8-megapixel sensors, while the Tab S9 will have a single 13-megapixel camera.</p><p>You’ll be able to get up to 12 gigs of memory across all three models, although the base Tab S9 will also be available with 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage. The Tab S9 Ultra tops out with a heady 1TB storage for power users. Make sure to factor in the cost of your keyboard dock, though. We’re waiting to confirm pricing with Samsung for the Tab S9 Ultra version, but last year’s premium keyboard folio, which includes a trackpad, cost $350.</p><p>At least Samsung is making sure some apps power-users might demand make use of the add-on, with the company teasing CAD design app ArcSite and video-editor LumaFusion (think an Android-flavored iMovie) on its top tablet.</p><figure><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c0d94892-2a36-11ee-b789-cad5ebe85de1" style="height: 2400px; width: 3600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from the bidirectional charging feature, the S-Pen also gets IP68 support, which is more likely to get dropped into water hazard than an almost 15-inch tablet. Samsung announced that it will also launch a creator edition of its S-Pen, with a new textured finish, wider tilt angle and multiple stylus tips. However, I didn’t get to test that during my meeting with Samsung and there’s no word on pricing and launch date, yet.</p><p>The standard S-Pen feels, well, like a Samsung Stylus. It’s more substantial than the one included with the S23 Ultra and Note series, with a flattened side to aid grip, and it seems fluid and responsive on the Tab S9’s screen.</p><p>Samsung’s Multi Control attempts to sew together your disparate Galaxy devices. I tested out some simple tasks during my briefing, and (after logging into both devices with the same Samsung account) could interface between a Galaxy Flip 4 and the Tab S9 Ultra. While setting up Multi Control, you’ll even get to choose where your phone appears in relation to the Tab S9, just like setting up a second screen on a PC. Then, if using a trackpad or mouse, you can inch the cursor across to your Samsung phone, type into search bars and emails from your keyboard (not sure why you would do that), and drag and drop files and images.</p><p>Prices for Samsung’s flagship tablet, the Tab S9 Ultra start at $1,200, while the Tab S9+ will start at $1000 and the Tab S9 at $800. Preorders will open for all three on July 26th, with the tablets eventually going on sale August 11th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-hands-on-a-premium-tablet-with-water-protection-110020872.html?src=rss

Like its predecessor, the device starts at $1,800 for a model with 256GB of storage. However, if you pre-order the device by August 10, Samsung says you can upgrade to the higher-capacity 512GB model for no extra cost. Over <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMENDQzYzNzNXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFyOS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTJjZmM1YmEtYmJiNy00NmI5LWE1Y2ItZjExNmRkODZkYjUzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAV794sO5T9xCWcGC63uKkL7sC4VCiCt_8OTbMNrKP9mr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCC6373W">at Amazon</a>, you can get the same upgrade, plus a $200 Amazon gift card. A 1TB variant is available on Samsung.com, while all three SKUs come with 12GB of RAM.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can read our hands-on preview for a full rundown, but the Galaxy Z Fold 5’s main upgrade centers on its “Flex Hinge,” which largely eliminates any gap between the phone’s halves when it’s folded. The device is slightly thinner in that mode as a result, though it’s still a bit thicker than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html">Google’s Pixel Fold</a>. The whole thing now runs on a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset, and the main display has a higher peak brightness of 1,750 nits, up from 1,200 nits. (But it still has a visible crease.) There are some new gestures aimed at boosting the software’s multitasking chops, as well as a thinner S Pen stylus.</p><p>That said, the broad strokes of the Galaxy Z Fold 5 are similar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">to before</a>. The camera hardware, displays and battery aren’t drastically different, and the price is still high. But if you’ve been looking to upgrade from an older Galaxy Z Fold, or if you’ve just been looking to hop on the foldable train, this looks to be a close follow-up to a premium device we recommend in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html">our smartphone buying guide</a>.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</h2><p></p><p>The new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXotZmxpcDUvYnV5LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTJjZmM1YmEtYmJiNy00NmI5LWE1Y2ItZjExNmRkODZkYjUzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAR3Qq6xF4rrHEL65sQQ6PTeEueu2aPFrqZXtUOWrXKXl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-z-flip5%2Fbuy%2F">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> is also available to pre-order today, with an official on-sale date of August 11. It starts at $1,000, just like last year's Z Flip 4, but the base model now comes with 256GB of storage instead of 128GB. As with the Z Fold 5, you can upgrade to a 512GB unit for no extra cost if you pre-order by August 10. Both variants have 8GB of RAM. If you pre-order <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVVubG9ja2VkLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtRm9sZGFibGUtT25lLUhhbmQvZHAvQjBDQ0MzMjJCTD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xcjktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUyY2ZjNWJhLWJiYjctNDZiOS1hNWNiLWYxMTZkZDg2ZGI1MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYko1YgQOKGvBe6lfGpwDJoW9wVjDu7ZLQjZfs-g_A6Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Foldable-One-Hand%2Fdp%2FB0CCC322BL">through Amazon</a>, you can get that same storage upgrade alongside a $150 store gift card.</p><p>The big upgrade here is a significantly larger cover display. Whereas the Z Flip 4 had a 1.9-inch external panel, now you get a 3.4-inch screen. That brings the device more in line with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html">Moto Razr+</a> from earlier this year. Samsung is touting improved widget support thanks to that expanded screen space, though only a handful of full-on apps are designed to run on the outer display for now. Still, it should be easier to preview photos, control music, reply to texts, view the weather, check notifications and so on without having to physically unfold the device.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Samsung’s larger foldable, there’s a redesigned hinge that flattens the gap between the phone's two halves and makes the device slightly thinner when folded. Samsung has bumped this device up to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset as well, and it claims that some new processing tricks will help with low-light photos in particular. The rest of hardware isn’t much different outside of that, but you can check out our hands-on for more info.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9</h2><p></p><p>Beyond foldable smartphones, Samsung refreshed its Galaxy Tab lineup with a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvdGFibGV0cy9nYWxheHktdGFiLXM5L2J1eS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUyY2ZjNWJhLWJiYjctNDZiOS1hNWNiLWYxMTZkZDg2ZGI1MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAddo0DOSfFw2a_qW5Pa51kDNc2Z0zNWKl66UboiQ2J8k&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftablets%2Fgalaxy-tab-s9%2Fbuy%2F">trio of new tablets</a>: the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9, the 12.4-inch Galaxy Tab S9+ and the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. Those start at $800, $1,000 and $1,200, respectively, with pre-orders available today and general availability starting on August 11. The base Tab S9 comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the larger two models include 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage by default. Pricier variants with 5G support are also available.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like the foldables, those who pre-order the base Tab S9+ and Tab S9 Ultra can upgrade to a variant with 512GB of storage for no extra cost. Samsung says anyone who pre-orders a Galaxy Tab S9 device can take $40 off a pair of the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review-160057740.html">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> wireless earbuds as well.</p><p>While not radically different from last year’s Galaxy Tab S8 series, the new slates do bring a handful of meaningful changes. The entry-level Tab S9 now comes with a richer AMOLED display instead of a TFT LCD panel, while all three tablets now have an IP68 water resistance rating, so you can feasibly use them in the pool or shower with less worry. Each device now runs on a faster Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset as well.</p><p>In general, these are still high-end Android tablets, with slim aluminum frames, vivid displays and strong speakers. The question, as always, is whether you’re willing to pay this much for an Android tablet, even with Samsung’s usual modifications for productivity and multitasking. If so, the Tab S8 is the top Android pick in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html">our tablet buying guide</a>, and the Tab S9 appears to deliver similar pros and cons. Our hands-on has more details.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</h2><p></p><p>Samsung also introduced <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvd2F0Y2hlcy9nYWxheHktd2F0Y2g2L2J1eS8_bW9kZWxDb2RlPVNNLVI5NjBOWktBWEFBIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MmNmYzViYS1iYmI3LTQ2YjktYTVjYi1mMTE2ZGQ4NmRiNTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR8gmvJDbHDBNiQCzQsPaLs9cXtEEf-780aEZC3NJEyZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fwatches%2Fgalaxy-watch6%2Fbuy%2F%3FmodelCode%3DSM-R960NZKAXAA">two new smartwatches</a> at Unpacked: the Galaxy Watch 6 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Like everything else unveiled today, both wearables are up for pre-order today and will be more widely available beginning on August 11.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 starts at $300 for a 40mm case, which is a $20 bump over the Galaxy Watch 5. A larger 44mm model starts at $330. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is broadly similar to the standard model but brings back the physical rotating bezel of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">older Galaxy Watches</a>, a mechanism many users preferred for navigating the OS. That one comes in 43mm and 47mm sizes, which start at $400 and $430, respectively. Samsung says anyone who pre-orders one of the new models will receive a bonus fabric watch band for no extra cost. Bluetooth and LTE variants will be available, and the company is keeping last year’s <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvd2F0Y2hlcy9nYWxheHktd2F0Y2g1L2J1eS8_c2tpcERldmljZT1nYWxheHktd2F0Y2g1LXBybyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTJjZmM1YmEtYmJiNy00NmI5LWE1Y2ItZjExNmRkODZkYjUzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXMkJ-5lIQvlBHiGhKdepcHKKBvIwnYJU2cVcf2ankt-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fwatches%2Fgalaxy-watch5%2Fbuy%2F%3FskipDevice%3Dgalaxy-watch5-pro">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> around for those who want a more rugged option.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 comes with an extra 0.1 inches of display real estate compared to its predecessor, thanks primarily to bezels that Samsung says are 30 percent thinner. The smaller model of each device has a 1.3-inch, 432 x 432 resolution OLED panel, while the larger variants bump that up to a 1.5 inches and a 480 x 480 resolution. Both use sapphire crystal glass and are said to reach a peak brightness of 2,000 nits. On the Galaxy Watch 6, the screen sits flush with the lugs.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung has slightly increased the size of each watch’s battery: 300mAh for the smaller models, 425mAh for the larger ones. The company rates the overall battery life at up to 40 hours with the always-on display mode off, though, which is 10 hours less than the Galaxy Watch 5’s max estimate.</p><p>Beyond that, both devices come with faster Exynos W930 processors, 2GB of RAM (0.5GB more than before), 16GB of storage and an IP68 water resistance rating. They also run on Samsung’s One UI 5 Watch software, which, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watches-will-soon-help-you-get-a-better-nights-sleep-130001529.html">previously noted</a>, brings a heavier focus on sleep tracking, plus features like personalized heart rate zones and notifications for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watch-will-soon-be-able-to-alert-wearers-to-irregular-heart-rhythms-161545939.html">irregular heart rhythms</a>.

<p>Today at its Unpacked event, Samsung announced its latest flagship foldable – the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMzc4YjhkOS0xZWRjLTRlNmMtOWMyMC1iNzk2ODYzMzllN2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATxTXZLNvz3IPHbj40W12Fr9sfjdAc0jUDgwFyKXHSia&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> – which features a new hinge, an even sleeker design and a brighter main display. Samsung has also included a handful of new gestures for improved multitasking along with an updated chip. However, after multiple generations without any major design changes and a still extremely high price of $1,800, one has to ask if Samsung’s latest changes are really enough.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 is centered around what Samsung is calling a Flex Hinge, which is said to have a more streamlined design while still boasting IPX8 water resistance. And thanks to that new hinge, Samsung has managed to get rid of the gap between the screen halves while also decreasing its overall thickness to 13.5mm. That’s a nice move toward everyday usability, though it’s thicker than Pixel Fold, which is only 12.1mm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1ff6a9349a2b43bebba18eac0bef1fac"></div><p>On the inside, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy for increased performance along with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. However, the Z Fold’s battery is staying pat at 4,400 mAh, so Samsung is really relying on power efficiency gains to deliver longer runtimes. As for its cameras, we’re looking at essentially the same general setup as on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Z Fold 4</a> highlighted by a 50-MP main camera, a 12-MP ultra-wide and a 10-MP telephoto with a 3x optical zoom. Though, Samsung says it’s added some new processing tricks.</p><p>The screens are also essentially the same. You still get a skinny baton-like shape with a 6.2-inch OLED Cover screen along with that big 7.6-inch main display on the inside, both of which sport 120Hz refresh rates. That main screen’s peak brightness is now the same as what you get on an S23 Ultra at 1,750 nits, which is rather impressive for a flexible display. That said, it still has a crease, which may be an issue for some. Those who can ignore the divot though, will find a few new gestures to make multitasking on that expansive screen just a bit easier.</p><figure><img alt="Thanks to its new Flex Hinge, Samsung was able to almost completely eliminate the gap between the phone's halves when closed.

You can also drag and drop files and photos from one app to another without being in multitasking mode by touching and holding on something, and then using a different finger to open a new app from the taskbar. Granted, this feels kind of clunky. Depending on where things are on the screen, sometimes it feels like you’re playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)">Twister</a> with your fingers. But I like the direction Samsung is going, it reminds me of dragging a file down to the taskbar in Windows which gives you more of a taste of desktop-style productivity. And while the taskbar is largely the same as before, there are now four spots for recent apps (up from just two).</p><p>Finally, while there’s still no room for it inside the device itself, Samsung has created a new S Pen for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 that’s around 40 percent thinner than before that works with a revamped and more compact phone case so there’s somewhere to stash it when it’s not being used.</p><p>However, my issue with the Z Fold 5 is that while a lot of the changes are nice in a vacuum, for a company that has had such a head start in the foldable phone space, it seems like Samsung isn’t pushing that advantage as hard as it should. On the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html#:~:text=Wrap%2Dup,screen%20a%20lot%20more%20usable.">Pixel Fold</a>, which is Google’s first foldable phone by the way, we got an interesting new design that’s even thinner than the Z Fold 5 while having a similarly sized screen plus a longer 5x optical zoom, not to mention Google’s superior photo processing. And other big foldables from China, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-foldable-phone-pricing-availability-101858317.html">Oppo Find N2</a>, are doing a better job at eliminating the crease.</p><p>But perhaps more importantly, the Z Fold 5 still costs $1,800, which is ludicrously expensive. That’s kind of disappointing because after five generations, you like to see Samsung leverage its size to scale down the price of foldables. And for something like the Z Flip series, Samsung actually has done a decent job of that. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">original Z Flip</a> costs just shy of $1,500 dollars at launch, but Samsung has brought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">that price down to $1,000</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">first Z Fold</a> started at just under $2,000, and has only come down by $200 over five generations.</p><figure><img alt="The Z Fold 5 features the same basic camera setup as last year's phone including a 50-MP main camera, a 12-MP ultra-wide camera and a 10-MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom.

But if Samsung could bring the Z Fold line closer to $1,500 (even though that would still be very expensive), it would give Samsung a huge leg up on rivals like the Pixel Fold. So while I like the Z Fold 5’s sleeker design, brighter screen and improved multitasking, I still kind of feel like Samsung should be doing more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 will be available in three main colors: Icy Blue, Phantom Black and cream along with gray and blue options which will be available exclusively from Samsung.com. The Z Fold 5 will start at $1,800 with pre-orders going live today ahead of an official on-sale date of August 11th.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-hands-on-specs-price-is-samsung-squandering-its-head-start-110009600.html?src=rss

<p>Though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-project-red-the-witcher-game-unreal-engine-5-174928261.html">CD Projekt Red has a few games in the pipeline</a>, the company behind the <em>Witcher</em> video game series apparently doesn't have enough work for all its employees. As a result, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-red-organizational-update/">CD Projekt Red has announced it's cutting about 100 jobs</a> or around nine percent of its workforce. This news follows layoffs in May and June when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-studio-the-molasses-flood-hit-by-layoffs-following-project-reboot">29 people were let go from The Molasses Flood</a> (owned by CD Projekt Red), followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-to-lay-off-around-30-employees-as-gwent-development-winds-down">30 people who worked on a Witcher card game</a> that was scaled back.</p><p>&quot;To meet our own high expectations and ambitions to create the best role-playing games, we not only want to have the best people but also the <em>right</em> teams,&quot; CD Projekt Red CEO Adam Kiciński said in the announcement. &quot;There's no easy way to say this, but today we are overstaffed. We have talented people on board who are finishing their tasks and — based on current and expected project needs — we already know we don't have other opportunities for them in the next year.&quot; The company will notify all impacted employees now, but layoffs will be staggered, with some not taking effect until the beginning of 2024.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CD Projekt Red had a rough last few years — especially with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-bugs-playstation-xbox-refund-removed-183051405.html">the mess that was the Cyberpunk 2077 launch</a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment pulled the game from its PlayStation Store at the end of 2020 — only one week after it was released — due to widespread glitches. Customers were offered a refund, and CD Projekt Red's stock tumbled by over 20 percent, a drop of $1.8 billion. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-will-take-you-back-to-night-city-on-september-26th-181652972.html"><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</em></a>, its follow-up starring Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba, will hopefully have a smoother launch when it comes out on September 26th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cd-projekt-red-is-laying-off-nine-percent-of-its-staff-103509519.html?src=rss

<p>It's that time of the year again. Samsung is ready to show off its next generation of foldable smartphones, but this year, we expect  a barrage of Galaxy devices. Beyond hinged smartphones, rumors and leaks suggest at least one wearable and the successors to last year's Galaxy Tab S8 series. Before the show starts at a very early 4AM PT/ 7AM ET / 11AM BST tomorrow, grab a coffee and read up on everything we expect to see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-samsung-unpacked-2023-what-to-expect-on-july-26th-150001571.html">right here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, Samsung is broadcasting its Unpacked reveal event from its home in Seoul, South Korea, and we've got Engadget's Richard Lai on the ground there to capture what goes down. I'll support him here in London, UK, where it'll be a more sensible hour for a liveblog. Any questions? Pose them to me @thatmatsmith (<a href="https://twitter.com/thatmatsmith">X/Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.threads.net/@thatmatsmith">Threads</a>, it's all the same?).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d488ab3a17934ba59dfdb76e936364bf"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-july-2023-event-liveblog-100031572.html?src=rss

<p>Twitter has changed its official handle from <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter">@Twitter</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/X">@X</a>, as Engadget's intrepid reporter Kris Holt noticed (&quot;Oof,&quot; he observed). If you attempt to access @Twitter, it now states: &quot;This account is no longer active. Follow @X for updates.&quot; All past @Twitter tweets, (or X's, or whatever they're now called), are henceforth available in the @X account.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not all. The Twitter Blue subscription service is now called @XBlue (Blue subscription) in the main description page. That means the majority of X née Twitter's handles have dumped the Twitter name or replaced it with X. For instance, @TwitterSupport, @TwitterDev and @TwitterAPI are now <a href="https://twitter.com/Support">@Support</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/XDevelopers">@Xdevelopers</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/api">@API</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a7c7063225304ef591d06774d18af8f6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="qme">🫠 <a href="https://t.co/0ITzTlnyUL">https://t.co/0ITzTlnyUL</a><a href="https://t.co/ZGyTk0zfzt">pic.twitter.com/ZGyTk0zfzt</a></p>— Kris Holt (@krisholt) <a href="https://twitter.com/krisholt/status/1684074202339618816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Twitter didn't possess the @X handle yesterday, as it was in the hands of a user named Gene X Hwang, from a photography/video studio called Orange Photography, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/twitter-changes-its-official-handle-to-x/"><em>Techcrunch</em></a> reported. That changed as of today, though, and Hwang tweeted from a new handle &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/x12345678998765/status/1684023924949151744?s=20">all's well that ends well</a>,&quot; so hopefully he was compensated in some way for relinquishing the name.&nbsp;</p><p>X has been working hard to remove all vestiges of Twitter branding, including partially taking down the Twitter sign at its San Francisco HQ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/25/elon-musk-x-rebrand-twitter-sign-removal">before police intervened</a> to due a lack of a permit.

## The Honda E compact electric car might not get a follow-up

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-honda-e-first-drive.html">Honda's E electric car</a> went on sale in the summer of 2020 in Europe and Japan, offering those who want a cute and compact vehicle a zero-emission option. The retro-styled EV could be the only model in its line, though, because the automaker apparently has no plans to produce more cars of the same size. At the launch event of e:Ny1, Honda's new electric SUV, Honda UK executive Rebecca Adamson told <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/no-replacement-honda-e-brand-shifts-focus-suvs"><em>Autocar</em></a>: &quot;There won’t be more cars the size of the Honda E. I can say that confidently.&quot;</p><p>Adamson also said that Honda chose to focus on electric SUVs, because that's where the market demand in the UK is. &quot;It's a market-led product line-up. As long as that’s where the market is, we will continue to be SUV driven,&quot; the executive said. Indeed, the car has several SUVs in its current lineup, which will soon include the e:Ny1. At a business briefing in April, Honda also said that it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-will-debut-a-mid-to-large-size-ev-based-on-its-earchitecture-in-2025-051042586.html">building a mid-to-large-size EV</a> based on its e:Architecture platform that will go on sale in North America in 2025. As another clue that Honda was going to put its focus on electric SUVs, it said it was further developing its vehicle OS for use with mid-to-large-size EVs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Honda E was relatively well-received for its stylish looks, but it has a small battery and has a pretty short range at 137 miles. It was meant for city and suburban use only, not for long stretches of road with no charging stations in sight. As for the e:Ny1, it's a compact SUV with a range of 256 miles and a fast charging capability that enables it to go from 10 to 80 percent in 45 minutes. It's only the brand's second pure EV after Honda E meant for release in the European market.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-honda-e-compact-electric-car-might-not-get-a-follow-up-051431133.html?src=rss
