It doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 not even a super showdown can save such a limp series</p><p><em>This is a recap of </em><em>Secret Invasion </em><em>on Disney+. Do not read ahead unless you have seen episodes one to six \u2026</em></p><p>We picked up in the aftermath of Priscilla (Charlyane Woodard) and G\u2019iah\u2019s (Emilia Clarke) bloodbath. As Scilla inspected dead bodies, her phone rang and it was Fury (Samuel L Jackson). Presumably sensing that he was heading to Russia to meet his death, he wanted to call his (estranged?) wife one last time \u2013 the old romantic \u2013 still sweet on his wife despite the fact she revealed that their entire marriage had been an undercover Skrull op. The next we saw of him, he was rolling an empty car at the gates of New Skrullos and killing a couple of goons. Fury by name, ice-cold killer by nature. Roll weird AI credits.</p><p>The DNA contained in the Harvest that we saw on the computer monitor were: Ghost, Captain America, Corvus Glaive, Thanos, Outrider, Proxima Midnight, Captain Marvel, Abomination, Mantis, Cull Obsidian, Drax, Korg, Ebnony Maw, Frost Beast, Hulk, Chitauri, Valkryie, Thor, Gamora, Flora Colossus and Winter Soldier. Of course, it would have been impossible to collect Ebony Maw\u2019s DNA from the aftermath of the Endgame battle because the Maw was killed after being ejected from Thanos\u2019s ship by Iron Man while saving Doctor Strange. Perhaps that DNA came from somewhere else? I don\u2019t recall Ghost and Abomination being in Endgame\u2019s final battle, either.</p><p>Nice use of the various powers in Gravik and G\u2019iah\u2019s fight. A Drax arm here, a Hulk punch there, Ghost phasing, Captain Marvel energy, Ebony Maw magic, some Groot, Cull Obsidian and crucially, some Mantis when it mattered \u2026 The original comic-book Super-Skrull only had enhanced versions of the Fantastic Four\u2019s powers; G\u2019iah\u2019s version is way more powerful.</p><p>Good to see the real Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), Rhodey, the arms/art dealer (Uriel Emil), Dr Rosa Wilton Dalton (Katie Finneran), Pamela Lawton and whichever military officer Pagon (Killian Scott) had been impersonating, among others, in the New Skrullos basement.</p><p>If the radiation was so strong at New Skrullos, will all the real versions of the people we\u2019ve seen impersonated by Skrulls throughout the series be sick from it? Just how good are those iodine pills?</p><p>What now for Emilia Clarke\u2019s Super-Skrull G\u2019iah? If great responsibility comes with great power, how much responsibility comes with having ALL the powers? Too much responsibility, as David St Hubbins nearly said. We see her enter into a deal with Falsworth just as her dad, Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), had done with Fury, but with the caveat that they\u2019ll leave love and friendship out of it and do the best for their respective people. I will believe that when I see it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/secret-invasion-recap-episode-six-its-hard-to-care-about-this-jeopardy-free-finale\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/secret-invasion-recap-episode-six-its-hard-to-care-about-this-jeopardy-free-finale", "date_published": "2023-07-26T20:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UFO hearing key takeaways: cover-up claims and Pentagon denials", "description": "<p>Witness made several startling allegations about the US government and UFOs, but doubts lingered over key testimony</p><p>In scenes that felt reminiscent of a science-fiction movie, the US Congress held a public hearing on claims the government is covering up its knowledge of UFOs.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the hearing generated huge interest in the US and around the world as it heard from three key witnesses, including David Grusch, a whistleblower former intelligence official who in June<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation\"> claimed</a> the US has possession of \u201cintact and partially intact\u201d alien vehicles.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/ufo-hearing-update-congress-whistleblower\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/ufo-hearing-update-congress-whistleblower", "date_published": "2023-07-26T19:44:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Netflix lists AI job worth $900,000 amid twin Hollywood strikes", "description": "<p>Company lists highly paid machine-learning project manager role while actors and executives at odds over future of AI in Hollywood</p><p>As actors and writers strike over fair compensation and protections from the encroachment of artificial intelligence, Netflix has <a href=\"https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/278437235\">listed</a> a position for a machine learning product manager that will compensate somewhere between $300,000 and $900,000 a year.

The tween series, which ran from 2005 to 2008 and starred Jamie Lynn Spears as a boarding school student in Malibu, is remembered fondly by a certain slice of Nickelodeon-raised late millennials. Its ending felt premature and tinged with sadness, as the series finale aired a few months after Spears, the younger sister of Britney, revealed that she was pregnant at 16. Though the show had already wrapped production before Jamie Lynn became a too-young tabloid fixture, the popular impression was that her off-screen shock pregnancy torpedoed the cutesy, very PG series. (As a 14-year-old at the time, this was a brain-searing event.)</p><p>In other words, there\u2019s an on-paper case for Zoey 102, the new Paramount+ movie reboot of the series, in the sense that there was a lingering feeling of unfinished business to the show and that streaming service logic demands anything once popular be tried again. But it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. The revisionist happy ending for Zoey 101 feels at best strange and too overdue to work.

Brooding Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) has returned home \u2013 begrudgingly \u2013 from Copenhagen; his highly strung, chain-smoking, wine-sodden mother, Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis), is frantically and frenetically preparing a meal based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Seven_Fishes\">the feast of the seven fishes</a>, with kitchen timers going off left, right and centre, the culinary chaos building to an almost unbearable level.

I couldn\u2019t stomach more than a couple of episodes</p><p>\u201cOh, this is stressful,\u201d says Drag Me to Dinner host Murray Hill. For a show that is so over the top, this is quite the understatement. The high-stress kitchen chaos of The Bear has nothing on this hybrid reality show, which appeared in the US earlier this year. It is \u201cthe best show about duelling parties thrown by pairs of drag queens that the world has ever known,\u201d as one of its many co-hosts, Neil Patrick Harris, quips. He and Hill are joined by Broadway star Haneefah Wood, actor, chef and \u201clife of the party\u201d David Burtka, and the acidic drag queen Bianca Del Rio. With five hosts/judges, it continues to greedily pile on the elements, cherry-picking parts from different reality competitions: it\u2019s Come Dine With Me, it\u2019s Interior Design Masters, it\u2019s the performing challenges on Drag Race, it\u2019s MasterChef and it even has a brief quiz show element. Clearly, its maxim is more is more.</p><p>There might be a reason nobody in television has thought to try this particularly intense combination of ingredients before. The first half of an episode, which works pretty well, tasks the pairs of drag queens with making the food and drinks for a dinner party, to a specific theme. The first is \u201cTropical Kiki\u201d, with BenDelaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon opting for a\u201cdessert island\u201d concept, and Jackie Beat and Sherry Vine choosing to showcase talking birds and a cheese volcano. The cooking part is fun and anarchic, though I pity the poor crew who had to clean up the mess afterwards. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve really cooked,\u201d says Dela, though to call it cooking is pushing it a little. This is puns, gags, wisecracks and a bit of throwing stuff around the kitchen. Burtka occasionally steps in to help, though he has a drag alter ego, Sue Chef, who can also step in to cause havoc if the queens lose the quiz round.</p><p>Drag Me To Dinner is on Disney+</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/drag-me-to-dinner-review-so-stressful-and-chaotic-it-makes-the-bear-look-like-a-picnic\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/drag-me-to-dinner-review-so-stressful-and-chaotic-it-makes-the-bear-look-like-a-picnic", "date_published": "2023-07-26T13:51:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UFO hearings live: Congress to examine claims US government is harboring alien space craft", "description": "<p>House committee will hold hearing after former intelligence official David Grusch alleged the US had encountered \u2018malevolant\u2019 alien pilots</p><p><strong>Tim Burchett</strong> and <strong>Anna Paulina Luna,</strong> Republican members of Congress from Florida and Tennessee, respectively, are leading the House oversight committee investigation.</p><p>In a briefing last Thursday, Burchett said he and Luna had been \u201cstonewalled\u201d by federal officials when asking about UFOs, and prevented from accessing some \u201cinformation to prove that they do exist\u201d.</p><p>We\u2019ve had a heck of a lot of pushback about this hearing.

I see it as part of my work, not the extent of it, and it\u2019s also intimately tied to pain. For the public, being upskirted was an exciting origin story, but for me it was trauma. I was assaulted in public, and everyone knows the details. They want to hear the story from my mouth so they can enjoy the triumph at the end.

A solid determination to see the good in people, even those who behave badly, generates a feeling that humanity may be salvageable after all.
