<p>As well as being a fearless interpreter of others’ work, the late singer adapted to a seemingly endless array of styles, marking her out as a bold and utterly singular artist</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/sinead-oconnor-obituary">Sinéad O’Connor – obituary</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2023/jul/26/sinead-oconnor-a-life-in-pictures">Sinéad O’Connor – a life in pictures</a></strong></li></ul><p>Almost from the moment Sinéad O’Connor appeared in the mass public consciousness, she created controversy: her first release, a song called Heroine co-written with U2’s guitarist the Edge for the soundtrack to a largely forgotten 1986 film called Captive, was swiftly followed by the singer causing a furore by expressing her support for the IRA. Years later, she described her comments as “bollocks”, but further uproar would surround O’Connor on a regular basis: about her conversion to Islam (she called non-Muslims “disgusting”); about Prince, the author of her biggest hit, 1990’s Nothing Compares 2 U, whom she accused of physical abuse; and, most notably, about sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a subject which she took up long before it became a mainstream talking point.</p><p>Her 1992 performance on Saturday Night Live, during which she ripped up a photo of the pope, was described by the New York Daily News as a “holy terror”, and attracted the opprobrium of everyone from Madonna to Joe Pesci. Pesci threatened her with violent retribution on the same show the following week – incredibly, the audience applauded him. The furore permanently derailed her career in the US, where her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got, had sold 2m copies and topped the charts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/26/controversy-never-drowned-out-the-astonishing-songcraft-of-sinead-oconnor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After two diabolical performances, few think Australia can beat the All Blacks at the MCG and Eddie Jones is counting on it</p><p>Stirling Mortlock remembers the last time the Wallabies played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was 2007, a World Cup year, a Bledisloe Cup opener. Mortlock was captain and 79,322 were packed in. Australia had lost to South Africa the week before and had not beaten the All Blacks in three years. That night their fullback started the game by kicking out on the full, Mortlock gave away the first penalty and the All Blacks scored a third-minute try. His side didn’t win a penalty until the 10th then Mortlock missed it. Soon they were down 15-6.</p><p>It was the worst possible start on the biggest possible stage. But history shows Australia fought back to win that game 20-15 at the wire. Mortlock says it’s “an omen for our lads”, coming into the Wallabies’ Bledisloe match this Saturday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/27/wallabies-bank-on-underdog-status-in-hunt-for-bledisloe-cup-upset">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Homeland security secretary faces confrontation with House judiciary committee as Republicans seem intent to impeach him or Biden</p><p><strong>Hunter Biden</strong> has arrived at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware to enter his guilty plea to tax charges, the Associated Press reports, as part of a deal that will resolve a long-running investigation against him and avoid jail time.</p><p>Republicans have decried the agreement reached with the US attorney in Delaware as a “sweetheart deal” for the president’s son, and continue their campaign to prove that he and <strong>Joe Biden</strong> are corrupt. In an unusual move, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-plea.html">the New York Times reports</a> that a top House Republican lawmaker filed a brief in the case that asks the judge to refuse the deal, arguing it is “tainted”.</p><p>On the eve of Hunter Biden’s court appearance to enter into a plea deal for misdemeanor tax crimes that would allow him to avoid prison time, House Republicans and conservative groups sought to intervene in the case, urging a judge to throw out the agreement he reached with prosecutors.</p><p>The highly unusual legal maneuvering — which experts said was unlikely to succeed — illustrated the lengths that House Republicans and their allied groups have been willing to go to as they have tried to use Mr. Biden’s legal and personal troubles to inflict political damage on his father, President Biden.</p><p>Our approach to managing the border securely and humanely, even within our fundamentally broken immigration system, is working. Unlawful entries between ports of entry along the southwest border have consistently decreased by more than half compared to the peak before the end of Title 42.</p><p>Under President Biden’s leadership, we have led the largest expansion of lawful, safe, and orderly pathways for people to seek humanitarian relief under our laws, at the same time imposing tougher consequences on those who instead resort to the ruthless smuggling organizations that prey on the most vulnerable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jul/26/republicans-mayorkas-hearing-biden-trump-us-politics-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>
