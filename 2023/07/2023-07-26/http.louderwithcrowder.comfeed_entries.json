Six seconds worth. We haven't been analyzing the video like it's the Zapruder film, but the journalismers at the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/25/jason-aldean-controversial-music-video-edited/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a></em> have.</p><p>In their most recent piece of content created that they pass off as \"news,\" the video is now SIX SECONDS shorter than when it was first uploaded to YouTube on July 14th. Those six seconds were from a Fox 5 Atlanta news clip about the firey but mostly peaceful riots that took place three years ago.</p><p>Portions of that clip appeared in the original music video twice. At one point, it was projected onto the exterior wall of a Tennessee County courthouse that was also featured in the Hannah Montana movie.</p><p>It is unclear when the video was edited. Or why. Or who called for it. There is a very good chance Fox 5 Atlanta put in a copyright claim with YouTube. And while the six seconds would fall under \"fair use,\" Louder with Crowder knows firsthand that YouTube ignores laws and doesn't apply guidelines fairly when their progressives have sand in their vaginas.</p><p>In response to the Left and the media (but I repeat myself) trying to get the song canceled, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-hot-100-sales\" target=\"_blank\">Middle America has rallied around the artist</a>. Audio and video streams have increased by 999%. Sales of the song jumped from 1,000 units to 228,000 units. And it's #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Aldean, up until this point, has refused to back down. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cmt-cancels-jason-aldean-video\" target=\"_blank\">He said in a statement when the controversy first popped off</a> that there isn\u2019t a single video clip that isn\u2019t real news footage and the attacks against him \"...are not only meritless but dangerous.\" This past weekend, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-plays-try-that-in-a-small-town\" target=\"_blank\">he told an audience full of fans</a> \"...if people don\u2019t like what you say, they try and make sure that they can cancel you. Which means, try and ruin your life, ruin everything,\" before playing the song live.</p><p>Let's hope this isn't the beginning sign of Aldean bending the knee. And that someone at BMG made the call when they got the YouTube notice as an unfortunate knee-jerk response. The Aldeans didn't bend the knee when the Left and the media (again, I repeat myself) <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittany-aldean-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">lashed out at Brittany's common sense views on biology</a>.
