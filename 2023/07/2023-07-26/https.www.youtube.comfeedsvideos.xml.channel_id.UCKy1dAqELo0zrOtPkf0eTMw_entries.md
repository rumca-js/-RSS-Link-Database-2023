Watch the new red band trailer for Strays, an upcoming live-action comedy movie starring Will Ferrell, Will Forte, Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher, and Randall Park.

They say a dog is a man’s best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. 

When Reggie (Will Ferrell), a naïve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. 

But once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. 

Determined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug’s pals—Maggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner’s new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who’s stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal—together hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home … and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It’s not his foot). 

The film also features Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast), Harvey Guillén (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish), Rob Riggle (The Hangover), Brett Gelman (Stranger Things), Jamie Demetriou (The Afterparty), and Sofia Vergara (Modern Family). 

Strays is produced by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans), by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal) and by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) and Lord Miller President of Film Aditya Sood (The Martian, Cocaine Bear). The film is executive produced by Jessica Switch, Nikki Baida and Julia Hammer. It is directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal).

Strays opens in UK cinemas on August 17, 2023 and in US theaters on August 18, 2023.

## Twisted Metal Season 1 Review

Twisted Metal Season 1 reviewed by Matt Fowler. Narrated by Kerry Palmer.

Twisted Metal is absurd and hilarious in exactly the ways you want a dystopian Cannonball Run to be. Yes, it matches the games' crude humor but, mostly, it springboards from there and creates its own dark and warped wasteland sensibilities. During the back stretch of the season, there's a little bit of joke fatigue, but the demented tapestry presented here, grown from the seeds of the games and expanded into something workable as an ongoing series, is delightful. Mackie and Beatriz play characters you root for but also love to see get into impossible situations. Meanwhile, Church and Joe/Arnett provide the "order" and "chaos" out on the open road, making for a believable powder keg of violence at all times. This show is so so dumb, as only clever people could achieve.

## Skyrim's Modders Might Be Starfield's Secret Weapon

While Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 are massive on their own, it’s the mods that really give them their longevity. I spoke to some of the creators on Nexus Mods and came away with this: Skyrim’s Modders Might Be Starfield’s Secret Weapon.

Skyrim mods and Fallout mods are both plentiful, but Skyrim modded builds are much more popular than anything else on nexusmods. But what about Starfield mods? We’ve seen a lot of Starfield gameplay, but haven’t heard much about the Starfield creation kit, the tools that modders will use to start Starfield modding. The extent of Starfield mod support is unknown at this point, but if the Skyrim nexus mods and Fallout 4 mods communities are any indication, then I bet we’ll see the beginning of Starfield mods at launch. Game Pass may also be a factor for Starfield, as there will be a larger player base on Starfield’s release date.

Here's how the All Ghillied Up mission changed Call of Duty forever. Developer Infinity Ward changed first-person shooters when it launched Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare in 2007. Set on the frontlines of a politically murky war, its adrenaline-fueled action set pieces redefined campaign design for an entire generation. But while levels like Crew Expendable and Charlie Don’t Surf channelled the trademark intensity of Call of Duty’s World War 2 days, one mission set the series’ rulebook ablaze and threw it out of the window. It was called All Ghillied Up.
 
To find out how All Ghillied Up was put together IGN spoke to designer Mohammad Alavi, who created the mission alongside colleagues at Infinity Ward. With his insight, we examine how All Ghillied Up makes use of custom artificial intelligence, combat puzzles, and tense scripted sequences to create a heart-stopping mission behind enemy lines.

Heading into the Season of the Malignant, some Diablo 4 players were concerned by the fact that you need to start a new class character every season in order to experience each season’s new content, and since the 1.1.0 patch on July 18 for Season 1, almost all players are now looking at their experience bar and wishing it would go up a bit faster. We’ve done some testing, and we’re here to help you quickly level up new characters through to level 50, both in the Eternal Realm and with new Seasonal Characters in Diablo IV.
