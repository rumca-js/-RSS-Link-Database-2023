  <p id="CkKflQ">Comedian and author Sarah Silverman, as well as authors Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey — are suing <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23869693-silverman-openai-complaint?responsive=1&amp;title=1">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23869675-kadrey-meta-complaint?responsive=1&amp;title=1">Meta</a> each in a US District Court over <a href="https://llmlitigation.com/">dual claims of copyright infringement</a>. </p>

<p id="1JhsDu">When I told my kids <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Furby-Accessories-Interactive-Activated-Animatronic/dp/B0BLR5RGPY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the new Furby</a> was done staying at our house, they seemed to understand. “We’ll miss you a lot, Furby!!” my six-year-old exclaimed — but there were no cries, no tantrums. They asked if Furby could play <em>one more song</em>. They gave it a goodbye hug. Then, I happily stuck the talking puffball deep in the garage. </p>
<p id="Ak4oSC">But a day later, my three-year-old made an uncharacteristic offhand remark: “I wish we had enough money to buy a Furby...” she said, her full-force puppy dog eyes burning into my soul. </p>

## Apple may be ‘experimenting’ with a 32-inch iMac, but don’t expect one soon

He doesn’t believe we’ll see one before the end of 2024. </p>
<p id="MfGhRy">Gurman also tweaked his predicted timeline for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/5/23625972/apple-new-imac-launch-m3-chip">M3-powered iMac</a> he said in March would be coming as soon as the second half of this year at the earliest. This time, he said he expects them by early next year.</p>
<p id="FM87Z0">It makes sense that Apple would be working on a bigger iMac. People like bigger screens! And while the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review">24-inch model</a> Apple sells now is a solid compromise between the former 21.5-inch and the...</p>
