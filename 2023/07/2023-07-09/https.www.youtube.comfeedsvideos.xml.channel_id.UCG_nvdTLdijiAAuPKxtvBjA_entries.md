Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 sends the guardians on one last mission to save Rocket Raccoon from the villains High Evolutionary (not Kang (?)). It concludes the trilogy in a very respectable manner, but what it really shines at is emotion. In the day of consumable movies like Red Notice and Ghosted, it's amazing how Guardians 3 makes you feel a variety of strong emotions throughout the way. In today's episode of Film Perfection, let's try to see how new DC Superman boss James Gunn generates such strong emotional impact.
