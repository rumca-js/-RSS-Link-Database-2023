This genre is obviously not as popular in the current gaming landscape, but there are plenty of developers working hard to express their love for hack-and-slash games with interesting projects that have the potential to be something truly great. \n\n2023 and beyond will see the release of highly anticipated games like Marvel\u2019s Wolverine and Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade 2.
