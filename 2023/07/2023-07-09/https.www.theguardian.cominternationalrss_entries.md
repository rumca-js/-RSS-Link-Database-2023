<ul><li>Italian wins 7-6 (4), 6-4, 6-2 against world No 54</li><li>Victory marked by conflicts with umpire Marijana Veljovic </li></ul><p>Around Wimbledon this past week, an unfamiliar site among the traditional strawberries and cream: giant carrots. Five of them. These are the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/carotaboys/" title=""> “Carota Boys”</a>, a troupe of travelling Italian fans in carrot costumes supporting the world No 8, Jannik Sinner. (Additional context: he once <a href="https://www.tennis.com/baseline/articles/watch-sinner-eats-mid-match-carrot-in-vienna" title="">nibbled on a carrot</a> at a change of ends, instead of the more traditional banana.)</p><p>That the wiry 21-year-old, who hails from a small town on the Italy‑Austria border, has such dedicated fans makes sense. Sinner has wowed crowds with his almost supernatural all-surface sliding, manic court coverage and blockbuster matches – in particular against his Next Gen rival, Carlos Alcaraz, at both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOCHjQbU3kw" title="">Wimbledon</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SSd4pFPUXk" title="">the US Open</a> last year. I’d argue he’s played the <a href="https://twitter.com/TennisPodcast/status/1641953595263180801" title="">best point of the year so far</a>. Mostly Sinner is a low-key figure calm on the court, who lets his tennis do the talking, although earlier in the tournament he did make lifestyle sections when he graced Centre Court carrying a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/07/sinner-gucci-deal-leads-wimbledon-fashion-revolution" title="">bespoke Gucci</a> duffel bag; his collaboration with the fashion house more evidence of his rising star.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/09/livewire-jannik-sinner-beats-daniel-elahi-galan-to-progress-to-quarter-finals">Continue reading...</a>

## Of course Orkney wants to leave the UK! Can York come too?

<p>My hometown still celebrates its capture by the Viking leader Ivar the Boneless. If that doesn’t make us honorary Danes, what would?</p><p>The story of Orkney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/02/orkney-could-leave-uk-for-norway-as-it-explores-alternative-governance">exploring the possibility of joining Norway</a> is deeply pleasing on many levels. It’s such a great tease, but also aspirational. Who in Britain has not dreamed of divorcing this sewaged isle and joining forces with another, more enlightened place, maybe one with adequate healthcare funding, life expectancy <a href="https://www.fhi.no/en/he/hin/population/life-expectancy/?term=">trending in the direction</a> you’d expect in 2023 and a functional relationship with the EU? “There is a huge affinity and a huge, deep cultural relationship there,” the council leader, James Stockan, told the BBC. To which surely much of the nation is nodding and muttering, “Yeah, fair play, Stockan, strong move.”</p><p>Living in a city that also has a “deep cultural relationship” with Norse lands, albeit Danish rather than Norwegian, I find it a dreamy prospect. That relationship in York is of being successfully invaded by someone with the less-than-bloodcurdling moniker, Ivar the Boneless (he sounds like a cute cartoon dragon). My French husband is baffled by the way we glorify this inglorious history. “You’re celebrating being invaded?” he says every year, gesturing at men, women and children in cloaks and historically inaccurate helmets queueing for yorkshire pudding wraps at the <a href="https://jorvikvikingfestival.co.uk/">annual Viking festival</a>. “<em>We</em> don’t have a festival celebrating the Germans.” This is usually my cue to remind him that the Vikings just softened us up for his Norman forebears, so maybe he should pipe down. In any case, the city-wide economic exploitation of our Viking heritage over the past few decades goes some way to making up for the whole pillage business.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/09/of-course-orkney-wants-to-leave-the-uk-can-york-come-too">Continue reading...</a>

## Anohni and the Johnsons: My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross review – piercing heartache

<p>(Rough Trade)<br />Recorded at speed, Anohni’s first album since 2016 adds a soulful swagger to poetic, cathartic rock</p><p>On her first album since 2016’s hollowed out electronic lament, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/08/anohni-hopelessness-review-antony-and-johnsons">Hopelessness</a></em>, and the first using the “and the Johnsons” moniker in more than a decade, Anohni continues to soundtrack oppression, loss and alienation with heart-aching precision. The presentation has shifted, however: made with British producer Jimmy Hogarth (Duffy, Amy Winehouse), songs such as lead single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2cF9o7FuU4">It Must Change</a> and Can’t add a soulful swagger to often brutally direct lyrics contemplating forgiveness for abuse and the sudden loss of a friend (“I don’t want you to be dead”), respectively.</p><p>Loss also permeates the incandescent ballad Sliver of Ice, which poetically traces the final moments of mentor Lou Reed’s life, Anohni’s multi-octave voice dancing round a searching guitar figure. While in the past, piano and orchestral flourishes augmented shifts in emotion, here cathartic rock excess anchors the winding Rest and the gut-punch of Scapegoat, while Why Am I Alive Now?’s paean to a dying world is something approaching light-footed pastoral folk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/09/anohni-and-the-johnsons-my-back-was-a-bridge-for-you-to-cross-review-piercing-heartache">Continue reading...</a>

## Architecture is built on the cult of stardom – its #MeToo moment is no surprise | Rowan Moore

Allegations of sexual harassment against David Adjaye are shocking, but at least expose toxic practices in the industry<p>Last week the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1a03a13c-a0b3-41c9-9a7b-702719ac6d58" title="">published an article </a>in which the celebrated architect Sir David Adjaye, winner of the 2021 Royal Gold Medal for architecture, once described by Barack Obama as “genius, pure and simple”, was accused by three women formerly employed by him of sexual assault, sexual harassment and a toxic work culture in his practice. Adjaye has denied the more serious allegations, while <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66109133" title="">saying that he was “deeply sorry”</a> for blurring professional boundaries through what he called “entirely consensual” relationships. He would, he said, be “immediately seeking professional help in order to learn from these mistakes”.</p><p>It is beyond the scope of this article to adjudicate the merits of Adjaye’s defence, but the <em>FT</em> report, if true, is horrifying. Its authors say they have been working on it <a href="https://twitter.com/joshspero/status/1676111762049867776" title="">“for the past year”</a>, and they describe in detail alleged events that would have been devastating to the victims. It takes great courage to talk about such experiences. The allegations are also heartbreaking. Adjaye, the most prominent black architect in the world, was – as a number of architects have said to me in the last few days – a role model. He “has been a source of pride to many”, said one, “there is a sense of shock and loss”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/09/architecture-cult-stardom-metoo-moment-david-adjaye">Continue reading...</a>
