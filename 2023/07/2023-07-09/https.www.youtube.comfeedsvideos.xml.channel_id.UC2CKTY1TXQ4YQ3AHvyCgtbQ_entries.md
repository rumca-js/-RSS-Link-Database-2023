I'm entering a fancy Death Guard Terminator guy into the Capitol Palette painting competition at NOVA Open this year - my first ever painting competition. I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone. And, I'm just not finding myself doing it. Will talk a little about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Reign in Hell - Demonic Skirmish Combat at http://www.reigninhellgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
