"description": "<p>Elkin\u2019s capacious survey of female artists who focused on the body might have worked better as a collection of essays</p><p>When Lauren Elkin began work on this book, she believed its subject was monstrosity and female creativity, her spur a now much-quoted line from Jenny Offill\u2019s 2014 novel <em>Dept</em><em> of Speculation</em>: \u201cMy plan was to never get married. I was going to be an art monster instead.\u201d Naturally, Elkin hardly needed to be told that such a monster is almost inevitably male: a beast who relies on women for all the mundane things in life (the cooking, the washing, the regular praise due to an undoubted genius). Female art monsters are thin on the ground because to become one means choosing work over motherhood.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t only such unfairness that interested her. The more she thought about it, the more she saw that while it is still agonisingly difficult for a woman to allow herself to be monstrous \u2013 how we fear baring our teeth \u2013 it\u2019s also terrifyingly easy inadvertently to become so, at least in the eyes of others. Behaviour that is perfectly acceptable in a man \u2013 determination, rage, ambition \u2013 is all too often seen as ugly and unwarranted in a woman.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/09/art-monsters-unruly-bodies-in-feminist-art-by-lauren-elkin-review-when-freestyle-thinking-goes-too-far\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/09/art-monsters-unruly-bodies-in-feminist-art-by-lauren-elkin-review-when-freestyle-thinking-goes-too-far", "date_published": "2023-07-09T14:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Off the beaten track in northern Portugal", "description": "Ravenous vultures, wild horses and elusive wolves\u2026 The joy of nature tourism in the Greater C\u00f4a Valley<p>The feeling of awe that being in the company of wild or semi-wild horses elicits is hard to beat \u2013 and hard to come upon, too. Many of Europe\u2019s wild horses are now extinct, though there are still semi-wild ponies on Exmoor and, in southern Bulgaria, the karakachan, an ancient breed related to the Mongol horse, roam the Rhodope hills near the town of Velingrad. In the breathtaking Greater C\u00f4a valley in northern Portugal, you can spend hours in the company of Sorraia, a breed of wild horses that feeds on dried undergrowth and scrub. Re-introduced by <a href=\"https://rewilding-portugal.com/\" title=\"\">Rewilding Portugal</a>, a nature conservation project founded in 2019, the Sorraia help prevent wildfires and increase bio-diversity, making the terrain more hospitable to roe deer, Iberian ibex, rabbit and red-legged partridge, which in turn benefits the Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx, eagles and vultures.</p><p>My son and I were among a small group of lucky eco-tourists who watched the Sorraia horses as they grazed while enjoying a prepared picnic of pasta, fresh salad and fruits in the Vale Carapito nature reserve. Leaning against a tree and observing these small, semi-wild horses, their coats the colour of dried grass, was a meditative, magical experience. It is one of several memorable nature tourism excursions available in the 120,000-hectare corridor that stretches from the Douro in the north, down to the Malcata mountains and nature reserve in central Portugal, close to the Spanish border.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/09/off-the-beaten-track-in-northern-portugal\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/09/off-the-beaten-track-in-northern-portugal", "date_published": "2023-07-09T14:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Should I worry about how much processed meat I eat?", "description": "<p>All those sausages, hotdogs, ham and salami can spice up your diet.

In the mid-1980s, a body was recovered from a peat bog in Cheshire \u2013 after a violent death he had lain there since the iron age, and when he was exhibited in the British Museum I went to have a look. He lay under glass as if asleep, his mouth open in a sort of snore, his skin tanned orange after thousands of years buried in the spongy wetlands near Wilmslow, pickled by layers of moss. He was recognisably a body, but one that appeared to have melted, like chocolate or cheese \u2013 he looked like dropped ginger cake. I was quite taken with him. I drew pictures in my little book.</p><p>Reading the story of the discovery today (and the surrounding ethics of displaying human remains) was fascinating, not least the detail that the peat worker who found him in the 80s, chucking what he thought was a piece of wood at his mate (they quickly realised it was actually\u2026 a foot), had discovered <em>another</em> body (a woman\u2019s, dating from around AD210) only a year earlier. Andy Mould, his name was. Lucky chap. I wondered why this lone slice of history had stuck with me, a person unproud but accepting of the strict limits of my interests, which are rarely piqued by events pre-disco. It wasn\u2019t the poetry of it, though stumbling through a science piece about the bodies in the <em>New York Times</em> I was moved by a line from Seamus Heaney\u2019s <em>Bog Poems</em>, which includes a lament for one bog man whose throat was cut: \u201cThe cured wound / opens inwards to a dark / elderberry place.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t the science itself, the way the magical chemistry of bogs prevented decay.

Then I met my current boyfriend, Moro. Since he is five years younger than me, I felt that the whole concept of relationships changed, all the way around. I became a person who has more authority and power. One of my male friends even questioned how I could choose a boyfriend the way a man would choose a girlfriend. And I thought: \u2018Damn right.

Liao creates situations in which Moro appears passive or submissive to her whims in order to \u201cexplore the alternative possibilities of heterosexual relationships\u201d. The series has fun with the expectations of the male gaze. Sometimes, Liao is clothed in the portraits and Moro is naked. She carries him over her shoulder in a fireman\u2019s lift, or eats her breakfast off his unclothed body, or stares uncompromisingly into the camera while he places his head, childlike, on her shoulder, or tweaks his nipple. The pictures are more comical than coercive. Here, Moro seems to be getting the wrong end of the candy floss, while Liao enjoys his slight discomfort.

Over the years, one of my favourite Definition wines has been the Rioja Reserva which is made for the company by one of the best of the Spanish region\u2019s traditional bodegas, La Rioja Alta, and which has always hit that very particular soft mellow, sweet-and-savoury older Rioja spot, with the current 2018 vintage (\u00a313.99, or \u00a311.99 as part of a mixed six) no exception.
