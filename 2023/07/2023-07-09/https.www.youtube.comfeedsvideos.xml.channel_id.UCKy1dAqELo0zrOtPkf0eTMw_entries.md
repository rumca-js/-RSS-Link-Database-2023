With the group having the idea of engaging in prayer to rid themselves of any curse or evil, they're left with a Yankee Candle to do the trick. The film stars LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Chase W. Dillon, and Daniel Levy, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto as The Hatbox Ghost.

Haunted Mansion follows the iconic tale from Disney's past of a mother and son getting help from an unexpected crew to rid their home of a dark curse. The film’s producers are Dan Lin and  Jonathan Eirich, with Nick Reynolds and Tom Peitzman serving as executive producers.

Haunted Mansion, directed by Justin Simien, opens in US theaters on July 28 and in UK cinemas on August 11, 2023.
