<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34304433&amp;width=980" /><br /><br /><p>You had to know a disgusting corporate media was going to lash out at the anti-child trafficking film "Sound of Freedom." After all, it is Christian-made and toppled the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/indiana-jones-harrison-ford-conan" target="_blank">left's latest attempt to get woke and go broke</a>. However, the extent of what appears to be a coordinated effort tied into the Left's obsession with Qanon has caused journalismers to be pro-child trafficking and pro-pedo.</p><p>The film <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sound-of-freedom-review" target="_blank">tells the story of Tim Ballard</a>, former Homeland Security agent and founder of Operation Underground Railroad. It's based on a true story. It's not political. It's about saving children. In theory, one would think it's a movie that could unite people. Or, at the very least, not compel people to publically attack it. Yet, here we are.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>"[Trafficking of children] is a disgusting, horrific issue happening all around the world. And it's not getting better, it's getting worse. I'm going to give any of my UFC employees that want to go see this movie free tickets to go see it. And I would like to encourage other executives to do the same at their company."</p><p>“Sound of Freedom” has a genuine core of righteousness that most call-to-action films do not. This is a dramatic film, but it takes pains to show that real children need help now. And it does all this while giving us more of a heartfelt story than Hollywood has in years.</p>

## Watch: A shirtless Joe Biden hits the beach in turtle shorts because someone at the WH thought this was a good idea

There is no way you can like and respect Joe Biden and allow him to go shirtless in a public place in turtle shorts. Either that or the person who suggested "Hey Mr. President, let's go to the beach" should be blacklisted from ever working in politics again. Though not until after DeSantis beats him next year.</p><p>Seriously, this is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/what-is-bidenomics" target="_blank">the Bidenomics</a> of political stunts.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The outfit was bad enough. When photos broke online, I believe <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-cocaine" target="_blank">we had figured out whose cocaine was found in the White House</a>. It had to have been Jill Biden's. That's the only excuse for dressing her husband like this and letting him go out in public.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Ten bucks he said "Whoever smelt it, dealt it" here even though no one had smelt it yet.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Somewhere in California, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-san-francisco" target="_blank">Gavin Newsom saw this</a> and immediately called his mole at the White House to poke POTUS with a stick to see if it was finally time.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Here is Joe Biden checking to see if anyone responded to the Putin meme he sent in the world leader group text. Little does he know, all the world leaders started their own group text so they can make fun of him behind his back. Yes, even <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-taylor-swift" target="_blank">Justin "I Feel Pretty" Trudeau</a>. You know it's bad when even Trudeau is dunking on you.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>They didn't even have the sense to send him to the beach with Hunter so he didn't look like a lonely old man. Only two, I'm assuming, female secret service agents. And a perimeter far enough that no one gets close, but also no one notices another beachgoer recording this video.</p><p>After this, the White House will be sending Biden to the Iowa State Fair. He can't wait to get his mouth on a corndog.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
