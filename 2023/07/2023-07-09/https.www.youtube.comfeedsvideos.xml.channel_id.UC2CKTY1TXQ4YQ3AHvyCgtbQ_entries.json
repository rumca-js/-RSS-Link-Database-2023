I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone. And, I'm just not finding myself doing it. Will talk a little about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Reign in Hell - Demonic Skirmish Combat at http://www.reigninhellgame.com\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly).
