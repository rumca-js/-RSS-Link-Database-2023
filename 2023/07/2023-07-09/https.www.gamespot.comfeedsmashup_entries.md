<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is set to release on August 3 for PC and September 6 for PlayStation 5. Those who have the PC/Steam version might be keen on playing it on the Steam Deck as well. However, as of the time of this writing, it's not fully verified. That means there are a few kinks that need to be ironed out. Our guide discusses how you can play Baldur's Gate 3 on a Steam Deck, including some issues that you might run into.</p><h2>How to Play Baldur's Gate 3 on a Steam Deck</h2><p>Baldur's Gate 3 promises a gargantuan campaign that can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-take-up-100-hours-to-finish-a-standard-playthrough/1100-6515603/">take up to 100 hours</a>. And that's just a standard playthrough, not a completionist run where you try to discover all outcomes and secrets. You probably don't want to spend all that time sitting in front of your PC. Still, if you do have a Steam Deck, here's what you need to know if you plan on trying a handheld gaming option.</p><h3>Have a larger internal storage or a MicroSD card</h3><p>First things first: Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive game, not just due to its story and choices, but also because of the whopping installation size: 80.46 GB as of the time of this writing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-guide/1100-6515775/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The first season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a>, Season of the Malignant, is set to go live on July 20. As such, that means creating a new character and progressing once more just to see the new content. However, given that a few facets will be retained from the base game you may have already played for dozens or hundreds of hours, it's also a good idea to be ready for a fresh playthrough. Here are the things you should do to prepare for Diablo 4's Season of the Malignant.</p><h2>Top 7 tips to prepare for Diablo 4 Season of the Malignant</h2><p>Diablo 4's Season of the Malignant promises <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-and-character-reset-details/1100-6514821/">additional content</a>, including new legendaries and uniques, as well as a battle pass with several cosmetics. You'll also experience the season's activities involving a new quest line, and battle Malignant Monsters to claim their Malignant Hearts. Still, you do need to make a new character, although a few facets carry over.</p><h3>Complete the campaign on your main character so you can skip it on alts</h3><p>The information was <a href="https://twitter.com/JPiepiora/status/1656416902816886785">previously confirmed</a> by Diablo 4's associate game director Joseph Piepiora. Basically, completing the campaign allows you to skip it on your new characters (or "alts"). This includes those that you create in Season of the Malignant.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-prepare-for-season-1-season-of-the-malignant/1100-6515774/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
