Hack-and-slash games were some of the most popular during the sixth and seventh generations of consoles, which gave us classics of the genre including but not limited to the Onimusha series, Metal Gear Rising and many more.

The open-world genre garners its fair share of criticism (depending on the game) while still performing well. However, the true hallmark of a game's world isn't necessarily its size but how it fits the setting, what content it packs in and whether it complements the overall design.

You can focus on the story in some of these games but also spend time messing around, farming, gathering resources or taking on optional challenges.

Even with so many big titles on the way, here are 15 of the biggest game worlds of 2023 so far, which deserve recognition.
