  <p id="W1mB2Q">The general trend of macOS releases over the past few years is that it has been moving closer and closer to the look and feel of iOS. The icons have become iOS icons, and their shape has become the iOS shape, and you can now use your iPhone as the Mac’s webcam, etc. etc. This occasionally comes at the expense of other functionality (ask me how I feel about the new Settings menu), but it is the direction that Apple has clearly been heading in since (arguably) Big Sur. Every so often, other splashy features are announced (Stage Manager, Universal Control, Quick Notes) that I write a lot about and then never end up using ever again.</p>

There’s a Capcom version with 12 built-in games (including <em>Street Fighter II’ Turbo: Hyper Fighting</em>, <em>Final Fight</em>, <em>1942</em>, and <em>Mega Man</em>) and a Taito version with 17 games included (like <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Elevator Action</em>, and <em>Bubble Bobble</em>).

## Honor’s latest foldable is almost as thin and light as a regular smartphone

  <p id="3cJc35">If there’s one thing Honor wants you to know about its new Magic V2, it’s how thin and light it is. The thinnest vegan leather version of the new foldable, which is launching in China today, is just 9.9mm thick when folded and weighs 231 grams. That’s thinner and lighter than Honor’s major competitors like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23308459/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-screen-battery-camera-price">Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4</a> (14.2mm and 263g), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23773594/google-pixel-fold-review-screen-battery-hinge-camera">Google’s Pixel Fold</a> (12.1mm and 283g), and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1979540/huawei-mate-x3-review.html">Huawei’s Mate X3</a> (11.8mm and 239g) when folded.</p>
<p id="l4saEc">In fact, hold the folded Honor Magic V2 in your hand, and it almost feels like a non-folding smartphone. The Magic V2’s weight (like its 6.43-inch exterior screen size) sits somewhere between an iPhone 14 Pro (206g) and iPhone 14 Pro Max (240g). It’s not as thin in its smartphone-style folded form...</p>

  <p id="sjcuwp">When the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10760840/oxenfree-review-pc-xbox-one"><em>Oxenfree</em> debuted in 2016</a>, it was hard <em>not</em> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12297852/oxenfree-game-stranger-things-pc-ps4-xbox-one">make <em>Stranger Things</em> comparisons</a>: from the synth-heavy soundtrack to its story of kids grappling with the supernatural, the vibes were very similar. So it made a lot of sense when, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree">in 2021</a>, Netflix acquired <em>Oxenfree</em> developer Night School Studio as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">its burgeoning games effort</a>. Now we have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/19/23689524/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-release-date-switch-ps5-steam"><em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals,</em></a> which is an ideal sequel: it’s another creepy adventure game that stands on its own but also builds on the original in smart ways. It might also be the best video game released under the Netflix label so far.</p>
<p id="4m0laT">As a game, not much has changed in <em>Lost Signals</em>. It’s a 2D adventure where you wander around a beautiful small town, doing lots of talking and...</p>

  <p id="dnlvM6">A group of Democratic senators is <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24782736/2023.07.11_Letter_to_IRS__TIGTA__FTC__DOJ_on_tax_prep_pixel_data_sharing.pdf">urging federal law enforcement officials</a> to investigate and prosecute some of the most popular online tax filing companies for allegedly sharing millions of taxpayers’ financial data with Meta and Google. </p>
<p id="S3dznA">On Tuesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and others asked the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Treasury Department, and the IRS to investigate whether TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct violated taxpayer privacy laws by sharing sensitive user information with the two tech firms.</p>
