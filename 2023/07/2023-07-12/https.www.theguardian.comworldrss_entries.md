Republican lawmakers, which hold a majority in the Iowa house and Senate, passed the anti-abortion bill after the governor, Kim Reynolds, called a special session to seek a vote on the ban.</p><p>The legislation will take immediate effect after Reynolds signs it on Friday and will prohibit abortions after the first sign of cardiac activity – usually around six weeks, with some exceptions for cases of rape or incest. It will allow for abortions up until 20 weeks of pregnancy only under certain conditions of medical emergency. Abortions in the state were previously allowed up to 20 weeks.</p><p><strong>The plot thickens. </strong>Lawyers reportedly said the new evidence suggested “that Mr Trump was motivated by a ‘personal grievance’ stemming from events that occurred many years prior to Mr Trump’s presidency”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/12/first-thing-iowa-republicans-pass-six-week-abortion-ban">Continue reading...</a>

<p>US couple gives evidence to New Zealand court in case against island’s owners and tourism operators</p><p>An American couple who were badly burned when Whakaari/White Island erupted in December 2019, killing 22 of the 47 people in its crater, told a New Zealand court that neither their guides nor anyone else involved in their trip to the crater told them that such an event was likely – or even possible. Information about the dangers they faced on the island volcano was minimal, they said, and safety protections lax.</p><p>Evidence from Matthew Urey, 40, and Lauren Urey, 36, opened the prosecution’s case in the Auckland district court on Wednesday, beginning a lengthy trial for the island’s owners and other tourism companies involved in the ill-fated trip.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/12/couple-who-survived-white-island-volcano-tell-court-they-werent-warned-of-danger">Continue reading...</a>
