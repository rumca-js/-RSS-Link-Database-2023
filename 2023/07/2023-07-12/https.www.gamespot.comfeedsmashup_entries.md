<p dir="ltr">In a recent interview with HBO and HBO Max Chairman and CEO Casey Bloys, concerns were raised regarding the potential repercussions of the ongoing WGA writers strike and the looming SAG-AFTRA strike. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/hbo-max-casey-bloys-emmy-nominations-netflix-strike-1235668287/">Variety</a>, Bloys stressed the vital role played by writers and actors in the industry and expressed his hopes for a resolution that would acknowledge their value and encourage their return to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"It will slow everything down," Bloys said. "It will be a lot of pain for everybody, for all sides. It's not a lot of fun to contemplate having to deal with, having to figure this out as an industry." Bloys further predicted that viewers would begin to notice the effects of the strikes in 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are scheduled to conclude on July 12, and should an acceptable deal fail to materialize, SAG-AFTRA members, who overwhelmingly voted in favor of a strike, are poised to commence their strike on July 13.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-boss-predicts-a-lot-of-pain-for-everybody-if-actors-join-writers-on-strike/1100-6515929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## CoD: Warzone's New The Boys Superpowers Are Great--But They Don't Belong Everywhere

However, the superpowered fun is annoyingly invading too many maps and modes, and it would make more sense as a standalone playlist.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded temporarily adds the new Temp V field upgrade, which is named after the super serum used in The Boys to give anyone a random superpower for just 24 hours. Temp V works well as a field upgrade for Call of Duty because it gives you one of four random superpowers with one activation. Once you use it, you'll lose the ability and need to find another dose of Temp V. This helps keep the superpowers from being overused and spammy.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Injecting Temp V will give you either an electric shockwave attack, laser vision, teleportation, or a charged jump attack. These superpowered field upgrades are pretty abundant in battle royale, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding Temp V, and if you don't like the random ability, you can swap the equipped field upgrade for another randomized power.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-the-boys-superpowers-are-great-but-they-dont-belong-everywhere/1100-6515928/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Previously, Xbox 360 players were unable to load into matches, despite the active communities across each game.</p><p>This comes by way of a tweet from Zekco Trickshots, who shared a video featuring the matchmaking for older Call of Duty games functioning properly.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day</a> (July 11-12) is prime time for getting new parts for your gaming PC. Whether you're upgrading components or looking to build a new rig, you'll want to check out all the current sales for parts like CPUs, motherboards, RAM, SSDs, power supplies, cases, and cooling fans. Some of these components have decent price cuts, but CPUs, motherboards, and SSDs in particular feature some really deep, head-turning discounts.</p><p>For example, you can get any of AMD's flagship CPUs with a major price slash, a few of which exceed half-off MSRP.

## Final Fantasy 16's Benedikta Deserved Better

<p>Benedikta Harman is a deeply flawed woman. You can see this in her expressions, which are often twisted in rage, and her manipulation tactics, which lie twisted in bedsheets. She is temperamental, power-hungry, cruel, and conflicted, repeatedly switching back and forth between being the villain and the victim in her struggle for self-preservation. She is also one of the best female characters to appear in a Final Fantasy game in nearly two decades--and she deserved so much better than the treatment she received in Final Fantasy XVI.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers for Final Fantasy XVI ahead.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">As Dominant of the wind harpy Garuda, Benedikta, in all her insatiable glory, is an inspired character. Much like the harpies depicted in Greek mythology, Benedikta is a beautiful vulture--hungry for scraps of power and sharp enough to take them. We see this in her aggression on the battlefield, and her submission to men she sees as powerful. Like the wind itself, she is ever-changing and capable of offering respite, or unleashing unfathomable destruction. In short, her Eikon perfectly suits her, and her relationship with Garuda feels like a true merging of souls rather than something transactional or hierarchical.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16s-benedikta-deserved-better/1100-6515905/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uk-blocked-the-microsoft-activision-merger-so-what-happens-next/1100-6513589/">blocked the merger over concerns about cloud gaming</a>, but both Microsoft and the CMA have stated they are willing to negotiate. Microsoft's appeal of the CMA's decision is on pause while these discussions take place.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/microsoft-activision-deal-moves-closer-as-judge-denies-ftc-injunction.html">CNBC</a> claims that Microsoft has offered a small divestment to address the CMA's concerns. No details about the divestment have emerged, though it could involve Xbox's cloud services in the UK. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23792245/uk-cma-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-negotiations">The Verge</a>, the CMA has also stated that any changes to the deal can result in a new merger investigation. These discussions are in an early stage, and until they resolve, the CMA's decision remains valid. The EU broached similar concerns about cloud gaming, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-activision-buyout-approved-by-european-commission/1100-6514161/">ultimately approved the deal after Microsoft offered concessions</a>.</p><p>The FTC will still go forward with an anti-trust trial starting on August 2, but the judge's decision means that the acquisition can now go forward in the meantime. The FTC can also still appeal the court's decision and has until July 14 to do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> Season 4 Reloaded has gone live and it comes with a slew of new features and adjustments, including a change to the Ghost perk. Now, Ghost is countered by the Birdseye perk, which will offer more variety in terms of gameplay.</p><p>Specifically, players utilizing the Birdseye perk will now be able to see Ghosted enemies on the minimap during UAVs. Previously, the Ghost perk practically dominated the meta, as it prevented players from showing up during enemy UAVs, on heartbeat sensors, and on portable radars. It was a very useful perk that didn't have a counter.</p><p>Birdseye, which offers faster UAV scanning and shows the direction of opponents for a player's squad, was previously a lesser-used option. In fact, the Birdseye perk was actually removed from the game due to being overpowered before Activision changed the way it works. It made its return during an earlier season this year.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warzone-just-nerfed-its-best-perk/1100-6515921/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">In a recent interview, Harrison Ford revealed that he initially resisted Indiana Jones' costume when he first saw the plans for his character in Steven Spielberg's 1981 film, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Ford told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k-6X2H7pCo">GQ</a> that he was dubious about every single aspect of the costume, and that as a result of needing to have a fedora stapled to his head during production, he still has "staple scars."</p><p dir="ltr">"It was presented to me as an aspect of character in the first film," Ford said about the iconic jacket, bullwhip, and fedora.

I'm going to whip people?"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-doubts-to-staple-scars-harrison-fords-reluctance-over-indiana-jones-costume/1100-6515920/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a> almost didn't have a major game mechanic due to developer Guerrilla Games' ambition to support the game on both the PS4 and the PS5.</p><p>Studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said at the Develop Brighton conference this week that the game's flying mechanic could have been cut, but ultimately the coders figured things out. According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/guerrilla-games-and-the-road-to-horizon-forbidden-west">GI.biz</a>, Van Beek said one of the challenges with making the sequel was finding new ways to excite players, and one of the ways the team sought to do this was by adding underwater and aerial exploration.</p><p>The aerial part took a lot of work and it came down to the wire. Presumably due to the technical limitations of the PS4 relative to the PS5, the team considered simply dropping the flying mechanic from both editions of the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-almost-cut-an-entire-game-mechanic-due-to-ps4/1100-6515918/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Anyone who has played an online game on Xbox is probably aware that the voice chat can be far from clean and nice. To help tackle this issue, Microsoft has announced a new platform feature for Xbox that aims to make online chat less toxic.</p><p>Xbox Alpha and Alpha-skip members of the Xbox Insider program can now test out a new feature that allows players to capture and submit inappropriate voice chat. Here's how it works: Players who encounter bad/toxic voice chats they believe violate Xbox's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/community-standards?xr=shellnav">Community Standards</a> can record a 60-second clip and submit it to the Xbox Safety Team for them to review.</p><p>This feature will work across "thousands" of games that use voice chat, including backwards-compatible Xbox 360 titles.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-live-will-let-you-share-voice-chat-clips-with-microsoft-to-fight-toxic-players/1100-6515906/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW: Dragonflight Is Finally Letting You Earn Items Missing For Over A Decade

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Dragonflight's latest update has made it so players can once again journey to the original version of the Naxxramas raid and Scholomance dungeon, allowing players to earn items that have been missing in Blizzard's MMO for over a decade. However, players will have to work for the privilege, as the process for unlocking these classic instances is far from straightforward. </p><p dir="ltr">Scholomance back in 2004 was one of WoW's original endgame dungeons. However, a revamped version introduced in 2012's Mists of Pandaria expansion replaced the original, making all of the old items obtained within inaccessible. Naxxramas, on the other hand, was the final raid in original WoW, and so challenging that few players even stepped foot inside, let alone defeated the raid's final boss, the lich Kel'Thuzad. That led Blizzard to bring Naxxramas back for the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion in 2008, albeit with different items.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">All of the loot obtained within the classic instances, which players might desire for transmog purposes, is finally obtainable once again. However, the process for unlocking the old versions of the dungeon and raid are far from simple. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/how-to-enter-old-scholomance-farm-once-removed-transmog-items-333981">Wowhead</a> has a full rundown of the process, but for starters, players will have to use a specific toy in a specific location in the new version of Scholomance: a toy that is only dropped from a rare spawn inside. After using the toy, players will encounter the ghost of an unfortunate soul slain within the necromancy school. She tasks adventurers with tracking down her journal and performing a ritual, one that will unlock the dungeon for all characters on a player's account.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-is-finally-letting-you-earn-items-missing-for-over-a-decade/1100-6515912/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of the major pillars of Assassin's Creed's gameplay is parkour. Or at least it used to be before taking a bit of a back seat with Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. All three games feature huge open worlds where buildings are often far apart instead of the more condensed and intricate city settings the Assassin's Creed series was known for, meaning freerunning from rooftop to rooftop isn't a major part of those games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-sounds-like-a-fantastic-return-to-the-roots-of-the-series/1100-6507322/">Assassin's Creed Mirage seems to be a return to the series' roots</a>, featuring a city playground as its setting with parkour at the forefront.</p><p dir="ltr">But which system of parkour is it? Long-time Assassin's Creed fans will tell you that the series has featured a variety of freerunning systems over the years. Each system is usually used in a few games with minor iterations before being tossed out for a completely new one. The core of the original game's parkour system was used up to Revelations, for example, and Assassin's Creed III introduced a new core system that was used in the franchise up to Rogue.</p><p dir="ltr">In Mirage's case, it seems like this will be another jump, building a parkour system that--though it feels like what's come before--is brand-new and distinct from the rest of the series. "The parkour system we have in Assassin's Creed Mirage is really its own thing," creative director Stéphane Boudon told GameSpot. "It has not been built to reproduce exactly a former system--it has been designed to reproduce a feeling, a nostalgia we wanted to share with our players."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-plays-to-your-nostalgia-emulates-the-feeling-of-freerunning-in-ac1-ac2/1100-6515876/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>At its core, Diablo 4 is a game about math. Specifically, the eternal grind to hurl bigger numbers of damage at the enemies around you before they can do the same to you. One Diablo 4 player has just set a ridiculous benchmark when it comes to dealing damage, as they've managed to use a broken build to deal over 35 <em>undecillion </em>points of harm to an enemy.

<p dir="ltr">Director James Gunn has shed light on the storyline for a potential Star-Lord movie featuring Chris Pratt, as reported by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/chris-pratt-marvel-movie-plot-next">The Direct</a>. In the recently released digital version of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Gunn confirmed that he and Pratt have discussed the idea of Legendary Star-Lord film. The plot would center around Star-Lord's struggle to adapt to life on Earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Gunn expressed his excitement about exploring the concept, stating, "Chris and I, forever, have talked about how great it would be to be able to do a Legendary Star-Lord movie, a story with Star-Lord on Earth trying to adapt to the environment of Earth in the same way that somebody else might try to adapt to the alien environment of outer space. He's a fish out of water in just kind of regular water. So I can't wait to see it."</p><p dir="ltr">The revelation came in the form of a post-credits scene in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which hinted at Star-Lord's return. The scene portrayed Peter Quill, played by Pratt, beginning to adjust to his life on Earth. Sitting down for breakfast with his grandfather, portrayed by Gregg Henry, they engage in conversation while holding a newspaper featuring a playful reference to Kevin Bacon's abduction in the Disney+ Holiday Special.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-reveals-what-chris-pratts-star-lord-movie-is-about-report/1100-6515901/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Two former NFL cornerbacks are throwing jabs at each other on social media, which has hilariously led to one of them bringing up an old GameFAQs thread in their back and forth.

Samuel countered with a GameFAQs post (a GameSpot sister site) from apparently 8 years ago <a href="https://twitter.com/pick_six22/status/1678867940916056064?s=61&amp;t=JR30VSvxa2rjUhEWvfydIw">on Twitter</a>.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">It’s a big difference coach telling a QB not to throw your way or a QB being terrified to throw your way ⁦<a href="https://twitter.com/Revis24?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@Revis24</a>⁩ talk that shit 🤣💪🏾 I Love It <a href="https://t.co/HlzDE0scfT">pic.twitter.com/HlzDE0scfT</a></p>  — Asante Samuel (@pick_six22) <a href="https://twitter.com/pick_six22/status/1678867940916056064?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It's not every day you see a two-time Super Bowl champion pull up a video game forum to make an argument on Twitter.

One of the best specials on right now is for the Lexar 1TB microSD, which is available for just $63 currently.</p><p>Usually retailing for $130, this is perfect for anyone looking to pump up their Nintendo Switch, ROG Ally, or Steam Deck libraries, as you can easily hold several AAA games and plenty of indie titles on this little storage unit. SanDisk also has a 1TB card on sale, but this one is geared more toward professional content creators and is a little bit more expensive.

You can get a 256GB card for just $18 or a 512GB version for $40, and these are rated class 10 as well.

<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have had a good couple of years--between the retro-styled Shredder's Revenge, the upcoming Mutant Mayhem animated movie, and of course, the reverent Cowabunga Collection.

<p>It's a good time to be a Final Fantasy fan, as between spin-offs, new entries in the series, and exciting sequels on the horizon, the franchise has a <em>lot </em>to offer. For Final Fantasy VII fans, the game's excellent prequel Crisis Core just got a discount for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day 2023</a>, and is available for $35 on Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><ul><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Core-Final-Fantasy-Reunion-PlayStation/dp/B0B5B2B2S1?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">PS5</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Core-Final-Fantasy-Reunion-Xbox/dp/B0B5B1HZSR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Xbox Series X|S</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Core-Fantasy-Reunion-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0B5B1864Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Nintendo Switch</a> </span></li></ul><p>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is both a remake and a remaster of the classic PlayStation Portable game, as it updates the graphics of that game massively, overhauls its combat system, and throws in a few new ideas into the mix as well. It's a more digestible Final Fantasy game owing to its existence as a PSP original, but it's an essential chapter in the tale of Cloud Strife as it shines a light on his mentor Zack Fair and his nemesis Sephiroth.</p><p>"Much like protagonist Zack Fair himself, the story of the self-proclaimed country-boy-turned-SOLDIER-First-Class is not one shrouded in mystery," Jess Howard wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crisis-core-final-fantasy-7-reunion-review-conflict-resolved/1900-6418009/">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion review</a>.

<p>One of the most action-packed Final Fantasy games of recent memory, Stranger of Paradise is a fascinating prequel set before the events of the original 1987 game and puts a sharp new spin on that tale. At Amazon, the game just got a Prime Day discount and you can grab this Final Fantasy prequel for just <strong>$20</strong>. This deal is for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, and for PS5 owners and Xbox Series X|S owners, the last-gen versions include a free current-gen upgrade.</p><ul><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Paradise-Final-Fantasy-Origin-PlayStation/dp/B09HG3VZTT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin (PS4)</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Paradise-Final-Fantasy-Origin-PlayStation/dp/B09HFP7FSZ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin (Xbox Series X|S)</a> </span></li></ul><p>Developed by Team Ninja, Stranger of Paradise puts you in control of Jack Garland as he attempts to kill chaos, a fact that became a well-known meme after the game was first revealed back in 2021. Beyond the unintended comedy from its marketing, Stranger of Paradise is a fun reimagining of the first Final Fantasy, one that is backed up by challenging combat and surprisingly flexible character customization. It's not just an action with a Souls-like flair that pays lip service to Final Fantasy, but a genuine love letter to the franchise and crafts its own complex story of its own along the way.</p><p>"Still, while it might be confusing and memey, disjointed and weird, Stranger of Paradise is also a lot of fun," Phil Hornshaw wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-review-chaos-incarnate/1900-6417844/">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin review</a>. "It's full of cool combat with a wide variety of options, and a job system that lets you customize your playstyle or just try out what feels like 30 different ones. Its challenge makes every fight a battle of skill, while also giving you the tools to feel like a ludicrously powerful Final Fantasy badass. And despite being bizarrely delivered and wildly strange, there is a delight in uncovering what the hell is actually going on in the game's story and the weird ideas it brings to bear on the Final Fantasy series."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-gets-a-big-prime-discount/1100-6515881/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dying Light 2 Is 60% Off For Prime Day

<p>When it comes to games set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, Techland's Dying Light 2 is one of the best titles in that genre. A tense first-person game of parkour and peril, Dying Light 2 is currently on sale for just $24 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day 2023</a> and is available for both Xbox and PlayStation. It's worth noting that this deal applies to the Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game, but both these versions are eligible for a free current-gen upgrade on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><ul><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Light-2-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DK1RY3F?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Dying Light 2 (PS4)</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Light-2-PlayStation-4/dp/B0961T277L?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Dying Light 2 (PS5)</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Light-2-PlayStation-4/dp/B09QQWPDGQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Dying Light 2 (Xbox One digital code)</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Light-2-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJXSCR1?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Dying Light 2 (Xbox Series X|S)</a> </span></li></ul><p>Like its predecessor, Dying Light 2 tasks you with surviving the post-apocalyptic ruins of a world that has fallen to the hordes of zombies. The big catch here is that in addition to regular ankle-biters loitering around the streets of derelict suburbs, you also have to keep an eye out for the more volatile infected who only emerge at night. Tougher and more lethal than their daytime brethren, these homicidal zombies will push your flight-or-fight responses to the limit as you'll often find that it's better to leg it when you run into these monsters at night.</p><p>When you're not exploring the environment for resources or dealing with bandits, Dying Light 2 also has an intriguing story for you to take part in, one that forces you to make some hard decisions as you shape the world around you, for better or worse. Additionally, the game has received a substantial amount of free DLC since it launched, and Techland still has plans to support Dying Light 2 for several more years.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-2-is-60-off-for-prime-day/1100-6515882/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review - Unnerving Static

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/oxenfree-ii-lost-signals/">Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</a> is quite creepy at times, using time loops, crackling radio static, and the occasional vengeful interdimensional ghost to keep you on your toes. Sure, there are moments of levity when the game's characters crack jokes or dabble in a little fun but, like its 2016 predecessor, this dialogue-driven graphic adventure game delights in its unsettling atmosphere. The best parts of the experience are drowned out in the dreadful static of Oxenfree II's unmemorable companion and irritating secondary antagonist, but navigating the game's growing sense of unease as you slowly uncover clues to a greater mystery is an engaging and chilling thrill.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place five years after the original game, Oxenfree II has you play as a new protagonist: Riley Poverly. Returning to her hometown of Camena--the part of the mainland closest to the first Oxenfree's Edwards Island--Riley is partnered with the town's resident handyman, Jacob Summers, and tasked to set up transmission radio towers around the coastal town. The seemingly simple job devolves into a much stranger and more dangerous situation, however, as electromagnetic waves take a toll on reality, opening portals to other timelines. As Riley and Jacob struggle to understand what's happening and fix things, they find their efforts repeatedly thwarted by a trio of teenagers who are a part of Parentage, a church-like cult in the area, and lingering supernatural specters.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4164351-choices.jpg"><img alt="Sometimes choosing to say nothing can also affect how the story plays out." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4164351-choices.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Sometimes choosing to say nothing can also affect how the story plays out.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Like its previous games, developer Night School Studio utilizes both a choice- and timing-driven dialogue system, taking note of not only what you say but when you say it. Conversations don't pause to give you a chance to figure out what to say next--like an actual conversation in real life, Riley will have to regularly respond to express interest. During conversations, small thought bubbles will appear above Riley's head as people talk to her, giving you a chance to choose how you speak your mind. Wait too long and these dialogue branches eventually fade away, but speak up too soon and you may interrupt someone just before they absent-mindedly say something that creates a more compelling path in the conversation. In this way, saying nothing at all is just as valid a choice as saying something.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-unnerving-static/1900-6418088/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Don't Worry, Mileena Has Way Too Many Teeth In Mortal Kombat 1

<p> The monstrous mouth hiding beneath Mileena's mask has been the character's main trademark since she was introduced, though subsequent redesigns haven't always got it right. The upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> still decided to risk taking a new direction with Mileena's mouth--and fans are loving it.</p><p>In the first look at what Mortal Kombat 1's rebooted Mileena is hiding under her mask, she's shown to have more teeth than ever before, with an almost Predator-esque hinged jaw that opens up to reveal an equally freaky tongue. While the clip was only brief, revealed as part of a promo video for NetherRealm Studios' Kombat Kast, fans are excited about the design's potential for cool fatalities.</p><div>          </div><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mortal-kombat-1-mileena-new-design-teeth-mouth/">TheGamer</a>, the design shares some similarities with a <a href="https://twitter.com/WeBeenCroft/status/1677005382147792901?ref_src=twsrc^tfw|twcamp^tweetembed|twterm^1677005382147792901|twgr^8ec734f441cc65628edaf07c8ff0102b0f02125a|twcon^s1_&amp;ref_url=https://www.thegamer.com/mortal-kombat-1-mileena-new-design-teeth-mouth/">multi-jawed Mileena concept</a> that was originally created for Mortal Kombat X, before the title went with a design that controversially gave Mileena lips. From reactions <a href="https://twitter.com/isyourboyjun/status/1677002575650881537">across social media</a>, it appears that Mortal Kombat 1's unique (and importantly, lipless) Mileena redesign is hitting all the right notes with fans.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-worry-mileena-has-way-too-many-teeth-in-mortal-kombat-1/1100-6515878/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
