[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "This $100 TP-Link mesh router 3-pack will fix your spotty Wi-Fi", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Wi-Fi is convenient, but it&rsquo;s not always consistent. Your home&rsquo;s layout, materials, and/or size can cause signals to weaken or drop. Fortunately, mesh routers help fix that problem, and during the final day of Amazon Prime Day, you can pick up the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Deco-Replacement-S4-3-Pack/dp/B084GTH5LL/&amp;xcust=2-1-1992169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">TP-Link Deco S4 AC1200 three-pack system for just $100</a>. That&rsquo;s $50 off the normal price, bringing it to an all-time low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all other mesh routers, this dual-band, Wi-Fi 5 budget system offers more stable Wi-Fi by repeating the signal across all its active nodes. It also forms one unified network&mdash;you can roam freely in your home without worry about network switching and its related headaches. (A <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/539680/mesh-wi-fi-vs-traditional-router-which-ones-best-for-your-home.html\">traditional router paired with extenders</a> establishes multiple Wi-Fi networks your devices must connect and disconnect from as you move around.) And the TP-Link Deco S4 supports wired Ethernet backhaul, too, for even more stable Wi-Fi. That is, you can link the nodes with a Ethernet cable to ensure interference won&rsquo;t interrupt their communication.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1992181\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The ports on the back of the Deco S4 allow you to link the nodes with a Ethernet cable, ensuring stable communication between them.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With three nodes included in this deal, you can spread Wi-Fi coverage across a pretty wide space (up to 5,500 square feet or roughly a three-to-five bedroom home), or create a more dense, strategic configuration. (Maybe you&rsquo;ve got that one wall separating the kitchen and living room that weakens Wi-Fi signals from the central router.) The Deco S4 can also handle up to 100 devices at once, so you should be able to run all of your gear easily, as well as integrating Alexa support for select voice commands (e.g., parental controls).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, for some folks, the TP-Link Deco S4&rsquo;s older Wi-F 5 protocol will be a drawback. But if you don&rsquo;t have a gigabit internet plan nor run tons of devices at once on the network, this affordable system should work just fine. Otherwise, you can opt instead for the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/WiFi-6-Mesh-System-AX3000/dp/B09PRB1MZM/&amp;xcust=2-1-1992169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">TP-Link X55</a>, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system also available in a 3-pack at an all-time low price ($180).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Deco S4 is a great way to get into mesh networking cheaply, especially since each node can function as either a router <em>or </em>an extender. Yep: You can split up the pack among different households, if you want. Likewise, you can expand by buying more nodes later on. That&rsquo;s the beauty of mesh routers.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Deco-Replacement-S4-3-Pack/dp/B084GTH5LL/&amp;xcust=2-1-1992169-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the TP-Link Deco S4 (3-pack) for $100</a></p>\nNetworking</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1992169/this-100-tp-link-mesh-router-3-pack-will-fix-your-spotty-wi-fi.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T18:59:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Our favorite PCIe 4.0 SSD is ludicrously cheap for Prime Day", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to pick up more storage this Prime Day, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.

That&rsquo;s 63 percent off of the original $159.99 price tag and a savings of $100. Yep, that&rsquo;s a steal right there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This specific drive even nabbed our top spot on PCWorld&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">best SSD roundup</a> as well as earning four and a half stars plus an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award. According to our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828399/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review.html\">review</a>, this drive is &ldquo;especially adept at real-world transfers and random operations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WD Black SN850X features 1TB of space, sequential reads of up to 7,300, and sequential writes of up to 6,350. It offers a good amount of speed at a more reasonable price point, making this drive a true value buy. It also provides &ldquo;outstanding real world transfer rates and top-notch random write performance.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s even the WD Black Dashboard, which helps monitor your drive&rsquo;s health. As far as SSDs go, it really holds its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This SSD is more than half off, which is fantastic.

Literally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Surface Laptop Go 2 was an odd duck, a budget laptop that was still priced higher than its competition because of the price premium Microsoft attached as part of the Surface brand. Competing laptops by Acer and Asus offered more for your money, as our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/796333/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-2-review.html\">Surface Laptop Go 2 review</a> revealed. But Best Buy&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-go-2-12-4-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-latest-model-ice-blue%2F6505201.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">$499.99 deal for the Surface Laptop Go 2</a> erases that premium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop Go 2 uses an 11th-gen Core chip inside of it, which still holds up. Remember, this is the Surface <em>Laptop</em> Go 2, not the confusingly similar Arm-based Surface Go brand. We&rsquo;re pretty sure that the buyers either conflated the two, were turned off by the slightly sub-1080p screen, or simply didn&rsquo;t want to pay $699 for a laptop that should have been priced at $499 from the get-go. (Best Buy&rsquo;s other Surface sales puts the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-go-3-10-5-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-device-only-latest-model-matte-black%2F6490631.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Surface Go 3 on sale for $555.00</a> and the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-7-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-with-black-type-cover-latest-model-platinum%2F6482181.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Surface Pro 7+ on sale for $599.99</a>, incidentally, so this is also one of the best Surface deals available.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out that the performance of the Surface Laptop Go 2 didn&rsquo;t hold it back, just the price of competing products. And <em>those</em> products have <em>not</em> received the price cuts that the Surface Laptop Go 2 has. (Most Prime Day deals arrive on older hardware, anyway.) Best Buy is offering the Surface Laptop Go 2 in its 12.4-inch configuration, with a Core i5/8GB RAM/128GB SSD. That&rsquo;s a solid configuration, especially at this price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, this is a solid opportunity to snag a well-regarded laptop a year or two down the road.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-go-2-12-4-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-latest-model-ice-blue%2F6505201.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Surface Laptop Go 2 for $499 at Best Buy</a></p>\nBudget Laptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1992046/the-best-surface-everyone-forgot-about-is-29-off-for-prime-day.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T17:49:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Our best budget 1080p webcam plunges to $17 for Prime Day", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>This Prime Day webcam deal makes buying a new 1080p webcam an impulse buy: Just $17 nets you EMEET&rsquo;s 1080p webcam, our runner-up for the best budget webcam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deal reflects the waning days of Logitech dominating the entire webcam market. Instead, a cohort of Asian companies seized upon the work-from-home trend, all set upon replacing that crappy 720p webcam attached to your laptop. All those vendors have begun working hard for Prime Day to get your dollars.

EMEET&rsquo;s C960 is one of the most popular webcams on Amazon, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, the webcam is nothing fancy. If you&rsquo;re well-lit, the image quality is solid. The only real sign of its budget status is in the privacy shutter, which you have to manually attach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>EMEET lists the retail price at $49.99. When we reviewed it, the price was $33.99. Either way, the company is offering a substantial discount for Prime Day.

But how could it ever come to this, that officially released drivers contain malware?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stolen-certificates\">Stolen certificates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Microsoft, all drivers had a valid signature. This allowed them to secure administrator rights. This would have made it possible to monitor compromised systems at any time. The drivers would have come from different Microsoft partners, and the discovered accounts have now been suspended. The developer certificates used to sign the malware-infused drivers were apparently stolen by the software manufacturers and sold over the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"offline-scan-recommended\">Offline scan recommended</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Windows has been able to detect malicious drivers on its own since March 2023, Microsoft recommends regularly updating Windows Defender and also applying Windows updates. To detect potentially malicious drivers that may have been installed before March 2, 2023, an offline scan of the system is also recommended. The bad drivers are now automatically collected in a revocation list integrated in Windows, including numerous drivers with certificates from China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article originally appeared on PCWorld&rsquo;s sister site PCWelt, and was translated from German to English.</em></p>\n\nAntivirus, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1991875/caution-malware-in-133-windows-drivers-this-is-how-microsoft-reacts.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T15:58:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Boost your Xbox\u2019s storage capacity for $80 less on Prime Day", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s face it.

Best Buy&rsquo;s also selling the same <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fseagate-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2F6425015.p%3FskuId%3D6425015&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">SSD for the same price</a> if you&rsquo;d rather shop there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way it works is simple. All you have to do is plug in the expansion card and it&rsquo;ll connect to Xbox&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/14/a-closer-look-at-xbox-velocity-architecture/&amp;xcust=2-3-1991710-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Velocity Architecture</a> in a matter of seconds. Switching to different games should be fast and seamless, according to the manufacturer. Load times should be faster, too. It&rsquo;s compatible with Xbox Series X and S models, and Amazon buyers seem pleased with the extra space, which better accommodates a large library of games. It just works!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a fantastic deal. However, with Prime Day quickly coming to a close, you better swoop in and grab it now before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM&amp;xcust=2-3-1991710-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Seagate 1TB storage expansion for Xbox for $139.99 at Amazon</a></p>\nStorage</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1991710/1991710.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T15:30:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Prime day stunner: AMD\u2019s ferocious Ryzen 9 7900X3D is cheaper than ever", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD created an overnight sensation when it boosted V-cache on the Ryzen 5 5800X3D. So for the next generation, it did the same thing to its top-of-the-line CPU. The result is the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and if you&rsquo;re putting together a gaming PC, it&rsquo;s one of the best chips money can buy. Normally a surprisingly okay deal at $600 (compared to Intel&rsquo;s offerings at the same tier), for Prime Day Amazon is selling it for $140 off. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTRRNK7T/&amp;xcust=2-2-1991601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">That brings the price down to $459</a>, the best we&rsquo;ve seen yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ryzen 9 7900X3D boasts twelve cores, 24 threads, and a maximum clock speed of 5.5GHz, which makes it a beast of a CPU just like the almost-identical Ryzen 9 7900X. But the special sauce that makes this variant even better for gaming is the boosted V-cache on half of those cores, making them especially well-suited to gaming tasks, while keeping the other half free for standard desktop CPU operations. You can <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1804140/ryzen-7800x3d-vs-7950x3d-amd-gaming-cpus-compared.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out this breakdown</a> for a more technical explanation of how it works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, the even more insane <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTRH9MNS/&amp;xcust=2-2-1991601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>, with 16 cores and 32 threads and the same AM5 socket, is also on sale, but its $70 discount is a lot less dramatic. For a high-end gaming build and a budget that&rsquo;s roomy but not unlimited, the 7900X3D makes a lot more sense. Pick it up fast if you&rsquo;re ready to buy: A discount this deep might not be seen again this calendar year. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTRRNK7T/&amp;xcust=2-2-1991601-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Ryzen 9 7900X3D for $459 at Amazon</a></p>\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1991601/one-of-amds-best-ever-gaming-cpus-is-140-off-on-amazon.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T15:15:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Samsung\u2019s gorgeous OLED ultrawide monitor is $500 off for Prime Day", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for a good deal to take the plunge on a high-end OLED monitor, then today&rsquo;s your day. Samsung&rsquo;s large format monitors usually come with a significant markup, but for Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day extravaganza, they come down to a much more reasonable price. Normally $1500, the 34-inch Odyssey OLED G8 is 33 percent off today only, which <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLF2RWNV/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1991496-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">brings the price down to $999.99</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OLED G8 G85SB shares a lot of specs with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1984208/alienwares-oled-ultrawide-monitor-is-under-900-before-prime-day.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alienware&rsquo;s ultrawide curved OLED</a>, which is also deeply discounted at the moment. It has the popular 3440&times;1440 resolution at a 21:9 aspect ratio, 175hz refresh rate (assuming your desktop can actually push that many frames), .03-millisecond response time, and a stylish build with a super-skinny base and RGB lights in a ring on the rear. In comparison to the Dell model, Samsung&rsquo;s is a little more friendly with modern laptops thanks to a USB-C port with 65 watts of charging power. But it&rsquo;s also a little less easy-to-use, since there&rsquo;s only one USB-C &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; port for attaching accessories, and the single HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort both need mini-adapters for some reason. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung also includes some extra hardware that basically makes this display a stand-alone TV, packing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and running on the same Tizen-based streaming app platform as Samsung&rsquo;s smart TV line. That seems a little extra for a display so clearly designed to be plugged into a PC or laptop, but I&rsquo;m sure someone will find a use for it.

Whether in <em>Doom</em>, <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, or <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, if you picked up a package with a red cross on it, your health improved after a few seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, however, you can hardly find the clearly marked medipack with the red cross in any game. It turns out there&rsquo;s a reason why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"protected-symbol\">Protected symbol</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The symbol with the red cross should never have appeared in video games to begin with. Although the symbol seems quite simple, it isn&rsquo;t subject to public domain. Instead, the symbol is protected by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"developers-must-rethink\">Developers must rethink</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The circumstance became clear at the beginning of 2017 when the developers of the building strategy game <em>Prison Architect</em> had to remove the red cross from their game via an update. Until then, the symbol was visible on ambulances in the game, even if it was only displayed very small. Other games also dispensed with the familiar symbol for life energy or medicine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in the 2001 remake of the first-person shooter <em>Halo</em>, the red cross on medipacks was replaced by a simple &ldquo;H.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"criticism-from-players\">Criticism from players</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers initially reacted with incomprehension. But the Red Cross explained in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.redcross.ca/about-us/about-the-canadian-red-cross/red-cross-emblem/it-may-just-be-a-game-to-you-but-it-means-the-world-to-us&amp;xcust=2-2-1989513-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a statement</a> that the symbol had a much greater meaning. It stands for humanity all over the world and should show people where they can expect help and protection. It is often vital for aid workers that the Red Cross is identified and respected as an aid organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, they oppose the use of the symbol in other ways in video games. The majority of developers have since refrained from using the symbol in games of all genres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article originally appeared on PCWorld&rsquo;s sister site PCWelt, and was translated from German to English.</em></p>\n\nGaming</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1989513/did-you-know-that-this-symbol-is-forbidden-in-video-games.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Razer\u2019s Naga Pro, my favorite wireless mouse, is $60 off for Prime Day", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who spends both a lot of work time and a lot of play time at my computer desk, I&rsquo;m incredibly picky about mice. I need something that&rsquo;s wireless, comfy, and has plenty of buttons for all the productive and/or stupid things I do on a daily basis. So far the best one I&rsquo;ve ever used is the Razer Naga Pro, which offers insane speed and interchangeable side plates for a variety of button layouts and play styles. Normally a shameful excess at $150, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D27XXRY/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1991427-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a slightly-less-shameful $89.99</a> for the home stretch of Amazon Prime Day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Razer&rsquo;s Naga Pro lets you choose from three thumb button layouts: standard two-button &ldquo;shooter mode,&rdquo; 12-button &ldquo;MMO mode,&rdquo; and my personal pick, a six-button grid that splits the difference. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Logitech&rsquo;s G602 or G604, you&rsquo;ll know why this layout is so comfy and versatile. In addition to bound game items (I tend to use the top row for melee/throwable/special ability in shooters), it&rsquo;s useful for basic computer functions, too. I have the bottom row set to control my media, using Razer&rsquo;s Shift function to turn the mouse wheel into a volume wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Naga Pro lasts about two weeks on a battery charge for me with lights turned off, and I can appreciate the 20,000 DPI and sub-1ms wireless connection, even if my puny human reflexes can&rsquo;t actually use it. The wireless mode can swap between the 2.4Ghz dongle and Bluetooth on the fly. This isn&rsquo;t the latest model of the Naga Pro, but the V2&rsquo;s upgrades <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGJTLFN5/&amp;xcust=2-1-1991427-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">aren&rsquo;t worth $180</a> to me.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D27XXRY/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1991427-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Razer Naga Pro for $89.99 on Amazon</a></p>\nMice</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1991427/my-favorite-razer-wireless-mouse-is-60-off-for-prime-day.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T14:24:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Prime Day deal: Nab an RTX-loaded Asus ROG gaming PC for $999", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;m a massive fan of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481326/pre-built-desktop-gaming-pc-pluses-minuses.html\">pre-built gaming desktop PCs</a>.

Regarding size, a 27-inch monitor seems to be the best option for most folks, as it doesn&rsquo;t take up a ton of desk space and it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes. A 32-inch monitor, for example, may cause eye strain if it&rsquo;s too close to your face. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"does-monitor-refresh-rate-matter\">Does monitor refresh rate matter?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Refresh rates are mostly relevant to PC gaming. The refresh rate is the number of times a monitor refreshes the screen per second. 60Hz is fine for casual gamers, but if you&rsquo;re into fast-paced action titles, we recommend a monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate. This will ensure your monitor never bottlenecks the frame rates generated by your PC. You probably don&rsquo;t need a 240Hz (or higher) refresh rate unless you&rsquo;re a professional gamer. Personally, I use a 60Hz monitor, which is fine for me because the games I play are slower-paced.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"does-my-monitor-need-4k-resolution\">Does my monitor need 4K resolution?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>A 1080p monitor is totally fine for most tasks like web browsing and checking e-mail, but 4K is the way to go if you want the ultimate streaming or gaming experience, or simply want more screen real estate for multiple windows, applications, and so on. 4K monitors provide sharper detail than 1080p monitors, but can be more expensive. Still, if you&rsquo;re working with a flexible budget or need that sharper resolution, then 4K is the way to go. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"are-curved-monitors-better\">Are curved monitors better?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Curved monitors are not necessarily better, but they&rsquo;ve got some advantages over the flat variety. They create a more immersive experience, which is can be nice for games and movies. They also theoretically reduce eye strain and fatigue, as they minimize distance and viewing angles. You don&rsquo;t have to adjust your eyes as much. Unfortunately, most curved monitors cost more than flat ones and loss of clarity can happen if you aren&rsquo;t sitting directly in the center of the screen.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nGaming, Monitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/394751/prime-day-monitor-deals-july-12-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T13:58:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Cheaper than Prime Day: Get Windows 11 Pro licenses right here for $30", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>A Windows 11 Pro license can be handy, but the cost of upgrading or buying a full license isn&rsquo;t cheap.

And we&rsquo;re not talking about rinky-dink sales of a few dollars here and there. Discounts during this year&rsquo;s two-day Prime Day sale are running as high as half off the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1988954/this-is-the-best-thunderbolt-dock-deal-on-prime-day.html\">Belkin Thunderbolt Dock Core</a>, with the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1983354/prime-day-thunderbolt-docks-and-usb-c-hubs-deals-july-2023.html\">best Prime Day deals for Thunderbolt docks</a> saving you close to $100. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. Thunderbolt docks emerged from the shadows around 2019 or 2020 or so, as laptop makers began recognizing that the emerging USB-C port could replace the need for embedding HDMI, SD, USB-A, and other ports along the side of their laptops. Laptops could finally be thin, svelte, and look like Macs! The growing popularity of the 40Gbps Thunderbolt protocol across 10th- and 11th-gen Intel Core laptops also meant that this single USB-C port became vastly more powerful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cue the pandemic. Workers headed home, soon realizing that they would like to replicate their office workspace with multiple monitors and USB devices to get more done. What to do? Thunderbolt docks offered a solution: Plug in multiple 4K displays all from a single port. Demand rose. But the pandemic bit hard, here, too. With supply chains thrown out of whack, certain <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/707591/why-are-thunderbolt-docks-so-hard-to-find-blame-electric-cars.html\">Thunderbolt dock components were being snapped up by electric car makers</a>. Prices started spiking, and general availability became a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About eighteen months later, things have changed. The pandemic may not be totally over, but the Thunderbolt dock supply chain has relaxed. Plugable founder Bernie Thompson told PCWorld last week that the company has tried to move its sourcing operations to Thailand to make it easier to buy and assemble docks. (China has aggressively locked down cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, tech hubs where many computer accessories are made.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers also benefit from the desire to move on. You&rsquo;ll find older Thunderbolt 3 hardware like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1988768/the-best-usb-c-dock-you-can-buy-is-60-off-for-prime-day.html\">this Editors&rsquo; Choice award-winning Plugable TBT3-UDZ dock</a> receive discounts, in part because the latest specification is Thunderbolt 4. But Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 are almost functionally identical, meaning that you can snap up a Thunderbolt 3 deal like day-old bread: It&rsquo;s really almost as good as the freshest hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble &mdash; which demands a separate story &mdash; is that there is a confusing mess of hardware that can fit into that USB-C port and expand your PC. This includes <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">USB-C hubs and dongles</a>, Thunderbolt docks, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html\">DisplayLink docks</a>, and even high-bit-rate options that can squeeze out more performance on certain PCs. We&rsquo;ve tried to keep it simple, focusing on slow, cheap USB-C hubs/dongles, and the faster Thunderbolt docks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it all boils down to, though, is that you&rsquo;re finally seeing actually, honest-to-goodness <em>sales</em> on Thunderbolt hardware during these Prime Day sales. If you have held back from buying because you were unwilling to spend the extra money, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1983354/prime-day-thunderbolt-docks-and-usb-c-hubs-deals-july-2023.html\">start looking for a Thunderbolt dock deal</a>.

Once you&rsquo;re in, simply head to the&nbsp;<em>Performance</em> tab and look for your current GPU temperature listed in the GPU section, as shown in the image above.&nbsp;This works only if you have the Windows 10 May 2020 Update or a newer version of Windows installed, including Windows 11; older versions lack the capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bare-bones feature, showing only the current temperature rather than tracking it over time. It can also be annoying to keep Task Manager open while you&rsquo;re gaming or fine-tuning an overclock.

How hot should your graphics card run?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no easy answer; it varies from GPU to GPU. Google is your friend. Most modern chips can run at temperatures in the mid-90 degrees Celsius, though, and you&rsquo;ll often see them hit those temperatures in gaming laptops. In desktops, however, a graphics card running at 90-plus degrees is screaming for help. In single-GPU systems with decent airflow, your graphics card temperatures shouldn&rsquo;t wander above the 80-degree range unless you&rsquo;re using a model with a single blower-style cooler, or an exceptionally powerful GPU. Custom graphics cards with multiple fans often hover in the 60s and 70s, even under full load, and water-cooled GPUs can run even cooler.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image large\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/radeon_vega_64_liquid_c-100730366-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"radeon vega 64 liquid c\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/radeon_vega_64_liquid_c-100730366-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n<p>Some graphics cards, like this iteration of the Radeon Vega 64, include integrated closed-loop liquid coolers for even cooler temperatures.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>If your graphics card was released in the last five years and runs hotter than 90 degrees Celsius, or you&rsquo;ve observed a steep incline in your GPU temperature over several weeks or months of monitoring it, consider taking steps to help cool it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-lower-your-graphics-card-temperature\">How to lower your graphics card temperature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your graphics card temperature runs hot, there&rsquo;s not much you can do to improve it aside from paying for hardware upgrades.

Assuming your PC isn&rsquo;t a rat&rsquo;s nest of cables, you&rsquo;ll likely need to consider adding more fans to your case to improve airflow. Every PC should have at least intake and outtake fans for optimal performance, and that goes doubly so for gaming PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find basic case fans for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Case-Fans/SubCategory/ID-573?name=Case-Fans&amp;Order=BESTSELLING&amp;xcust=2-1-397489-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">under $10 on Newegg</a>, or swankier models with features like RGB lighting and mag-lev suspension for much more if you want to get fancy. Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3628172/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html\">setting up your PC&rsquo;s fans for maximum system cooling</a> can help if you need it.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image large\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/maingear-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-pc-100769006-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"maingear geforce rtx 2080 ti pc\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/maingear-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-pc-100769006-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n<p>Your hot graphics card could cool down in a more spacious case.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Small form factor systems can deliver a big punch these days, but the constrained space can send hardware temperatures skyrocketing. If you have a particularly small case, and your graphics card keeps overheating and shutting down, consider upgrading to a more spacious model. Even larger cases can strangle airflow if they&rsquo;re poorly designed, however. Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3226748/how-to-buy-pc-case.html\">picking the perfect PC case</a> can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, sometimes the thermal paste between the GPU and the heatsink can become dry and lose its effectiveness, most commonly in graphics cards that are many years old. And sometimes, graphics cards ship with poor thermal paste application, though it&rsquo;s very rare. You could try to replace it if all else fails, though the process is highly technical, varies card-by-card, and voids the <em>hell</em> out of your warranty. Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2066684/how-to-make-your-old-gpu-run-like-new.html\">making your old graphics card run like new</a> is several years old, but the basic technique still applies to today&rsquo;s GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <em>really </em>wanted to get adventurous in your quest for lower temperatures, you could swap out your graphics card&rsquo;s cooling system for a liquid-cooling option while you&rsquo;ve got it disassembled, though it&rsquo;s overkill for most people. We&rsquo;ve got a guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2977023/how-to-liquid-cool-your-gpu-in-20-minutes.html\">water-cooling your GPU</a>, and hot-running enthusiasts with nothing to lose might find the upgrade worthwhile. &ldquo;I saw significant reduction in heat and noise by going with liquid, and none of the throttling I saw on air cooling,&rdquo; hardware editor Gordon Mah Ung wrote after using a Corsair bracket to attach a CPU closed-loop liquid cooler to a reference Radeon R9 290. &ldquo;For a 20-minute project with a $35 bracket, that&rsquo;s not bad.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just be sure to Google a disassembly guide for your specific graphics card model before you start tearing your precious, pricey hardware apart willy-nilly. And if you don&rsquo;t want to go to all that hassle, our constantly updated guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3106426/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">the best graphics cards for PC gaming</a> can help you pick out an all-new GPU lickity-split.</p>\n\nDesktop PCs, Gaming, Graphics Cards, Professional Software, Technology Industry</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/397489/how-to-check-your-graphics-card-gpu-temperature.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best Prime Day tech deals on Amazon: Laptops, SSDs, monitors, more", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s annual Prime Day sales event ends today, so be sure to take advantage of the discounts if you&rsquo;re in the market for any tech products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve combed through the categories that PCWorld readers care about&mdash;from laptops to monitors to security cameras, SSDs, soundbars, streaming subscriptions, and more&mdash;and highlighted the best of those deals below.

The HP Pavilion Gaming Desktop on sale from Amazon for $222 off is a standout budget gaming PC with a Core i5 processor and an RTX 3060 GPU&mdash;that&rsquo;s enough to game at 1080p with decent framerates in pretty much all modern games. Alternatively, for just about the same price you can opt for the Acer Nitro 50 for $510 off on Newegg which comes with a Core i5 processor and an RTX 3050 GPU. Ultimately the better value will come down to your intended use. If gaming is your main priority then opt for the HP model with an RTX 3060. But if you need your computer for work or other multipurpose use then save yourself a little bit of money and go with the Acer Nitro 50 which comes with more RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-prime-day-all-in-one-computer-deals\">Best Prime Day all-in-one computer deals:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-all-in-one-27-cb1095xt-bundle-all-in-one-pc&amp;xcust=2-1-796457-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">HP AiO 27</a>, Core i7/Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics/16GB RAM/512GB SSD/1TB HDD/27-inch 1080p display, <strong>$789.99 (34% off on HP)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaCentre-Business-Touchscreen-i7-13620H/dp/B0C7S4W3RY&amp;xcust=2-1-796457-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo IdeaCentre 3 Business AiO</a>, Core i7/64GB RAM/2TB SSD/27-inch 1080p touch display, <strong>$1,279.00 (7% off on Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Touchscreen-Computer-i5-1235U-Graphics/dp/B09S7MCVTV?ots=1&amp;slotNum=3&amp;imprToken=44c49443-e2ed-dd71-0c8&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/813362/best-pc-computer-deals.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Inspiron 24 AiO</a>, Core i5/8GB RAM/512GB SSD/24-inch 1080p touch display,&nbsp;<strong>$729.97 (22% off on Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=2-1-813362-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-pavilion-all-in-one-27-ca1065m-4p6a8av-1&amp;xcust=2-1-796457-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">HP Pavilion AiO 27</a>, Ryzen 3/8GB RAM/256GB SSD/27-inch 1080p touch display,<strong>&nbsp;$549.99 (35% off on HP)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/gkk9&amp;sid=2-1-813362-1-0-0?sid=2-1-796457-1-0-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Inspiron 24 AiO</a>, Core i7/MX 550/16GB RAM/512GB SSD/24-inch 1080p touch display,&nbsp;<strong>$949.99 (21% off on Dell)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/gkki&amp;xcust=2-1-796457-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Inspiron 27 AiO</a>, Core i7/12GB RAM/512GB SSD/27-inch 1080p touch display, <strong>$849.99 (32% off on Dell)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/HP-Essential-All-in-One-Computer-23-8-FHD-AMD-Ryzen-3-8-GB-512-GB-SSD/1406725671?athbdg=L1700&amp;xcust=2-1-796457-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">HP Essential AiO 24</a>, Ryzen 3/8GB RAM/512GB SSD/24-inch 1080p display, <strong>$489.99 (11% off on Walmart)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for an all-in-one (AiO) desktop computer then you&rsquo;re in luck.

Which you should end up buying is entirely dependent upon what your needs are and what you want to do with your computer. If you are looking for something that will work in a home office or family room, then a productivity PC or AiO with a solid CPU and lots of RAM and storage is probably the way to go. If gaming is your main concern, a gaming PC can offer a lot more bang for your buck than a laptop and you should focus on getting the best GPU possible. Or if you just want something that can fit anywhere and provide basic computing then a mini PC is a good bet.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-much-processing-power-will-i-need\">How much processing power will I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;re after CPU power, look for processors with higher numerical names. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks. Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. Typically, the higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. You can get along just fine with a Core i3 for basic office and web browsing. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. If you need more power, the Ryzen 7 chip is well suited for content creation like video editing. Finally, if you&rsquo;re dealing with 4K video, spring for a Ryzen 9. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-gpu-should-i-get\">What GPU should I get?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t intend to do any gaming on your computer then feel free to save some money by going with integrated graphics. However, if you are looking to get your game on, then we recommend at least an Nvidia GeForce 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT as these are the least expensive discrete graphics cards that can handle ray tracing. The latest gen GPUs are becoming more readily available in pre-built systems so opt for that if you have the money and want a performance boost. But they&rsquo;re still running a bit expensive, so budget gamers will likely be better served with the previous generation cards.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-memory\">What about memory?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>As for RAM, we think its best to shoot for 16GB at the minimum for productivity and gaming, but for family computers and internet browsing, 8GB should suffice.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">5.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-good-amount-of-storage\">What is a good amount of storage?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Storage size is dependent upon your personal needs, but it is generally a good idea to opt for an SSD over an standard HDD as they are much faster and don&rsquo;t significantly affect the price of a desktop. Before deciding, it&rsquo;s best to consider what your intended use of the computer will be. Are you just doing work or web browsing? Then something like 512GB will be plenty. If you want to load up a lot of large files such as games or content creation projects, then you&rsquo;ll need at least 1 or 2TB or storage.

It&rsquo;s loaded with upsides, including a Ryzen 9 processor, an Nvidia RTX 3070Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, which is enough to do 4K gaming.

This is the cheapest we&rsquo;ve ever seen this model. It provides some solid budget gaming specs, too. You&rsquo;ll get a Ryzen 5 processor and an RTX 3050 GPU. The 8GB of RAM could be better, but it does have an additional open DDR5 slot in case you wish to pop in some another 8GB of RAM for an upgrade in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-type-of-laptop-should-i-get\">What type of laptop should I get?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>The very first thing you should think about is what type of laptop will be best for you. There are traditional clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, and even Chromebooks. If you want something that is portable and can work as both a laptop and tablet, then a 2-in-1 is a good choice. Traditional clamshells can offer better hardware and often are the way to go for professionals and gamers who require strong performance. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-much-processing-power-will-i-need\">How much processing power will I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>If it&rsquo;s CPU power you&rsquo;re looking for, look for processors with higher numerical names. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks. Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. The higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. Basic office and web work gets along just fine on a Core i3. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. If you need more power, the Ryzen 7 chip is well suited for content creation like video editing. Finally, if you&rsquo;re dealing with 4K video, spring for a Ryzen 9. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-the-difference-between-discrete-graphics-and-integrated-graphics\">What&rsquo;s the difference between discrete graphics and integrated graphics?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want a discrete graphics card for hardcore gaming or editing videos. It&rsquo;s separate from the processor, so you can expect higher performance out of it. Integrated graphics, on the other hand, are attached to the CPU and uses less power as a result. This is perfectly fine for everyday tasks, especially if you&rsquo;re not doing anything that&rsquo;s graphics-intensive.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-memory\">What about memory?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>8GB of RAM is zippy enough for general use. If you&rsquo;ve got a gaming laptop, 16GB of RAM is the way to go, and content creators will want even more.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">5.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-big-should-my-display-be\">How big should my display be?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a video editor or someone who does a lot of multimedia work, you&rsquo;ll want a display that&rsquo;s anywhere from 15- to 17-inches. The sweet spot is really anywhere from 13- to 14-inches, though. The bigger the display, the heavier your laptop is going to be. A 13- or 14-inch display is the best in terms of portability and value.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/796350/prime-day-laptop-deals-july-12-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T07:38:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "The best Day 2 Prime Day Chromebook deals are live", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon Prime Day Chromebook deals are here, with new, updated deals for the second day of the Prime Day sale.

Keep in mind that retailers will dump older Chromebooks for less than $100 &mdash; we take a close look at these to determine whether they&rsquo;re trash or treasure. We&rsquo;ve factored the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394216/google-is-working-to-solve-the-chromebooks-support-problem.html\">Chromebook support window</a> into our recommendations, which tends to extend between two and five years on discounted Chromebooks. We prioritize modern, more powerful Chromebook processors, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Chromebook 315 sale is our recommendation, with solid all-around hardware and a price that&rsquo;s at its lowest point for the year. The Asus Chromebook C423 is also at a yearly low, with just a small flaw: 4GB of RAM. (We try to shy away from recommendations with hardware shortfalls, but we&rsquo;ll show them if the savings justify it.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vibe Flip is also near a yearly low, with powerful hardware that will work well for productivity or gaming. Acer&rsquo;s Chromebook 516 GE is one of the few times we&rsquo;ve seen a gaming Chromebook go on sale, especially one with such a nice display. That might be worth a purchase all its own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Slim 3&rsquo;s memory is a little skimpy, but we like Lenovo&rsquo;s Chromebooks and the price seems like a good one for the other specs. Caution! You may see this <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-15-6-chromebook-intel-processor-n200-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-natural-silver%2F6535992.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Chromebook</a> at Best Buy for almost half off, but we&rsquo;re steering clear: It just feels like a 15.6-inch screen with 768p resolution is going to unnecessarily fatigue your eyes. We&rsquo;d prefer you buy a smaller screen instead, like the Chromebook Spin 311. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We generally avoid bargain-basement Chromebooks, but some buyers just want to spend as little as possible. Our last three recommendations are made with this in mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"what-to-think-about-when-buying-a-chromebook\">What to think about when buying a Chromebook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, Chromebooks tend to fall into three categories: ultracheap models at about $100, which can offer solid discounts but can hide gotchas like a subpar screen; midrange $200 to $350 Chromebooks, the typical price point; and premium Chromebooks at $500 and above. The latter are essentially PC laptops with Google&rsquo;s Chrome OS on top, and might be too expensive for your tastes. Our story recommending <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1976934/why-you-should-choose-a-chromebook-over-a-laptop.html\">Chromebooks over laptops</a> may help you decide, as might our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">recommendations for the best Chromebooks</a>. We have a more detailed comparison of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html\">laptops versus Chromebooks</a>, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discounted Chromebooks used to cut corners, like using 768p screens. We try to highlight more eye-pleasing 1080p screens, but smaller Chromebooks may look just fine with an older screen instead. Unlike a laptop, you should worry less about the processor: An Intel Core chip guarantees solid performance, but Celerons are much more common. Don&rsquo;t snub either a Qualcomm Snapdragon or Mediatek Arm chip, either. Instead, Chromebooks with more memory generally perform a bit better. Consider a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">USB-C dongle</a> to connect to an external display, if it doesn&rsquo;t already come with an HDMI port.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-much-should-i-pay-for-a-chromebook-during-prime-day\">How much should I pay for a Chromebook during Prime Day?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Expect to pay between $170 to $250 or so, depending on the configuration.

If the system memory is 8GB, that&rsquo;s also signals a quality Chromebook. Don&rsquo;t be so concerned about the microprocessor, as they tend to vary between Intel Pentium and Celeron processors and Arm (Qualcomm and Mediatek) processors. Anything powered by an Intel Core chip or AMD Ryzen (not an A-series) chip should deliver solid performance.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"does-a-chromebooks-brand-matter\">Does a Chromebook&rsquo;s brand matter?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Virtually all Chromebooks are manufactured by name brands: HP, Samsung, Asus, and so on.

None of Amazon&rsquo;s Thunderbolt deals are at their yearly lows, but they&rsquo;re close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have three top deals to recommend. Grab that HP Thunderbolt 4 deal now &mdash; the discounted HP 4J0A2AA is an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/813347/hp-thunderbolt-dock-120w-g4-review.html\">Editor&rsquo;s Choice award-winning dock</a> at a solid discount. The other standout deal also won an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award: Our review of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/813324/review-belkins-connect-is-a-great-budget-thunderbolt-dock.html\">Belkin Thunderbolt Dock Core</a> reveals it to be an excellent little portable Thunderbolt dock at a massive discount. The Belkin Thunderbolt Dock deal is for a slightly bulkier dock, and probably should be considered a secondary option. Finally, our third recommended deal is the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/814540/plugable-tbt3-udz-thunderbolt-dock-review.html\">&ldquo;Cadillac of Thunderbolt docks,&rdquo; the Plugable TBT3-UDZ</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kensington SD2500T is the cheaper little brother of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/918583/kensington-sd5500t-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html\">Kensington SD5500T</a>, a much-loved dock which offers more ports. We haven&rsquo;t reviewed the Monoprice dock, unfortunately, but the price is right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not huge fans of the SD5700T deal or the OWC Thunderbolt Dock, because of the lack of display ports. You&rsquo;ll need to invest in an intermediary cable like this <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/uni-Thunderbolt-Compatible-MacBook-Surface/dp/B075V5JK36/&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">USB-C to HDMI cable</a>, at $17 per cable on Amazon. Here&rsquo;s our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1519567/owc-thunderbolt-go-dock-review.html\">review of OWC&rsquo;s Thunderbolt Go Dock</a>, a more robust option. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/815647/anker-apex-12-in-1-thunderbolt-4-dock-review-meh.html\">Anker 777 Apex won a middling score in our review</a>, but its features are top-notch and the price is just about at its yearly low. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"prime-day-deals-on-usb-c-hubs-docks-and-dongles\">Prime Day deals on USB-C hubs, docks, and dongles</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Multi-Port-Delivery-Splitter-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BLJFZ42M/&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acasis 6-in-1 USB-C Hub</a>, <strong>$9.99 (23% off on Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/USB-Hub-Acodot-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B0BKPYY8BC&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acodot 9-in-1 USB-C Hub</a>, <strong>$15.99 (47% off on Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.amazon.com/Hiearcool-MacBook-Multiport-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B07WPTG7NX/&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hiearcool USB-C 7-in-1 Hub</a>, <strong>$19.99 (33% off at Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNZ5V34J&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anker Triple Display 564 Docking Station</a>, 100W charging, <strong>$199.99 (33% off at Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Displays-DisplayPort-Compatible-Thunderbolt/dp/B09NQQ1G1N/&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plugable 12-in-1 Docking Station</a>, 60W charging, <strong>$159.96 (27% off on Amazon)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/black-wavlink-69dk1/p/1DN-0023-00014&amp;xcust=2-1-1983354-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wavlink Universal USB-C Laptop Docking Station</a> (no charging), <strong>$94.99 (52% off at Newegg)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t reviewed the Wavlink docking station, but it supplies the capabilities of Thunderbolt via <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html\">DisplayLink, a compression technology we&rsquo;ve been impressed with</a>. The Anker and Plugable docks also use the same technology. Anker&rsquo;s price is a little high, but it does include laptop charging. Wavlink&rsquo;s deal meets the price we&rsquo;ve hoped these devices would achieve, though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve used the Hiearcool dongle before, and it&rsquo;s solid. We haven&rsquo;t used the Acasis or Acodot hubs, but the price is right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-look-for-when-buying-a-thunderbolt-dock-or-usb-c-hub\">What to look for when buying a Thunderbolt dock or USB-C hub</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though we consider a Thunderbolt dock and a USB-C hub to be two separate product categories, they share similarities. Both use a USB-C output from your laptop. The difference is that some laptops use this port as a generic USB-C port, and others route the high-speed Thunderbolt 3 or 4 protocol through the USB-C socket. The former allows for typically 10Gbps of throughput, useful for USB keys, external storage, and perhaps an external display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt (either Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4) allows for 40Gbps of throughput, designed for high-speed external SSDs and multiple displays. Our roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">best USB-C hubs</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">best Thunderbolt docks</a> explain further in much greater detail. Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 are close enough that you can save money by buying the older technology that retailers are trying to get rid of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, USB-C hubs and dongles are relatively cheap, rarely climbing over $60. Prime Day is an opportunity to pick up a USB-C hub with inputs for USB expansion, Ethernet, SD cards, and more for very little &mdash; all ports that your laptop might lack. Just don&rsquo;t go too crazy: All of the devices that the USB-C connects to will transfer data over the same 10Gbps port. That&rsquo;s fine for a keyboard, mouse, and a hard drive which will power on, send data, and turn off. But sending a fire hose of simultaneous Ethernet, storage, and display data won&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;ll need a Thunderbolt dock (and a laptop port) instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt docks require more care. Here, consider what you want to do: connect a pair of 4K displays with HDMI? Look for Thunderbolt docks with a pair of HDMI ports. DisplayPort connections will work, but you&rsquo;ll need a cheap intermediary cable. Thunderbolt docks have historically been in short supply, so this is an opportunity to pick up a pricey accessory at a discount. However, they&rsquo;re almost a must for a home office.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-have-a-usb-c-port-on-my-laptop-how-do-i-know-what-to-use-with-it\">I have a USB-C port on my laptop. How do I know what to use with it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Consult your laptop&rsquo;s manual. A Thunderbolt port <em>may</em> be labeled with a small lightning-bolt logo, but that icon can sometimes be used to signal that that port can be used for charging, too. If nothing else, a USB-C dongle/hub will always work with a USB-C port. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-still-dont-understand-what-the-difference-is-between-usb-c-and-thunderbolt-how-does-it-all-work\">I still don&rsquo;t understand what the difference is between USB-C and Thunderbolt. How does it all work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>USB ports have been around for years. USB-C replaced USB-A (the square port) because USB-C was more versatile: the port connector was both reversible and allowed for higher speeds. USB-C ports can be rated for either 5Gbps or 10Gbps, just like a normal USB-A port. Some USB-C ports connect to a Thunderbolt chip inside your laptop, though, and this allows the port to run at a higher 40Gbps speed. Physically, the connector looks exactly the same. It&rsquo;s just what it can do that&rsquo;s different.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-the-difference-between-a-usb-c-hub-and-a-thunderbolt-dock\">What&rsquo;s the difference between a USB-C hub and a Thunderbolt dock?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Speed and features. A USB-C hub connects to a single 4K (or 1080p) display, and provides a mix of ports: USB-A, SD card slots, and so on. You can usually plug your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C power cable (if it uses one) right into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Thunderbolt dock supplies even more bandwidth for more ports. There are two key differences: It has enough bandwidth to drive a pair of 4K displays, and many docks come with their own power supply that can charge your laptop as well as your phone. All that occurs via the Thunderbolt cable that connects your laptop to the dock.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-laptop-has-usb4-not-thunderbolt-can-i-use-a-thunderbolt-dock\">My laptop has USB4, not Thunderbolt. Can I use a Thunderbolt dock?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Yes and no. Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB4 all run at 40Gbps across the same connector. USB4 is identical to Thunderbolt 4. But if your laptop runs USB4, it won&rsquo;t &ldquo;understand&rdquo; Thunderbolt 3 protocols. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB4 laptops are still extremely rare, and have an AMD Ryzen chip inside.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">5.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-thunderbolt-4-better-than-thunderbolt-3\">Is Thunderbolt 4 better than Thunderbolt 3?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Physically, they use the same USB-C cable. Functionally, they&rsquo;re <em>almost</em> the same. Thunderbolt 4 was released almost as a patch to Thunderbolt 3, ensuring that everything worked properly. If your laptop has Thunderbolt, you should probably be able to buy either a Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4 dock without any problems. Since Thunderbolt 3 is being phased out, you&rsquo;ll probably find more discounts on the older Thunderbolt 3 hardware. (For the gory details, see our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">best Thunderbolt docks</a>.)</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">6.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-own-a-desktop-pc-do-i-need-a-thunderbolt-dock\">I own a desktop PC. Do I need a Thunderbolt dock?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Possibly. Historically, the back of a desktop has been chock-full of I/O ports, especially DIY models that you build yourself. Desktops usually have extra room for internal SSDs, SD cards, and so on. However, if your desktop lacks these things, and includes an external Thunderbolt port, you can always add these additional components externally via Thunderbolt. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">7.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"some-of-these-docks-have-had-bad-reviews-on-shopping-sites-what-gives\">Some of these docks have had bad reviews on shopping sites. What gives?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Read the user reviews closely. While Macs adopted Thunderbolt first, some of the Apple M1 silicon couldn&rsquo;t keep up with Intel Thunderbolt controllers used by Windows PCs, and the Apple MacOS experience suffered as a result. If a Windows user complains, pay attention; otherwise, you can dismiss them.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This roundup was updated on July 12 with the latest Prime Day deals.</em></p>\n\nComputer Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1983354/prime-day-thunderbolt-docks-and-usb-c-hubs-deals-july-12-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T07:23:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best Prime Day deals on SSD & storage, July 12", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Another summer, another Prime Day sale&mdash;but it&rsquo;s almost over.

Solid-state drives have particularly hefty discounts this year, with some positively jaw-dropping. All our recommended deals are all-time low prices (or very near it).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the best deals, you&rsquo;ll need an Amazon Prime subscription, as they&rsquo;re only available to members.

Now you can snag both 2.5-inch and M.2 models for even <em>lower</em> prices. Not too long ago, a good 1TB M.2 Gen 4 SSD would cost you a little over $100. But at the moment, you can snag a great one for as little as $50. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note:</em> Unless listed otherwise, the warranty for these SSDs is five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"internal-2-5-inch-sata-ssd-deals\">Internal 2.5-inch SATA SSD deals</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Samsung 870 EVO\" class=\"wp-image-1945714\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/samsung-870-evo-sata-ssd-primary-100873962-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-500GB-Internal-MZ-77E500B-AM/dp/B08QBMD6P4/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samsung 870 Evo</a>, 500GB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD &ndash; <strong>$30 (24% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-MX500-NAND-SATA-Internal/dp/B078211KBB/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crucial MX500</a>, 1TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD &ndash; <strong>$48 (52% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GB8S6R3/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">PNY CS900</a>, 2TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD, 3-year warranty &ndash; <strong>$62 (31% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-BX500-NAND-2-5-Inch-Internal/dp/B07YD5F561/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crucial BX500</a>, 2TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD, 3-year warranty &ndash; <strong>$76 (24% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Inch-Internal-MZ-77E2T0B-AM/dp/B08QB93S6R/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samsung 870 Evo</a>, 2TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD &ndash; <strong>$100 (17% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-MX500-NAND-Internal-560MB/dp/B09FRRWVWX/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crucial MX500</a>, 4TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD &ndash; <strong>$165 (53% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Inch-Internal-MZ-77E1T0B-AM/dp/B08QBL36GF/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samsung 870 Evo</a>, 4TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD &ndash; <strong>$170 (31% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089C3TZL9/&amp;xcust=2-1-393625-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samsung 870 Qvo</a>, 8TB 2.5&Prime; SATA SSD &ndash; <strong>$320 (30% off)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crucial MX500 is a favorite among SATA SSDs, and for good reason&mdash;not only do you get solid performance, but it&rsquo;s incredibly affordable.

Even before the big sales began, SSDs cost much less. A 1TB drive that might have been $100 during Black Friday is now often found for around $80 (or 20 percent lower than before). And during Prime Day, those prices have tumbled even further, slicing yet another $20 to $30 off the price. It&rsquo;s a great time to pick one up if you&rsquo;ve been wanting to expand your storage!</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-an-ssd-better-than-hdd\">Is an SSD better than HDD?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>SSDs are faster and take less room in a PC than a hard-disk drive (HDD), which gives them a strong advantage. If you only have one storage drive in your PC, it should ideally be an SSD so you get faster boot times and quicker access to your files. A HDD as your primary drive will feel much slower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HDD still have their advantages. First, they&rsquo;re much cheaper. The going price of a 2TB HDD is about the same as the <em>sale</em> price for a 1TB SSD. You also can get them in higher capacities than SSDs. If you work with huge files, you can pick up an 18TB or 20TB HDD (and as mentioned, since HDD cost less, you&rsquo;ll spend as much or even less as a 4TB SSD). f you need secondary storage and you don&rsquo;t need it to be fast, HDD are a fantastic option.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-i-know-if-an-ssd-deal-is-good\">How do I know if an SSD deal is good?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the guideline we use for picking deals: First, it should be for an SSD that performs well (or in select cases, performs well for its MSRP), and is a reasonable price when not on sale. The discount should also be significant for that particular model. Ex: For SSDs that almost never go on sale, a reduction of $5 to $10 is already hefty. For others, that might be closer to $20 to $30. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, expect to pick up high-performing drives at an all-time low (or very close to that) during Prime Day. Ignore the options that don&rsquo;t meet this criteria.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nTechnology Industry</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/393625/prime-day-ssd-deals-july-12-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-12T07:05:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
