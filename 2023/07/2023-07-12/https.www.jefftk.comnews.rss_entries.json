This works, except that my hands are often busy\nplaying instruments when I want to change something.  I already have a\nmicrophone in front of my mouth running to a computer, which I use for\nmy whistle-controlled bass synthesizer: could I use speech\nrecognition?\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAnother way to look at this is that a lot of my exploration here has\nbeen finding some way to play bass and mandolin at the same time:\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-synth\">whistle bass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/chording-bass\">bass pedals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/simultaneous-footbass-and-footdrums\">bass and drum\npedals</a>.  With speech recognition I could <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/calling-chords\">call chords</a> to the computer!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm currently running on a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/\">Raspberry\nPi 3B</a>. I tried <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper\">OpenAI's Whisper</a> and then\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp\">the C++ port</a>\n(which <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/166\">should\nwork on the 4B), and then the much older software </a><a href=\"https://github.com/julius-speech/julius\">Julius</a> but my Pi 3B\ncouldn't handle real time with any of these. Is there some existing\nsoftware that would be a good fit for this?  People were running\nspeech recognition back when this computer would have been top of the\nline.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm also considering giving up on the idea of using speech: all I\nreally need is some sound I can make consistently enough that the\ncomputer can recognize.  I'm already running a system that can mostly\ndecode whistling, so maybe I should figure out how to phrase my\ncommands as simple whistle patterns?  I'm a bit nervous about doing\nthis while playing, though, since unless I choose patterns that can\nsound musical in any key it's going to be pretty hard to combine with\nplaying something else.  Maybe alternating low and high notes, but I\ncan choose which notes in response to the key?\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02XcB6U96Yk1EfT9aE2QSooQ2JwMRsgGfQgbhZq1HJd2rRxbDChxo8DUY4a8B8FE74l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110700988967477273\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/lightweight-minimal-speech-recognition", "date_published": "2023-07-12T08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
