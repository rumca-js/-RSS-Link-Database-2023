They are not fussy eaters; they eat any antigen.\n\nThe person now enjoys \u2018learned innate immunity\u2019\n\nAs bacteria and viruses are eaten and internally digested in the upper part of the lungs, they are dead, so cannot migrate down to infect the alveoli, the gaseous exchange structures.\n\nAs the alveoli are not infected, they do not become inflamed, therefore they do not fill up with inflammatory fluid leading to a consolidated pneumonia\n\nAs these thin-walled alveoli are not infected, the viruses and bacteria are not present, so do not migrate into the blood leading to systemic illness.\n\nTherefore, in short, the person stays well\n\nAs the T cells are very powerful stimulants of immunity and inflammation, we do not want them hanging around for a long time, therefore they are short lived in the lungs\n\nHowever, the neutrophils they have stimulated self-perpetuate over a longer period of time (probably about 10 months)\n\nThis means the upper airways are patrolled and protected for months after an episode of T cell stimulation\n\nAs the upper airways are kept clear of viruses and bacteria the lower airways are protected from descending infection\n\nTherefore, infections such as influenza or covid may present as mild or even asymptomatic\n\nSuch a protected person is therefore able to \u2018compartmentalise\u2019 the infection in the upper airways, preventing it from descending to the lower alveoli\n\nPhysiologically, this system is protective but imperfect, for example a lot of the bacteria are digested in the stomach\n\nThis means some people will be well protected from severe disease after covid or influenza infection, while others are not\n\nGiving an optimised strain of Haemophilus influenzae as an Immunobiotic can enhance the efficiency of this natural physiological system\n\nThe administered Haemophilus influenzae is killed, so cannot reproduce to cause disease\n\nThe administered Haemophilus influenzae is enteric coated, so it will be protected as it passes through the stomach, meaning it will reach the small intestine in large numbers\n\nThis will provide lots of stimulation to the Peyer\u2019s patches\n\nThis is not a vaccination, it is an augmentation of a completely natural physiological system\n\nA tablet could probably be taken before every winter as an OTC (over the counter medication)\n\nMillions of acute exacerbations (going to the lungs) could be prevented\n\nThe tablet would cost very little as an OTC, it\u2019s just dead bugs\n\nFree textbook download, https://drjohncampbell.co.uk/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cfvdG5FU8", "date_published": "2023-07-12T13:13:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/O6cfvdG5FU8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
