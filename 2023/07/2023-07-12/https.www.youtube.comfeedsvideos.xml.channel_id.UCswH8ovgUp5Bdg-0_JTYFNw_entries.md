With Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger shedding light on the Censorship Industrial Complex, we are witnessing its global impact unfold. That’s why in our discussion, we will delve into the EU Commissioner’s statement, highlighting how Social Media “Didn’t Do Enough” to censor French riot posts.
