Today, I've laid out the techniques, strategies, tools, and hacks I‚Äôve learned over my many years as a software developer. And specifically, I'm using all of these right now to work on a special project you'll see come to light here shortly. I've pulled in the sources and science behind these things to really show what they can do for you and help you level up as a programmer.

And most of all, as previously stated, they make coding even more fun than it already is. This is what you will find in this video.
