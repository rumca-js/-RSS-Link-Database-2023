Growing up in the olden days, you could only get membership depending on what company you worked for. I know <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/24/costcos-buck-fifty-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-went-viral-and-became-a-t-shirt.html\" target=\"_blank\">people are obsessed with Costco's hot dogs</a>. And it makes me giggle that the BJ's by me is next to a Hooters. But can you imagine any store deciding to no longer carry Bud Light? Let alone a major retailer like this? That is how bad and how much of a colossal f*ck up this has been for the company.</p><p>If true (the company didn't respond to Newsweek and I'm just here for the content), Bud Light has gone from being the most iconic beer in America to no longer being sold in stores. Costco thinks the real estate would be more profitable if they replaced Bud Light with a 96-pack of mac and cheese or a box of those cheap sweatshirts.</p><p>All because a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing\" target=\"_self\">now-disgraced marketing elitist lashed out at Bud Light customers as \"fratty\" and \"out of touch</a>. It was more  important to appeal to consumers who don't drink Bud Light out of hatred of the kinds of people who do drink Bud Light. This was three months and over twenty-billion dollars ago.</p><p>Now the beer is being removed from shelves because executives are too busy sticking their noses up at middle-class, blue-collar, rube America to say \"whoops, we f*cked up.\"</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

She also has a deadbeat for a dad, and Joe Biden as her Paw Paw. Pappy Biden has <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-granddaughter\" target=\"_blank\">gone to great lengths to make sure no one in his regime acknowledges his granddaughter's existence</a> as Hunter is seen partying in the White House with his other kids.</p><p>Oh, and the girl knows her father is Hunter Biden and her paternal grandfather is the president, who she speaks about often. A four-year-old girl knows that her grandpa -- the freakin' PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- wants nothing to do with her. That makes this resurfaced clip from the 2020 campaign all the more awkward. You'll always answer a call, Joe?</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1317966186907226113\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This video was released by the Biden campaign <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-twittter-gop-judiciary\" target=\"_blank\">three days after the Hunter Biden laptop story</a> (that they knew wasn't Russian disinformation). Joe knew of his seventh grandchild as an intern tweeted this on his behalf. But worse? They released of video of what a great grandfather Joe Biden was as part of his presidential campaign. This was to show how Joe Biden was a good person, contrasted with Donald Trump who was not.</p><p>And leave it to the usual suspects to defend Biden being a scumbag. The shrill harpies from \"The View\" had their fangs out, saying the GOP are the real villains for \"weaponizing\" Hunter. They also went so far as to call an OpEd writer from the New York Times \"MAGA\" for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/opinion/hunter-biden-child.html\" target=\"_blank\">writing that Joe looks like a jerk</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1678429048584773635\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then there is CNN. They went the \"Republicans seize\" route, while Dana Bash laments the ordeal damages \"the brand and the kind of person that we all know and believe Joe Biden to be.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1678481804796256256\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Riiiiiiight. That \"brand?\" It was all media concocted bullplop. This is who Joe Biden has always been. <a href=\"https://redstate.com/bonchie/2022/08/25/banana-republic-doj-charges-two-over-ashley-biden-diary-confirms-its-disturbing-allegations-exist-n617789\" target=\"_blank\">Ask his daughter Ashley</a>. And while \"what if it was Trump's kid\" is implied during all media coverage of Hunter Biden, let's spell it out here.</p><p>Say it was Eric Trump who knocked up his assistant, refused child support, forbid her from using the Trump last name, had to get dragged to court, and Donald Trump denied the girl existed while throwing it in her face by playing with his other grandkids. This would be all CNN talked about, and every Republican would be dragged on camera to comment on family values.</p><p>We know how this story will end too. October 18th, 2024. A few weeks before Election Day. Biden meeting and having a tea party with this girl as a cheap political stunt as the media praises how it proves what a good man he is. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
