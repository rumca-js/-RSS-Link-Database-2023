This week on Breakout, we discuss the recent updates on the Microsoft acquisition of Activision, and what we think that will look like should the CMA approve it. 

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
