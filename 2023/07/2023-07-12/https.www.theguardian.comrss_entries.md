<ul><li>World No 1 will face Daniil Medvedev after 7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-4 win</li><li>Alcaraz surprised by his ‘crazy’ progress on grass courts</li></ul><p>Throughout the first set of the first major meeting between the two brightest young players in men’s tennis, Carlos Alcaraz’s growing frustration was palpable. He was struggling just a little with his backhand, his return of serve wasn’t penetrating quite as well as normal and Holger Rune chased down all of his mediocre drop shots. The world No 1 gestured regularly to his box and, at times, roared to the skies.</p><p>Yet even as he briefly failed to match up to his stratospheric standards, Alcaraz was still supreme.

The first Wimbledon men’s quarter-final match in the open era between two players younger than 21 had rightfully commanded immense hype.

Article 5, which sets out the principle of collective defence – an attack on one is treated as an attack on all – works as a deterrent, not as a do-over.</p><p>Nor was there much prospect of this meeting even agreeing to a concrete timetable for membership afterwards.

And then she played Sally Reed <em>even further</em> in the future, stumbling haltingly towards some level of peace. Forget comedy or drama, or lead or supporting for that matter. In terms of sheer heft, of pure undiluted range, no working actor could touch Sarah Goldberg this year. That she’d be snubbed this year is no surprise – aside from one nomination early in Barry’s run, she has been consistently blanked – but the fact that she’ll never again earn a nomination for this incredible role is heartbreaking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/12/emmy-nominations-2023-snubs-surprises">Continue reading...</a>

However, the Sun is not alone in displaying a contradictory attitude towards children and young people. As a society, we profess to be child-centred, yet the UK has for the last 13 years voted for Conservative administrations that have systematically attacked and dismantled children’s services.</p><p>This can be seen by the treatment of children in care, the underfunding of children’s services, cuts to youth offending teams, poor teacher pay, crumbling school infrastructure, lack of access to mental health services, failure to tackle childhood obesity, muddled policy on school meals provision, open hostility to child migrants and, most importantly, the failure to at least provide our children with the legacy of a habitable planet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/12/if-only-care-as-much-young-people-bbc-presenter-case">Continue reading...</a>

## Another PMQs outing for deputy Dowden? Sunak must be quite the sadist | John Crace

<p>Long before the end, even his own MPs were going for him. Bloodsports are less cruel</p><p>Oliver Dowden’s reputation precedes him. You’d have thought there would be at least a niche appeal in watching the deputy prime minister die on his feet. The inadequate’s inadequate at work. If you can call it that. But we’ve actually gone well past that point. There were even fewer Tory backbenchers in the Commons for Oliver’s latest outing for prime minister’s questions than there had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/05/absentee-prime-minister-routinely-skips-parliamentary-scrutiny">last week</a>. And the sprinkling of cabinet ministers all looked as if they were there under duress. Their faces locked in a rictus of pain. The chronicle of their own deaths foretold.</p><p>This PMQs must surely be about as bad as it can get for Olly. Even if his material was better, he just can’t do it. The 1980s holiday camp entertainer being mercilessly ripped apart by an audience that’s bored out of its mind. Bloodsports are less cruel than leaving Dowden to fend for himself for half an hour. Long before the end, even his own MPs were going for him. They just couldn’t help themselves. This was group therapy turning into Lord of the Flies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/12/another-pmqs-outing-for-deputy-dowden-sunak-must-be-quite-the-sadist">Continue reading...</a>

And with the flourish of the opening bars, there is a frisson of sheer wonder that, more than four centuries on, the piece can still so enchant listeners, much as the legendary Orpheus singing to the accompaniment of his lyre.</p><p>It is a work ideally suited to <a href="https://www.lfo.org.uk/">Longborough</a>’s small-scale theatre and a principal attraction of Olivia Fuchs’s new staging is the presence in the raised pit of Adrian Chandler’s period-band <a href="https://www.laserenissima.co.uk/">La Serenissima</a>, with the outlines of harp and theorbo – exquisite playing from Oliver Wass and Lynda Sayce – always visible. But, to underline the timelessness of the story of love and loss, there are colourful revelries at the marriage of Orfeo and Euridice: electric guitars and a drum kit are brought on and Orfeo is revealed as lead singer of his own band. This wedding gig has only begun when the news comes that Euridice is dead from a snake bite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/12/orfeo-review-longborough-festival-opera-monteverdi-olivia-fuchs">Continue reading...</a>

I first discovered him at about 17, when I read his essay The Art of the Novel followed by his novel Slowness, which had just come out. (A book I ended up stealing from a friend’s apartment, I loved it so much.) He had been dramatically famous in the 1980s, so I associated him with the bookshelves of my parents’ generation, but these two almost miniature books were so funny and lucid and experimental and worldly that they seduced me entirely. This sensation of excitement and the contemporary never left me.</p><p>He came, of course, out of a specific historical moment. When he was young in the 1950s he was a member of the Communist party in Prague, but the horror of the Russian invasion of what was then Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the realisation that whatever utopian ideal of society he had envisaged would never be possible, led to his exclusion first from any form of work – banned by the totalitarian Communist authorities, he was eventually forced to live in the woods for a period – and then, ultimately, from his country. In 1975 he left Czechoslovakia for France, where he lived with his wife Vera until his death, becoming a Franco-Czech hybrid: a cross-border phenomenon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/milan-kundera-his-writing-vibrates-with-energy-adam-thirlwell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Elon Musk took over the platform, the downward slide was depressing. But then, the horror may always have been a big part of its appeal</p><p>“And he couldn’t do it. He could not fucking die. How could he leave? How could he go? Everything he hated was here.” The end of Philip Roth’s Sabbath’s Theater is a perfect distillation of how many of us felt about Twitter when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal">Elon Musk bought it</a> last October. But I didn’t know that from reading it, even though I have; I knew that because someone faster, smarter, probably younger, with a better memory (@hayleycampbell), put it on Twitter.</p><p>So even though everything I hate is there, so is a lot of what I love. My father never owned a TV, because he said every time you thought you were good at something – cooking, repartee, being alive – on the telly, there’d be someone who was better at it than you. I thought that was just an unlovely overhang of a 40s childhood: the whole point of repartee, and indeed cooking and being alive, is that the more people who can do it, the better. Also, I really wanted a TV.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/12/hate-twitter-elon-musk">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’ve never been one of the cool guys’: Rob Brydon on mortality, jealousy and writing to Kevin Costner

<p>In his new podcast, the best-connected man in showbusiness gently grills stars like Matthew MacFadyen and Noel Gallagher. So what has he learned about the secrets of success?</p><p>When he’s interviewing guests on his podcast, does Rob Brydon, I wonder, feel a twinge of professional jealousy? Talking to Matthew MacFadyen about Succession, or Steve Coogan or Mark Gatiss about their many projects? Jennifer Saunders or Alison Steadman or Kenneth Branagh? It’s not all comics and actors – Johnny Marr, Noel Gallagher and Chris Martin have all appeared on <a href="https://podtail.com/en/podcast/brydon/">Brydon &amp;</a>. “There’ll be occasional moments,” he admits, “but it will be something very specific, but not generally. I’m not a ‘grass is greener’ person. I’m a ‘look around you, this is good’ person.” He smiles. “I sometimes wish I were a bit more jealous actually, it might make me a bit more get-up-and-go.”</p><p>The podcast originated in lockdown, when a producer friend suggested he start a YouTube channel, interviewing famous friends (show me a better-connected man in showbiz). “It was something to do. It gave me a chance to be a little bit creative, to make something.” Spotify picked it up, and now the Amazon-owned podcast company Wondery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/12/ive-never-been-one-of-the-cool-guys-rob-brydon-on-mortality-jealousy-and-writing-to-kevin-costner">Continue reading...</a>

At just 51 years of age, yet with the disorderly, mythic bearing of someone many thousands of years older, this orotund, ginger-locked behemoth departed the world having refashioned the postwar vision of the English eccentric and irreversibly altered the path of British culture.</p><p>While his florid, stentorian contributions to Dadaist 60s trad-jazz mutilators the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band influenced everyone from the Beatles to Monty Python, a peripatetic path through the 70s saw him appear as the Master of Ceremonies on Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells and as a regular lyricist for Steve Winwood, while his 1978 solo LP, the grandiloquent, gothic spoken-word masterpiece that was Sir Henry at Rawlinson End found lifelong fans in both Jarvis Cocker and Stephen Fry, who declared Stanshall “one of the most talented and magnificent Englishmen ever to have drawn breath”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/12/on-best-behaviour-he-was-a-joy-the-lost-archive-of-english-pop-eccentric-vivian-stanshall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Volume of debris in the unexplored twilight zone is an ‘emerging threat’ to reefs already stressed by climate crisis, say scientists</p><p>No part of the planet is free of plastic waste, and coral reefs are no exception, but scientists have now made the discovery that the deeper the reef, the more plastic debris it is likely to have.</p><p>A study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06113-5">published in Nature</a> found that not only is every coral reef encumbered with plastic, but almost three-quarters of the larger items were from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/invisible-killer-ghost-fishing-gear-deadliest-marine-plastic">ghost gear</a>” – fishing paraphernalia such as ropes, lines and nets.

<p>The Czech author has died at the age of 94. Here are some of the most memorable quotes from interviews and articles over the course of his career</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/milan-kundera-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-author-dies-aged-94">• Milan Kundera: The Unbearable Lightness of Being author dies aged 94</a></p><p>When I was a little boy in short pants, I dreamed about a miraculous ointment that would make me invisible. Then I became an adult, began to write, and wanted to be successful. Now I’m successful and would like to have the ointment that would make me invisible.</p><p>For a writer, the experience of living in a number of countries is an enormous boon. You can only understand the world if you see it from several sides.</p><p>With the first story of Laughable Loves (I wrote it in 1959), I was certain of having ‘found myself’. I became a prose writer, a novelist, and I am nothing else. Since then, my aesthetic has known no transformations; it evolves, to use your word, linearly.</p><p>I lived in Czechoslovakia until I was 45. Given that my real career as a writer began when I was 30, I can say that the larger part of my creative life will take place in France. I am much more tied to France than is thought.</p><p>To be a writer does not mean to preach a truth, it means to discover a truth.</p><p>The stupidity of people comes from having an answer to everything. The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything</p><p>A novel does not assert anything; a novel searches and poses questions. I don’t know whether my nation will perish and I don’t know which of my characters is right. I invent stories, confront one with another, and by this means I ask questions.</p><p>I think that the importance of the novel in European culture has been enormous; European man is unthinkable without the novel, he was created by it. For centuries it was the first thing one read. The love of adventure, which is so European, adventure understood as a value. If you say, ‘I lived my life without adventure,’ then it’s a failure, right? Well, it’s the novel that impressed upon us this love of adventure.</p><p>There are four great novelists: Kafka, Broch, Musil, Gombrowicz. I call them the “pleiad” of central Europe’s great novelists</p><p>An author, once quoted by a journalist, is no longer master of his word … And this, of course, is unacceptable.</p><p>These days, when sexuality is no longer taboo, mere description, mere sexual confession, has become noticeably boring. How dated Lawrence seems, or even Henry Miller, with his lyricism of obscenity!</p><p>It is the sex of the novels and not that of their authors that must interest us. All great novels, all true novels are bisexual. This is to say that they express both a feminine and a masculine vision of the world. The sex of the authors as physical people is their private affair.</p><p>It would be senseless to try to draw its borders exactly. Central Europe is not a state: it is a culture or a fate.</p><p>In fact, what does Europe mean to a Hungarian, a Czech, a Pole? For a thousand of years their nations have belonged to the part of Europe rooted in Roman Christianity. They have participated in every period of its history. For them, the word ‘Europe’ does not represent a phenomenon of geography but a spiritual notion.</p><p>It’s not Russia but communism that deprives nations of their essence.</p><p>I learned the value of humour during the time of Stalinist terror … A sense of humour was a trustworthy sign of recognition.

Matthew McConaughey travels to an alien planet knowing that, for every hour he spends on its surface, seven years will pass on Earth. But something goes wrong, and the mission takes longer than he anticipated. He leaves the planet to discover that 23 Earth years have passed. His children, who he left behind on Earth, are now adults who have grown up without him. Anyway, it breaks my heart because it’s basically the same as being a non-Australian Bluey fan.</p><p>Ten Bluey episodes have appeared on Disney+ this morning. If you have children of the appropriate age, you will have been aware of this for weeks. And if you weren’t, you can all but guarantee that these episodes will play on an unbroken loop throughout the summer holidays.

<p>Raised on punk, the artist tried to channel that aggression into painting – but instead found himself arriving at a quiet, reflective style that has more in common with Nick Drake</p><p><a href="https://www.theapproach.co.uk/artists/mike-silva">Mike Silva</a>’s paintings are steeped in melancholy. Painted in oil, the defining motif of his latest exhibition is windows, each with the London light pouring through them. In Owen’s room, long swathes of orange curtain do little to keep the room dark, though the sky outside is gloomy. In Window sill with plant and camera, the dappled shadows of the foliage outside cast shadows over the ledge on which sit a mug (the tea or coffee drained), a succulent and an SLR camera. The last object provides a clue to Silva’s source material: a huge photographic archive of old homes and former lovers, which the artist keeps haphazardly stored in boxes and uses for inspiration.</p><p>“I moved around a lot as a kid, I was saying goodbyes to friends, and taking photographs was always an acknowledgment of that,” Silva says. He was born in Sweden to a Sinhalese father and an English mother, and the family moving to Canada when he was very young. Mike and his mother arrived in south-east England after his parents split up. While studying art at Middlesex University in his early 20s, Silva flitted between the local punk scene and the gay scene in London. “It’s not that gay relationships are inherently less stable, but for me everything was very fluid,” he says. “There’s cruising, saunas, and that kind of thing. That informs how you meet people and how you view relationships, and the transient nature of those relationships.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/12/mike-silva-i-wanted-to-paint-with-the-viscerality-of-black-flag-but-i-cant-do-it">Continue reading...</a>

Then, four years later, she sat out the next World Cup, in France, nursing a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, before knee ligament damage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/england-women-provisional-squad-euros-jordan-nobbs-steph-houghton-fran-kirby">ruled her out of Euro 2022</a>.</p><p>“It means that, now, I’m still waking up with the butterfly feeling,” says the 30-year-old Aston Villa midfielder. “Everyone dreams of playing in major tournaments.

<p>These moments of precious fresh awareness can be found in authors from Oliver Sacks to Ottessa Moshfegh and Franz Kafka</p><p>In Salvador Salvador Dalí’s painting Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening, a floating woman <a href="https://www.museothyssen.org/en/collection/artists/dali-salvador/dream-caused-flight-bee-around-pomegranate-second-waking">lies beneath</a> a bayonet-wielding tiger who, along with its friend, has recently pounced from the mouth of a fish, which has itself just emerged from an exploding pomegranate. By the woman’s face, at the bottom of the painting, a tiny bee circles a smaller pomegranate. Her awakening will wrench the woman from one reality into another.</p><p>The following books contain both literal and metaphorical awakenings. As well as the disparate states of dreaming and wakefulness, they also illuminate what connects the two. Laughter awakens the unconscious, music awakens history. From psychoactive drugs to linguistic invention to sheer rage, in literature it seems there are as many bees and pomegranates as there are dreamers. And reading offers its own awakening, too – you look up from the page, the words still buzzing, and the world seems new. It’s interesting how many of these books are also thinking about authenticity – how to be yourself, how to stay awake to the uniqueness of others and the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/top-10-books-about-awakenings-anna-metcalfe-awakenings">Continue reading...</a>

We begin proceedings on Court 1, where frankly you feel for the balls, who are in for a painful afternoon. In her fourth-round match against Marra Andreeva, Madison Keys found herself just in time, adapting tactics on the fly to overpower her brilliant opponent and dodge the embarrassment of being the person whose defeat allowed a 16-year-old into the last eight. But today, she meets the player most similar to herself who is also better than she is – Aryna Sabalenka hits it even harder, has an even better touch, and in Melbourne, finally held it down when it mattered to win her first Slam. However, her semi-final collapse at Roland-Garros reminded us that, despite her progress, she is who she is, so a battle of devastating power, beauty and frailty awaits.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/12/wimbledon-tennis-jabeur-rybakina-alcaraz-medvedev-sabalenka-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The quest for the ultimate raspberry panna cotta may be over, with the dairy, fruit, and flavourings tested to the nth by our resident perfectionist</p><p>This column covered panna cotta, the classic Piedmontese dessert, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/aug/25/how-to-make-perfect-panna-cotta">back in 2011</a>, when your humble columnist was still as fresh and lovely as a buttermilk jelly, if somewhat less wobbly. While I stand by that recipe – it’s a banger, as we definitely wouldn’t have said a decade ago – there’s room for at least one more in my life, particularly if it involves one of my favourite summer fruits.</p><p>I concede that raspberries are so perfect straight from the plant (or punnet) that there often seems little point in meddling further, but if you, like me, enjoy their perfumed sweetness gilded with thick cream, then a panna cotta is the logical next step, once you’ve eaten your fill. Their acid edge stops the combination from cloying, as can happen with more straightforwardly sugary fruits, and lifts the dish from the merely rich to the realms of rich and interesting, a bit like an Italian philanthropist who also happens to know quite a lot about wine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/12/how-to-make-the-perfect-raspberry-panna-cotta-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this week’s newsletter: A new report says 87% of games released before 2010 are no longer commercially available – and it’s a huge loss for the art form</p><p>• <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/nov/24/sign-up-for-pushing-buttons-keza-macdonalds-weekly-look-at-the-world-of-gaming">Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>Grim news heralded in a report published this week by the Video Game History Foundation, which claims that 87% of video games released before 2010 <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/">are no longer commercially available</a>. This equates to a lacuna of tens of thousands of works, many of which represent key moments in the medium’s evolution. It’s an excruciating loss of source material for the people who worked on these games, as well as for historians and archivists, for gem-hunters and for any younger player who might wish to enjoy interactive works created in different socio-political circumstances, against different technological constraints and fashions or within different market conditions.</p><p>The void is not unique to video games – there are books that are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66131911">no longer published</a> even in digital form, some films can only be watched on defunct formats, others disappear from streaming services <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-streaming-crater-tax-rort-scam-writeoff-delete-1850604861">mere months after release</a> – but the scale of the video game void is unmatched in other media. According to the report, less than 5% of games from the Commodore 64 are still available today. The 13% availability rate of classic video games is one percentage point less than that of American silent films. As the foundation’s co-director <a href="https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/1678422092042366976">Frank Cifaldi tweeted</a>: “Nine out of 10 classic video games are no longer available to consumers, and that number is unlikely to get any better. It’s practically guaranteed that something you grew up with is gone, for ever.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/12/pushing-buttons-playing-old-video-games">Continue reading...</a>

Happy birthday, Bobo</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryBellCalcio">Henry Bell</a> for <a href="https://www.gentlemanultra.com/">The Gentleman Ultra</a></p><p>Christian Vieri turns 50 today. He scored many wonderful hat-tricks, including one on his debut for Inter in 1999, so what better way to celebrate the big man than picking a <em>tripletta</em> of his three best goals.</p><p>For many Italian football fanatics of the Channel 4 generation, he sums up why we fell in love with the game. His physical presence, commitment and ability to bully defenders into submission places him in a lineage of great Italian No 9s such as Gigi Riva, while his ability to score long-range strikes and turn past defenders added a sprinkling of gold dust. He also excelled in an era when managers often played two strikers up front so memories of Vieri also evoke his partnerships with Marcelo Salas, Álvaro Recoba, Hernán Crespo and Roberto Baggio.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2023/jul/12/christian-vieri-50-celebrating-greatest-goals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chinese writer’s first book in English explores the power and limitations of language with an appealing quickness and wit</p><p>In Elsewhere’s first story, a young fiction writer named Pigeon falls in with a band of drunken poets after a disastrous earthquake. She tells them that she finds poetry difficult to understand. But it’s not about understanding, they tell her. Fiction, they say, is like describing a delicious meal without being able to eat it. But poetry? “We eat up the food and shit it out later,” one poet says. “And the shit is poetry.”</p><p>Yan Ge’s English debut is preoccupied with language, its failures, and its relationship to human emotions and the raw reality – the “food” – of life. A prolific Chinese writer, Yan began writing in English after moving to Ireland in 2015. Her stories’ protagonists, based in the UK, Ireland or China, are often similarly peripatetic; we follow them as they travel to Stockholm, New York City, Chiang Mai.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/elsewhere-by-yan-ge-review-a-visceral-english-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian-made version has ditched many of the story’s features to focus on a bland hero who looks like a boyband member</p><p>This is nominally an adaptation of the 19th-century picaresque children’s story by Italian writer Carlo Collodi that has yielded all manner of adaptations on stage and screen, from Walt Disney’s haunting if bowdlerised 1940 version to Guillermo del Toro’s exquisite, politicised 2022 Oscar winner. Collodi’s original story is so weird and rich it can accommodate a lot of free interpretation and tinkering, but this Russian-made version – first emerging in 2021 but on the UK distribution shelf since the Ukrainian invasion and consequent soft ban on Russian cultural imports – arguably goes right off the beaten track, up the mountain and away to lands unknown. Despite the subtitle, this is truly a sub-par story.</p><p>For starters, the puppet hero of this competently animated if blandly designed feature doesn’t even look like he’s made of wood, even before he gets brought to life by a visiting fairy who drops by to get pick up her repaired wand from craftsman Geppetto. Instead, he looks like a lesser singer in a cartoon boyband: blond-haired, blue-eyed and with perfectly bland features. There’s just the faintest suggestion of wood grain in his flawless complexion when shown really close. And yet he has the whiny, decidedly adult voice (in its dubbed English version) of 55-year-old actor-comedian Pauly Shore, who channels teenage rather than boyish desire for pretty blue-haired acrobatic chanteuse Bella, whom he meets while press-ganged into a circus run by her father Mojafocco.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/12/pinocchio-a-true-story-review-russian-animation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The rapper denies his private Christian academy was a ‘dystopian institution’.

The part of your mind that tells you: “Nah, I’m not really qualified for this,” is disabled and you become convinced that being filthy rich makes you an expert in everything. There are plenty of examples of “money brain” out there, but one of the more glaring is Kanye West. Ye, as West likes to be known, seems to think that his success in music and fashion makes him qualified to do everything from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/10/kanye-west-president-2020-is-it-real" title="">run for president</a> to set up a school.</p><p>We all know how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/04/kanye-west-announces-kanye-2024-as-he-fails-to-make-election-impact" title="">his presidential aspirations went</a>, but we are only just discovering quite how bizarre the disgraced musician’s foray into education was.

<p>The Czech novelist found himself silenced by the communist regime at home, but achieved international fame with playfully philosophical fiction</p><p>Czech writer Milan Kundera, who explored being and betrayal over half a century in poems, plays, essays and novels including The Unbearable Lightness of Being, has died aged 94 after a prolonged illness, Anna Mrazova, spokeswoman for the Milan Kundera Library has confirmed.</p><p>Famously leaving his homeland for France in 1975 after being expelled from the Czechoslovakian Communist party for “anti-communist activities”, Kundera spent 40 years living in exile in Paris after his Czech citizenship was revoked in 1979. There he wrote his most famous works, including Nesnesitelná lehkost bytí (The Unbearable Lightness of Being) and later left behind his mother tongue to write novels in French, beginning with 1993’s La lenteur (Slowness) and his final novel, 2014’s The Festival of Insignificance.

<p>The stress of trying to get Taylor Swift tickets this week led to feelings of anger and loathing. It’s all part of a music culture that feels increasingly greedy and combative </p><p>This week, hundreds of thousands of Taylor Swift fans around the UK, Ireland and Europe have been desperately trying to get tickets to the Eras tour, which kicks off in Paris in May 2024. When tickets for North America dates went on sale last year, it was a disaster: demand was so high that systems crashed, the sale had to be stopped and ticket prices spiralled out of control due to Ticketmaster’s “dynamic pricing” whereby costs increase with demand. Clearly Swift’s team and Ticketmaster have worked hard to try to prevent the same thing happening here but it has involved dizzying bureaucracy: presale codes, waitlists and special ballots for general sale.</p><p>In our dedicated Swiftageddon group chat, we had been discussing strategy and making spreadsheets for weeks, ensuring we had credit cards and log-ins for every possible date we could make, though there was no indication in advance of how much tickets would be. Presale opened, and we dutifully took our places in the lobby, the waiting room and then the hundred-thousand-deep queue in which places were randomly assigned (military-grade planning only gets you so far).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/12/from-nightmare-ticketing-to-online-abuse-being-a-pop-fan-is-becoming-miserable">Continue reading...</a>

## I travelled around Britain on low-carbon transport. It was creaky – but magical | Sophie Pavelle

<p>Even train delays and waits for buses felt worth it for the space to think and environmental benefits. Our public transport is full of untapped potential</p><p>The water was clear enough to notice the sun’s rays touch the seabed. Seconds later, the scene was repeated in light piercing the canopy of a beech tree, spotlighting patches of dry earth below. I stared through the salt-smeared window of the train as it raced north on Devon’s famous Riviera line. In the carriage my skin felt weathered and dry. I hadn’t washed my hair for days. Anyone might think I had been to a festival; but having spent the best part of the week on a boat<strong> </strong>doing<strong> </strong>research for a project, I felt like the sea, and preferred it. One arm was stretched across my 65-litre rucksack as I faced the window, its bulky weight my temporary home, my office, my explanation.</p><p>When I challenged myself to travel by low-carbon routes during the writing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/24/forget-me-not-sophie-pavelle-review-britain-undersung-species-hares-salmon-climate-crisis">my book </a>on species in Britain affected by climate change, I experienced the best and worst of our lethargic – yet still often charming – transit network.<strong> </strong>When public transport works, it really works. As a woman in my 20s, travelling long-distance, especially solo by train and bike, is empowering. Personal space, silence and time are street sweepers on the brain. A stillness descends in the wake of a slower pace, and you’ve forgotten how much you needed it. Yes, you tire, but it’s a tiredness that tells me I’ve gone and <em>done</em> <em>something</em>. I’m not in traffic. I don’t need help with my bag. No, I am not lonely. Nothing is wrong.</p><p>Sophie Pavelle is the author of Forget me Not: Finding the forgotten species of climate-change Britain</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/12/britain-low-carbon-transport-environment-public">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anton Corbijn directs this enjoyable documentary about the design duo who created extraordinary images for Pink Floyd, 10cc, Led Zeppelin and more</p><p>Photographer and film-maker Anton Corbijn is the very best person to direct this very enjoyable documentary about design outfit Hipgnosis and its dynamic co-founders Aubrey “Po” Powell and Storm Thorgerson, the creative powerhouse who virtually invented the concept of the album cover as a vital artform; they worked for Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Paul McCartney and Wings, 10cc and others, when the vinyl rock industry was in its 70s pomp. They devised extraordinary images which were enigmatic, monolithic, audacious, funny, surreal, hip and gnomic and conceived albums as an unacknowledged multi-media experience: you gazed at the cover while the LP was on the turntable. Hipgnosis’s staggering location work in deserts and wildernesses and with flying pigs over London landmarks virtually made them pioneers of land art, the medium which grew up at about the same countercultural time.</p><p>Hipgnosis had its roots in 1960s Cambridge where long-haired, dreamy-eyed idealists all hung out creatively, smoking dope, and Powell and Thorgerson went on to have a lifelong association dating from that time with Pink Floyd, whose music probably inspired their brilliant shapeshifting ideas most directly. To my shame, I realise now that I never knew that the “burning man” in the dreamlike picture that went on the Wish You Were Here cover really was burning: a stunt man doing the most dangerous work of his career.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/12/squaring-the-circle-the-story-of-hipgnosis-review-anton-corbijn-pink-floyd">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The dream is in place, the field has been built. Major League Cricket finally launches on Thursday outside Dallas. But will the people come? </p><p>For decades, cricket’s powers have dreamed of making it big in America. Starting on Thursday the grandest, richest attempt yet to get Americans hooked on cricket will begin in a converted baseball stadium (capacity: 7,200) on the outskirts of Dallas. Major League Cricket, as the new competition is known, has money: close to $50m already spent, with another $130m on the way. It has wealthy patrons: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella leads a roll call of leading Indian-American tech executives who’ve signed up to throw cash at the new venture. It has the blessing of an International Cricket Council desperate to lift its sport’s profile in America ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. It has powerful allies: four Indian Premier League franchises and two state cricket bodies from Australia have signed on as either full owners or operational partners for the fledgling league’s six founding teams. It has a slot in the international cricket calendar that’s relatively uncrowded, with only the men’s and women’s Ashes as real competition for the committed global cricket fan’s attention. It has a list of team names that combine, in delightfully unbound American style, the patriotic (Washington Freedom) and ecological (Seattle Orcas) with the borrowed-from-the-IPL nonsensical (MI New York).</p><p>Most importantly it has players, and some extremely capable ones at that: sprinkled among the little-known local talents (Corne Dry, anyone?) the new competition features the genuine stardust of Wanindu Hasaranga, Kagiso Rabada, Tim David and Anrich Nortje, among many other established T20 internationals who’ve made the trek out to the suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to help launch cricket’s latest big shot at success in America. But will Major League Cricket have any viewers? Will the American public thrill to the spectacle of a beefy heave through midwicket from Aaron Finch? Will it learn to lament, as millions of cricket fans throughout the world already do, the lost opportunities of a wasted PowerPlay? Will it grow to appreciate the finer points of an Adam Zampa strangler down leg side, or a topless cameo from Faf du Plessis on the player balcony? The final touches – the marking of the boundary barrier, the laying of the turf wicket, the engineering of the outfield – have just been applied to convert the former home ground of now-defunct off-brand baseball side the Texas AirHogs into an international-grade cricket venue. The dream is in place, the field has been built. But will they come?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/12/major-league-cricket-preview-united-states">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A simple cloth sack brings to life generations of enslaved women and reminds us of the enduring power of love</p><p>Ever since narratives of the enslaved began to be published in the 18th century, writers have wrestled with how to convey the visceral brutality of slavery without robbing the subjects of their humanity. But how, especially in nonfiction, is it possible to imagine that caged world in the absence of first-hand accounts? On plantations, a literate population was considered a threat, and in America laws were passed to prohibit the enslaved from reading and writing. Apart from a few written testimonies by women such as Harriet Jacobs, who escaped and bore witness, there has been an immense silence.</p><p>The Harvard historian Tiya Miles has taken a bold and innovative approach to this problem in All That She Carried, a bestseller when it came out in the US last year, now published for the first time in Britain. The story begins in South Carolina in 1852, with a stark description of the dread that would have been familiar to every enslaved woman: “Rose was in existential distress that fateful winter when her would-be earthly master, Robert Martin, passed away.” Rose had no agency over her future and knew what was coming: the auction block that would separate her from her nine-year-old daughter, Ashley, for the rest of their lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/all-that-she-carried-by-tiya-miles-review-social-fabric">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From bent cops to blaxploitation, this tale of corruption in 70s New York combines the energy of a crime thriller and the sharp wit of social satire</p><p>In his last novel, 2021’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/23/harlem-shuffle-by-colson-whitehead-review-a-delicious-heist-novel" title="">Harlem Shuffle</a>, Colson Whitehead introduced us to Ray Carney, a vibrant creation of fierce contradictions. A family man and respectable businessman, he’s constantly drawn back into the nefarious legacy of his own father’s villainy. As a furniture salesman and occasional receiver of stolen goods, his dual occupations reflect these polarities. His legitimate enterprise is one of modish interiors and the promise of comfort; his crooked side hustle plays out in the harsh exterior and threat of the street. And he’s not just holding it together in his own being – he’s somehow making sense of the chaotic environment of 1960s New York. “He was a wall between the criminal world and the straight world,” it is stated early on, “necessary, bearing the load.”</p><p>This compelling juxtaposition intensifies as we move into the 1970s with Whitehead’s follow-up, Crook Manifesto. Carney has been going straight: “four years of honest and rewarding work in home furnishings”, as the period style moves from sedate mid-century modern into the mad extremes of that most garish of decades. The city beyond is spiralling into an apocalyptic decline, nearing bankruptcy with staggering levels of crime, corruption and political violence. But it’s a simple act of parental generosity that gets him into real trouble once more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/crook-manifesto-by-colson-whitehead-review-a-dazzling-sequel-to-harlem-shuffle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Locked down in London, I was lonely and underfed. I longed for the communal meals at my Mum and Dad’s home in Delhi, so I embarked on some disastrous and delicious dinners of my own</p><p>When the UK’s last lockdown lifted in 2021, and a return to normal life beckoned, I was distraught. For the past few years, I had at least been saved from the pressure of having plans and being with someone for Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Even though I had moved to London two years ago, the pandemic hadn’t made it easy to find friends in a new city. To escape my loneliness over the holidays, I decided to fly back to see my parents in Delhi. Unlike me, they had plans to ring in the new year – they were hosting a little dinner party for their friends.</p><p>In the isolation of the pandemic, far away from my family, I had forgotten how warm and inviting my parents’ home was. The kitchen was the heart of our family – cups of chai<em> </em>constantly marched out alongside trays of biscuits and conversation, yet another samosa<em> </em>being offered even though our plates and stomachs were full, a fridge that always had something nice to eat and a table that had a place for everyone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/12/a-moment-that-changed-me-my-parents-had-a-dinner-party-and-it-inspired-me-to-find-and-feed-new-friends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>News anchor Kumar stays quietly courageous amid nationalist hysteria in Vinay Shukla’s tense documentary – but its final note of hope has been undermined by recent events</p><p>Events have overtaken this sombre documentary, which, though interesting and relevant, doesn’t encompass important recent developments. It is about the sinister pro-Modi nationalist hysteria in India that infected the country’s quasi-Fox TV channels, and one moderate journalist who politely stood against it: NDTV’s news anchor Ravish Kumar. This was especially true in the unbearably tense period before the 2019 election in which Modi was victorious, when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/26/pakistan-india-jets-breached-ceasefire-line-kashmir-bomb">Indian government launched an airstrike on Balakot in Pakistan</a> in retaliation for a terrorist attack on an Indian police convoy in Pulwama in Kashmir.</p><p>Indian TV’s shrill pundits denounced traitors everywhere, and this documentary by Vinay Shukla details Kumar’s quiet courage in just carrying on with his reports on the widespread poverty that Modi was ignoring (preferring to stoke diversionary fascist fervour), keeping his cool amid a barrage of abuse and death threats. The pressure on NDTV and its journalists is shown getting worse, with someone having a gloomy leaving party with cake almost every week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/12/while-we-watched-review-ravish-kumar-india-modi-ndtv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The photographer travelled the West Midlands in a campervan to document the workers risking their lives to toil in steel mills, coal mines and blast furnaces</p><p>One day in 1978, <a href="https://archive.wiedel-photo-library.com/index">Janine Wiedel</a> found hell a few streets south of Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham. “The noise was deafening. The heat was intense. I’d never seen anything like it,” she says. In her native US, she’d photographed Black Panthers and student protests at Berkeley in California, but neither prepared her for this industrial inferno, on which one-time West Midlands resident JRR Tolkien reputedly based Mordor.</p><p>Inside Smiths’ Drop Forgings were nine 35-hundredweight hammers worked by some of the filthiest men she’d ever seen. The forge had been in operation since 1910 and was typical of the small Birmingham firms that made the city proudly define itself not just as the workshop of the world but as the city of a thousand trades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/12/janine-wiedel-images-of-flaming-1970s-industrial-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Their relationship with booze has taken these friends and broadcasters on very different journeys. Here they discuss what constitutes heavy drinking, successful moderation – and when it is time to give up altogether<br /></p><p>Adrian Chiles, author, broadcaster, columnist, and for these purposes, longtime dispenser of searching but practical thoughts on booze, met comedian John Robins when they were making adjacent shows on Radio 5 Live. After Chiles made his documentary, Drinkers Like Me, at the start of 2021, the pair got talking.</p><p>Robins – whose new comedy show Howl explores his relationship with alcohol and his journey into sobriety – was experimenting with drinking in moderation; Chiles was writing his book, The Good Drinker: How I Learned to Love Drinking Less. Adrian interviews John in the hardback, and they’re both enthusiastic, freshly minted moderate drinkers. By the time the paperback was coming out, though, John was teetotal. What follows is the conversation they had about how their paths crossed and, later, branched apart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/12/moderation-or-total-abstinence-adrian-chiles-and-john-robins-talk-honestly-about-their-drinking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Wagner forces turned their guns against Russian forces it led to panic in Moscow. But after the coup was aborted and its leader accused of treachery, it was business as usual for the group’s lucrative Africa operations. Pjotr Sauer and Jason Burke report</p><p>Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march on Moscow caused panic and led Vladimir Putin to go on the airways to condemn the head of Wagner. He decried the ‘treachery’ and vowed to ‘liquidate’ what remained of Wagner – and many assumed Prigozhin himself.</p><p>In the days that followed, something more subtle happened. As our correspondent <strong>Pjotr Sauer </strong>tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal</strong>, while Russian state TV has called Prigozhin corrupt and traitorous, it emerged that he had been invited for a face-to-face meeting with the Russian president.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/12/putin-v-prigozhin-is-wagner-too-valuable-to-crush-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
