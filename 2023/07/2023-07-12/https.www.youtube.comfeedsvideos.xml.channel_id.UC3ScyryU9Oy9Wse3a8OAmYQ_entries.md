It’s been described as the most serious threat to Vladimir Putin’s leadership in years: the armed rebellion on June 23, led by the Russian mercenary Wagner Group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Prigozhin and his forces ultimately stood down, but the mutiny raised new questions about the strength of Putin’s grip on power amid discontent around his troubled war on Ukraine.
Veteran filmmaker Michael Kirk and his team examine the story of Putin’s rise, his clashes at home and abroad, how his troubled Ukraine war led to this moment of uncertainty and what it could portend for the country, the region and the world.
