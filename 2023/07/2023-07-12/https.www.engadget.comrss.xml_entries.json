[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "macOS Sonoma preview: For the widget wonks", "description": "<p>It's easy to look at every new macOS release and wonder where the upgrades actually are. Unlike iOS and iPadOS, Apple doesn't often push for bold and visible changes on the desktop (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macos-ventura-preview-stage-manager-173031552.html\">last year's Stage Manager</a> was a surprising addition, but even that was brought over from iPadOS). Instead, most of the enhancements to the Mac experience are usually under the hood \u2014 don't forget, the company completely rebuilt macOS for its new Apple Silicon chips.</p><p>So it goes with macOS Sonoma, an update that doesn't truly make itself known until you see its new high-res video screensavers (something the Apple TV has done for years), or try to drag over a widget to your desktop. If <em>widgets</em> are a highlight in a new OS, you know it's a slow year.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This isn't a knock against Sonoma, exactly. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Apple is saving its bolder UI concepts for iPhones, iPads, and the Vision Pro. Macs are computers that don't even have touchscreens yet! Playing it safe makes the most sense.</p><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sonoma lock screen with live wallpaper\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c7c73a30-20eb-11ee-abff-105ea076d638\" style=\"height: 1250px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>So let's talk about screensavers. While not exactly Earth shattering, Apple's new aerial footage looks great in macOS Sonoma. It adds a dose of elegance to an already refined operating system \u2014 having footage from Hawaii or Patagonia pop up in the middle of the workday is like a mini-vacation. (Don't judge me, I know it sounds sad.)</p><p>I also liked being able to turn aerial screensavers into wallpapers. Doing so lets them play as videos on your lock screen, but once you log in, the video slows down and smoothly settles on a static image. I'm sure that's done to avoid motion sickness from some users, but I'm hoping Apple or some intrepid hacker unlocks the ability to let the video constantly play on your desktop. I'll risk a bit of squeamishness for more of that slick drone footage.</p><section><img alt=\"macOS Sonoma on several Macs\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c7c73a31-20eb-11ee-9d0e-cee39a766466\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /></section><p>As for the widgets, well... they're widgets. On your desktop. It's a pretty straightforward concept. I'll admit, being able to quickly see the weather or an upcoming appointment under my windows is easier than popping open the notification tray. But it's not exactly a killer feature. But hey, if you really do love these things, at least you can easily bring over your iOS widgets. And if you also have an iPad, I'm sure it'll be helpful to have all of your widgety goodness across your devices.</p><p>Beyond those two features, Sonoma's upgrades are a bit more subtle. If you jump into a video chat, you can use hand gestures to kick off some fun special effects. A double thumbs up triggers fireworks behind you, while a peace sign surrounds you with floating balloons. They're certainly fun at first, but thankfully you can turn them off easily for more professional video chats.</p><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sonoma FaceTime hand gesture\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c7c73a32-20eb-11ee-bf53-a461307241a6\" style=\"height: 1229px; width: 2490px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The new presenter overlay features, on the other hand, are a lot more useful. In supported screen sharing apps, like FaceTime or Zoom, you can place a small or large window of yourself on top of whatever window you're sharing. It's the sort of feature I'm surprised Apple didn't roll out sooner, as it can help to humanize boring video chats. Instead of just sharing a spreadsheet, for example, your colleagues can also see what you think of your data as you're discussing it.</p><p>Here are a few other Sonoma updates to keep an eye out for:</p><ul><li><p>Safari supports profiles for different use cases. For example, one profile could house all of the bookmarks and settings that you need for work.</p></li><li><p>You can also turn any website into a web app with Safari. It's the perfect way to read Engadget without any distractions!</p></li><li><p>Stickers and Memoji now synchronize with all of your Apple devices over iCloud.</p></li><li><p>A new Game Mode will prioritize resources while gaming. I didn't notice any major differences with Apple Arcade titles during my testing, though.</p></li><li><p>Autocorrect should be better too, but again, I didn't notice any major changes.</p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/macos-sonoma-preview-widgets-screen-savers-210036486.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/macos-sonoma-preview-widgets-screen-savers-210036486.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T21:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Samsung Frame smart TVs drop to as low as $548 for Prime Day 2023", "description": "<p>You'll want to act quickly if you're shopping for a truly stand-out TV set. Samsung's 2023 Frame TVs are on sale at Amazon for Prime Day, and the discounts are particularly steep for some models.

Mount it on your wall (the kit is thankfully included) and it blends into the decor using either professional images or your own. You'll usually have to subscribe to the Samsung Art Store or buy individual works if you want classics, but it could be worthwhile to have a Van Gogh or Vermeer in your living room. The 2023 models have a matte finish that cuts reflections and gives them a canvas-like appearance.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>These aren't Samsung's highest-end TVs, so you won't get the crispness of an 8K panel or the vivid contrast <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2023-qd-oled-t-vs-will-hit-up-to-2000-nits-of-peak-brightness-090401455.html\">of OLED</a>. They still offer an accurate 4K picture, however, and they're full-featured sets with voice assistant control, a game mode and a wide range of apps. At these prices, they're easy choices if you either want a wall-mounted TV or were otherwise resigned to buying an ordinary screen.</p><p><strong><em>Your Prime Day Shopping Guide</em></strong><em>: See all of our</em><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/topics/prime-day/\"><em> Prime Day</em></a><em> coverage.

The information was also collected from taxpayers using TaxAct\u2019s Free File service \u2014 which is through a partnership with the IRS.</p><p>Congressional investigators listed in the report include Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Rep.

The company is introducing a feature that allows Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One players to capture a 60-second video clip of abusive or inappropriate voice chat and submit it for moderators to review.</p><p>&quot;This feature is purpose-built to support the broadest arena of in-game interactions between players and works across thousands of games that offer in-game multiplayer voice chat, including Xbox 360 backward-compatible titles,&quot; Xbox Player Services corporate vice-president Dave McCarthy <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/12/xbox-voice-reporting-feature/\">wrote in a blog post.</a></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Microsoft designed the tool for both ease of use and to minimize the impact on gameplay. When you capture a clip for reporting, it will stay on your Xbox for &quot;24 online hours.&quot; You'll have the option to submit it right away or wait until you finish your gaming session. You'll get a reminder before the 24 hours are up. If you opt not to report the clip, your Xbox will automatically delete it.</p><p>No one else will have access to the clip unless you submit it. &quot;Xbox is not saving or uploading any voice clips without you, the player, choosing to start the reporting process,&quot; McCarthy said. Any clips you capture through the tool will not appear in your recent captures and it won't be possible to download, share or modify them. These clips will only be used for moderation purposes. After the safety team has reviewed your report, you'll receive a notification to tell you whether it took action against an abusive player.</p><p>An Xbox spokesperson told Engadget the safety team will use &quot;a range of moderation tools that leverage AI and human moderators&quot; to analyze the clips. Moderators will review audio and video to determine if someone has violated the community standards.</p><p>At the outset, the reactive voice reporting system allows a player to report up to three individuals at once. &quot;If a moderator cannot determine who was talking at a given time and associate it with the reported Xbox Live player, the report will be closed as unactionable, no enforcement action will be taken and the captured video will be deleted within 90 days,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>The advent of cross-platform play muddies the waters here too. The safety team won't take any action in cases of inappropriate voice chat from those who are on other platforms. &quot;The announced reactive voice moderation feature is specifically for reporting Xbox players to the Xbox Safety Team,&quot; the spokesperson noted.</p><p>It's encouraging to see Xbox tackle the problem of toxic voice chat at a platform-wide level. The PlayStation 5 has had a similar feature <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ps5-voice-chat-recording-moderation-213415981.html\">since it debuted in 2020</a>.</p><p>Several studios have adopted similar approaches in their own games. In 2021, Riot said it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-monitor-valorant-voice-chat-154944022.html\">record <em>Valorant</em> voice communications</a> but only listen to them when a report was filed. It started <a href=\"https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/announcements/valorant-voice-evaluation-update/\">testing the system</a> last July.</p><p>Ahead of <em>Overwatch 2</em> going live last October, Blizzard said it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-link-phone-account-voice-chat-ai-defense-matrix-214034957.html\">automatically transcribe</a> a recording of a match's voice chat following a report from a player. The company's chat review tools analyze the transcription for signs of abusive behavior and both the recording and text file are deleted. (Of note, Blizzard and <em>Overwatch 2</em> may <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-uk-regulators-agree-to-pause-legal-fight-to-negotiate-activision-acquisition-165856989.html\">soon be Microsoft properties.</a>)</p><p>To begin with, Xbox's voice reporting feature will be available for Alpha and Alpha-skip Xbox Insiders in the English-speaking markets of the US, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Microsoft hopes that insiders will provide feedback to help improve this feature. It plans to continue investing in voice moderation and to support more languages.

Its iPhone 14 series has glittery cases, floral print covers and everything in between, but the one that stuck out most to me is the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYXNlLU1hdGUtQkxPWC1pUGhvbmUtQ2FzZS1BbnRpLVNjcmF0Y2gvZHAvQjBCOUM5V1I2WD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1iei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzI1YzA3NDctZjg3ZC00YzhmLWEzODItNGI3NmY5MWIyMjY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAW0ZzD6qhpYxd4MdjJTBZAdZLeLk2F2CajirMTZWW_2o&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCase-Mate-BLOX-iPhone-Case-Anti-Scratch%2Fdp%2FB0B9C9WR6X\">Blox line</a>. These cases have squared-off corners that give your iPhone a modern, blocky look. Combine that with their bright neon colors and you\u2019ll likely never have to ask your friends where your phone is again \u2013 you won\u2019t miss it. I also appreciate that the Blox cases are fingerprint-resistant, provide protection against 10-foot drops and have built-in magnetics for MagSafe accessory compatibility.</p><h2>Incipio Organicore</h2><p></p><p>You have many more options today than you did previously if you want an environmentally friendly phone case. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2luY2lwaW8uY29tL3BhZ2VzL29yZ2FuaWNvcmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImMyNWMwNzQ3LWY4N2QtNGM4Zi1hMzgyLTRiNzZmOTFiMjI2NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXwYdO_SLOmtjNvNeB3_jHL3Riwlk5md_e2F2MJ6hyTk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fincipio.com%2Fpages%2Forganicore\">Incipio\u2019s Organicore line</a> is one of our favorites because its high-quality cases are 100 percent compostable, provide decent protection and the latest models are MagSafe compatible, too. They come in clear and opaque designs, and the latter has a buttery texture that makes the case feel more luxurious than you\u2019d think. Organicore cases will protect your iPhone from drops up to eight feet, and their raised edges will be the first line of defense your phone has against accidental dings and bumps. MagSafe accessories work fine, but we did find that the opaque case wasn\u2019t the grippiest out of the ones we tested.

It\u2019s one of the thinnest and lightest cases we tried, but it does have four layers of protection: a soft microfiber lining, a sturdy PC back, TPU bumpers and a vegan leather exterior. Since the company doesn\u2019t boast a certain level of drop protection, this slim case is a good option for those that care more about aesthetics and case design, but also want a simple, protective layer standing between their iPhone and hard concrete. As the name suggests, you can use the Kajuk Mag with MagSafe accessories, and it even has an accessory hole built in, for those that want to attach charms, straps and other things.</p><h2>Peak Design Everyday Case</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8747aed1-6586-46eb-856d-c95a5318901b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peak+Design&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NzQ3YWVkMS02NTg2LTQ2ZWItODU2ZC1jOTVhNTMxODkwMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVha2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZXZlcnlkYXktY2FzZT92YXJpYW50PTM5ODIxOTgwMjM3OTAxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMjVjMDc0Ny1mODdkLTRjOGYtYTM4Mi00Yjc2ZjkxYjIyNjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX5ifLUyfUt5JYRsrM2sAYxGfwrk4bb1Z_W1ibk9z5By&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Feveryday-case%3Fvariant%3D39821980237901\">Peak Design\u2019s Everyday Case</a> not only looks attractive, but it turns your phone into a bunch of different things when you pair it with any of the accessories in the company\u2019s mobile ecosystem. We like its protective rubberized bumper and nylon shell, and its SlimLink connector sits in the middle of the case\u2019s back, waiting for whichever accessory you need that day. The company\u2019s mobile tripod is one of our favorites for taking better photos with your phone, but also propping it up any which way you need. Commuters can opt for the dashboard mount to keep their phone within reach while driving, or the bike mount when you need to follow directions on its screen. If you use your phone for everything and want a case that can support all of those different activities, this one is a good option.</p><h2>Pelican Shield Kevlar</h2><p></p><p>Maybe you work outdoors, go camping frequently or are simply a bit clumsier than most.

They\u2019re admittedly bulky, but that\u2019s how they safeguard your phone from up to 21-foot drops. The 5mm raised bumper provides shock-absorbing safety for the rear camera lens array as well as the handset as a whole, plus the secure edges and dustproof cover keep all unwanted debris out. Plus, these rugged cases are MagSafe compatible, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice convenience when opting for as much protection as possible.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T18:30:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Roblox' is coming to Meta Quest VR headsets", "description": "<p>The immensely popular online game creation platform/thingamajig <em>Roblox</em> is coming to VR, thanks to the Meta Quest platform.

That isn't guaranteed to happen with Autocado when humans are still necessary, but the long-term future isn't quite so clear.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chipotles-guacamole-robot-is-cursed-to-peel-and-core-avocados-for-eternity-174027901.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/chipotles-guacamole-robot-is-cursed-to-peel-and-core-avocados-for-eternity-174027901.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T17:40:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "iPadOS 17 preview: A smoother multitasking experience (for those who really need it)", "description": "<p>Just a year ago, Apple announced the biggest software update the iPad has ever seen. iPadOS 16 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ipad-os-16-public-beta-preview-193037237.html\">ushered in Stage Manager</a>, a completely revamped multitasking mode that brought overlapping, resizable windows to the iPad, along with robust external display support (provided you <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-16-stage-manager-for-older-i-pads-171218520.html\">had compatible hardware</a>).</p><p>There were a host of other new features, as usual, but Stage Manager in particular brought the iPad closer than ever to a Mac or Windows PC experience. iPadOS 17, on the other hand, is a more subtle update. That\u2019s usually the case, with one year bringing big new features and the next offering tweaks and stability improvements. And while there isn\u2019t one singular headline feature in iPadOS 17, the totality of myriad smaller changes definitely adds up. I\u2019ve been using iPadOS 17 in beta for a few weeks, and now that the public beta is live, you can do the same.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A note on stability: Even though this is a public beta, the \u201cbeta\u201d still applies. It\u2019s probably not ideal to install on a machine you rely on for daily use, as you\u2019ll surely run into some bugs and crashes. And it\u2019s always a bit of a crapshoot how well third-party apps work on a beta. All that said, I haven\u2019t run into anything particularly severe. Occasionally, an app will just toss me back to the Home Screen, or you might find some weird UI issues where apps haven\u2019t quite been optimized yet. But over the last few years, Apple has gained a reputation for releasing public betas in solid, usable states, and that\u2019s the case here as well. Just remember that \u201cdowngrading\u201d to iPadOS 16 final releases <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjAzMjgyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZDZhN2FlMi0yMzdhLTQ5YTQtYTFiZC03NzQ4MmUyOTNjOWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXc_Nhucucnb6yTlHnN5StE9KVXmYMtXz_iEdJtxRMSg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT203282\">isn\u2019t exactly a simple process</a>.</p><h2>Stage Manager updates</h2><h2></h2><p>While Stage Manager opened up some major new multitasking features for the iPad, it was also a lot more rigid than the windows management system you\u2019d find on a Mac. This year, Apple has tweaked things to make it easier to set up your ideal workspace. Previously, apps would snap to a handful of predetermined sizes to fit your display, and the specific placement of each individual window was up to iPadOS to decide. Now, app windows have a lot more granularity in how you can size and place them. For example, I can make the Notes app that I\u2019m typing into right now a tiny window half of my screen\u2019s height and about a quarter of its width. From there, I can make it as tall or wide as I want; there are still specific sizes that it snaps to, but there\u2019s far more flexibility than there was last year.</p><figure><img alt=\"GIF showing resizable windows in Stage Manager on iPadOS 17\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/8adeef20-20cb-11ee-bfda-595b1356e62a\" style=\"height: 480px; width: 640px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>iPadOS 17 is also a lot more flexible about how you arrange multiple apps, something that wasn\u2019t the case last year. When you added a second app to a space, iPadOS automatically decided where the two windows should go. You could resize them both as you wanted, but it was basically impossible to show two apps side-by-side without any overlap, for example. That\u2019s no longer the case. Now, it\u2019s a simple matter of grabbing the top of a window and dropping it where you want.</p><p>These basic controls have been available on Windows and macOS for decades, but it\u2019s still a new paradigm for the iPad. I\u2019m definitely glad that Apple seems to be trusting its users more by giving them more flexibility rather than letting iPadOS make major decisions about how you lay out your screen. Stage Manager is still somewhat of a niche feature, given that lots of iPads can\u2019t run it, but people who want to push their iPads further will definitely appreciate these updates.</p><h2>Lock Screen and interactive widgets</h2><h2></h2><p>Probably the most obvious user-facing update is the revamped Lock Screen. It should also be very familiar, because Apple first introduced it on the iPhone a year ago. Basically, you can now set up multiple lock screens, each with its own wallpaper, widgets and design elements (like fonts and color filters). To jump between different styles you\u2019ve set up, you can just press and hold on the Lock Screen and then choose what suits you. Finally, you can also set a specific Focus setting for each Lock Screen, so you can set up a whole profile for work mode or vacation time.</p><p>There\u2019s also a great new wallpaper picker \u2013 this, too, borrowed from the iPhone. There are some new styles here specifically for the iPad, though, including striking views of every planet in the solar system stem. And in a nod to the iPad\u2019s history, they brought back the original Pyramid Lake wallpaper (<a href=\"https://osxdaily.com/2010/02/16/the-ipad-background-picture/\">shot by photographer Richard Misrach</a>) from the first iPad back in 2010. I\u2019m a sucker for nostalgia and love the photo, so Apple won me over here.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPadOS 17 home screen\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/df4dbe30-20ce-11ee-bfbf-07b2bdc6ee9b\" style=\"height: 2048px; width: 2732px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the aesthetics, having widgets on the Lock Screen makes the iPad\u2019s large display more useful \u2014 there\u2019s a ton of space, so why not show more than just the time and your notifications? But widgets are getting a big improvement beyond just being able to drop them on the Lock Screen. At long last, they\u2019re interactive. That means if you have a Reminders widget, you can tap a specific item to check it off without having to open the app. Or, with the Apple Music widget, you can automatically start playing an album or playlist.</p><p>Previously, widgets let you tap specific parts to jump to that place in the app, so they weren\u2019t just static information displays, but this takes their functionality a lot further. We\u2019re going to need third-party developers to add this functionality to their widgets to really take full advantage of the feature, but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how apps incorporate it when iPadOS 17 is out in the wild.</p><h2>Health</h2><h2></h2><p>There aren\u2019t many Apple apps on the iPhone that you can\u2019t also get on the iPad. Health was one, but that\u2019s been remedied this year. It\u2019s just what you\u2019d expect: Health data tracked from your iPhone and Apple Watch is available for you to review on the iPad, with a design that\u2019s better suited to the larger screen. While there\u2019s nothing revolutionary here, the Health app can include so much data that it\u2019s actually a bit easier to dig through everything here.</p><p>Everything syncs from your iPhone, but so far that sync process hasn\u2019t been the most reliable. Even though the Health app on my iPad says it synced two minutes ago, it hasn't pulled in updated steps data since 7AM this morning. My activity rings from my Apple Watch are similarly hours out of date. I wager this will get settled before iPadOS 17 is finished, though.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPadOS 17 Health app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/f6420e20-20ce-11ee-87f9-7541d0276c39\" style=\"height: 2048px; width: 2732px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple announced a handful of features relating to mental health as part of the latest iPad and iOS updates, including a dedicated journaling app and mood trackers in the health app. While the journal app isn\u2019t coming until \u201clater this year,\u201d sometime after iPadOS 17 and iOS 17 officially launch, the mood tracking features are available in the Health app. I\u2019ve long been in the habit of tracking my daily mood, and this isn\u2019t a bad place to do it. It\u2019s pretty simple, with a slider to pick your overall mood and a few follow-up questions, but the idea is for it to be quick and painless so you do it repeatedly. There\u2019s also a mental health questionnaire you can take that claims to assess your anxiety and depression levels that reminds me of questions I\u2019ve answered from a doctor in the past. I did reach out to Apple to find out where they\u2019re sourcing this set of questions from so we can know more about their validity and approach.</p><h2>Safari, Messages, Notes and more</h2><h2></h2><p>As always, Apple\u2019s core apps are getting lots of little but potentially meaningful updates. Safari\u2019s biggest new feature is arguably the ability to set up multiple profiles. Each profile can access all your bookmarks, saved passwords and reading list, but it keeps things like logins to sites and tab groups separate. I did the basic \u201cpersonal and work\u201d profiles, with logins to work-specific tools kept separate. It\u2019s also pretty easy to move things between profiles if you accidentally open windows in your personal profile that you\u2019d rather have with your work tabs. And, of course, this all syncs via iCloud to other devices \u2014 I have the macOS Sonoma beta installed as well, and things were shared seamlessly.</p><p>Messages is possibly Apple\u2019s most important app, and every year it gets usability tweaks and new features. A bunch of those are focused around audio messages, which I haven\u2019t really had a chance to check out much. One thing I do like, though, is that replying in a thread is a lot easier than it used to be. Now, swiping right on a message opens the reply interface, which is definitely quicker than holding down on a message, waiting for the menu to pop up and selecting the \u201creply\u201d option.</p><p>The search experience has also been upgraded with filters. For example, you can first search for a specific contact, and then search just their conversation for keywords. The results naturally include specific messages as well as relevant links, images and more.</p><p>But the update I\u2019ve had the most fun with so far is definitely Stickers. You can now easily create your own stickers from images in your photo gallery. If you tap on a subject in a photo, you can pull it out from the background and save it as a sticker, so you can easily use it again. Live Photos can be turned into live stickers \u2014 and let me tell you, the live sticker I made of my dog laying down is adorable and I will spam everyone with it.</p><p>Your own stickers can live alongside sticker packs from other apps, emoji and Memoji. And the stickers you\u2019ve created will be available to use in third-party apps, as well. Basically, stickers you create as well as those from apps should be easier to share outside of just Apple\u2019s Messages app, which is a nice change from the previously walled-off approach Apple took.</p><p>Notes, quietly one of Apple\u2019s most useful apps, has gotten more improvements this year too. You can now embed PDFs right into a Notes doc and they display full-width, so you can easily browse through a PDF and make notes on it below. You can also naturally mark it up with an Apple Pencil or collaborate on it in a note shared with other people.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPadOS 17 Notes app with PDFs\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/cbb9bad0-20cf-11ee-bdf8-e483c489387e\" style=\"height: 2048px; width: 2732px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>PDF support system-wide has been improved. For example, opening a PDF document from the Files app will open it in its own window, provided you\u2019re running Stage Manager. This makes it easier to put a PDF side-by-side with another app while still having full access to the Files app. Auto-filling fields in PDFs has also been improved system-wide; Apple says it\u2019s using an on-device neural network to identify documents that have fields that need to be filled in across the system, and you\u2019ll be able to AutoFill details like names and addresses the same way you can on websites.</p><p>Another useful trick is the ability to link directly to a specific note in your library. Other note-taking apps like Bear have had this feature for a while, but it\u2019s undeniably handy to link related notes together so you can easily jump between them instead of having to go back to the sidebar and search for the one you\u2019re looking for.</p><h2>The rest</h2><h2></h2><p>This just scratches the surface of iPadOS 17. Lots of new features, like the changes to Messages, work best when other people you know are also running the new software. And other things, like the journal app, won\u2019t be available to try for months to come. Finally, there are plenty of iOS 17 features like Facetime updates and a smarter keyboard will be in iPadOS 17 as well. If you want to give this all a shot months before Apple finalizes everything, you can install the iPadOS 17 public beta now. But as always, think hard about whether you\u2019re up for some instability before you take the plunge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ipados-17-preview-a-smoother-multitasking-experience-for-those-who-really-need-it-173022677.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ipados-17-preview-a-smoother-multitasking-experience-for-those-who-really-need-it-173022677.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T17:30:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "How to install the iOS 17 public beta", "description": "<p>Gone are the days when you contort yourself to try the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html\"><ins>latest iOS version</ins></a> before its official debut. Apple has released the iOS 17 public beta, and it\u2019s easy to install the preview on your iPhone. So long as you know what you\u2019re getting into, you can explore major features months before the finished software arrives this fall. These instructions should also work for the iPadOS 17 beta, too.</p><h2>Before you start: iOS 17 beta requirements and risks</h2><figure><img alt=\"iOS 17 contact cards and stickers in Messages\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/72480830-20ca-11ee-b9bb-c84e91683140\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><h2></h2><p>To begin, you\u2019ll need to be sure your hardware supports iOS 17. Apple requires at least a 2018 or newer iPhone, including the XR, XS and second-generation SE. Notably, this release <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-17-drops-support-for-iphone-8-and-x-200718892.html\"><ins>ends support for the iPhone 8 and X</ins></a> \u2014 if you own one of these older models, you\u2019ll simply have to buy a new handset to run the updated platform.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The iPadOS 17 public beta clearly has different requirements. You\u2019ll need at least a sixth-generation iPad, third-generation iPad Air, fifth-generation iPad mini, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, any 11-inch iPad Pro or the second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro.</p><p>Whatever you\u2019re installing, remember that this is pre-release code. The iOS 17 public beta is better-suited to everyday use than earlier developer versions, but you may still run into bugs, odd behavior or app compatibility issues. You\u2019ll want to wait for the finished software if your phone has apps or data you simply can\u2019t afford to lose. If you\u2019re willing to accept the risks, it\u2019s still a very good idea to backup your data through iTunes or a cloud service (such as iCloud) in case you need to restore your phone at some stage.</p><h2>How to install the iOS 17 public beta</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"NameDrop in iOS 17\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/db41b330-20cb-11ee-b79e-445d851bfb78\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Be sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 16.4 or newer, as you\u2019ll need it to walk through the public beta installation process.

You just have to visit Settings, tap General, tap Software Update and then select a new Beta Updates item underneath Automatic Updates. Be sure that the Apple ID displayed at the bottom is the one you used to join the beta program. You should see the option to install \u201ciOS 17 Public Beta\u201d from that screen. Go back one screen and you should get an offer to download and install the beta.</p><p>As with any other iOS upgrade, the installation may take a few minutes to complete and will involve restarts.

However, not all of those elements will be available in the public beta.</p><p>Most improvements are intact. Notably, there\u2019s a redesigned phone experience that includes custom contact cards and live voicemail transcripts. A Messages app revamp includes a new sticker interface, simpler replies, audio message transcripts and location-based check-ins. Sharing is easier as well. You can share content just by bringing iPhones close together, and you can now share contacts. The keyboard has improved autocorrection, predictions and voice dictation. You can document your mood in the Health app, and StandBy turns your iPhone into an ad hoc smart display.</p><p>However, a few features won\u2019t be present until after iOS 17 arrives. The life-logging Journal app isn\u2019t in the public beta. You\u2019ll also have to wait for AirDrop transfers that continue over the internet, and collaborative Apple Music playlists aren\u2019t yet ready. We\u2019d also expect Apple to make minor interface tweaks and additions in later revisions, and it won\u2019t be surprising if one or two iOS 17 features will only be announced alongside future iPhones that use them.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-17-public-beta-172319006.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-17-public-beta-172319006.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T17:23:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Elon Musk\u2019s new AI company aims \u2018to understand the true nature of the universe\u2019", "description": "<p>Elon Musk has a new AI company.

Although Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-increasing-xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-prices-in-most-countries-182635680.html\"><ins>just increased</ins></a> the price of the subscription service, it includes access to every single Xbox first-party game on the day it's released. The library includes an extensive selection of third-party games as well, meaning players have hundreds of titles at their fingertips. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/capcoms-exoprimal-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-soon-143520052.html\"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto V</ins></em></a> just returned to the service, for one thing.</p><p>Opt for a Game Pass Ultimate membership and you'll get all of that along with access to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-november-10-december-135548415.html\"><ins>a bunch more EA titles</ins></a> and the option to play the service's games via the cloud and on PC.

You have limited options for expanding the storage, as Microsoft opted for a proprietary card that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/western-digitals-first-xbox-series-xs-storage-cards-start-at-80-171723507.html\"><ins>only two manufacturers are making</ins></a>. The PlayStation 5 has a more immersive controller due to features like adaptive triggers and the remarkable haptic feedback. Unless you have a PS5 as well, you'll also need to consider which of each console's exclusive games are more compelling to you before taking the plunge on a Series X.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-xbox-series-x-is-50-off-right-now-143604090.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-xbox-series-x-is-50-off-right-now-143604090.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T14:36:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best Amazon Prime Day phone deals for 2023", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/\">Amazon Prime Day</a> is looking like a good time to pick up a new phone, so long as you prefer Android.

It has just about everything you\u2019d expect from a high-end handheld: a gorgeous 6.8-inch OLED display with a fast 120Hz refresh rate, a snappy Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, top-notch build quality, more than all-day battery life and a powerful camera system. It comes with an S Pen stylus, and Samsung will support the device with five years of security patches and four years of OS updates. You may need to put in a little extra work to unlock the full potential of those cameras, and Samsung\u2019s software is still somewhat bloaty, but the S23 Ultra is a decidedly premium device. The biggest knock against it is that it\u2019s expensive, but this deal helps with that.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy S23</h2><p></p><p>The base <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJMUDJQWTZOP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFwaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzk4MjUwYTYtZTNmOS00OWU4LTkzYzYtYjhhZGQ4YzY0MWVhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS1ZgdMVGeFoqzpRVobt2hGN56PFQtzsfm9Jn8V7MWEt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BLP2PY6N\">Galaxy S23</a> is down to $600 for a 128GB model and $660 for a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJMUDNaTVpQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFwaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzk4MjUwYTYtZTNmOS00OWU4LTkzYzYtYjhhZGQ4YzY0MWVhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARbkdAyhYej8r3miDdJ-ILpw0-X93WjsfSXMqehC9tjV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BLP3ZMZP\">256GB unit</a>. Both of these deals represent a roughly $140 discount and match the lowest prices we\u2019ve tracked. The Galaxy S23 trails the S23 Ultra in terms of battery life, camera hardware and charging speed, but that still leaves room for a fast and vibrant device that\u2019ll receive updates for years to come. Apart from the lower cost, the biggest reason to consider it is because it\u2019s one of the smallest high-end phones on the market, with a 6.1-inch display that should be easy for many people to use with one hand.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy S23+</h2><p></p><p>The 256GB <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJMUDRKOVJSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFwaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzk4MjUwYTYtZTNmOS00OWU4LTkzYzYtYjhhZGQ4YzY0MWVhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXpfJlQmLAbv_ML3-r_TnKye4P8smeROIl3YPaXy3xnD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BLP4J9RR\">Samsung Galaxy S23+</a> is available for $750, which is another all-time low for an unlocked model and about $150 off this model\u2019s typical going rate.

The S23+ is the middle child between the Galaxy S23 and S23 Ultra. It has the same processor, triple-camera system and 1080p resolution as the former, but it offers a larger 6.6-inch OLED display without adding the weight of the latter. It also supports faster charging speeds than the S23, with a maximum of 45W instead of 25W. Deputy Editor Cherlynn Low gave the Galaxy S23+ <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html\">a score of 86</a> in her review this past February.</p><h2>Google Pixel 7 Pro</h2><p></p><p>Google\u2019s trio of Pixel 7 phones are also discounted for Prime Day.

That said, the S23 Ultra\u2019s raw performance is still better for more involved tasks like gaming, and it outpaces Google\u2019s flagship in display quality and battery life. It\u2019s also worth noting that Google will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/pixel-8-pro/\">almost certainly</a> launch new Pixel 8 phones later this year.

We\u2019ve seen these SKUs go for $50 less in the past, but each is roughly $70 below their typical street price. While the Pixel 7 Pro has a 6.7-inch 1440p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, the normal Pixel 7 bumps things down to a 6.3-inch 1080p panel that tops out at 90Hz. There\u2019s no 5x telephoto lens, either, so you won\u2019t get the same level of zoom for photos. That said, the device runs on the same solid Tensor G2 chip and delivers the same software experience, while its camera is still on the shortlist for the best on the market. Its battery lasts a little longer as well.

Most of the other essentials are just about identical, plus the 7a will get an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-later\">extra year</a> of software and security updates. As of this writing, the unlocked Pixel 7a is available for $449, which is a $50 discount and a new low. If you prefer a smaller handset or just want to save $50, it\u2019s a fantastic value, though the Pixel 7 is still a bit better if you can pay a little extra.

Yes, the Pixel 6a can\u2019t really touch the Pixel 7a: Its Tensor G1 chip isn\u2019t as fast, it has less RAM (6GB versus 8GB) and a more basic 60Hz refresh rate, there\u2019s no wireless charging, and its camera is slightly worse. But it runs the same pleasant software as other Pixel phones, its hardware is still far from slow or cheap-feeling, and its camera runs circles around other phones in this price range. It won\u2019t last as long as some alternatives, but it's a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6a-review-battery-life-camera-samples-170025138.html\">nice upgrade</a> over the usual budget suspects.</p><h2>Motorola Moto G Stylus</h2><p></p><p>We list the latest <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Nb3Rvcm9sYS1Nb3RvLVN0eWx1cy1VbmxvY2tlZC1DYW1lcmEvZHAvQjBCWUxYOTUyNT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xcGgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc5ODI1MGE2LWUzZjktNDllOC05M2M2LWI4YWRkOGM2NDFlYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeR8ufnawY5XB0Bm3yZEdhZ--dQ18pmX0pxIe8cCgNCS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMotorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Camera%2Fdp%2FB0BYLX9525\">Moto G Stylus</a> as an honorable mention in our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html\">best affordable smartphones</a>, as it\u2019s one of the few budget phones to come with a built-in stylus.

Now, the company has finally rectified that with the launch of the 26-megapixel (MP) A6700, it's new flagship APS-C mirrorless camera. It's particularly strong for vlogging thanks to features like 4K 120p video, active mode stabilization and AI auto-framing \u2014 but it's not cheap, either.</p><p>The A6700 looks like other Sony A6000-series models at first glance, but there are some considerable improvements. The grip is now bigger for improved handling and stability, and it introduces an assignable front dial that makes manual shooting easier. It has a vari-angle LCD (rather than a popup LCD as before), along with a low-res (2.36 million dot) but fast (120fps) electronic viewfinder. It's fairly compact, being 35 percent smaller and 21 percent lighter than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r7-review-130024472.html\">Canon's $1,500 R7</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Sony's A6700 is its new flagship mirrorless camera\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/14d4c1f0-20ae-11ee-bfb7-3fc87e149785\" style=\"height: 1467px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Sony has also introduced a still/movie/S&amp;Q dial with dedicated settings for each, along with a new and far more intuitive main menu and menu structure. It comes with mic and headphone ports (plus a digital audio interface via the hotshoe), USB-C 3.2 Gen1, a micro HDMI port (not full-size, unfortunately), and a single SD UHS-II card slot on the side, rather than on the bottom in the battery compartment as before. It's dust and moisture resistant if you're shooting in inclement weather and supports 4K30p webcam capture.&nbsp;</p><p>The A6700 doesn't improve on the A6600's shooting speeds, grabbing bursts at the same 11 fps (in both mechanical and electronic shutter modes) with autofocus and auto-exposure tracking. However, it can capture far more photos at a time, with the new larger buffer letting you capture 59 compressed RAW and over 1,000 JPEGs before it stops.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony's A6700 is its new flagship mirrorless camera\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/39377c40-20ae-11ee-b65f-8881750d01bc\" style=\"height: 1467px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>The autofocus is improved as well, thanks to a faster backside-illuminated (BSI) sensor and processor that's eight times quicker than past models. Sony promises &quot;reliable real-time tracking&quot; for humans, animals and birds, insects and vehicles (cars, trains and planes). Human eye AF performance is up by 60 percent from previous models, while animal/bird eye AF speeds increased by 40 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>It should also take better photos in low light, again thanks to the BSI sensor and improved processor. Finally on the photo side, it now offers selectable RAW options including lossless and compressed, along with JPEG, HEIF and HLG still images.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony's 26-megapixel A6700 is its new flagship APS-C mirrorless camera\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/57f44a50-20ae-11ee-abbd-d3f162c4e67d\" style=\"height: 1467px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>While Sony already has a vlogging-oriented camera in the ZV-E10, the A6700 is even stronger in this regard. You can shoot 4K video at up to 120fps with 10-bit 4:2:2 quality (FHD at 240p) all with AF/AE, besting all APS-C rivals except <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-mirrorless-camera-review-123049866.html\">Fujifilm's $2,000 X-H2S</a>. Better still, it's super-sampled from 6K &quot;resulting in high-resolution 4K with minimal moir\u00e9 and jaggies,&quot; Sony says.&nbsp;</p><p>You can record in Sony's XAVC format at up to 600 Mbps with I-frame codecs that are easier to edit. It supports S-Cinetone and Sony S-Log3 mode to boost dynamic resolution up to 14+ stops (matching its Cinema line cameras), along with user-assignable LUTs so you can get a better idea of what you're shooting.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony's 26-megapixel A6700 is its new flagship APS-C mirrorless camera\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/72575b30-20ae-11ee-ad81-232fbc2ed23f\" style=\"height: 1467px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>For those who do a lot of tracking shots or walk-and-talk vlogging, the A6700 has &quot;active mode stabilization&quot; that uses both software and optical tricks to reduce camera shake. Video autofocus mode supports the same range of subjects (people, animals, vehicles) as photo AF, with Sony promising real-time recognition in all cases. Another nice feature borrowed from the ZV-E1 full-frame camera is AI-based auto framing that lets the subject move around while staying centered in the frame \u2014 with varying levels of cropping and tracking speeds. And like other recent Sony models, it supports digital focus breathing compensation with select lenses.&nbsp;</p><p>We had the camera for a short time, and found that it handled much better than any previous Sony A6000-series cameras. At the same time, it's compact and light enough to take on trips. It's certainly not an impulse buy, though. The A6700 starts at $1,399 (body only), or $1,499 with a 16-50mm kit lens and $1,699 with the 18-135mm lens. Pre-orders are now open, and it's set to start shipping in early August.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonys-26-megapixel-a6700-is-its-new-flagship-aps-c-mirrorless-camera-140031494.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sonys-26-megapixel-a6700-is-its-new-flagship-aps-c-mirrorless-camera-140031494.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T14:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Honor's Magic V2 is the thinnest foldable phone to date", "description": "<p>With the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-2-leica-pricing-availability-124434422.html\">Xiaomi's Mix Fold 2</a> last August, it was only a matter of time before other brands would catch up with similarly impressive slimness for their next foldable phones.

Today, another Chinese brand has beaten Huawei with an even slimmer and lighter foldable phone \u2014 the Honor Magic V2. It's the first of its kind to reach a folded thickness of less than 1cm, and it weighs less than some of the top flagship candybars \u2014 namely Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html\">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> or Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html\">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Specifically, the Magic V2 is 9.9mm and 4.7mm thick when folded and unfolded, respectively. Only the Mate X3 and Mix Fold 2 come close in this aspect. As for weight, the Magic V2 measures just 231g (8.15oz), beating the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-foldable-phone-pricing-availability-101858317.html\">Oppo Find N2</a> and Mate X3 by a few grams. As someone who has been using a 262g (9.24oz) Mix Fold 2 for 10 months, I found it surprisingly delightful while fiddling around with Honor's slimmer and lighter foldable.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>One of the keys to this form factor breakthrough is Honor's new hinge design, which consists of 3D-printed aerospace-grade titanium parts and proprietary steel bits. Together with the latest flexible OLED panel from China's BOE, the Magic V2 has been certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland to last for over 400,000 folds \u2014 doubling that of the Pixel Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 4. As a bonus, the hinge lets the phone \"hover\" in a laptop-like mode, which comes in handy for taking photos, watching videos, listening to music, making video calls and more, thanks to some tweaks in MagicOS 7.2 (based on Android 13).</p><p>Despite the size and weight reduction, the Magic V2 packs a generous 5,000mAh battery capacity, beating that of all existing foldable phones. This is thanks to the new silicon-carbon battery tech, which allows for a significant bump in energy density. These cells support Honor's 66W fast charging, though fans of wireless charging are out of luck here \u2014 not a surprise given the ambitious thickness reduction. The company also had to slim down essential components like the vapor cooling chamber, antenna, aluminum mid-frame, fingerprint module, USB-C connector, speakers and more to fit everything together. Much of this was done in Honor's research lab just across the street from the production line in Shenzhen.</p><p>The Magic V2 offers a 6.43-inch 2,376 x 1,060 OLED screen on the outside, and its 20:9 aspect ratio is to better mimic the user experience of a conventional smartphone \u2014 which is just as well given the thickness and weight achievement here. When unfolded, you'll be greeted by a 7.92-inch 2,344 x 2,156 flexible panel with a near-invisible crease. Both displays have an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz plus HDR10+ support, and yes, you can use a stylus on them, though only the Ultimate Edition in China comes bundled with an active pen. Honor also touted its eye protection measures for both screens on the Magic V2, using features like high-speed 3,840Hz pulse wave modulation dimming technology to reduce eye fatigue, as well as \"Circadian Night Display\" to help the user sleep better.</p><figure><img alt=\"The external and internal sides of the unfolded Honor Magic V2.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/982c3630-2079-11ee-a6bf-247bf0eb6ce9\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Richard Lai / Engadget</div></figure><p>The rest of the Magic V2's core specs are very much on flagship level, featuring Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, NFC, triple mics, Bluetooth 5.3, infrared remote and more. With the preloaded MagicOS 7.2 (based on Android 13), Honor even promises 50 months of fast performance, as certified by SGS. The only glaring omission on this list of goodies is an ingress protection rating (the Mate X3, Pixel Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 4 all have an IPX8 rating), but Honor assured us that it has applied a <a href=\"https://www.p2i.com/solutions/splash-proof/\">P2i</a> nano-coating to the device for basic water resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>The cameras are seemingly impressive, too: the rear-facing set consist of a 50-megapixel f/1.9 main camera with optical stabilization, a 50MP f/2.0 ultra-wide camera and a 20-megapixel f/2.4 2.5x zoom camera also with optical stabilization. Both the external and internal displays have a 16-megapixel f/2.2 selfie camera each. Honor said its AI motion sensing feature can help capture constantly moving subjects like kids and pets, but we won't be able to verify this claim until we get to a review unit later.</p><figure><img alt=\"The purple, silver and black versions of Honor Magic V2.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/982b24c0-2079-11ee-9c7f-0cd58a1ca789\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Richard Lai / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Honor Magic V2 is now up for pre-orders in China, with color options including black (with a vegan leather back), gold, silk purple, and silk black (with \"silk\" referring to the frosted glass back), with prices starting from 8,999 yuan (about $1,250) for the 256GB version, 9,999 yuan ($1,390) for double the storage, and maxing out at 11,999 yuan ($1,670) for the 1TB Ultimate Edition.</p><p>Even though the demo units I played with at Honor's headquarters had Google services pre-installed, the company was hesitant on confirming a possible global rollout. Perhaps we will hear more at IFA come September, otherwise I'm sure the enthusiasts will already know how to grab one from China, anyway.

But some toys are better than others when it comes to actually stimulating your child\u2019s brain while also keeping them entertained. The parents on the Engadget staff know this well, and we\u2019ve tried out a bunch of educational toys with our kids, with various results. These are some of the ones that have had staying power with our children \u2014 and even we adults have to admit we found them pretty fun, too.</p><h2>Magna-Tiles</h2><p></p><p>There are tons of building toys out there, from LEGO, to Tegu, to the classic wooden block.

These large, colorful construction toys come in a variety of sizes and shapes and click together, or to other surfaces, with the aid of powerful magnets. They can be combined to form simple shapes like cubes and pyramids, or arranged to make magnetic art on a garage door. Plus there are themed packs that can add windows, staircases or even functional cranes to the playsets.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>These are open-ended building toys that don\u2019t have set instructions for making a particular scene or item. They\u2019re safe for a three-year-old, and fun for much older kids, too. Honestly, as a nearly 40-year-old man, even I have a blast finding new and interesting ways to create ever more elaborate structures with my son. We\u2019ve built castles, spaceships, racecars and even a ferry terminal complete with a moveable boarding ramp.</p><p>At $120 for a 100-piece set, Magna-Tiles certainly aren\u2019t cheap, but they\u2019re definitely the sort of toy that will keep your child entertained for years to come, while also helping them learn valuable problem solving skills. \u2014<em> Terrence O\u2019Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><h2>Kindle Kids Edition</h2><p></p><p>I can tell you first hand that <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJMR0ZOVjI1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4Yy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWY0ZjQyYzctODZmYy00NmMzLTgwYzgtMWE5NDAyNjExNzE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAftoEYEaK7ZGsVZk6mqaRQmBR09zXtdDCDz67rMJlrgk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BLGFNV25\">Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets for kids</a> are great for little ones.

It\u2019s a mail-order service that delivers specifically timed play kits designed around Montessori tenets for different developmental windows. Each box is a mix of toys and books (or cards for little babies) that start at birth and go all the way up to four-years-old. The kits come every two months through the first year. At this point, things get understandably more complex and the boxes arrive every three months.</p><p>The kits aren\u2019t cheap: The boxes for babies are $80 each and when you hit one year they go up to $120. I can attest after nearly a year and a half that the service is great. It has been nice to refresh our child\u2019s toys with things that are more appropriate for his developmental stage on a regular basis. Everything is safe and well-built and, most importantly, highly engaging. <em>\u2014 B.S.</em></p><h2>Smart Lab: Smart Circuits</h2><p></p><p>When it comes to introducing kids to electronics there are a ton of options, but I personally like the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TbWFydExhYi1Ub3lzLUNpcmN1aXRzLUdhZGdldHMtRWxlY3Ryb25pY3MvZHAvQjAxNzZJRVVIMj9saW5rQ29kZT1zbDEmbGlua0lkPTAwODEyY2IzMzUxMGJkNGYxZDBmNTA1NDBhNjdhNTQ3Jmxhbmd1YWdlPWVuX1VTJnJlZl89YXNfbGlfc3NfdGwmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMThjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZjRmNDJjNy04NmZjLTQ2YzMtODBjOC0xYTk0MDI2MTE3MTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAer3bGbWwuzGGWkbcDhh_-M1vT1AB4q4ByKAbwsIMprZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSmartLab-Toys-Circuits-Gadgets-Electronics%2Fdp%2FB0176IEUH2%3FlinkCode%3Dsl1%26linkId%3D00812cb33510bd4f1d0f50540a67a547%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl\">Smart Circuits kit</a>. It can take a kid from simple blinking lights to complex motion-controlled games. The snap-together baseboard can lie flat on a table like a regular breadboard, but it can also be folded into a cube or the pieces can be attached at a 90-degree angle. This gives kids an extra element to play with when they graduate to designing their own circuits.</p><p>The kit itself only has a few pieces, but they\u2019re quite flexible.

My kids have a few of them, but the one I like most is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QbGF5c2tvb2wtMDAzMjItUExBLUZvcm0tRml0dGVyL2RwL0IwN1pXSjJKNTE_bGlua0NvZGU9c2wxJmxpbmtJZD1iYjBjMTkxYTFiYTk1ZWNlZmRmMjUyN2Q0OTBhYTQ1NiZsYW5ndWFnZT1lbl9VUyZyZWZfPWFzX2xpX3NzX3RsJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4Yy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWY0ZjQyYzctODZmYy00NmMzLTgwYzgtMWE5NDAyNjExNzE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYKgDAaWjtKHAP53LKeF1_5RaIOomAETMGO_vFer_4nb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlayskool-00322-PLA-Form-Fitter%2Fdp%2FB07ZWJ2J51%3FlinkCode%3Dsl1%26linkId%3Dbb0c191a1ba95ecefdf2527d490aa456%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl\">this Playskool model</a> and here\u2019s why. The lid latches, which means they can\u2019t just dump the shapes out easily; they have to learn how to work the mechanics of the lid as well. Also, the multi-colored shapes have tactile patterns on them that match the area of the box they\u2019re supposed to fit into, and that gives me another teaching opportunity. The whole thing is durable, too \u2014 my son likes to chew on the shapes and my daughter likes to stand on the box, but despite that abuse, there\u2019s not so much as a dent or a scratch on it. And because it\u2019s only $12, it makes a great gift if you\u2019re buying for someone else\u2019s kiddo. \u2014<em> Amber Bouman, Associate Editor, Parenting</em></p><h2>Yoto Player</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Zb3RvLVBsYXllci1CZXN0c2VsbGluZy1BbGwtT25lL2RwL0IwODhNTFZaODE_bGlua0NvZGU9c2wxJmxpbmtJZD00ZGEwZDU2YTQ5Y2E2OTM3MjE1ZDg0MTRmMDYyZWY4MyZsYW5ndWFnZT1lbl9VUyZyZWZfPWFzX2xpX3NzX3RsJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4Yy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWY0ZjQyYzctODZmYy00NmMzLTgwYzgtMWE5NDAyNjExNzE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYq0U05sLeNp1BhxHxBaIQz8GhXk9NlkI8FgVuU-M-yB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYoto-Player-Bestselling-All-One%2Fdp%2FB088MLVZ81%3FlinkCode%3Dsl1%26linkId%3D4da0d56a49ca6937215d8414f062ef83%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl\">Yoto Player</a> is the perfect toy for a young child who wants to play their own tunes and stories, but who isn\u2019t ready for an iPad or smart speaker of their own. Yoto\u2019s cute design and blocky, pixel-like display looks distinctly retro. It\u2019s detailed enough for kids to make out images, but it\u2019s insufficient for video, which should actually be good news for parents worried about too much screen time.

Each month my kid receives a collection of simple DIY toys, crafts and games built around a theme. For instance, one box was all about bioluminescent animals. Inside was a plush lightning bug that we had to stuff ourselves and shape using hair ties; a mushroom that had us painting a Slurpee lid and then dotting it with glow-in-the-dark stickers; and a dancing, glowing jellyfish as well as several window clings of sea creates for him to create scenes with.</p><p>Past kits have covered farm life, dinosaurs and simple machines like ramps. The stuff inside the box is usually pretty simple (think: cardboard, felt and wood). It\u2019s definitely not built to last, but my kid has gotten plenty of use out of each piece.</p><p>The best part is the crates will grow with him. As he gets older the projects will get more complex (and the price will go up). Later boxes include everything from screen-printing tools, to trebuchet kits and even robots. \u2014<em> T.O.</em></p><h2>Playtime Engineering: Blipblox</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CbGlwYmxveC1TSzItU3ludGhlc2l6ZXJzLUVsZWN0cm9uaWMtU3ludGhlc2l6ZXIvZHAvQjBCNzg1NUZZWS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMThjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZjRmNDJjNy04NmZjLTQ2YzMtODBjOC0xYTk0MDI2MTE3MTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARZBNvpScBYohEv30LSksVEjPV_vw0x4h7M10yp0MOwF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlipblox-SK2-Synthesizers-Electronic-Synthesizer%2Fdp%2FB0B7855FYY%2F\">Blipblox</a> may look like a simple noise-maker for kids, but this gadget is much more than just a toy.

There\u2019s an oscillator with the usual assortment of synth parameters along with an amp envelope, two LFOs, modulation envelope and a low-pass filter. The Blipblox also has a MIDI input for use with a keyboard or other accessories in addition to a \u00bc-inch output. Lastly, it runs on three AA batteries or plugged in via a USB cable. Blipblox can teach kids about music through a basic approach to instruments and synthesis, but its features are advanced enough to offer noise-making magic for parents, too. <em>\u2014 B.S.</em></p><h2>Montessori Busy Board</h2><p></p><p>My kids are currently fascinated with snaps, zippers and closures, which is fun because it means it\u2019s easy to amuse them, but awkward, too, because they often decide to undo the closures on the shirt I\u2019m wearing. A busy board capitalizes on this curiosity by offering several different clasps, snaps, zippers, buttons and openings for little ones to work their fingers on. It intrigues children by activating their senses and helps them develop their fine-motor skills and problem solving by using real-world obstacles. It also adheres to the Montessori philosophy of simple, wooden toys that help children explore the world around them through play.

In addition to its impressively speedy performance, we also praised it for having the capabilities it has without the need for a fan. Its 13.3-inch Retina Display looked fantastic, with thin bezels around the high-res screen, and we found its keyboard to be excellent, with a satisfying amount of depth.

You can get any of the color options \u2014 gold, silver and space gray \u2014 for $750, but due to the nature of the event, you'll have to be a Prime member to enjoy the discount.

Usually $150, it\u2019s down to $129 for Prime members, which is a $40 discount that matches the lowest price. It gives bright, dynamic finesse to music and delivers a significant amount of bass for its size. It\u2019s about the size of a clutch bag and even has a small loop strap to further the comparison.

We recommend the third generation of JBL\u2019s Boombox speaker in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html\">guide</a> because it\u2019s loud and comes in a take-anywhere package.

It pumps out loud, thumping beats, stands over two feet tall and emits lighting effects that sync with what\u2019s playing. It weighs 37 pounds, so the grab bars on the top and bottom make a lot of sense. It can go for 25 hours on a charge and offers a bit of water-resistance to accidental splashes, but its size and build make it less rough and tumble than other portable Bluetooth speakers.</p><h2>Samsung HW-Q700B</h2><p></p><p>Samsung\u2019s<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlYNjFGTjQ4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE5OS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDIxYjFjYmYtNTBhOC00NzY0LWI3N2UtMmUwODQ5YzM3Y2E5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUfmW7XfgLMPM5KCfhWclbhdzrZphuZ3O5l7hC-fZjtY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09X61FN48\"> HW-Q700B</a> soundbar is currently $398 for Prime members after a steep 47 percent discount off its $698 MSRP.

The A13 Bionic chip inside makes it a little smarter than most displays, but the 60Hz refresh rate is disappointing.

Prime Day usually brings decent laptop sales, but the biggest downside is that your only options are the configurations that Amazon offers. There's usually good variety, but we still recommend going directly to your manufacturer of choice if you want to spec out your new machine precisely. But for those who are comfortable picking up a pre-configured model, here are the best Prime Day laptop deals we could find this year.</p><h2>Apple MacBook Air M2 (15-inch)</h2><p></p><p>The 15.3-inch version of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEM3NkQ0UldKP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFhOS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzVhOGFiZmYtZjlmMS00OGU4LTg0MjgtZmQzNDhiMDcwNTc5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf5yVRnu_qYCZoro-dqNXqNeKhii9WDuLDY98FuAIFHO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C76D4RWJ\">Apple\u2019s MacBook Air M2</a> is down to $1,399 for a configuration with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. That\u2019s a modest $50 drop from its usual price on Amazon, but the notebook only just arrived last month, and it's $100 less than buying from Apple directly. The M2 Air is the top pick in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\">the best laptops</a>, and we gave it a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html\">review score of 96</a> in June. It checks just about all the requisite boxes for a mainstream notebook, with a thin and light design, bright and accurate display, comfortable keyboard, long-lasting battery, and more than enough performance for everyday use. This 15-inch model has all the same benefits of the prior 13-inch model, but adds a more powerful speaker system and slightly upgraded GPU alongside the bigger screen.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Apple MacBook Air M1</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhONU03UzZLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFhOS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzVhOGFiZmYtZjlmMS00OGU4LTg0MjgtZmQzNDhiMDcwNTc5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUD79J00kIOIyAWrBEkv9QB4t86ZIWGcIazxDgwotBFl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K\">M1 MacBook Air</a> released back in 2020, but it remains a worthy option if you want a Mac for light work and web browsing for as little cash as possible. The entry-level configuration is now on sale for $750, which is a new low. Apple sells this device for $999, though we\u2019ve seen it go for $799 for most of the past few months. This model\u2019s keyboard, trackpad, display and battery life continue to impress, and the quiet M1 chip is still fast enough for the essentials. This configuration is strictly for casual use, though, as it only has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You\u2019ll have to live with a more basic 720p webcam, too, and you\u2019ll miss out on the improved speakers and slimmer bezels of the M2 model.

As of this writing, the 14.2-inch Pro with an M2 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD is available for $1,799. We've seen it go for $50 less in the past, but if you don't want to wait for another sale, this is still $200 cheaper than buying from Apple direct. Apart from the faster internals, the Pro\u2019s mini-LED display can get brighter than the Air for HDR content, plus it has a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother motion. There\u2019s also a wider port selection, including three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port and an SDXC card reader. There\u2019s no USB-A port, though, and the chassis is thicker and heavier.

That\u2019s a new low and roughly $120 off this model\u2019s typical street price.

Apple normally sells this 64GB model for $329, though we\u2019ve frequently seen it retail around $275 for most of the past few months.

But it still gets you a huge array of apps, and its A13 Bionic chip remains fast enough for light work and casual media consumption. It\u2019s also the only current iPad to still carry a headphone jack.</p><h2>Apple iPad Air</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlWM0hOMUtDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFvaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEyYmU4NTEtNmIzMy00NDQ1LWEyNjgtMDc1ZGM4ZWM2MjU2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQrRp1X1r3sGnv6Z10V1r94Iq4tjpAgd866GBST83p1h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC\">iPad Air</a> is the iPad we recommend for most people, and right now it\u2019s available for $500. That\u2019s a price we've seen for much of the last few months, but it's $100<strong>&nbsp;</strong>off Apple's MSRP. The Air earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html\">review score of 90</a> last year. While it lacks the 120Hz refresh rate, 128GB of base storage and better speakers of the iPad Pro, it provides a similarly elegant design for less cash, with a faster M1 chip, superior display and wider accessory support than the 9th-gen and 10th-gen iPads.</p><h2>Apple iPad Mini</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlHOTgzSkpTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFvaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEyYmU4NTEtNmIzMy00NDQ1LWEyNjgtMDc1ZGM4ZWM2MjU2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdxdyyxzOVoQD2T8rtcCUqIWKKouy3Vie2SLPTKTEIR7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G983JJS\">iPad Mini</a> is also down to an all-time low of $380. That\u2019s roughly $65 off the 8.3-inch tablet\u2019s typical street price and $120 off Apple\u2019s MSRP. We gave the latest Mini a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html\">score of 89</a> back in 2021, but it remains the best compact tablet on the market, as it\u2019s essentially a smaller version of the iPad Air. It uses Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chip instead of the more powerful M1, but the former is still plenty quick for most needs. The big downside, as with most non-Pro iPads, is that it only has 64GB of storage by default.

That\u2019s $50<strong>&nbsp;</strong>off Apple's list price for the jumbo-sized tablet, though it's a deal we've seen fairly regularly in recent months. The 12.9-inch Pro has all the hardware upgrades of its 11-inch counterpart, but its \u201cLiquid Retina\u201d display offers better brightness and contrast thanks to its Mini LED backlighting. It\u2019s the closest any iPad comes to being a full-on laptop replacement, though iPadOS still has its share of issues with multitasking and productivity. Still, if you just want the most luxurious iPad possible, or if a tablet fits better into your workflow than a traditional notebook, it\u2019s worth considering.</p><h2>Amazon Fire HD 10</h2><p></p><p>Amazon\u2019s Fire HD tablets are worth a look if all you want is a competent device for basic streaming and web browsing for as little as possible.

But the Fire HD 10\u2019s 10.1-inch 1080p display is nice enough for casual media consumption, and its processor is fast enough to not be a dealbreaker. Plus, its matte plastic design is comfortable, it gets a solid 10 or so hours of battery life, and it has a microSD slot for adding storage.

They ship with a simplified UI by default, and mercifully, they don\u2019t feature ads on the lock screen.</p><p>Between the two, the Kids edition has a larger rubbery case, while the Kids Pro model has a slimmer hard-plastic case designed for slightly older children.

We\u2019ve typically seen this 11-inch slate retail around $635 in recent months. The Galaxy Tab S8 line is the top Android pick in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html\">the best tablets</a> thanks to their lively displays and robust S Pen stylus support. The base Tab S8 has an LCD panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate and sharp 2,560 x 1,600 resolution, along with a speedy Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor and 8GB of RAM. Samsung says it will supply software updates to the Tab S8 lineup through early 2026 as well.</p><p>That said, you should only get this if you\u2019re deeply committed to Android. Google\u2019s OS still isn\u2019t as accommodating to productivity as iPadOS or Windows, nor does it have as many apps that are explicitly designed for large screens. But if you own a Galaxy phone or just don\u2019t want to jump into Apple land, this is still good hardware.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8+</h2><p></p><p>The 12.4-inch <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlOUU1MNVdHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFvaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEyYmU4NTEtNmIzMy00NDQ1LWEyNjgtMDc1ZGM4ZWM2MjU2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAR_VHV2Ys5O1-vHoR2BHisUIWx6x4QKsYch1uisMaUtR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09NQML5WG\">Galaxy Tab S8+</a> is available for $600, which is more than $200 below its usual street price and matches its all-time low. This variant has the same general strengths as the standard Tab S8, but it has a more vibrant OLED display that ranks among the best on any tablet, plus it\u2019s slightly thinner (0.22\u201d instead of 0.25\u201d). It also has a larger battery to make up for the bigger display. Again, though, this is a good chunk of change to spend on an Android slate. Like the standard Tab S8, it also lacks a headphone jack. We gave the Galaxy Tab S8+ a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-8-review-in-a-class-of-its-own-132946024.html\">review score of 85</a> last year.</p><h2>Amazon Fire Max 11</h2><p></p><p>The recently released <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1BbWF6b24tcG93ZXJmdWwtb2N0YS1jb3JlLXByb2Nlc3Nvci9kcC9CMEIxVlExWlFZP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFvaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEyYmU4NTEtNmIzMy00NDQ1LWEyNjgtMDc1ZGM4ZWM2MjU2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdT3yka7VtO3PQNPliJoH_33bGh5D5_U-7z2SZQoacHy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIntroducing-Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor%2Fdp%2FB0B1VQ1ZQY\">Fire Max 11</a> is down to $150, which is the first major discount we\u2019ve seen and 35 percent off this slate's standard going rate.

Its chassis is made of aluminum instead of plastic as well. The issue is that it still runs Fire OS, whose shortcomings in app support and productivity features (plus its built-in ads) are harder to swallow when you\u2019re spending more than $100 to use it. But if you\u2019re in the niche group that wants a more premium Fire tablet without spending iPad or Galaxy Tab money, it could have appeal.</p><h2>Amazon Fire 7</h2><p></p><p>Amazon's <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXJlLTctVGFibGV0L2RwL0IwOTZXS0tLMksvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFvaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEyYmU4NTEtNmIzMy00NDQ1LWEyNjgtMDc1ZGM4ZWM2MjU2In0&amp;signature=AQAAARpQ64zX5hAN_5kBal3BEUxKYGqwFyCqiSc62eDFOvcu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFire-7-Tablet%2Fdp%2FB096WKKK2K%2F\">Fire 7 tablet</a> is on sale for $40 for Prime Day.

The A6H is very much an entry-level 4K TV, so don\u2019t expect especially high contrast or rich colors compared to pricier options. There\u2019s no local dimming, and it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. But for this price, its picture is perfectly fine. The 50-inch model\u2019s VA panel should be particularly decent in a dark room, though it\u2019ll have narrower viewing angles than the 43-inch set\u2019s IPS display. And while it can be sluggish to navigate apps, its Google TV interface makes it easy to find things to watch.

The Streaming Stick 4K is the safer buy when both devices are on sale, but if you really want to save, this is a fine value.</p><h2>Roku Streambar</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2t1LVN0cmVhbWJhci1TdHJlYW1pbmctUHJlbWl1bS1SZWxlYXNlZC9kcC9CMDhHOEpIODM2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAW8NOQ7sN9K8pUaLIpeC5x-S_R4gyJB9b9Vi5zH463dD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoku-Streambar-Streaming-Premium-Released%2Fdp%2FB08G8JH836\">Roku Streambar</a> is a compact 2.0-channel soundbar that doubles as a 4K media streamer. It won't sound as rich as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-soundbars-143041791.html\">best dedicated soundbars</a>, and it lacks Dolby Vision HDR, but it plays clearly for its size and performs much better than the speakers built into most TVs. If you're looking to upgrade a smaller secondary TV, it should be appealing. The Streambar is currently on sale for $89, which is a $30 discount. We gave the device a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-review-133013675.html\">score of 86</a> back in 2020.</p><h2>Google Chromecast with Google TV (4K)</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhLUlY3UzIyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAckQryqS4jPdBWTHoLa-zsCxjufujzvJkDUvtEOIDKpW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08KRV7S22\">Google Chromecast with Google TV</a> is down to $40, which is a deal we\u2019ve seen several times before but still comes in $10 below its list price. This is the runner-up pick in our buying guide: It\u2019s getting a bit long in the tooth, but it\u2019s worth grabbing over a Roku streamer if you want a device that\u2019s more proactive about recommending shows you might like based on your viewing history. Compared to Roku OS, Google TV is centered more on content than apps (though it\u2019s still easy to reach the latter), and it\u2019s more nuanced when it comes to voice controls and searching for content. Naturally, it also works better with Google services like YouTube TV, though it doesn\u2019t support AirPlay or Apple TV+.</p><p>Google makes <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaHJvbWVjYXN0LUdvb2dsZS1UVi1TdHJlYW1pbmctRW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kcC9CMEI5SFM2RExaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQomCLKfBH-8prLcyRh423WF6Dr1uVOzxawdzgzkVPDw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChromecast-Google-TV-Streaming-Entertainment%2Fdp%2FB0B9HS6DLZ\">an HD version</a> of the Chromecast that outputs in 1080p but otherwise works like the 4K model.

This is Amazon\u2019s fastest streaming stick, and its remote comes with Alexa baked in. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG, and like the rest of the Fire TV lineup, it has just about all of the necessary streaming apps. Unlike the standard <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhYVllaMVk1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcPLTThGHjNEX6qokC9_6wE9OEBzHl2FoGi-YU063WIc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08XVYZ1Y5\">Fire TV Stick 4K</a>, it includes a WiFi 6 radio, though you\u2019ll need a compatible router and an unusually fast internet connection to see any advantage from that.</p><p>We generally prefer Roku\u2019s and Google\u2019s interfaces over Amazon\u2019s Fire TV OS, which more aggressively displays ads on its home screen and prioritizes Amazon\u2019s content throughout the UI. It lacks AirPlay support as well. But these issues might be easier to look past if you often use Alexa and Prime Video, especially when the upfront cost is this low.</p><h2>Amazon Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite</h2><p></p><p>The standard <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhDMVc1Tjg3P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYaklKjtqzxQU3O0LdcvcgdykAKqfUS3y_qY4rRBYexG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08C1W5N87\">Fire TV Stick</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDkxRzRZUDU3P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcz9CBa93kNjQB0NZkIOE3FhoiWf_XTdfsagJVBlTkti&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB091G4YP57\">Fire TV Stick Lite</a> are best used with older TVs, as they each top out at a 1080p resolution instead of 4K. Both lack Dolby Vision HDR \u2013 though they retain HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG \u2013 and can be more sluggish than the 4K Max when switching between apps as well. That said, the rest of the experience is similar. The main difference is that the base Fire TV Stick\u2019s voice remote has app shortcuts and TV controls for volume and power, while the Fire TV Stick Lite\u2019s remote does not.</p><p>Most people who really want a Fire TV streamer should just get the 4K Max, but if you want to upgrade an office or bedroom TV on the cheap, the Fire TV Stick is down to $17, while the Fire TV Stick Lite is down to $15. Both deals represent all-time lows.</p><h2>Amazon Fire TV Cube</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlCWlozTU03P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYXRBOsnuVrNYYw1t0exuT9Rb5KcIQ-2kxQLFxFKxWzb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09BZZ3MM7\">Fire TV Cube</a> blends a 4K media streamer with a hands-free Alexa speaker and right now it\u2019s down to $110 for Prime Day, which is $30 off and it's best price yet. This is the most powerful Fire TV device by a comfortable margin, and because it\u2019s a box instead of a stick, it has a host of ports, including an Ethernet jack and an HDMI input. The latter means you can run a game console or cable box through the Cube yet still see an Alexa overlay whenever you call on the assistant. (This passthrough is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, though.) It also supports WiFi 6E.</p><p>The Cube runs the same OS as any other Fire TV streamer, so it can be hard to justify over devices with less ad-heavy UIs like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2022-faster-cheaper-best-streaming-box-150013627.html\">Apple TV 4K</a>. Its lack of AirPlay or Google Cast support is harder to swallow at this price, too. But if you don\u2019t own an Echo and want the ability to use Alexa hands-free, it\u2019s the only streamer with that functionality.</p><h2>NVIDIA Shield TV Pro</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdZUDlGQk1NP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE4YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3OGNjMjItMjE4ZC00NmIwLWIwOTEtODA5ZDlkODY0NzZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUs4aD8lMZpRozAVs6FSuljYN5lMPoqd5McNxOC7-grC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07YP9FBMM\">NVIDIA Shield TV Pro</a> is available for $170 this Prime Day, a $30 drop that matches the set-top box\u2019s all-time low. This is the most niche player we recommend in our guide, as it released in 2019, still costs a ton and uses Android TV instead of the newer Google TV platform found on the Chromecast. We highlight it for gaming specifically, as its still-speedy Tegra X1+ chip plays well with NVIDIA's <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTIzNDhmNi0yMzA0LTQxNWUtYjE2Yy0xZmIyNTI3OTQwNjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnZpZGlhLmNvbS9lbi11cy9nZWZvcmNlLW5vdy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzNzhjYzIyLTIxOGQtNDZiMC1iMDkxLTgwOWQ5ZDg2NDc2ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYWPVjSw3rvuZfyk3hrLCWtUM_dL59EUziXKrQiGbIEP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2F\">GeForce Now</a> game streaming service and various Android games. If you\u2019re looking to run a Plex media server or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFLRvM1xYNM\">emulate</a> older games, it makes sense there as well. The box itself is loaded with ports, and it uses upscaling technology to make 1080p content look crisper on 4K TVs.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to call the Shield TV Pro a great value at this price in 2023, but if you\u2019re an enthusiast who has had their eye out for a sale, this is a chance to save at least a little bit.</p><p><strong><em>Your Prime Day Shopping Guide</em></strong><em>: See all of our</em><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/topics/prime-day/\"><em> Prime Day</em></a><em> coverage.

Plus, they're great for working out \u2014 or a nice frolic in the rain \u2014 with the AirPods and the charging case being sweat and water-resistant.</p><h2>Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)</h2><p></p><p>The latest AirPods might have a few extra bells and whistles, but the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdQWEdRQzFRLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xMzYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFhZGQwNTk2LTE2MGItNGVlMi1iMjA0LTgxMzZhYWI5Y2U2MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWTC1ir8EH3AGWIRtV0y5iJ8RudsYBYguI6j2Lv0bRjv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%2F\">second-generation Apple AirPods</a> are a great choice for $90. They're currently $39 off their sticker price of $129 for Prime Day, the lowest we've seen them in a while. This model mirrors its successor in having an H1 chip, Siri, automatic switching between devices and a lightning charging case. The biggest consideration is battery life, with these AirPods offering five hours of uninterrupted use and over 24 hours with the charging case. If you're looking for AirPods for your commute or walks, the $50 price difference makes the second-gen AirPods a solid option.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 8</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1XYXRjaC1NaWRuaWdodC1BbHVtaW51bS1BbHdheXMvZHAvQjBCREhGNzU3Ri8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTM2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhYWRkMDU5Ni0xNjBiLTRlZTItYjIwNC04MTM2YWFiOWNlNjMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ4gG0osaQHcZpxa4P4liAgjsCAl0WXi9gNGkkY3Bmsb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Always%2Fdp%2FB0BDHF757F%2F\">Apple Watch Series 8</a> is the brand\u2019s latest flagship wearable and usually sells for $399 for the 41mm GPS model.

Unlike the standard Fire TV Stick 4K, it also has a WiFi 6 radio, though you\u2019ll need a compatible router and an unusually fast internet connection to ever see any advantage from that.</p><h2>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Lite</h2><p></p><p>We call the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDkxRzRZUDU3P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEzNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWFkZDA1OTYtMTYwYi00ZWUyLWIyMDQtODEzNmFhYjljZTYzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaEwIR5mhlXtbOs32-xoWVEXWCzN0nbeeBRUzhr9s7H_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB091G4YP57\">Fire TV Stick Lite</a> the best budget pick in our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">best streaming devices</a>.

Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote the acquisition &quot;has been described as the largest in tech history,&quot; and it deserved to be scrutinized. She noted Microsoft's commitment to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation and deals the company has to bring its games and Activision Blizzard titles to Nintendo Switch and cloud gaming services. Later yesterday, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it has also agreed to take a break from its legal battle to negotiate a compromise that could allow the deal to move forward.

As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/19/artificial-intelligence-child-sex-abuse-images/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> recently reported, the rise in generative AI has also led to the explosion of lifelike images with sexual depictions of children.

The platform has banned teen dating servers, as well, and has vowed to take action against users engaging in this behavior. A previous <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/discord-child-safety-social-platform-challenges-rcna89769\"><em>NBC News</em></a> investigation found Discord servers advertised as teen dating servers with participants that solicited nude images from minors.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Adult users had previously been prosecuted for grooming children on Discord, and there are even crime rings extorting underage users to send sexual images of themselves. Banning teen dating servers completely could help mitigate the issue. Discord has also included a line in its policy, which states that older teens found to be grooming younger teens will be &quot;reviewed and actioned under [its] Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Children and Grooming Policy.&quot;</p><p>Aside from updating its rules, Discord recently launched a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/new-family-center-tool-gives-parents-better-insight-into-their-teens-discord-usage-150014579.html\">Family Center tool</a> that parents can use to keep an eye on their kids' activity on the chat service. While parents won't be able to see the actual contents of their kids' message, the opt-in tool allows them to see who their children are friends with and who they talk to on the platform. Discord is hoping that these new measures and tools can help keep its underage users safe along with its old measures, which include proactively scanning images uploaded to its platform using PhotoDNA.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"c42fe389823d4986968864e12ed93eaa\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Discord's Family Center is a new opt-in tool that makes it easy for teens to keep their parents and guardians informed about their Discord activity while respecting their own autonomy. <a href=\"https://t.co/UFY0ybo0LR\">pic.twitter.com/UFY0ybo0LR</a></p>\u2014 Discord (@discord) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/discord/status/1678783622969692165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/discord-bans-teen-dating-servers-and-the-sharing-of-ai-generated-csam-071626058.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/discord-bans-teen-dating-servers-and-the-sharing-of-ai-generated-csam-071626058.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-12T07:16:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
