This isn\u2019t always the case with actors or even movie stars, some of whom may be good at faking it but really are more interested in fame and fortune than they are the cinematic experience. And while Cruise may be one of our last, true movie stars, it\u2019s pretty hard to question that his feelings for the art of moviemaking are real.\n\nI mean, Steven Spielberg himself gave Cruise credit for saving Hollywood after the pandemic.\n\nIn that particular case, Spielberg was talking about Cruise\u2019s insistence on releasing Top Gun: Maverick in theaters during a time of great uncertainty in the industry. A billion and a half dollars later, Cruise clearly made the right call there. But there\u2019s another key ingredient to the once and future Ethan Hunt\u2019s strategy to keeping cinema alive \u2013 and that\u2019s his frankly insane stunt work.\n\nTom Cruise has been making movies since 1981, and became a star within two years of that with the release of Risky Business. He\u2019s had his ups and downs over the decades of course, but one thing that audiences have come to expect from the actor in recent years is him doing his own stunts. And not just that, but one-upping himself with each subsequent Mission: Impossible movie, especially since director Christopher McQuarrie joined him on the franchise.\n\nSo with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hitting theaters, let\u2019s look at how Tom Cruise approaches stunts in the Mission: Impossible movies, and how his lifelong love of film has fueled that methodology.\n\n#IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHv2bfrOUOw", "date_published": "2023-07-12T13:15:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xHv2bfrOUOw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review", "description": "Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals reviewed on PC by Carli Velocci.

While the similarities with its predecessor can make it feel too familiar, highlighting a few missed opportunities for expansion of its puzzle mechanics and for fresh worldbuilding, it still creates an intimate but epic adventure. The world is built out just enough to feel fresh and to lead you to some unexpected and surprising places. However, its real strengths are its characters. Riley\u2019s story is a standout, but she and Jacob come together to form a bond that carries you through to the (possibly) bitter end.
