(A book I ended up stealing from a friend\u2019s apartment, I loved it so much.) He had been dramatically famous in the 1980s, so I associated him with the bookshelves of my parents\u2019 generation, but these two almost miniature books were so funny and lucid and experimental and worldly that they seduced me entirely. This sensation of excitement and the contemporary never left me.</p><p>He came, of course, out of a specific historical moment. When he was young in the 1950s he was a member of the Communist party in Prague, but the horror of the Russian invasion of what was then Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the realisation that whatever utopian ideal of society he had envisaged would never be possible, led to his exclusion first from any form of work \u2013 banned by the totalitarian Communist authorities, he was eventually forced to live in the woods for a period \u2013 and then, ultimately, from his country. In 1975 he left Czechoslovakia for France, where he lived with his wife Vera until his death, becoming a Franco-Czech hybrid: a cross-border phenomenon.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/milan-kundera-his-writing-vibrates-with-energy-adam-thirlwell\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/milan-kundera-his-writing-vibrates-with-energy-adam-thirlwell", "date_published": "2023-07-12T16:01:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018They were chilled\u2019: bated breath as beavers released in Northumberland", "description": "<p>Animals make first return to the county in 400 years as National Trust introduces family of four to Wallington estate</p><p>It was a genuinely tense tale of the riverbank as a family of four beavers were released into the Northumberland countryside on Wednesday, the first time in more than 400 years that the animals are making the county their home.</p><p>Would they even come out of their cages?

Then I became an adult, began to write, and wanted to be successful. Now I\u2019m successful and would like to have the ointment that would make me invisible.</p><p>For a writer, the experience of living in a number of countries is an enormous boon. You can only understand the world if you see it from several sides.</p><p>With the first story of Laughable Loves (I wrote it in 1959), I was certain of having \u2018found myself\u2019. I became a prose writer, a novelist, and I am nothing else. Since then, my aesthetic has known no transformations; it evolves, to use your word, linearly.</p><p>I lived in Czechoslovakia until I was 45. Given that my real career as a writer began when I was 30, I can say that the larger part of my creative life will take place in France. I am much more tied to France than is thought.</p><p>To be a writer does not mean to preach a truth, it means to discover a truth.</p><p>The stupidity of people comes from having an answer to everything. The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything</p><p>A novel does not assert anything; a novel searches and poses questions. I don\u2019t know whether my nation will perish and I don\u2019t know which of my characters is right. I invent stories, confront one with another, and by this means I ask questions.</p><p>I think that the importance of the novel in European culture has been enormous; European man is unthinkable without the novel, he was created by it. For centuries it was the first thing one read. The love of adventure, which is so European, adventure understood as a value. If you say, \u2018I lived my life without adventure,\u2019 then it\u2019s a failure, right? Well, it\u2019s the novel that impressed upon us this love of adventure.</p><p>There are four great novelists: Kafka, Broch, Musil, Gombrowicz. I call them the \u201cpleiad\u201d of central Europe\u2019s great novelists</p><p>An author, once quoted by a journalist, is no longer master of his word \u2026 And this, of course, is unacceptable.</p><p>These days, when sexuality is no longer taboo, mere description, mere sexual confession, has become noticeably boring. How dated Lawrence seems, or even Henry Miller, with his lyricism of obscenity!</p><p>It is the sex of the novels and not that of their authors that must interest us. All great novels, all true novels are bisexual. This is to say that they express both a feminine and a masculine vision of the world. The sex of the authors as physical people is their private affair.</p><p>It would be senseless to try to draw its borders exactly. Central Europe is not a state: it is a culture or a fate.</p><p>In fact, what does Europe mean to a Hungarian, a Czech, a Pole? For a thousand of years their nations have belonged to the part of Europe rooted in Roman Christianity. They have participated in every period of its history. For them, the word \u2018Europe\u2019 does not represent a phenomenon of geography but a spiritual notion.</p><p>It\u2019s not Russia but communism that deprives nations of their essence.</p><p>I learned the value of humour during the time of Stalinist terror \u2026 A sense of humour was a trustworthy sign of recognition. Ever since, I have been terrified by a world that is losing its sense of humour.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/to-be-a-writer-means-to-discover-a-truth-milan-kundera-a-life-in-quotes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/12/to-be-a-writer-means-to-discover-a-truth-milan-kundera-a-life-in-quotes", "date_published": "2023-07-12T12:49:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US inflation rate down to 3% in June, a two-year low, but prices remain high", "description": "<p>Increase was the smallest since March 2021 and down from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022</p><p>The prices of US goods and services hit a two-year low in June, a sign that inflation is continuing to ease as the economy responds to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rapid increases in interest rates.</p><p>The latest consumer price index (CPI) <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\">figures</a>, which measure the prices of a basket of goods and services, increased 3% over the last year.

It has the blessing of an International Cricket Council desperate to lift its sport\u2019s profile in America ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. It has powerful allies: four Indian Premier League franchises and two state cricket bodies from Australia have signed on as either full owners or operational partners for the fledgling league\u2019s six founding teams. It has a slot in the international cricket calendar that\u2019s relatively uncrowded, with only the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Ashes as real competition for the committed global cricket fan\u2019s attention. It has a list of team names that combine, in delightfully unbound American style, the patriotic (Washington Freedom) and ecological (Seattle Orcas) with the borrowed-from-the-IPL nonsensical (MI New York).</p><p>Most importantly it has players, and some extremely capable ones at that: sprinkled among the little-known local talents (Corne Dry, anyone?) the new competition features the genuine stardust of Wanindu Hasaranga, Kagiso Rabada, Tim David and Anrich Nortje, among many other established T20 internationals who\u2019ve made the trek out to the suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to help launch cricket\u2019s latest big shot at success in America. But will Major League Cricket have any viewers? Will the American public thrill to the spectacle of a beefy heave through midwicket from Aaron Finch? Will it learn to lament, as millions of cricket fans throughout the world already do, the lost opportunities of a wasted PowerPlay? Will it grow to appreciate the finer points of an Adam Zampa strangler down leg side, or a topless cameo from Faf du Plessis on the player balcony? The final touches \u2013 the marking of the boundary barrier, the laying of the turf wicket, the engineering of the outfield \u2013 have just been applied to convert the former home ground of now-defunct off-brand baseball side the Texas AirHogs into an international-grade cricket venue. The dream is in place, the field has been built. But will they come?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/12/major-league-cricket-preview-united-states\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/12/major-league-cricket-preview-united-states", "date_published": "2023-07-12T07:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "After two years of real progress on climate, a European \u2018greenlash\u2019 is brewing | Nathalie Tocci", "description": "<p>As climate pledges become reality, opposition to the green agenda is growing.
