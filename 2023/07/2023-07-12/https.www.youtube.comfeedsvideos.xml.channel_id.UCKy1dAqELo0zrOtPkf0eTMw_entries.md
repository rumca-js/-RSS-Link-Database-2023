## Secret Invasion Episode 4 Review

Watch our IGN Secret Invasion episode 4 review! With flat action and an underdeveloped central idea, episode four of Marvel's Secret Invasion continues the season’s streak of diminishing returns. At barely more than 30 minutes long, there’s little time to explore its multiple revelations and provide the required complexity to the Skrulls’ building war efforts, but it does mean this dull chapter is over and done mercifully quickly.

## Tom Cruise Killed 6 Motorcycles in One Day Because He Loves Movies So Damn Much

Tom Cruise loves movies. This isn’t always the case with actors or even movie stars, some of whom may be good at faking it but really are more interested in fame and fortune than they are the cinematic experience. And while Cruise may be one of our last, true movie stars, it’s pretty hard to question that his feelings for the art of moviemaking are real.

I mean, Steven Spielberg himself gave Cruise credit for saving Hollywood after the pandemic.

In that particular case, Spielberg was talking about Cruise’s insistence on releasing Top Gun: Maverick in theaters during a time of great uncertainty in the industry. A billion and a half dollars later, Cruise clearly made the right call there. But there’s another key ingredient to the once and future Ethan Hunt’s strategy to keeping cinema alive – and that’s his frankly insane stunt work.

Tom Cruise has been making movies since 1981, and became a star within two years of that with the release of Risky Business. He’s had his ups and downs over the decades of course, but one thing that audiences have come to expect from the actor in recent years is him doing his own stunts. And not just that, but one-upping himself with each subsequent Mission: Impossible movie, especially since director Christopher McQuarrie joined him on the franchise.

So with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hitting theaters, let’s look at how Tom Cruise approaches stunts in the Mission: Impossible movies, and how his lifelong love of film has fueled that methodology.

## Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals Review

Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals reviewed on PC by Carli Velocci. Also available on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Android/iOS via Netflix. Narrated by Ryan McCaffrey.

Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals is a sequel in a lot of ways. While the similarities with its predecessor can make it feel too familiar, highlighting a few missed opportunities for expansion of its puzzle mechanics and for fresh worldbuilding, it still creates an intimate but epic adventure. The world is built out just enough to feel fresh and to lead you to some unexpected and surprising places. However, its real strengths are its characters. Riley’s story is a standout, but she and Jacob come together to form a bond that carries you through to the (possibly) bitter end. The choice is yours.
