<p>In a press release, Atlus revealed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-tactica/">Persona 5 Tactica</a> will offer a tactical twist on the franchise's classic systems of elemental weakness, with unique skills and abilities for every character, and social connections to explore.</p><p>Just like in Persona 5, your characters can take cover. If characters are in cover at the end of their turn, they will take reduced damage or entirely evade harm. However, if they aren't in cover at the end of your turn, enemies will get a "One More" and can deal an additional round of damage.</p><p>Elemental attacks also inflict ailments onto enemies. Fire attacks, like Agi, will deal extra damage at the end of the affected enemy's turn, for example, while electrical attacks, like Zio, will prevent affected enemies from moving. If you hit an enemy that has taken cover with a skill, you'll get a One More and get the chance to hit them again. In this way, and with other abilities, you can chain together attacks to deal continual damage.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-persona-5-tactica-twists-rpg-systems-into-a-tactical-treat/1100-6516074/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Mr. Krabs was feeling it earlier this week once again when it was discovered that a banned SpongeBob SquarePants episode made its way to Paramount+ via Amazon Prime Video, only to be pulled again.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/banned-spongebob-squarepants-episode-returns-due-to-glitch-promptly-banned-again">IGN</a>, we know that "Mid-life Crustacean" was the episode in question, and it was viewable because of a "technical error." In Mid-life Crustacean, Mr. Krabs deals with a mid-life crisis. So to battle that, he decides to hang out with SpongeBob and Patrick, which eventually leads them to go on a "panty raid," where Mr. Krabs steals his mom's underwear.</p><p dir="ltr">Mid-life Crustacean has been out of rotation for the past five years. When Paramount+ launched last year, a Nickelodeon representative stated that the episode was removed because it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spongebob-squarepants-mid-life-crustacean-episode-removed-from-paramount/1100-6489459/">"determined some story elements were not kid-appropriate."</a> Many fans believe it was pulled primarily due to the "panty raid" scene.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banned-spongebob-episode-returns-to-streaming-gets-pulled-again/1100-6516075/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Destiny 2's big four seasonal games provide some of the best-looking gear every year, but when it comes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-solstice-event-date-new-rewards-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515958/">Solstice</a>, those rewards are both stylish and functional. The Event Card, which is unlocked at the start of Solstice, tasks you with completing several objectives that'll reward you with Solstice-related gear and resources, and can once again be upgraded to unlock exclusive items in the game.</p><p>This year's armor sets once again feature an option to handcraft them into armor pieces that have desired stats, so whether you're looking for a helmet that can help you reduce your Super cooldowns, gauntlets that amplify restorative effects, or chest armor that provides you with plenty of resilience, Solstice is the event to grind through for some of the best gear in Destiny 2.</p><p>On the weapons side, Solstice also introduces the first-ever Strand rocket launcher to the game world. Rocket launchers typically have the best DPS in Destiny 2, while Strand-energy weapons allow for a variety of beneficial effects that ties quite nicely into the subclass. Like other events, Solstice will have its own Event Card that you can upgrade to unlock rare gear. Alternatively, you can also pay to unlock a premium version of the Event Card, which offers several extra cosmetic items.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-solstice-2023-rewards-all-the-weapons-armor-and-exotics-available/1100-6516019/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Unstoppable monsters and bosses in their stagger state instead will take 110-130% increased damage from damage-over-time effects.

<p>Microsoft is reportedly negotiating an extension of its acquisition contract with Activision Blizzard, as of July 17. The contract is set to expire Tuesday, July 18.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/microsoft-talks-extend-deal-contract-with-activision-source-2023-07-17/">Reuters</a>, the two companies will continue to negotiate the extension, even if a resolution is not reached by the end of day July 18. To be clear, the expiration of the contract does not necessarily mean that acquisition will not occur; it simply means either company has the legal power to walk away from the deal. According to the report, Microsoft wants to make sure that Activision does not enter into a contract with another acquirer or back away from the acquisition.</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wins-court-case-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/1100-6515704/">Federal Trade Commission lost its case against Microsoft</a>, the key obstacle against the tech giant's acquisition of Activision is the UK's Competition And Markets Authority (CMA). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uk-blocked-the-microsoft-activision-merger-so-what-happens-next/1100-6513589/">The CMA previously decided against the acquisition</a>, citing concerns about cloud gaming.

<p>Actor Matt Damon was planning to take a break from acting, but then Christopher Nolan called and offered him a role in his new movie, Oppenheimer. In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/jF2q-PsLVFI">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Damon said he and his wife agreed in couples therapy that he would take time off from acting--with one exception. Should Nolan come calling, Damon would be able to break his agreement and return to acting, and that's exactly what happened.</p><p>"I had negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off. I had been in Interstellar, then Chris put me on ice for a couple movies. I actually negotiated in couples therapy that the one caveat to me taking time off was if Chris Nolan called," Damon said.

When it was first revealed for PS5, Sony's marketing would often mention how Rift Apart was only possible on that system thanks to its solid state drive, but since then, a few advancements in rendering technology have made it possible for the game's PC port to work on older technology.</p><p>Rift Apart uses DirectStorage 1.2 and GPU decompression to load assets quickly, Nixxes senior lead programmer Richard van der Laan explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/18/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-specs-and-new-features-revealed/?sf267956570=1">PS Blog update</a>. "DirectStorage ensures quick loading times, and GPU decompression is used at high graphics settings to stream assets in the background while playing. Traditionally, this decompression is handled by the CPU, but at a certain point, there is an advantage to letting the GPU handle this, as this enables a higher bandwidth for streaming assets from storage to the graphics card. We use this to quickly load high-quality textures and environments with a high level of detail."</p><p>DirectStorage fully utilizes the speed of fast PCIe NVMe SSDs, but is also compatible with SATA SSDs and even traditional hard disk drives, making the game capable of using the same technology for loading data regardless of the storage device that you have installed. According to the PC requirements listed below, you'll only be able to run the game on an HDD using very low settings, and for everything else, an SSD is recommended.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-pc-requirements-reveal-how-the-game-can-run-without-ssd/1100-6516049/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Like several other classic games over the last few years, Portal Prelude--a free and unofficial prequel to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/portal/">Portal</a>--is getting a big graphical update. Available on July 18, Portal Prelude RTX overhauls the game and adds several new features that Nvidia GPU owners can take advantage of, including full ray tracing, performance improvements via DLSS 3, minimized system latency through Nvidia Reflex, and faster load times for textures through Nvidia RTX IO.</p><p>This version of the game will be available as a free download on Steam and playable for anyone who owns the original version of Portal, and new GeForce Game Ready drivers will be available to complete the transformation. An unofficial Portal prequel first released in 2008, Portal: Prelude is a community remaster that is set before the time of GLaDOS and offers a more challenging experience that's composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, and a fully voiced story with NPCs.</p><div>          </div><p>Nvidia collaborated with Nicolas "NykO18" Grevet, the original creator of Portal Prelude, and modder David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm to modernize the game and add new features such as path tracing. The team of five modders spent eight months upgrading the game, adding full ray tracing, hand-crafted high-resolution textures, and enhanced high-polygon models. To get the most out of these new enhancements, users will need to own one of Nvidia's newer GPUs such as RTX 4080 and 4090, although previous 20- and 30-series GPUs can still benefit from the Portal upgrades.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/portal-is-getting-a-surprise-graphical-makeover-from-nvidia/1100-6516043/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

According to creative director Stephane Boudon, who responded to a fan question in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session, Mirage will be a standalone game.</p><p>"For now, Mirage has no plan[s] for DLC or extensive post-launch," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/14yjq5i/comment/jrt98n6">Boudon wrote</a>.</p><p>This is something og a surprise move for Ubisoft, given its history of DLC-focused post-launch support for its games. Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey saw several expansions released that added more mythical elements to those games, while Assassin's Creed Valhalla had two years of DLC and live-season content that rolled out over the months.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-has-no-dlc-plans-for-now/1100-6516045/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Rumored information about this year's new Call of Duty game emerged in recent days, and now Activision itself has seemingly responded to acknowledge the supposed leaks. One of the rumors circling around COD 2023 is that Operators, weapons, and bundles from Modern Warfare II will carry forward to the new game.</p><p>The official Call of Duty Twitter account recent posed a poll to its millions of followers, asking if Operators, weapons, and bundles should carry forward to Call of Duty 2023. The answers to the poll were "Yes" and "Yes, when is reveal?" So this seems to be a tongue-in-cheek way for Activision to acknowledge the recent rumors without giving too much away ahead of the official reveal.</p><p>It's not a definite confirmation at this point, but it sure sounds like content from Modern Warfare II will carry forward to this year's game, and fans who invested time and money are probably happy to hear that. 2023's Call of Duty is rumored to be Modern Warfare III, with Sledgehammer Games leading development and support from Activision's network of studios as is normal for development on the COD series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2023-may-carry-forward-operators-guns-and-bundles-from-mw2/1100-6516044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
