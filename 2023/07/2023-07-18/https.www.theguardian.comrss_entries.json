Critics are not the most reliable guides. We sit in the best seats, don\u2019t have to pay, and are there to assess the performance rather than the building. If ever I have wanted guidance on architectural issues, I have turned to Iain Mackintosh, who from 1973 worked for Theatre Projects Consultants, has designed many successful theatres and has now put his encyclopedic knowledge into a book called <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/theatre-spaces-19202020-9781350056244/\">Theatre Spaces 1920-2020</a>. But the revelation comes in the subtitle: Finding the Fun in Functionalism. At the heart of the book lies an assault on modernist concrete buildings and a celebration of any theatre where actor and audience enjoy an easy rapport.</p><p>Mackintosh covers a lot of ground and tells a number of good stories, two of which relate to the old Shakespeare Memorial theatre in Stratford, which opened in 1932. Derided at the time as a \u201cjam factory\u201d, yet capable of infinite adaptation, it has long been attributed to a 29-year-old modernist architect, Elisabeth Scott. But Mackintosh implicitly endorses the view that it was the work of her father, Maurice Chesterton (cousin of the famous GK). He also quotes a story about Tyrone Guthrie, on being offered co-directorship of the theatre in 1950 by Anthony Quayle, saying he would only accept if they built a new theatre with the audience on three sides. Asked what should be done with the existing theatre, Guthrie replied, \u201cBulldoze it and push it into the river.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.str.org.uk/product/theatre-spaces-1920-2020-finding-the-fun-in-functionalism/\">Theatre Spaces: 1920-2020</a> is published by The Society for Theatre Research and Bloomsbury-Methuen</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/18/the-plays-the-thing-but-its-success-depends-on-the-theatre-too\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/18/the-plays-the-thing-but-its-success-depends-on-the-theatre-too", "date_published": "2023-07-18T16:35:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "British Commonwealth Games bid encouraged after 2026 hosts withdraw", "description": "<ul><li>Australian state of Victoria pull out due to high costs</li><li>Organisers describe UK as fantastic hosts and are open to talks</li></ul><p>Organisers have said they would welcome any offer from the United Kingdom to step in as hosts of the 2026 Commonwealth Games after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/18/australia-commonwealth-games-2026-victoria-cancels-event-after-funding-shortfall\">withdrawal of the Australian state of Victoria</a> on Tuesday left the event\u2019s future in serious doubt.</p><p>The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) said it was given only eight hours\u2019 notice before the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced the state would no longer host the 2026 Games due to spiralling costs.

Can I get close to that result indoors?<br /></strong><em><strong>Justin, Bournemouth</strong></em><br />Well, yes and no. \u201cHow grilling works is that the fat drips on to the coals below and it smokes, which permeates the meat. So you can\u2019t really recreate that, for obvious reasons,\u201d says David Carter, chef-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/06/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-smokestak-london-one-glorious-considered-pose\">Smokestak</a> in London.</p><p>That said, there are a few tactics Justin can deploy to get close. The first and simplest, says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jacksteinchef/?hl=en\">Jack Stein</a>, chef-director at <a href=\"https://rickstein.com/restaurants/\">Rick Stein Restaurants</a>, is to use a griddle pan: \u201cIt gives you the ability to get those charred bar marks on whatever you\u2019re cooking.\u201d That\u2019s the route Patrick Williams, chef-patron of <a href=\"https://www.kuducollective.com/\">Kudu Collective</a> in south-east London, would take for meat: \u201cIf you\u2019re cooking a T-bone or similar, get the pan raging hot, then, to get more flavour, put the meat in a tray with loads of garlic, rosemary, thyme and ember oil.\u201d The oil, he says, is the key to instant smokiness, although, admittedly, that would require Justin to barbecue the meat at some point. \u201cWe take a leftover briquette [charcoal], chuck it in a pot of oil, cover and seal \u2013 it gives the oil an intense, smoky sweetness, and we then use it in dressings or sauces to baste fish, meat, or vegetables.\u201d</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

Yet, for all the hype, this is not the first time Barbie has found herself cast as the lead in a film. Much like mumblecore queen Gerwig herself, Barbie first arrived on screen as an insurgent outsider. Back in 1987, Todd Haynes, later the director behind contemporary classics such as Carol, Safe and Far from Heaven, cast a downmarket version of the popular doll in the title role of Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story. The underground classic charts the rise and tragic demise of singer Karen Carpenter and her breezily Californian musical stylings, using whittled down Barbie-style dolls to illustrate the worsening anorexia that eventually led to her untimely death in 1983. Thanks to a spot of litigation from the Carpenter estate, this long out-of-circulation film is today most likely to be watched on iffy YouTube bootleg.</p><p>Superstar draws a parallel between these two American icons \u2013 Carpenter and Barbie \u2013 and dramatises the former\u2019s decline against newsreel footage of America at war.

Brought up on a Norfolk farm, Russia lover, adventurer and correspondent, this complex narrator is both at the heart and at the edge of a remarkable attempt to uncover the wildest and least known frontier of Europe. Brave, stubborn but amusingly self-effacing, he sets himself a 1,000-mile walk from the Black Sea to the Caspian, along the string of mountainous republics that make up Russia\u2019s southern border. Across dramatic landscapes, he engages with a timeless world of shepherds who graze their flocks in the \u201cmystical\u201d highlands in summer, only to return to a patchwork of ethnic and religious communities in winter. Parfitt unravels how the Caucasus form \u201ca landscape of unfinished histories\u201d, histories misunderstood and often untold. On this \u201csaunter to the brink of madness\u201d, he runs into bears, wars and \u201cpermanent zones of counter-terrorist organisation\u201d.

He was witness to the inhumanity of the hostage takers and to the catastrophic \u201crescue attempt\u201d; 333 hostages died of which 186 were children. That night President Putin told the nation what he had learned: \u201cWe showed ourselves to be weak. And the weak get beaten.\u201d The events of those days left Parfitt not only with first-hand insight into a \u201cmerciless, blundering state\u201d but with a recurring nightmare: a falling woman, her left hand grasping the air, groaning like a wounded animal as she learns her child was killed in the school. This trauma set him on his mad trek on foot, \u201cnot as a reporter, but as a human being, as someone moved, and horrified, confused and intoxicated\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/18/high-caucasus-mountain-quest-in-russia-haunted-hinterland-by-tom-parfitt-review-one-man-and-a-mountain-range\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/18/high-caucasus-mountain-quest-in-russia-haunted-hinterland-by-tom-parfitt-review-one-man-and-a-mountain-range", "date_published": "2023-07-18T06:00:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Iraq\u2019s Invisible Beauty review \u2013 a photographer\u2019s eye on a vanished history", "description": "<p>Latif al-Ani has been documenting his country since the 1950s, with many of his subjects now destroyed.

Six months later they were performing at Spoleto arts festival in Italy. Can an island with the population of Woking sustain a national ballet company? And how did a Canadian end up launching it?</p><p>It started almost by accident, but making it work has been an act of determined design. Ramsay danced with the Cuban National Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo and the Norwegian National Ballet. She is immediately recognisable as a ballet dancer: upright posture, tidy, stylish appearance. She moans a little as she shifts in her chair. \u201cMy back\u2019s killing me.\u201d It is the telltale legacy of a prolapsed disc that expedited the end of her dancing career. Leaving ballet is like leaving the military: in a flash, you lose your life\u2019s structure. So Ramsay\u2019s strategy was to jump straight into a new project. She trained to be a pilot in Canada and got her licence. \u201cBut it turns out that I have too short an attention span to be in a small box that long,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I got into the operations side of aviation.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/18/we-will-reach-everyone-in-jersey-eventually-island-ballet-companys-giant-leap\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/18/we-will-reach-everyone-in-jersey-eventually-island-ballet-companys-giant-leap", "date_published": "2023-07-18T05:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Where is Qin Gang?

When the sound of gunfire began to ring around parts of Khartoum early one Saturday in April, calls from family and friends in the city sounded relatively little alarm. People were hearing that there had been skirmishes near the airport, and reported seeing pickup trucks ferrying troops at speed across the city. Those nearer central Khartoum said that they heard the sound of artillery, but others said there was in fact no gunfire, only loud explosions, and speculated that perhaps they were the result of military training exercises. A minority suspected it was the start of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/sudan-outsider-hemedti-mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-leader-militia-army-war-conflict\" title=\"\">a clash between two military factions</a> that had been jostling for power for months, but no one could foresee the scale of what was about to happen.

I was in London, and the news came to me in a horror reel of videos posted on social media and sent on WhatsApp. People trying to leave from Khartoum airport crouched in terror, sheltering from loud explosions. Planes preparing for takeoff were bombed on the runway. Military aircraft screeched across the skies of the capital, clumsily bombing militia targets positioned in civilian areas and levelling residential neighbourhoods. Tanks rolled through the city, crushing cars under their tracks. It was the last days of Ramadan, and the streets, which had only hours before been full of people preparing for Eid festivities, were now strewn with dead bodies.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/18/all-that-we-had-is-gone-my-lament-for-war-torn-khartoum\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/18/all-that-we-had-is-gone-my-lament-for-war-torn-khartoum", "date_published": "2023-07-18T04:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Vast\u2019 growth in value of England rentals since 1990 would have built 3m council homes", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Private rentals have grown \u00a3400bn in value \u2013 making a mockery of landlords\u2019 demands for tax cuts, say campaigners</p><p>Private landlords in England have made enough money from rising house prices in the last three decades to build at least 3m council homes, research suggests.</p><p>Owners of private rental properties have seen their assets grow in value by \u00a3400bn since 1990, equivalent to the amount needed to build more than 50 times the number of council homes that were actually built in England in that period.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/18/vast-growth-in-value-of-england-rentals-since-1990-would-have-built-3m-council-homes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/18/vast-growth-in-value-of-england-rentals-since-1990-would-have-built-3m-council-homes", "date_published": "2023-07-18T04:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US sends more fighter jets and warship to Gulf after Iran attempts to seize tankers", "description": "<p>US military builds up presence in and around Strait of Hormuz in response to \u2018continued threat\u2019 to commercial shipping</p><p>The US is sending additional fighter jets and a warship to the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman to increase security after Iranian attempts to seize commercial ships.</p><p>The latest deployments come after Iran tried to seize two oil tankers near the strait this month, opening fire on one of them.
