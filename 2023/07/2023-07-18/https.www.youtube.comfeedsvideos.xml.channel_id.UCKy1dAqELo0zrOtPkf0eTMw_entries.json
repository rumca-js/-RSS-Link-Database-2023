Instead of offsetting its expected $3 billion dollar loss some other way, NBC will be passing those \u201csavings\u201d over to consumers of the streaming service - raising the commercial-free #Peacock Premium Plus subscription from $9.99 to $11.99. The change is expected to take place August 17th. This move comes at the heels of the removal of Peacock\u2019s free subscription tier for new users, and the removal of the Peacock Premium and Comcast Xfinity bundle. 2023 has been a strange year for streaming services, as Peacock wasn\u2019t alone in price hikes. Both Max and Paramount Plus raised its prices this year, with Disney Plus and Hulu doing the same just a year prior. Ms. Marvel appears to be stretching over from Disney Plus to broadcast television. Ms. Marvel will be making its debut on ABC, marking it as the first original Marvel Disney Plus series to hit broadcast TV.\n\n#IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOD2AHN18OI", "date_published": "2023-07-18T23:18:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WOD2AHN18OI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Barbie Review", "description": "Barbie reviewed by Alyssa Mora.\n\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie is a masterful exploration of femininity and the pressures of perfection.

On why the company will be scaling back, he said, \u201cYou pull back not just to focus, but also as part of our cost-containment initiative. Spending less on what we make, and making less. 2021 Disney bombarded us with 5 Marvel Disney Plus shows and 4 #MCU films - that\u2019s a total of 9 different, unrelated projects.

In its place will be the new Game Pass Core plan, starting at $9.99. It's the end of an era for the subscription service, which launched ten years ago for the Xbox 360 and helped define the online console gaming experience that we know today. And if you're still a subscriber, you don't have to do anything; if you don't cancel you will automatically be rolled over into the Game Pass Core plan. In other Xbox news, Microsoft and Sony have signed an agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. This follows the huge legal victory Microsoft won last week against the FTC that sought to block their pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In other news, the narrative lead of the upcoming Fable game is leaving developer Playground Games. The split is said to be mutual. And finally, Ubisoft has clarified that Star Wars: Outlaws' worlds won't be procedurally generated, and each planet could be as large as two or three zones in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.\n\n\nPhoto by RDNE Stock project: https://www.pexels.com/photo/gray-and-white-tombstone-6841500/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0jzbzP8UI", "date_published": "2023-07-18T00:52:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Gx0jzbzP8UI/hqdefault.jpg"}]
