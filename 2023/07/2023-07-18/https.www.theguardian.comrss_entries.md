## Is Cricket Racist? review – the answer can only be one thing: ‘very’

<p>There is no denying the racism in the sport – but the shocking consequences of it are even more appalling than you might imagine</p><p>One of the weirdest things about racism, be it in person, on social media or emailed directly to a TV critic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/10/queen-cleopatra-review-a-fun-drama-weighed-down-by-the-self-serious-need-to-educate">who dared to say a Cleopatra docudrama was fine</a>, is that it so often comes with a caveat. First you get the bigotry, then a quick explanation that racism doesn’t exist anyhow. While a troll may spend their time trying to make people of colour hate themselves, they frequently claim that their use of racial slurs is born from the pure heart of a person who lives in a post-racial utopia. But unless viewers watch Channel 4’s Is Cricket Racist? with their eyes closed (broadcast as it is a few weeks after the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket’s report found “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/27/english-cricket-is-racist-sexist-and-elitist-says-landmark-report">widespread and deep-rooted” racism</a>), there is no denying that racism exists in the sport. So much so, that the answer to the question in the documentary’s title can only be: “Very.”</p><p>This programme sees the actor and presenter Adil Ray investigate a troubled time for cricket <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/27/ecb-yorkshire-record-fine-cricket-discipline-commission">after the Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq spoke publicly about the racism he endured at the county cricket club</a>. Ray covers the fallout, his personal experiences as a fan and the historic institutional biases in the sport. But even in light of the recent report and media coverage, the documentary is genuinely shocking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/19/is-cricket-racist-review-the-answer-can-only-be-one-thing-very">Continue reading...</a>

## Call Me a Lioness: Melanie C, Self Esteem and more record song for Women’s World Cup

<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Ahead of the World Cup on Thursday, 11 British female artists have joined forces for a new terrace anthem. They explain why they want to give young girls ‘something to shout and sing together’</p><p>The high drama and unplumbable emotional depths of England’s footballing adventures have long been heightened by song, from official tournament tie-ins such as New Order’s World in Motion to fan-generated favourites such as dance track turned terrace chant Freed from Desire. Now, ahead of the Women’s World Cup kicking off on Thursday in Australia and New Zealand, the England women’s team hope to have a crowd-pleasing singalong of their own: Call Me a Lioness.</p><p>A starting 11 of female-identifying British artists, including Melanie C and Self Esteem, have come together under the moniker Hope FC to record the unofficial track for England’s World Cup campaign. Songwriter Glen Roberts was hit by inspiration as the Lionesses won Euro 2022 and co-wrote it with producer Joel Pott and singer-songwriter Olivia Dean. Rather than focusing on the sometimes miserable experience of being a fan of the underdog – as Baddiel, Skinner and the Lightning Seeds did on their enduring Euro 96 hit Three Lions – it puts fans into the players’ mindset in the dreamlike aftermath of their 2022 victory, and manifests another: “We’re bringing it home again”, as one of several chantable lines goes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/19/call-me-a-lioness-melanie-c-self-esteem-song-for-womens-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Greta Gerwig’s bubblegum-fun-cum-feminist-thesis indulges Ken but pulls its punches as it trips between satire and advert</p><p>Are Barbie dolls demeaning or empowering? Director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/09/it-had-to-be-totally-bananas-greta-gerwig-on-bringing-barbie-back-to-life">Greta Gerwig</a> and her co-writer Noah Baumbach opt for the latter theory in this beamingly affectionate and deliriously pink-themed fantasy comedy-adventure produced by Barbie’s corporate manufacturer Mattel, and starring Margot Robbie whose own superhuman blond beauty makes her the only possible casting as Barbie herself. It is maybe down to Gerwig’s confidence and generosity as a feminist film-maker that she gives all the best lines to Ryan Gosling, who is allowed to steal the whole film playing Barbie’s non-genitaled boyfriend, Ken.</p><p>Yet the film has to keep second-guessing and pre-empting the anti-Barbie impulse with a stream of knowing references and self-aware meta-gags, which acknowledge that, sure, yes, Barbie’s uber-blond-slim persona is arguably conformist and oppressive, but we know all that, we’re past all that; these charges are redeemed by Barbie’s ethereal innocence and there is in any case now a range of Barbies, diverse in terms of ethnicity and body-image – among whom Robbie is first among equals as Stereotypical Barbie – including a wheelchair-using Barbie. But even this is hedged with a quirky admission that the real world that imposed these changes is still itself imperfect and tokenist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/barbie-review-greta-gerwig-delirious-bubblegum-fantasy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Current Labour leader and former Labour PM find validation in onstage love-in</p><p>How things change. You wouldn’t have caught Ed Miliband or Jeremy Corbyn having a love-in with Tony Blair at his thinktank’s annual Future of Britain conference. Then again, I doubt they would have got an invite. It would have been a bit like chucking a slab of kryptonite into the mix. No one would have got out alive.</p><p>Keir Starmer is a different breed of Labour leader. A man with an eye on the Downing Street prize. A pragmatist who will do whatever it takes to win an election. Someone who will happily pivot from being a paid up member of Corbyn’s shadow cabinet to dumping his former boss like a stone. Who recognises politics is a grubby game – one where allegiances can be short-lived – and all that matters is winning. There’s nothing to be gained by being on the right side of the argument if you’re left twiddling your thumbs on the opposition benches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/18/blair-and-starmer-bask-in-each-others-reflected-glory">Continue reading...</a>

In a new report, the MPs say that the problem of so-called dental deserts – where it is impossible to register with an NHS dental practice – is getting worse rather than better. About 3,000 dentists have left the NHS since the start of the pandemic. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/dental-deserts-form-in-england-as-dentists-quit-nhs-experts-warn" title="">Shortages</a> are particularly acute in the east of England, where there is nowhere to train.

Those affected include pregnant women and children, who should be able to access free care (most other people contribute to the cost of treatment). There has also been a steep decline in the ability of care homes to provide dental care for residents. From 67% in 2019, the number of providers who say they have access to dentists fell last year to just 35%. In one survey, 8% of people said that they had not seen a dentist for more than 10 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/18/the-guardian-view-on-dentists-the-lack-of-care-for-childrens-teeth-is-a-disgrace">Continue reading...</a>

So what social forces will he unleash?, 16 July</a>). At last a journalist is challenging the Labour/Tory nonsense about spending money on our cash-starved public services being “unaffordable”, because there is “no new funding available”. Of course, when Keir Starmer writes or speaks, the 13 years of unnecessary austerity are “pretty much unmentioned”, as Harris says, as they were the result of political choices which, it seems, the Labour leader is about to replicate.</p><p>Starmer’s insistence that what is needed is “reform” is correct, but not of our underfunded education, health and care services, where cash injections are needed immediately, if only to stop the outward flow of essential staff. Where reform is really needed is in the taxation system: the rich and high earners have to pay more; the oft-suggested equalisation of capital gains and income tax has to become a reality; the tax gap of £32bn has to be reduced; all tax reliefs need assessing; and all loopholes, especially those in inheritance tax, have to be closed.<br /><strong>Bernie Evans </strong><br /><em>Liverpool</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/18/elect-keir-starmer-on-thursday-and-fight-him-on-friday">Continue reading...</a>

One moment, she’s driving a car down a nondescript stretch of the Bahamas, responding to a question from an unseen passenger about mortality. “Honestly, I don’t think about death,” she says in Italian, her native language. “I’m not afraid of death. I’ve never thought freediving could lead to death.” The next, she’s in the water, holding the start position for a competitive freediver, sucking in deep gulps of air that will have to sustain her for more than three minutes.</p><p>At the signal, her lithe body shoots down like an arrow. The camera tracks her, hand over hand along a vertical rope, then in free fall – past other divers with cameras, past the upper and lower lips of a coral shelf, past any differentiation in the vast blue, past the color blue at all, some 100m (328ft) down. And then all the way back up, hand over hand. It’s such an excruciatingly long time without breath that, watching it, I began to lose mine. The scene is soundtracked only by an ever-slowing heartbeat, fainting away. Zecchini’s body starts twitching, in need of air. In competitive freediving, you either return to the surface under your own power – signaling “OK” to qualify a passing dive – or you don’t, requiring assistance from a team of safety divers to ferry you to air, sometimes conscious, sometimes requiring immediate resuscitation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/18/the-deepest-breath-freediving-netflix-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not all buildings are created equal. From sightlines to acoustics to the alchemy of actor-audience rapport, the physical facts of a dramatic space are fundamental</p><p>What makes a good theatre? Critics are not the most reliable guides. We sit in the best seats, don’t have to pay, and are there to assess the performance rather than the building. If ever I have wanted guidance on architectural issues, I have turned to Iain Mackintosh, who from 1973 worked for Theatre Projects Consultants, has designed many successful theatres and has now put his encyclopedic knowledge into a book called <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/theatre-spaces-19202020-9781350056244/">Theatre Spaces 1920-2020</a>. But the revelation comes in the subtitle: Finding the Fun in Functionalism. At the heart of the book lies an assault on modernist concrete buildings and a celebration of any theatre where actor and audience enjoy an easy rapport.</p><p>Mackintosh covers a lot of ground and tells a number of good stories, two of which relate to the old Shakespeare Memorial theatre in Stratford, which opened in 1932. Derided at the time as a “jam factory”, yet capable of infinite adaptation, it has long been attributed to a 29-year-old modernist architect, Elisabeth Scott. But Mackintosh implicitly endorses the view that it was the work of her father, Maurice Chesterton (cousin of the famous GK). He also quotes a story about Tyrone Guthrie, on being offered co-directorship of the theatre in 1950 by Anthony Quayle, saying he would only accept if they built a new theatre with the audience on three sides. Asked what should be done with the existing theatre, Guthrie replied, “Bulldoze it and push it into the river.”</p><p><a href="https://www.str.org.uk/product/theatre-spaces-1920-2020-finding-the-fun-in-functionalism/">Theatre Spaces: 1920-2020</a> is published by The Society for Theatre Research and Bloomsbury-Methuen</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/18/the-plays-the-thing-but-its-success-depends-on-the-theatre-too">Continue reading...</a>

According to Rego’s son Nick Willing in the exhibition catalogue, the late Portuguese-British artist saw the National Gallery as a place whose paintings “were made almost entirely by men and reflected the male experience”. When she became its first Associate Artist in 1990, “we joked that she was … in the belly of the beast”, Willing says. But “Paula erupted out of the belly of the beast stronger … exploring themes that quietly challenged the patriarchy to examine itself”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/18/paula-rego-crivellis-garden-review-the-scissors-i-get-but-whats-with-the-frog">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The much-hyped showdown between Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer isn’t the first time two cinematic titans have gone to war</p><p>Some defect in the homo sapiens brain compels us to see everything in terms of competition – all the world grouped by trials of skill and supremacy into a binary of winners and losers. This is of course how we wound up with the concept of sport – and, probably, war – but the internet’s never-ending ticker of discourse is applying this mindset to the arts with increasing frequency, creative expression simplified into a horse race that lets fans prognosticate and claim bragging rights. During the heydays of Game of Thrones and Succession, viewers readjusted their power rankings week by week in an attempt to predict the plotlines’ ultimate victors. In the streets, snapping gangs of Swifties rumble with squadrons of the BTS army. In the replies of any tweet announcing some significant pop-cultural happening, whether it be a greenlit sequel or news of another studio album, it’s not uncommon to see triumphant diehards crowing en masse, “WE WON.”</p><p>Over the past few months, this pathology has reached a fever pitch in the lead-up to an epochal box-office showdown slated for this coming Friday. In the red corner, weighing in at seven-and-a-quarter ounces, it’s the foot-tall wrecking ball, Greta Gerwig’s high-fructose feat of pop artistry, Barbie. And in the blue corner, he has become death, destroyer of worlds and possibly per-theater gross records, the bomb-daddy himself, Christopher Nolan’s stolid second world war period piece, Oppenheimer. Can he unleash the firepower to reduce the iconic plaything to an ashen crater? Or will this tenacious little hunk of plastic have what it takes to withstand waves of atomic radiation? Plenty of fence-sitters have withheld their allegiance by booking a double feature, but the impending cineplex Götterdämmerung still speaks to something fundamental about how and why we pit movies against one another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/18/barbie-oppenheimer-movies-same-release-date-edited--oppenheimer-movies-released-same-day-box-office-greta-gerwig-christopher-nolanbarbie-oppenheimer-movies-same-release-date-edited-">Continue reading...</a>

The satirist was in the West End performing his Denis Thatcher routine in the smash hit Anyone for Denis? But the subject of our conversation was not the husband of the then prime minister, nothing to do with the UK, nor in fact anything from the 20th century at all. Instead we discussed the events of 1778 and how watchmaker, arms dealer and spy <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Augustin-Caron-de-Beaumarchais">Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais</a> had come to write The Marriage of Figaro.</p><p>It was a sequel to his 1773 play Barber of Seville and Wells had written a new English translation. He explained that now, if a book or play was a huge success, it became a movie. In the 18th century, it would become an opera. Mozart delivered Figaro in 1786; 30 years later Rossini wrote The Barber of Seville. It was easy to see why Wells would have wanted to tackle Figaro. The play viciously skewers the aristocracy. Napoleon Bonaparte said it was “the Revolution already put into action”. It was a dangerous success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/18/mozart-didnt-have-explosions-simon-mayo-on-how-his-book-itch-became-an-opera">Continue reading...</a>

<p>People whose lives were destroyed deserve justice. And those responsible are contriving to make sure they don’t get it</p><p>Pop your teeth-grinding guards in and gather round, because it’s time to talk about the Post Office scandal again. It remains something of a downer that the most widespread injustice in British legal history doesn’t get the full-spectrum fever coverage that is lavished on more frivolous news – but then, the forces formerly known as The Man have always wanted this one covered up. Don’t worry if you’re only belatedly catching up. The second-best time to start absolutely losing your mind that any of it was allowed to happen is right now, while the official inquiry is under way and precisely NO ONE has yet been held accountable for the ruin of hundreds of completely innocent lives, and the causing of deep suffering in thousands more.</p><p>Box office-wise, despite its slow burn, the Post Office story has it all. It’s a tale of total corporate psychopathy, a mad Kafka-esque nightmare in which totally innocent subpostmasters, the very backbone of villages and communities, were turned into criminals to cover up the fact that the Post Office’s Horizon computer system didn’t work properly. Each was told by the Post Office that no one else had any problems with the system. Vast sums were effectively looted from them to make up accounting shortfalls, before they were prosecuted anyway. Distraught subpostmasters were imprisoned pregnant, or still in their teens, or on their young child’s birthday, or in their old age, or in high-security jails where they saw and suffered terrible things. At least <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/another-post-office-subpostmaster-wrongly-26795108">60 have died</a> without seeing <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/post-office-scandal-another-postmaster-dies-without-compensation-050lsc2k9">justice or compensation</a>; at least four took their own lives.

<p>Sky-high entitlement is causing havoc, with passengers baring their feet and complaining about their meals. Another reason to give up flying, writes Arwa Mahdawi</p><p>Here is your mission, should you choose to accept it: you have to get from point A to point B in an aeroplane without causing an international incident or inspiring a viral TikTok about what an entitled nitwit you are. Sounds simple, right? Apparently, it isn’t. About 76.9% of the general population, extensive analysis has led me to believe, seem to find this mission impossible.</p><p>You may have also noticed this phenomenon. It’s hard not to: there is a constant stream of headlines about airline passengers exhibiting sky-high entitlement. For example, earlier this month, a United Airlines flight from Houston to Amsterdam was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/united-airline-amsterdam-flight-diverted-airplane-food">diverted to Chicago</a> after a business class passenger became unruly. The reason? Their first choice of meal was unavailable. Authorities should have diverted the plane to The Hague, if you ask me. Having to deal with the ignominy of being served chicken instead of beef? It may sound paltry to unrefined ears, but if you’ve paid almost $7,000 for your ticket, it’s a veritable crime against humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/18/air-travel-brings-out-the-absolute-worst-in-people-from-faking-injuries-to-demanding-seat-swaps">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Griddle pans, charcoal oil and burnt herbs can all help emulate that charred flavour you desire, says our panel</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>Recipes often suggest that the meat, fish or vegetable element is best cooked on </strong><strong>a barbecue. Can I get close to that result indoors?<br /></strong><em><strong>Justin, Bournemouth</strong></em><br />Well, yes and no. “How grilling works is that the fat drips on to the coals below and it smokes, which permeates the meat. So you can’t really recreate that, for obvious reasons,” says David Carter, chef-founder of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/06/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-smokestak-london-one-glorious-considered-pose">Smokestak</a> in London.</p><p>That said, there are a few tactics Justin can deploy to get close. The first and simplest, says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacksteinchef/?hl=en">Jack Stein</a>, chef-director at <a href="https://rickstein.com/restaurants/">Rick Stein Restaurants</a>, is to use a griddle pan: “It gives you the ability to get those charred bar marks on whatever you’re cooking.” That’s the route Patrick Williams, chef-patron of <a href="https://www.kuducollective.com/">Kudu Collective</a> in south-east London, would take for meat: “If you’re cooking a T-bone or similar, get the pan raging hot, then, to get more flavour, put the meat in a tray with loads of garlic, rosemary, thyme and ember oil.” The oil, he says, is the key to instant smokiness, although, admittedly, that would require Justin to barbecue the meat at some point. “We take a leftover briquette [charcoal], chuck it in a pot of oil, cover and seal – it gives the oil an intense, smoky sweetness, and we then use it in dressings or sauces to baste fish, meat, or vegetables.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p><strong>O2 Academy, Glasgow</strong><br />The versatile US rapper directs the ebb and flow of the crowd in this energetic show of verbal dexterity and intimate narratives</p><p>‘If you listened to that shit, you’re forever part of my ecosystem,” JID proclaims before launching into tracks from 2022’s The Forever Story. That album signalled a shift towards soulful introspection for the Atlanta-born rapper, but his technical finesse and swagger remain intact at this energetic show, the first of four UK dates. From start to finish he is clearly appreciative of a crowd who have not just engaged with his new direction, but have properly absorbed his emotive storytelling.</p><p>In addition to that technical prowess – a verbal dexterity which has set him apart since 2017’s debut studio album The Never Story – his tracks are bolstered by live drums and instrumentation, adding more to the formula than the expected MC/DJ combo. Tracks such as the playful Dance Now, and the blistering verses of Workin Out – where JID flips the stereotypical rap boast to fret “I been working hella hard, shit ain’t really working out” – show real cohesion between each of the musicians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/18/jid-review-o2-academy-glasgow">Continue reading...</a>

## 40 years of the Nintendo Famicom – the console that changed the games industry

<p>Entering a crowded field, the Nintendo Famicom came to dominate the market in the 1980s, leaving a family orientated legacy that continues to be felt today</p><p>When the Nintendo Famicom, known abroad as the Nintendo Entertainment System, was launched on 15 July 1983, it entered a market crowded with formidable rivals. Six other consoles were released in Japan that year, including the Sega SG-1000, which arrived on the same day and would later be redesigned as the Master System in the west. Also in the running were the My Vision from Nichibutsu, the Pyuta Jr. from Tomy and the PV-1000 from Casio – all major consumer electronics manufacturers. But it was the Famicom that became a sales phenomenon, shifting more than 2.5m units by the end of 1984 and completely dominating the Japanese games industry.</p><p>When it was redesigned as the NES and launched in the US in 1985, it revitalised the country’s flagging games sector after an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/11/playtimes-over-how-2023-could-reshape-video-games">infamous crash</a> a few years earlier. Its reach was truly global: even in markets where the console wasn’t officially launched, bootlegged versions were rife. The Famicom is by far the most copied console of all time, and so called “Famiclones” are still being made now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/18/40-years-of-the-nintendo-famicom-the-console-that-changed-the-games-industry">Continue reading...</a>

## The banned Barbie film: her anguished first role as Karen Carpenter

<p>Todd Haynes animated the impossibly slender doll to show what drove the singer to her early death. The film has more in common than you might expect with Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster</p><p>Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, out next Friday, is the most anticipated film of the year. Yet, for all the hype, this is not the first time Barbie has found herself cast as the lead in a film. Much like mumblecore queen Gerwig herself, Barbie first arrived on screen as an insurgent outsider. Back in 1987, Todd Haynes, later the director behind contemporary classics such as Carol, Safe and Far from Heaven, cast a downmarket version of the popular doll in the title role of Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story. The underground classic charts the rise and tragic demise of singer Karen Carpenter and her breezily Californian musical stylings, using whittled down Barbie-style dolls to illustrate the worsening anorexia that eventually led to her untimely death in 1983. Thanks to a spot of litigation from the Carpenter estate, this long out-of-circulation film is today most likely to be watched on iffy YouTube bootleg.</p><p>Superstar draws a parallel between these two American icons – Carpenter and Barbie – and dramatises the former’s decline against newsreel footage of America at war. Early in the film, a tank firing off rounds is intercut with a domestic scene of Karen complaining about how unflattering her maxi dress is, while her mother’s spindly plastic limb snakes a measuring tape around her daughter’s waist and pronounces the measurements as if delivering a decree. Set in a time before anorexia was widely understood, these dolls’ domestic sphere was a psychological war zone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/18/barbie-first-film-role-as-karen-carpenter-greta-gerwig-todd-haynes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When I was a child, we used to wind down before the school holidays. Not this lot</p><p>It’s the last week of term, when kids should be watching a documentary about pyramids on a loop, every lesson, and teachers should be congratulating themselves all day long on another year survived. But times have changed since we were young. Now, the week is marked by outlandish demands. It starts when they’re tiny, no older than five: just as you’re leaving the house, they’ll announce it’s Victorian day and they need a bonnet and 25 packets of crisps. Wait, why the crisps? Why 25 packets? Because it’s a Victorian disco, <em>obviously</em>, and everyone in the class needs crisps. You dredge every corner of your psyche and figure that there is a pair of blue pants you own that will look like a bonnet if you safety-pin the leg holes shut. You get it on their head and it’s exactly right. You’re a genius. No, it needs to be green; the <em>other</em> class is in blue.</p><p>And with all the infinite sadness of time’s passing, as your tiny cute moppets morph into giant six-footers dedicated tirelessly to the delineation of your personal failings, there’ll be one upside, you think: no more bonnets. And they’ll be able to buy their own crisps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/18/the-kids-are-demanding-crisps-and-a-bonnet-and-a-rope-made-of-gold-i-hate-the-last-week-of-term">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Satire by German playwright Marius von Mayenburg will open next year at the Young Vic in London which will also revive Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming</p><p>Patrick Marber is to direct a new play at London’s Young Vic theatre in which a family argue over what to do with a piece of art that may have been painted by Adolf Hitler.</p><p>Nachtland, by the acclaimed German playwright Marius von Mayenburg (The Ugly One), is described as “a mordant satire about marriage, legacy, the rise of the new right and terrible impulses buried deep”. The play follows two siblings who are clearing out their late father’s house when they discover an old painting bearing Hitler’s name. It leads them to discuss whether they should keep, sell or destroy what could be the work of the Nazi leader.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/18/patrick-marber-nachtland-young-vic-marius-von-mayenburg">Continue reading...</a>

<p>USA are favourites for an unprecedented third World Cup win in a row but uncertainty surrounds an injury-ravaged team grappling with change</p><p>This is not the USA women’s team you think it is. Yes, USA are in search of an unprecedented third successive World Cup title. Yes, USA are still ranked No 1 in the world by Fifa. And yes, there is a target on their collective back as one of the perennial favourites at any major tournament. The players who won in 2019 though? They are mostly absent.</p><p>Just nine of the 23 named in USA’s World Cup squad were part of the triumph four years ago, of whom only five also took part at the 2015 tournament. News of captain Becky Sauerbrunn’s foot injury, which will keep her out of what would have been the 38-year-old’s fourth World Cup, only underscores the dramatic turnover that has played out during the past 18 months. If USA are to “threepeat”, they will do so with a vastly younger and less experienced group.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/18/usas-new-world-cup-generation-trying-to-keep-the-golden-era-alive">Continue reading...</a>

## Usos y Costumbres - Gabriel Chaile in collaboration with Laura Ojeda Bär

<p><strong>Studio Voltaire, London<br /></strong>Laura Ojeda Bär’s depictions of famous artworks jostle into position inside Gabriel Chaile’s unruly, adobe-plastered installation</p><p>‘I am the curator of my own misery,” reads a 2010 text by Douglas Gordon. Originally drawn in ballpoint pen direct on a gallery wall, it has now been carefully rendered in a small oil painting by Buenos Aires painter Laura Ojeda Bär. She hasn’t only painted the text, but also the wall it has been written on. Gordon’s pungent text has implications, and so too do the other artworks, from Tate and other British collections, which Bär has painted and ranged around the terracotta-coloured adobe-plastered walls of an installation created by the Argentinian sculptor Gabriel Chaile. Among them are <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/king-tra-la-la-t01206">Phillip King’s daft 1963 sculpture Tra-La-La</a>, an Alexander Calder mobile, a dangling Louise Bourgeois figure, <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/rachel-whiteread-hot-water-bottle-torsos/">Rachel Whiteread’s cast of the interior of a hot-water bottle</a>, an Easter Island head, a set of Dan Flavin neon tubes and an image of the <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1805-0703-43">Townley Diskobolos</a>, a classical Greek sculpture in the British Museum collection. These muted, precise paintings are at odds with the way they’re presented here.</p><p>Grouped as little conversations around the gallery and sometimes hung askew, Bär’s paintings argue among themselves. They jostle at odd, out-of-whack angles. One canvas tilts on the wall like a drunk, but the image on its surface maintains its poise and equilibrium, perfectly aligned to the horizontal and vertical. Usos y Costumbres, which translates as “customs and habits”, wrongfoots us at every turn. Everything, it seems, is unstable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/18/usos-y-costumbres-review-studio-voltaire-laura-ojeda-bar-gabriel-chaile">Continue reading...</a>

## My Name Is Alfred Hitchcock review – Mark Cousins’ cheeky and insightful study

<p>In this critically agile film, Hitchcock supposedly narrates from beyond the grave, using movie clips to reveal techniques and meanings in his work</p><p>Only a cinephile as passionate as Mark Cousins could have got away with this film, in all its hilarious presumption and cheek. It is a study of Alfred Hitchcock’s work, illustrated with clips chosen with tremendous insight and connoisseurship – and supposedly narrated from beyond the grave by Hitchcock himself, pointing out techniques, resonances, images, meanings and occasionally breaking off to check something with Cousins who will answer, off-mic: “Yes Mr Hitchcock.”</p><p>However, the script is Cousins’ own and the master himself is faked by the comic Alistair McGowan, whose vocal impersonation is just so eerily good that after a while I thought Cousins really had made this by sitting alone in some darkened Edwardian parlour with his tape recorder and Ouija board. But of course the voice is pure Cousins – which is to say, marvellously well-informed and critically agile. (He did something similar with his film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/09/the-eyes-of-orson-welles-review-cannes-mark-cousins">The Eyes of Orson Welles</a>, in which Welles (voiced by Jack Klaff) is imagined to have written a supportively nice letter to Cousins. It is also possible he was influenced here by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/01/double-take-review">Hitchcock doppelganger mashup movie Double Take</a> by Tom McCarthy and Johan Grimonprez. As I say, with anyone else, this kind of insouciant appropriation would be jarring. With Cousins you buy it, though there is some naivety, of which more in a moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/18/my-name-is-alfred-hitchcock-review-mark-cousins-cheeky-and-insightful-study">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A self-help book of sorts, this distillation of pre-Socratic philosophy succeeds in being both populist and profound</p><p>There was a wonderful, revelatory moment in Adam Nicolson’s last book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/life-between-the-tides-9780008294816">Life</a></em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/life-between-the-tides-9780008294816"> </a><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/life-between-the-tides-9780008294816">Between the Tides</a></em>, where he suddenly telescoped out from the Scottish rock pool he was describing in order to meditate on the work of the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, demonstrating how much we can still learn about our present-day world by turning to the great minds of the past. This dazzling passage of writing argued that engagement with the environment is always a philosophical act, and that the close looking of the naturalist is more similar than we might think to the work of the philosopher. As with his 2019 book about a year in the lives of the Romantic poets, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-making-of-poetry-9780008126490">The Making of Poetry</a></em>, this chapter about Heraclitus showed Nicolson at his illuminating, energetic best – scholarly without being schoolbookish, aware of the role that brilliant minds, well harnessed, can play in enlarging and enriching our appreciation of life.</p><p>It feels like that chapter was the launchpad for Nicolson’s latest book, <em>How to Be</em>, which is an elevated sort of self-help book about the origins of western philosophical thought. It is Nicolson’s 25th book in a career spanning 40 years and an array of genres – early in his 60s, he even turned his hand to fiction and was longlisted for the <em>Sunday Times </em>audible short story award. What links all his writing, though, is a tireless and tiggerish sense of wonder and curiosity; a bounding willingness to immerse himself and his reader deeply in his subject: life.</p><p><em>How to Be: Life Lessons from the Early Greeks</em> by Adam Nicolson is published by William Collins (£25).

<p>Big data has helped the music industry sell us only what we already like – but the results are less alive and less surprising</p><p>I was 14 when Kurt Cobain of Nirvana appeared on the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/nirvana-inside-the-heart-and-mind-of-kurt-cobain-103770/">cover of Rolling Stone</a><em> </em>wearing a T-shirt that said “CORPORATE MAGAZINES STILL SUCK”. Even at that tender age, I found his message worrisome: if Rolling Stone sucked, why was he on the cover? Maybe the shirt was ironic. Maybe his participation in the profile was ironic. Or maybe, alarmingly, he saw no contradiction between his shirt and his appearance in this corporate magazine, because we were all supposed to understand that any assertion of meaningful values in popular music was inherently bunk, even though many of the songs on Nevermind were clearly about me.</p><p>Cobain’s interview did not do much to resolve these ambiguities. After limply defending Rolling Stone as having some good articles, he added: “I don’t blame the average 17-year-old punk-rock kid for calling me a sellout.”</p><p>Dan Brooks is a writer based in Montana</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/18/nirvana-sell-out-data-music-industry">Continue reading...</a>

Some men have fundamental problems with delayed climax. Eventually, he may feel safe enough to let you know exactly what he needs from you to help him finish, but now it would be best simply to enjoy receiving pleasure without putting pressure on him to satisfy your need to make him climax. You could consider asking exactly what type of stimulation he might enjoy in the moment, and it is often best to give choices. During manual stimulation, for example, you could say: “Would you like me to do this more or less firmly, faster or more slowly, in a different place, with a different type of stroke?” “What feels better … this? Or this?” And perhaps you could use an erotic approach to get him to show you how he pleasures himself, which always yields important information.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

## High Caucasus by Tom Parfitt review – one man and a mountain range

<p>This record of an extraordinary 1,000-mile trek across the mountainous southern Russian republics of the Caucasus uncovers a brutal history that resonates today</p><p>Tom Parfitt is full of questions, guilt and regrets; a good man. Brought up on a Norfolk farm, Russia lover, adventurer and correspondent, this complex narrator is both at the heart and at the edge of a remarkable attempt to uncover the wildest and least known frontier of Europe. Brave, stubborn but amusingly self-effacing, he sets himself a 1,000-mile walk from the Black Sea to the Caspian, along the string of mountainous republics that make up Russia’s southern border. Across dramatic landscapes, he engages with a timeless world of shepherds who graze their flocks in the “mystical” highlands in summer, only to return to a patchwork of ethnic and religious communities in winter. Parfitt unravels how the Caucasus form “a landscape of unfinished histories”, histories misunderstood and often untold. On this “saunter to the brink of madness”, he runs into bears, wars and “permanent zones of counter-terrorist organisation”. These he sets alongside almost constant generosity and hospitality from peoples with almost nothing to share.</p><p>His journey begins in madness too. In 2004 he is sent to cover the seizure by militant Chechens of more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/beslan">1,000 hostages in a school in Beslan</a>, North Ossetia. He was witness to the inhumanity of the hostage takers and to the catastrophic “rescue attempt”; 333 hostages died of which 186 were children. That night President Putin told the nation what he had learned: “We showed ourselves to be weak. And the weak get beaten.” The events of those days left Parfitt not only with first-hand insight into a “merciless, blundering state” but with a recurring nightmare: a falling woman, her left hand grasping the air, groaning like a wounded animal as she learns her child was killed in the school. This trauma set him on his mad trek on foot, “not as a reporter, but as a human being, as someone moved, and horrified, confused and intoxicated”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/18/high-caucasus-mountain-quest-in-russia-haunted-hinterland-by-tom-parfitt-review-one-man-and-a-mountain-range">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latif al-Ani has been documenting his country since the 1950s, with many of his subjects now destroyed. Sadly, not too much is excavated here</p><p>Known as “the father of Iraqi photography”, Latif al-Ani began his career in the 1950s while employed by the British-run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Petroleum_Company">Iraq Petroleum Company</a>. Working for its in-house publication, al-Ani fixed his lens on a nation in transition; as his camera took in the new industrial infrastructures and a robust cosmopolitan culture, the 1958 Iraqi military coup occurred, the first of many regime changes that would for ever alter the look of the country.</p><p>Now in his late 80s, al-Ani returns to some of the locations from his photographs of a bygone Iraq for Sahim Omar Kalifa and Jurgen Buedts’s documentary. During his time at the ministry of culture and his post as the official photographer for various presidents – including Saddam Hussein – his body of work was journalistic, but it also carries significant aesthetic and archival value. After an endless series of wars and civil conflicts, large numbers of the architectural landmarks he captured are now in ruins. They live on only in al-Ani’s negatives, many of which were destroyed during the American invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/18/iraqs-invisible-beauty-review-a-photographers-eye-on-a-vanished-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This cross-border journey through fenlands and small towns is so idyllic our writer breaks up this short trip with overnight stays</p><p>What makes a fine rail journey? We all have our own ideas on this, but I find it’s best not to dash and to retain an element of spontaneity, taking the chance to stop off here and there along the way. So, last month I ended up taking three days for a train journey of only 200 miles.</p><p>It’s possible to travel from Hamburg to Esbjerg by train in four to five hours with a single change of train at Niebüll, a small town in northern Germany just short of the Danish border. Yet, with fine early summer weather, this was a chance to dawdle. Except for short electrified stretches at either end – for the first 40 miles out of Hamburg and then again on the final few miles into Esbjerg – the route relies on diesel trains and for much of the way has all the character of a lightly used secondary railway. The appeal of the journey is in the delicate beauty of the flatlands and the fine small towns along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/18/rail-route-of-the-month-hamburg-germany-to-denmark">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Voters want climate action but don’t trust politicians to do it. Could projects like a Whitehaven windfarm be the answer?</p><ul><li>Rebecca Willis is professor of energy and climate governance at Lancaster University</li></ul><p>The seaside town of Whitehaven, in the north-west of England, found itself at the centre of a political storm in May, when the levelling up, housing and communities secretary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-65584390">Michael Gove, gave his approval</a> for the UK’s first new deep coalmine in more than 40 years just outside the town.</p><p>But Whitehaven may soon be known for more than climate-wrecking coal.

<p>The Channel island now has a professional ballet outfit, run by Canadian former dancer Carolyn Rose Ramsay. She remembers rehearsals in a potato warehouse and shares ambitious plans</p><p>‘I’ve never seen so much bunting in my entire life,” says Carolyn Rose Ramsay when we meet in Jersey, an island with the air of a perennial summer fete. In January, the Vancouver-born former dancer founded the Channel Islands’ first professional ballet company, Ballet d’Jèrri, here. Six months later they were performing at Spoleto arts festival in Italy. Can an island with the population of Woking sustain a national ballet company? And how did a Canadian end up launching it?</p><p>It started almost by accident, but making it work has been an act of determined design. Ramsay danced with the Cuban National Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo and the Norwegian National Ballet. She is immediately recognisable as a ballet dancer: upright posture, tidy, stylish appearance. She moans a little as she shifts in her chair. “My back’s killing me.” It is the telltale legacy of a prolapsed disc that expedited the end of her dancing career. Leaving ballet is like leaving the military: in a flash, you lose your life’s structure. So Ramsay’s strategy was to jump straight into a new project.

<p>Krystal Evans was scarred, mentally and physically, by the fire that killed her sister. She blocked out the memories – until she decided to write about them</p><p>In previous, shorter standup shows, Krystal Evans tried to talk about her childhood experiences, but to say it didn’t work is an understatement. “Audiences just freak out,” she says with a laugh. “You can’t throw in a fucked-up joke at a 20-minute spot on a Saturday night, with a bunch of hen nights in. I realised you have to do a full show about it for people to accept it.”</p><p>Evans’s show, The Hottest Girl at Burn Camp, is about to open at the Edinburgh festival fringe. In it, she recounts a childhood that involved intense grief, neglect, surviving a lethal house fire and coping with a mentally ill mother. None of which, admittedly, sounds funny on paper, but Evans is confident in her show, unlike her previous attempts at talking about it. “I think it was a combination of not doing it in the right way and not being an experienced enough comedian at that point.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/18/at-14-i-escaped-a-lethal-house-fire-and-lost-everything-comedy-brought-me-back-to-life">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘All that we had is gone’: my lament for war-torn Khartoum | Nesrine Malik

<p>Since Sudan’s capital was engulfed by violence in April, life there has been all but destroyed. As we tried to get family members to safety, the ruination of my former home became hard to fathom</p><p>We thought it would last a day, two at most. When the sound of gunfire began to ring around parts of Khartoum early one Saturday in April, calls from family and friends in the city sounded relatively little alarm. People were hearing that there had been skirmishes near the airport, and reported seeing pickup trucks ferrying troops at speed across the city. Those nearer central Khartoum said that they heard the sound of artillery, but others said there was in fact no gunfire, only loud explosions, and speculated that perhaps they were the result of military training exercises. A minority suspected it was the start of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/sudan-outsider-hemedti-mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-leader-militia-army-war-conflict" title="">a clash between two military factions</a> that had been jostling for power for months, but no one could foresee the scale of what was about to happen. Whatever it was, I was convinced there was no cause for alarm. I had been in Khartoum only a few weeks earlier, and even though the city felt tense, life was perfectly normal. “It’ll die down,” an old friend told me. “It always does.”</p><p>It didn’t. In the 48 hours after the first reports of trouble, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/15/sudan-fighting-khartoum-latest-news-updates" title="">life in Khartoum shattered</a>. I was in London, and the news came to me in a horror reel of videos posted on social media and sent on WhatsApp. People trying to leave from Khartoum airport crouched in terror, sheltering from loud explosions. Planes preparing for takeoff were bombed on the runway. Military aircraft screeched across the skies of the capital, clumsily bombing militia targets positioned in civilian areas and levelling residential neighbourhoods. Tanks rolled through the city, crushing cars under their tracks. It was the last days of Ramadan, and the streets, which had only hours before been full of people preparing for Eid festivities, were now strewn with dead bodies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/18/all-that-we-had-is-gone-my-lament-for-war-torn-khartoum">Continue reading...</a>
