Microsoft has started this generation with two different console SKUs - the definitive Series X and its smaller brother the Series S. The latter of these machines is a great choice for budget gamers, and it packs some serious graphical grunt for an asking price of just $300. 

That value proposition is just insane, and we tried building a PC with brand-new parts that could match the performance levels of the Series S and see how much it ends up costing. Despite going with the most conscious choices available on the market, we ended up with a PC that costs double that of Series S. It’s still markedly cheaper than our 2021 edition $750 PC build, and it would be interesting to see how close we can get to the Series S’s price point in a couple of years’ time.

Capcom's co-op shooter mixes futuristic suits with dinosaurs, objective-based gameplay, PvP, invasion elements, and live service - the list goes on. It's an intriguing concept, with two teams of five competing to complete objectives while battling all kinds of Jurassic threats.

While the gameplay and visuals are solid as you mow down hordes of dinos, Exoprimal has some fundamental design flaws. Its interface varies from serviceable to inane. The story-telling mixes mystery and data gathering, but the latter ultimately feels irrelevant. Many matches feel monotonous, the maps are unspectacular, and the most varied objectives are in PvP.

Overall, Exoprimal isn't the worst experience if you want to jump in for some quick action, but whether it survives in the long term remains to be seen.
