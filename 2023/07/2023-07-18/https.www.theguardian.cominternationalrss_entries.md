<p>The record crowds that flocked to the NBA’s Las Vegas Summer League were treated to lots more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/13/victor-wembanyama-nba-summer-league-debut">the Victor Wembanyama Show</a>. Our correspondent in the desert empties her notebook</p><p>The most common mistake people make post-Vegas is overreacting, whether positive or negative. Yes, the NBA’s Summer League provides a high-profile showcase for undrafted and G League players to show their mettle, so if they impress, it shouldn’t be discounted. And some rookies display their rough edges in their first NBA-branded outing in ways that might raise flags for concern. But, on the whole, sweeping generalizations from the past 11 days shouldn’t be made in either direction off a handful of games that in the long run don’t carry a whole lot of weight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/18/nba-vegas-summer-league-2023-thoughts-wembanyama-henderson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For those that believe in the power of sport there will always be a place for major events. But do the Games deserve that place?</p><p>Following a long, gradual slide towards irrelevance, things had been looking up lately for the Commonwealth Games – the Olympics-lite multi-sport competition for British colonies past and present.</p><p>The 2022 edition in Birmingham had been a hit, among fans and athletes alike. The Games Federation had increasingly sought to grapple with its challenging past, a complex legacy of colonialism that sits uneasily with the celebratory tone of a major sporting event. Unlike the Olympics, which has tried to silence its participants, the Games had even embraced athlete activism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/18/commonwealth-games-2026-cancellation-will-it-return-victoria">Continue reading...</a>
