## Peacock Is Raising Its Prices in a Bid to Offset Billions in Losses - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Following in the footsteps of Netflix, Peacock is the latest streaming service that’ll be raising its prices. Instead of offsetting its expected $3 billion dollar loss some other way, NBC will be passing those “savings” over to consumers of the streaming service - raising the commercial-free #Peacock Premium Plus subscription from $9.99 to $11.99. The change is expected to take place August 17th. This move comes at the heels of the removal of Peacock’s free subscription tier for new users, and the removal of the Peacock Premium and Comcast Xfinity bundle. 2023 has been a strange year for streaming services, as Peacock wasn’t alone in price hikes. Both Max and Paramount Plus raised its prices this year, with Disney Plus and Hulu doing the same just a year prior. Ms. Marvel appears to be stretching over from Disney Plus to broadcast television. Ms. Marvel will be making its debut on ABC, marking it as the first original Marvel Disney Plus series to hit broadcast TV.

Barbie reviewed by Alyssa Mora.

Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is a masterful exploration of femininity and the pressures of perfection. This hyper-femme roller-coaster ride boasts meticulous production design, immaculate casting, and a deep-seated reverence for Barbie herself. Margot Robbie sparkles at the center of the film, alongside Ryan Gosling’s airheaded Ken and America Ferrera’s well-meaning Gloria. Ultimately, Barbie is a new, bold, and very pink entry into the cinematic coming-of-age canon. Absolutely wear your pinkest outfit to see this movie, but make sure you bring tissues along too.

Check out the trailer for Migration, an upcoming animated action-comedy movie starring Kumail Nanjiani as anxious Mallard dad Mack and Elizabeth Banks as Pam, the Mallards’ daring, quick-witted matriarch. Caspar Jennings plays Dax, the Mallards’ confident and restless son, and, in her feature film debut, Tresi Gazal plays Gwen, the family’s innocent and lovable daughter. The voice cast also includes Awkwafina as the scrappy leader of a New York City pigeon gang; Carol Kane plays Erin the heron, the first friend that the Mallards make on their journey; Keegan-Michael Key voices a homesick Jamaican parrot locked away in a Manhattan restaurant, and David Mitchell plays the yogic leader of a mysterious duck farm. Danny DeVito co-stars as Mack’s curmudgeonly, adventure-averse Uncle Dan. 

The Mallard family is in a bit of rut. While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids—teen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen—the whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica. 

As the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other—and themselves—than they ever imagined. 

The film's screenplay is by Mike White. It is produced by Chris Meledandri. 

Migration, directed by Benjamin Renner and co-directed by Guylo Homsy, opens in theaters on December 22.

Barbie season is in full swing with the Barbie movie throwing the spotlight on the Barbie toys, Barbie Girl the song, all the Barbie dolls in the Barbie family, and all the Barbie episodes imaginable in the Barbie dreamhouse. But, like the movie character’s realization within the Barbie Dream House, there’s more than meets the eye. The Barbie Mattel brand is incredibly established around the iconic Barbie doll, with official Barbie iconography popping up in Barbie 2023 movie imagery. 

Barbie (Margot Robbie) is a far leap from the original Barbiemovie was, though it’s hard to imagine different from recent Barbie trailer images. Barbiethemovie was something far different than before Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig came along for their version of Barbie. The movie seems to be a departure from what could be expected in any barbie movies, or the Barbiegirl music video. Ryan Gosling also stars in the Greta Gerwig helmed film. Can the Greta Gerwig Barbie deliver what the 2017 version couldn’t?

IGN goes back in time with Kim Horcher to explore the Amy Schumer version, and why Amy Schumer Barbie was never going to work, whether Shumer or the studio won control over where the famous doll would step forth in her heeled doll feet.

Disney plans on cutting back on the amount of Star Wars and Marvel projects we’ll be receiving, due to the recent underwhelming box office numbers and diminishing financial returns the company has gotten as of late. #Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that the company is still assessing its cost measuring tactics, this time directing it towards all those Marvel/Star Wars movies and shows that typically have million dollar budgets. On why the company will be scaling back, he said, “You pull back not just to focus, but also as part of our cost-containment initiative. Spending less on what we make, and making less. 2021 Disney bombarded us with 5 Marvel Disney Plus shows and 4 #MCU films - that’s a total of 9 different, unrelated projects. And not all of it was must-see TV or movies that captivated audiences. A couple of banned episodes of SpongeBob Squarepants returns to streaming - find out why they were banned and where you can watch ‘em, and more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.

In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft is finally killing off their Xbox Live Gold service, including the Games With Gold promotion. In its place will be the new Game Pass Core plan, starting at $9.99. It's the end of an era for the subscription service, which launched ten years ago for the Xbox 360 and helped define the online console gaming experience that we know today. And if you're still a subscriber, you don't have to do anything; if you don't cancel you will automatically be rolled over into the Game Pass Core plan. In other Xbox news, Microsoft and Sony have signed an agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. This follows the huge legal victory Microsoft won last week against the FTC that sought to block their pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In other news, the narrative lead of the upcoming Fable game is leaving developer Playground Games. The split is said to be mutual. And finally, Ubisoft has clarified that Star Wars: Outlaws' worlds won't be procedurally generated, and each planet could be as large as two or three zones in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
