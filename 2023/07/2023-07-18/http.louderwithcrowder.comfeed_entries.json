Jason Aldean released a powerful video for \"Try That in a Small Town\" that USING ACTUAL NEWS FOOTAGE showed what the Left has turned this country into. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-song-backlash\" target=\"_blank\">Leftists are outraged</a> and the cancelation attempts have started. CMT has <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/jason-aldean-music-video-pulled-cmt-1235539052/\" target=\"_blank\">canceled the video from being shown on the network</a>. Though I should point out, CMT is owned by MTV Networks. It is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kelsea-balerini-cmt-awards\" target=\"_blank\">NYC-based MTV's idea</a> of what country music is.\n</p><p>\n\tThe media has labeled it <em>\"...a modern lynching song\"</em> with <em>\"very scary\"</em> AND <em>\"racist\"</em> lyrics. As I'm sure you have guessed by now, it is none of those things.\n</p><p>\n\tAldean has doubled down on the \"controversy\" with a statement. \"In the past 24 hours, I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless but dangerous. There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn\u2019t a single video clip that isn\u2019t real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far.\"\n</p><p>\n\tAldean went on to say, \"My political views have never been something I\u2019ve hidden from, and I know that a lot of us in this Country don\u2019t agree on how we get back to a sense of normalcy where we go at least a day without a headline that keeps us up at night. But the desire for it to. That\u2019s what this song is about.\"\n</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jason_Aldean/status/1681382697875144717\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk/Carjack an old lady at a red light/Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store/Ya think it's cool, well, act a fool if ya like/Cuss out a cop, spit in his face/Stomp on the flag and light it up/Yeah, ya think you're tough/Well, try that in a small town.\"</p><p>Here's the video.

Unless you bought it on your way to your Top Secret cabinet-level job, or brought it with you to snort while working your Top Secret cabinet-level job.</p><p>These are all questions we should even want to be answered if it happens during the President DeSantis administration too. The difference is we wouldn't need to ask them because the culprit would be fired.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

During an intimate part of the show, fans caused a distraction by taking out their phones to pose for selfies. Miranda, the artist, thought this to be rude and said something. <a href=\"https://redstate.com/sister-toldjah/2023/07/17/watch-bizarre-miranda-lambert-mini-meltdown-during-concert-had-some-fans-walking-out-n778046\" target=\"_blank\">Not everyone agreed</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s go.

For reference, this is the song she was playing. It's called \"Tin Man,' is very emotional, and is performed with just her and an acoustic guitar.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Miranda Lambert - Tin Man (From The Marfa Tapes Film with Jack Ingram & Jon Randall)</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb2MrCB_aGg\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n</small>\n</p><p>They weren't distracting a wild, full band, singing about little girls playing with kerosine and being made of gunpowder and lead. It is a quiet, emotional, sentimental part of the show where you FEEL the music. </p><p>Being rude and not paying attention in such an intimate setting doesn't just take the artist out of the performance, it takes everyone around you out of the performance who paid just as much money as you did to not just enjoy, but feel live music.</p><p>What if instead of selfies, they were WOO girls screaming about shots? Would that fall under \"they paid money and can do whatever they want\" too? Because they aren't the only ones in attendance who paid money.</p><p>People with phones are getting out of hand at concerts as it is. Not that they don't have some use. Taking Back Sunday performed a new song on tour <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KogEiDjeRU\" target=\"_blank\">and someone got it up on the internet</a>. I thank you for that. </p><p>But as someone who breathes music AND is all about doing it for the content, have some respect for the artist and the other people around you. Record a little bit of the first song so Instagram knows you're having fun then put your damn phone away.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

James Barr is a virtue-signaling idiot. And Piers Morgan is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/piers-morgan-sam-smith-guest\" target=\"_blank\">a man who loves himself some content</a>. At issue is the live-action Snow White movie replacing the seven dwarfs with six mystical creatures and Peter Dinklage. It's being done in the name of tolerance and equity and whatever other gay words the woke Left has made up this week.</p><p>The story starts a year ago. Peter Dinklage (also a dwarf actor) lashed out when he heard Disney was making a live-action Snow White movie, calling its depiction of the seven dwarfs  \"tone-deaf.\" Postl (aka Swoggle from The Major Wrestling Figure Podcast, shout out to The Indy God) pushed back on Dinklage's attacks because the movie <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2022/01/27/dylan-postl-condemns-peter-dinklage-criticism-snow-white-7-dwarfs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">could have provided seven members from the community acting roles they wouldn't normally get</a>. Dinklage was costing those actors jobs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-snow-white-photos\" target=\"_blank\">Then photos from the live-action shoot leaked to the internet</a>. The only dwarf actor cast? Peter Dinklage.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cdd2c\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34347373&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>(Speaking of the Oompa Loompas, apparently in the new Wonka movie they replaced a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-snow-white-photos\" target=\"_blank\">bunch of potential dwarf acting roles with a CGI Hugh Grant</a>, but the most offensive thing there is that theres\\'s a new Wonka movie)</p><p>As Postl explains to Morgan, a live-action Snow White could have provided valuable jobs to dwarf actors. \"[The dwarves] weren't these cave-dwelling monsters the people speak of. They all had seven different characteristics for seven different actors from my community. And I don't feel it's right that got taken away from us.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored/status/1681022845197996034\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When Barr had his turn to speak, he said he didn't want to get into a fight with a dwarf. Probably a good idea, because I've seen Postl go nuts with tables, ladders, and chairs. It's  the \"ruthless aggression\" he inherited from being WWE chairman Vince McMahon's illegitimate son (I don't care if only seven of you got that reference).</p><p>Barr tried to wokesplain it was okay to take these acting roles away because they didn't fit a narrative in today's society. Postl was curious about this because the narrative is that to \"protect\" his community jobs and opportunites needed to be taken from his community.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored/status/1681024616595173376\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's when things went off the rails.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mythinformedmke/status/1681074398952935431\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is textbook progressivism. One single actor under five feet -- the only actor under five feet who gets any movie roles -- complained. And so a bunch of full-sized woke Leftist twats could feel good about themselves and revel in the smell of their own boofs, they rewrote a classic to show the dwarf community how much they cared about the dwarf community. Even though the community didn't ask for any of this and would have preferred the acting roles. </p><p>But who cares what the marginalized community du jour thinks, amirite Democrats? How you feel is what's important.</p><p>And I still find it hilarious that Dinklage, who started this, is the only one cast in the movie. Had I ever watched <em>Game of Thrones</em>, I'd have a Tyrion Lannister reference for how cutthroat that was.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
