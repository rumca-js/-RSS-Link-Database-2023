<p>Fervo Energy says it has achieved a breakthrough in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/geothermal/"><ins>geothermal</ins></a> technology. It carried out a 30-day well test at its site in northern Nevada and <a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-technology-breakthrough-in-next-generation-geothermal/"><ins>says it was able to achieve</ins></a> a &quot;flowrate of 63 liters per second at high temperature that enables 3.5 megawatts of electric production.&quot; The company says the test resulted in flow and power output records for an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) and that it was completed without incident.</p><p>A megawatt can power around 750 homes at once. Fervo is expected to connect its Project Red site to the grid this year. It will be used to power <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-13-google-expands-us-footprint.html"><ins>Google data centers</ins></a> and some of the company's other Nevada infrastructure. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> and Fervo <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-fervo-geothermal-project-creates-carbon-free-energy"><ins>signed an agreement</ins></a> in 2021 to develop a &quot;next-generation geothermal power project.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is the first time an energy company has shown that an EGS can work on a commercial scale, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/fervo-energy-says-it-has-achieved-geothermal-energy-tech-breakthrough?sref=10lNAhZ9#xj4y7vzkg"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. It's been a long road to reach this point, as scientists have been trying to make EGS a reality since the 1970s.</p><p>For a natural geothermal system to produce electricity, it needs a combination of heat, fluid and rock permeability, as <em>Bloomberg </em>notes. In many areas, the rock has the required levels of heat, but not enough permeability for fluid to flow through it.</p><p>An EGS creates this permeability artificially by drilling deep underground and injecting fluid to create fractures in the rock. That approach can vastly increase the number of potential sites for a geothermal power plant.</p><p>Fervo says it's the first company to &quot;successfully drill a horizontal well pair for commercial geothermal production, achieving lateral lengths of 3,250 feet, reaching a temperature of 191°C, and proving controlled flow through rigorous tracer testing.&quot;</p><p>One of the major advantages of geothermal power plants is that they're entirely carbon free — Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-carbon-free-energy-2030-190100260.html"><ins>aims</ins></a> to run all of its offices and data centers on carbon-free energy by 2030. These plants can also operate at any time (unlike solar and wind), making geothermal energy a compelling source of renewable power. However, cost reductions and regulatory red tape are barriers to making EGS more broadly available, according to Fervo CEO Tim Latimer.</p><p>The company is hoping to replicate its success at a site in Utah. If Fervo sees similar results there and it successfully implements design upgrades to maximize output, the site is expected to generate enough electricity to power 300,000 homes simultaneously, Latimer said. That's around a quarter of all homes in Utah.</p><p>“Achieving our goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy will require new sources of firm, clean power to complement variable renewables like wind and solar,” Michael Terrell, Google's senior director for energy and climate, said in a statement. “We partnered with Fervo in 2021 because we see significant potential for their geothermal technology to unlock a critical source of 24/7 carbon-free energy at scale, and we are thrilled to see Fervo reach this important technical milestone.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/breakthrough-geothermal-tech-produces-35-megawatts-of-carbon-free-power-210032356.html?src=rss

## The Cricut Venture is a $1,000 cutting machine for the most ambitious DIYers

<p>Cricut, a company that makes popular cutting machines for crafting projects, announced a new model today. Although its devices are relatively affordable, the new Cricut Venture is a higher-end $1,000 machine aimed at “incredibly enthusiastic makers and those who sell their crafts.” In other words, this variant is less for occasional hobbyists and more for hardcore makers or small businesses selling their creations somewhere like Etsy.</p><p>Cricut Venture is a “large-format” cutting machine that can handle bigger projects — whether physical size or higher volume. The device, the company’s biggest yet, can cut up to 75 feet of repeated images and 12 ft of single images. Cricut says it’s also its fastest machine, cutting up to 25 inches per second. “Cricut Venture is optimized for size and speed,” said Michelle Fishberg, Cricut’s VP of Global Product Management. “You will find the beautiful design and quality Cricut is known for, with increased precision and attention to detail, all of which make cutting on this large-format machine an easy and productive experience.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the company’s other models, the Cricut Venture can handle materials like vinyl, iron-on, cardstock, bonded fabric, leather and poster boards. Engadget’s Terrence O’Brien <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cricut-explore-3-review-precision-cutting-machine-arts-and-crafts-170053940.html">reviewed the printer-sized Explore 3</a> in 2021 and found it worked well for projects like vinyl decals and cardstock animals (that he may or may not have ever fully assembled). However, these machines are more limited by the user’s experience with crafts than technology: The company lists banners, engraved metal, debased leather, custom cards, t-shirts and color stickers among the various tasks it can handle.</p><p>The Cricut Venture will be available from the company website and retail partners starting on July 25th. Its $1,000 sticker price is for the machine only; Cricut also offers bundles with a stand or materials to help you get started.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-cricut-venture-is-a-1000-cutting-machine-for-the-most-ambitious-diyers-201519614.html?src=rss

<p>Meta has delivered the first significant update to Threads since the social network launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html">earlier this month</a>, and you might appreciate it if you're still building your contact list. The company's Cameron Roth has detailed an <a href="https://www.threads.net/@camroth/post/Cu2Pa4rBBlA?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D">upgrade</a> to the iOS app that adds a Follows tab to the activity feed, making it easier to see who just followed you.  You'll have an easier time following people back. Accordingly, you can open your Instagram follower list to see if you're missing anyone.</p><p>The update also adds translations for post text, so you'll have more incentive to follow people who speak unfamiliar languages. You can subscribe to unfollowed users to get notifications without crowding your timeline. There are a few basic interface tweaks as well, such as reposter labels you can tap. The app should be leaner and smoother, particularly when loading or scrolling through your activity feed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some of the features are enabled server-side, so don't be surprised if they're not all available immediately. Roth says they should be available by the end of today (July 18th). There's no mention of when Android will get an equivalent update, but we've asked Meta for comment and will let you know if we hear back. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-launches-a-threads-beta-program-for-android-191600004.html">Android beta program</a> offers features before they reach the publicly available app, however.</p><p>There are still numerous missing features, and the Threads team is aware of it. You can't yet use a chronological feed, direct messages or hashtags. You can't completely remove yourself from Threads without also deleting your Instagram account. And without a full web version, it's not usually practical to use Threads on a computer. This first update shows that Meta is acting on at least some promises, even if it may take a while to address every issue.</p><p>Meta has motivation to act quickly. Threads <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-users-are-already-spending-less-time-in-the-app-182738755.html">use is declining</a> after the initial spike, and the absence of some features (such as hashtags and a web app) may keep new users away. Greater parity could help sustain interest while Meta considers a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-twitter-rival-threads-wont-initially-launch-in-the-eu-090314803.html">European Union rollout</a> and otherwise prepares for a significant expansion.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-big-threads-update-for-ios-helps-you-see-new-followers-195035774.html?src=rss

<p>Remember <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-notes-longform-193057651.html"><ins>Twitter Notes</ins></a>? It was supposed to be the feature that let Twitter users write whatever they want, blowing past the typical Twitter character limit. At the time, that limit was only 280 characters. After several updates this year, Twitter Blue subscribers can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/twitter-now-allows-subscribers-to-post-25000-character-long-tweets/"><ins>tweet up to 25,000 characters</ins></a>. Now, CEO Elon Musk has seemingly confirmed that the company is still working on the Notes feature, but is rebranding it to Twitter Articles.</p><p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1681346514742919170"><ins>a reply</ins></a> to a tweet noting the name change, Musk confirms that Articles will be the place to post “long, complex articles with mixed media.” He goes on to say that “You could publish a book if you want.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="49eb59fbdfdd43c2a64e58028a440c7e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This will allow users to post very long, complex articles with mixed media.

Notably, this was announced before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html"><ins>the Elon Musk takeover</ins></a> later that year, but after he announced his intention to buy the company. This is the first time Twitter has acknowledged the feature since then.</p><p>As for what this feature will look like, think blog posts but on Twitter. Articles, which will be separate from the main timeline, is an area where users can post long-form content without the typical limitations of a tweet. That means you’ll be able to embed photos, videos and other tweets within an Article. Users can share Articles in tweets, and published Articles will show up in your Twitter profile.</p><p>It’s unclear at this time when or if Articles will be available to the public. The feature is still in the experimental stage it has been in since last year, and is only available to a select number of users.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-working-on-new-publishing-tools-for-long-form-articles-185302573.html?src=rss

## Amazon Echo Buds (2023) review: $50 goes a long way
 - [https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2023-review-50-goes-a-long-way-170007670.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2023-review-50-goes-a-long-way-170007670.html?src=rss)

<p>When Amazon introduced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">2nd-generation Echo Buds</a> in 2021, the company redesigned them to address nearly every issue with its first attempt. They had true active noise cancellation (ANC), better sound and a smaller size. Amazon took a much different approach for its third version, opting to move from mid-range to a low-cost model with an all-new design that covers most of the basic features you’d expect. As always, the Alexa faithful will get the most out of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbGwtbmV3LUVjaG8tQnVkcy0yMDIzLVJlbGVhc2UtVHJ1ZS1XaXJlbGVzcy1FYXJidWRzL2RwL0IwOUpWRzNUV1gvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFxMC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGZiZTI0OGUtZmI3Zi00NGU4LTg3YTItNzNmZWUzMWM2YzExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZa3w1ettlkLmgqed0Jtk5vQidSZZxbtOtLGms5Nw3gB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-new-Echo-Buds-2023-Release-True-Wireless-Earbuds%2Fdp%2FB09JVG3TWX%2F">the new $50 Echo Buds</a>, but in a lot of ways you could argue a budget model that does well with the essentials is where Amazon should’ve been all along.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>While the first two iterations of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-redesigned-echo-buds-are-only-50-140055204.html">Echo Buds</a> had similar designs, Amazon completely changed things up for the third generation. The 2023 model has an AirPods-like stem that extends down from your ear toward your jaw. The silicone ear tips are gone as well and the buds sit in your ear rather than completely closing off your ear canal. There are two sets of silicone “covers” included with the Echo Buds that Amazon says will “optimize your fit.” They don’t really change how the earbuds feel in your ears because they’re so thin. They just provide a tiny bit of grip to help them stay put.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>The mostly open design is great for when you might not want to block out the world entirely. However, they’re only IPX2 rated for protection from water droplets. The 2nd-gen Echo Buds offered slightly better IPX4 resistance, so I wouldn’t rely on the 2023 model as your workout partner if you sweat a lot.</p><p>Amazon didn’t cut too many corners when it comes to controls to keep costs low, though. The upper, main part of the Echo Buds accept taps (single, double, triple and long press) for music playback, calls and to summon Alexa manually. The earbuds are also equipped with in-ear detection for automatic pausing. You can reconfigure the defaults any number of ways, including swapping out core controls for volume. You’ll need two spots for that though, as volume up is one gesture while down requires another.</p><p>The controls are mirrored on both sides out of the box, but you don’t have to keep them that way. You can also reassign the long press to mute the Echo Buds mics or activate your phone’s native assistant. Since these earbuds offer hands-free access to Alexa, you can technically get both. However, the Echo Buds won’t summon Siri or Google Assistant if the mics are muted, even if you’ve assigned them to the long press action. The bottom line here is that there is a lot of customization available and the earbuds reliably accept your taps without having to repeat a touch command.</p><p>Despite the longer overall design, the charging case with the new Echo Buds remains small. This one will easily tuck in a tiny pocket. The Bluetooth pairing button is on the outside up front, sitting just below an LED status indicator, and a USB-C charging port resides on the right side.</p><h2><strong>Software and setup</strong></h2><figure><img alt="Amazon Alexa app" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/a2938a00-257a-11ee-a3e4-79e2f66f9ed1" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the biggest issues I have with the Echo Buds is that they require the Alexa app for a full setup. I’m well aware earbuds and headphones need apps to get the most out of their features, but the Alexa app is bloated as it handles all kinds of smart devices beyond just the Echo Buds. There’s a lot to contend with here just to tweak your settings. Amazon has put the earbuds info up top so you don’t have to go looking for it, but there’s still a lot to get lost in down below.</p><p>The Alexa app displays battery life percentages for both earbuds individually and the case right on the home screen, as well as an easily accessible mute button for the microphones. Tapping further into the settings shows you Bluetooth connections and gives you the option to disable Alexa hands-free. Note that this doesn’t mute the mics and you can still manually summon Amazon’s assistant with a long press on the Echo Buds. The earbuds also support multipoint connectivity for two devices at once, and in my experience switching is quick and reliable.</p><p>As it has in the past, the company allows you to activate and adjust Sidetone. That’s the amount of your own voice you want to hear during a call. VIP Filter returns as well, which lets you decide which contacts and apps you want to receive notifications from. EQ customization comes in the form of three sliders for bass, mids and treble, just above the option to reconfigure the tap controls. Amazon has included a Find My tool in the app and there are feature categories for Entertainment, Communication and Location &amp; Maps that help to further personalize the Echo Buds Setup.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img alt="Amazon Echo Buds (2023) review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/fbb9fc71-2577-11ee-9fbf-e1a8d5d31950" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to open-type earbuds, sound quality can vary wildly from model to model. It’s understandable that some companies struggle to deliver the best audio without sealing off your ears and the wearer’s ear shape can dramatically impact the results. But Amazon tackled both of those challenges admirably and created a sound profile that’s quite good in a set of $50 buds.</p><p>The first thing that impressed me with the Echo Buds was the clarity and detail. Softer and acoustic genres like bluegrass, folk and lighter country sound great, with the warm strums of Zach Bryan’s guitars and vocals on <em>American Heartbreak </em>cutting through the mix. Switch over to the electro-pop-rock of PVRIS’ <em>Evergreen</em> and you’ll notice that these earbuds do lack a bit of low-end thump. That’s common with open designs, so it’s not surprising. If I press the buds in slightly, the bass is more present. Unfortunately, that means audio quality may vary based on how the Echo Buds sit in your ears.</p><p>Overall, the tuning is well-balanced across genres. At times, there’s a heavier dose of treble, but it’s not a constant issue. But in general the Echo Buds deliver better audio quality than much of the $50 competition. They pickup plenty of subtle reverb when it’s present and there’s nice texture to drums and distorted guitars across hip-hop and metal respectively. They even adequately render all of the layered and unique sounds of the KAYTRAMINÉ album.</p><p>Unlike the previous version of Echo Buds, there’s no active noise cancellation here. Due to the semi-open design it would be mostly wasted anyway. This means the new Echo Buds won’t do much to block a noisy coffee shop or air conditioner, but they should keep you from missing announcements, warnings or any other crucial info that might otherwise go unheard.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><figure><img alt="Amazon Echo Buds (2023) review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/fbba71a0-2577-11ee-beff-890e15a99f5e" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Amazon says you can expect up to five hours of use on these Echo Buds. You can extend that figure by one hour if you opt to disable hands-free access to Alexa. There are three additional charges in the case and a quick-charge feature will give you up to two hours of listening time in 15 minutes. The Echo Buds are replenished via the USB-C port on the right side as there’s no wireless charging here. Amazon doesn’t include a cable either, citing its Climate Pledge Friendly commitment, but chances are you already have one. If not, the company offers the option to bundle it for $10 more.</p><p>During “regular” use, I still had eight percent left in the tank after five and a half hours. That’s a mix of playing music, taking calls and leaving the buds on my desk outside of the case a couple of times. I also had the wake word active, so I went beyond the company’s stated number. Five hours is near the industry average these days, especially for more affordable models, but it’s nice to see Amazon slightly overdelivering.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><p>To assist with calls, Amazon installed two mics and a voice accelerometer on each earbud. As always, companies’ claims about call performance are typically exaggerated to some degree with promises of “crystal clear” quality. That’s exactly what Amazon says about the Echo Buds, but overall clarity isn’t particularly great. Your voice comes across slightly muffled, though it’s perfectly fine for general video and voice calls. I wouldn’t do any recording with these – not that you would with most earbuds anyway. The Echo Buds do a decent job combatting background noise, including a loud fan that came through as soft white noise instead of its raucous rumble and a nearby game of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> wasn’t picked up at all.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><figure><img alt="Amazon Echo Buds (2023) review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/fbba98b0-2577-11ee-b6ed-98cb7018cea5" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>At $50, Amazon is significantly undercutting its competition from the biggest names in wireless earbuds.

The company was only going to improve things so much at its previous mid-range price point, there’s a limit to how much tech you can add to a $150 set before the price has to go up. Going for the budget buyers instead of building a high-end set of $300 earbuds makes more sense considering its approach to other devices. Still, the company managed to create low-cost Echo Buds with sound quality that punches above the price point while still including all of the basic functionality. Alexa users even get a hands-free assistant, which isn’t all that common on $50 earbuds. There are certainly some omissions, but on the whole, Amazon’s choice to go budget friendly seems like the right call.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2023-review-50-goes-a-long-way-170007670.html?src=rss

## AI put me in a 'South Park' episode

<p>It was just another day in South Park. The kids were making fun of each other on the playground, while the parents were all doing their best to maintain their sanity in the small Colorado town. And then there was me, a tech journalist going door-to-door warning about the impending AI apocalypse. No, I wasn't actually guest starring on the long-running TV series — I was thrust into an episode entirely produced by the Showrunner AI model from <a href="https://www.thesimulation.co/">The Simulation</a>, the next iteration of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-24-fable-vr-virtual-beings.html">VR studio Fable</a>.</p><p>All it took was some audio of my voice (recorded during a call with The Simulation's CEO Edward Saatchi), a picture and a two-sentence prompt to produce the episode. And while it wasn't the best <em>South Park</em> episode I've seen, I was shocked by how watchable it was. It begins with my AI character popping into Sharon and Randy Marsh's house in the morning, warning them about the AI uprising. Randy is intrigued, but Sharon is annoyed by my arrival (both of which were set up in one sentence of the initial prompt).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="07c29b4c6c9c4525bb3521940e83b2a6"></div><p>&quot;They're [AI] infiltrating every aspect of our lives,&quot; my AI character says. &quot;They're in our cars, our phones... even our toasters.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our toasters, really? I always knew that little bastard was up to something,&quot; Randy replies.</p><p>Sure, that's not exactly a tightly crafted joke, but it was enough to make me chuckle. And again, it didn't take much for Showrunner AI to piece that conversation together. Watching this episode made it clear that generative AI can actually produce watchable content (certainly more so than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-seinfeld-twitch-nothing-forever-201608936.html">that AI </a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-seinfeld-twitch-nothing-forever-201608936.html"><em>Seinfeld</em></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-seinfeld-twitch-nothing-forever-201608936.html"> project</a>), but it also made me even more worried about the role of AI in media.</p><p>At this moment, writers in the WGA and performers in the SAG-AFTRA unions are striking for better residual pay and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hollywood-writers-demand-protections-against-ai-exploitation-143007545.html">protections against potential AI exploitation</a>. A tool like Showrunner AI, which can produce decent content without much effort, threatens creatives everywhere. The WGA strike and the fears around AI-generated content is also the main plot line in the demo <em>South Park</em> episode, &quot;Westland Chronicles.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="The Simulation Showrunner AI South Park demo" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0ba66be0-2588-11ee-bb57-8efba388717c" style="height: 1406px; width: 2500px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">The Simulation</div></figure><p>&quot;Maybe it's a mistake to release it, I'm not sure,&quot; Saatchi said over email, when I asked if it's really the best time to launch Showrunner AI. &quot;If our focus was becoming 'the AI TV studio' and gloating that we can make shows with no staff I'd feel very queasy — but we're trying to build a simulation and we need infinite story to make that work.&quot;</p><p>He added: &quot;Now is the moment, in the biggest strike in 60 years, before AI has achieved takeoff, to negotiate the most aggressive protections possible for writers and actors from producers' use of AI — negotiations now so that these tools are in the hands of artists and creators only and not the hands of producers trying to become Griffin Mill Robert Altman's <em>The Player</em>.&quot;</p><div id="105e54ac179f4eb59010c93d158e1631"></div><p>(That character famously said, &quot;I was just thinking what an interesting concept it is to eliminate the writer from the artistic process. If we could just get rid of these actors and directors, maybe we've got something here.&quot;)</p><p>The idea of building intelligent characters isn't new for Saatchi. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-24-edward-saatchi-vr-interview.html">In 2018</a>, we discussed Fable Studio's VR adaptation of Neil Gaiman's <em>The Wolves in the Wall</em>, which centered on an interactive character named Lucy. Even then, he thought AI-powered beings were more intriguing than the notion of VR storytelling. Now, thanks to the proliferation of generative AI models, he can finally make that happen.</p><figure><img alt="The Simulation Showrunner AI South Park demo" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0ba77d50-2588-11ee-9f59-4a37ce3d774d" style="height: 1406px; width: 2500px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">The Simulation</div></figure><p>His goal with The Simulation is right there in the name: He wants to create simulations of characters living their lives in specific environments, similar to <em>The Truman Show</em>. That content could be cut down into episodic summaries with Showrunner AI. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/john-carmack-leaves-meta-043202664.html">so many in the AI field</a>, Saatchi eventually wants to build AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, &quot;an AI that reaches and surpasses human intelligence and is, ultimately, a new lifeform.&quot;</p><p>While <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi-explained/">many AI experts remain skeptical </a>about the viability of AGI, Showrunner could still end up being a powerful tool. But of course, like any tool, it could end up being used for good or evil. Saatchi envisions it being helpful for creators to build their own shows without a huge budget, but he also admits it could be used by studios to &quot;undermine artistic expression.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="The Simulation Showrunner AI South Park demo" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0ba644d0-2588-11ee-bffd-9ebd718a3e03" style="height: 1406px; width: 2500px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">The Simulation</div></figure><p>After watching myself starring in a South Park episode, though, I'm more worried than hopeful. The tech isn't perfect yet — my voice sometimes sounds overly robotic, and characters pronounce my name differently almost every time — but it's close enough. Saatchi and his team, including the AI research Philipp Maas, who developed the South Park simulation, still preview every episode to ensure they make sense. But with no end in strike for the Hollywood union strikes, it's hard not to imagine some studio looking at this tool as a potential savior.</p><p>“We aren’t releasing the Showrunner commercially and aren’t in talks with the <em>South Park </em>people (though we are with several studios about their IP, as well as creators to make original IP) but we used <em>South Park </em>only so that people have a comparison point between a super high quality human show and an AI show,&quot; Saatchi said. &quot;If the showrunner was ever released with the permission of an IP (letting fans create their own episodes) we believe all the revenue should go to the IP holders — these are just remixes after all!&quot;</p><p>Currently, The Simulation is developing showrunners around other animated concepts, like a space exploration series, and a Silicon Valley satire dubbed &quot;Exit Valley.&quot; The technology can't produce live action content yet. The company is <a href="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/">also releasing a research paper</a> explaining how its showrunner AI technology works, with the hopes of encouraging more AI workers to build on it.</p><p>The most striking thing about my South Park episode is that it actually feels like an episode of the show. Over the course of five minutes, I visited the local school, where all of the kids proceeded to make fun of me. One wisely lectured me about overhyping claims about the AI apocalypse, while I was also warning them to watch out for clickbait. By the end, I was eager to see more. And that was the most worrying thing of all.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-simulation-ai-put-me-in-a-south-park-episode-170002565.html?src=rss

## Peacock raises subscription prices for the first time

<p>Streaming service Peacock is raising the prices of its subscription plans, if you have an inclination to rewatch <em>The Office</em> for the hundredth time. The ad-supported Premium subscription goes up by a buck, to $6 per month, while the ad-free Premium Plus option shoots up two bucks to $12 per month. An annual Premium subscription is going up $10, so $60 per year, while the Premium Plus subscription increases $20, making it $120 per year. This all goes into effect on August 17th, according to an email sent to current subscribers.</p><p>This is actually the first price hike for the NBCUniversal-owned streaming service since launching back in 2020. The increase impacts both current and incoming subscribers. The streamer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-stops-offering-its-free-tier-to-new-subscribers-195856662.html"><ins>nixed its free tier earlier this year,</ins></a> so you have to pay up to learn if Jim and Pam ever share that paper-drenched kiss.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Why the price hike? Peacock is hemorrhaging money, despite a rapidly-increasing subscriber base. As of April, the streamer boasted 22 million paying subscribers, but increased programming costs led to a loss of more than $700 million. NBC’s golden child was the last holdout, as every other major streaming platform already slapped subscribers with price bumps. Paramount+ prices <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-prices-are-going-up-whether-you-get-showtime-or-not-153523879.html"><ins>shot up in February</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-increase-ad-free-170242563.html"><ins>same goes for Max</ins></a>, Disney+, Apple+ and all the rest.</p><p>This could all be moot if those dual Hollywood strikes aren’t resolved in the short-term, as the streamers will run out of content quicker than you can say “go outside and touch grass.” Shows premiering now were filmed last year, thereabouts, so expect a serious dry spell next year around this time.</p><p>As for Peacock, there’s a reason it reached over 20 million subscribers in just a couple of years. It’s not just home for <em>The Office</em> and other beloved, though ancient, sitcoms. The service streams tons of live sports, including NFL football, Premier League soccer and WWE wrestling. It’s also gotten itself a stable of decent original programming, from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html"><ins>absolute lunacy of </ins><em><ins>Mrs. Davis</ins></em></a> to the critically-acclaimed old-school sleuthing of <em>Poker Face.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/peacock-raises-subscription-prices-for-the-first-time-164405324.html?src=rss

## Meta and Microsoft release Llama 2, an AI language model for commercial use

<p>The rumors of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-could-soon-make-its-ai-model-available-for-commercial-projects-114021749.html">commercially-oriented Meta AI model</a> were true. Meta and Microsoft have teamed up to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">unveil</a> Llama 2, a next-generation large language (very generalized) AI model intended for both commercial and research purposes. The upgraded open source code places a greater emphasis on responsibility. Developers &quot;red-teamed&quot; models (that is, tested them for safety) and created a transparency schematic to detail potential issues. They also include a responsible use guide, and there's an acceptable use policy to prevent abuses like criminal activity, misleading representations and spam.</p><p>Meta is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">releasing</a> both pre-trained and conversation-oriented versions of Llama 2. Microsoft is making it available through the Azure AI catalog to use with cloud tools, such as content filtering. The tool can also run directly on Windows PCs, and will be available through outside providers like Amazon Web Services and Hugging Face.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The original AI model was open source, but intended strictly for academics and researchers. Llama 2 lets companies customize the technology for their own purposes, such as chatbots and image generators. Ideally, this lets companies benefit from the modelling while providing outsiders a way to check for biases, inaccuracies and other flaws. Open source code isn't new in the AI world — Stability's Stable Diffusion is a notable example. However, major rivals like OpenAI's GPT-4 tend to be locked down for the sake of subscription or licensing revenue.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>In recent years, we’ve seen an influx of self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-makes-a-cozy-game-cozy">cozy games</a>,” video games explicitly designed to invoke good vibes. Being cozy, however, isn’t the same as being good. To help gamers who could use some help winding down after a long day, we’ve rounded up a selection of chill games that purposefully deemphasize fail states, violence, overwhelming grinds, intense competition and other aggressive urges, but aren’t overly cute for the sake of it or so stripped-down that they’re boring. ​​Here are some of the best relaxing games you can play on your console, iPhone or Android phones.</p><h2><em>Stardew Valley</em></h2><p></p><p>Apart from being one of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-co-op-games-for-pc-nintendo-switch-ps-4-and-more-141542259.html">favorite couch co-op games</a>, the farming life sim <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdGFyZGV3LVZhbGxleS1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDc2VEs0TTk2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQjlsnkjgoATdLxKuNfWoLYmmLdcsR8PmgRu7Lo0MDW8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStardew-Valley-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB076TK4M96"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> is also notable for its relaxing qualities.

(On the flipside, if you want to turn your land into a model of ruthless efficiency as soon as possible, the experience will be more overwhelming, and the story will have a darker undercurrent.) It all starts a bit slow, but there’s no external force rushing you, and the game’s trajectory of progress always points upward.

It broadly tasks you with developing a deserted island as you see fit. You plant flowers, catch bugs, pave pathways, talk with your animal buddy neighbors, collect a million things and generally hang out.</p><p>Everything passes in real time, so sometimes you have to wait to complete whatever little task you had in mind. On the surface, much of what you do is comically unremarkable. (You don’t save people, you buy furniture.) But, like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, the slowness and mundanity is what sells the whole thing. It points toward some of life’s little pleasures – watching things grow, getting to know others, seeing what a new day brings – and gives you a space to enjoy them, at least in some fashion.</p><p><strong>Buy for:</strong><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbmltYWwtQ3Jvc3NpbmctTmV3LUhvcml6b25zLU5pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaC9kcC9CMDdTTDZaWEJMLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWIYHUXppqd_B_quRwBhc_7i7d25AOwUc_JSMJ3ml-Gj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnimal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB07SL6ZXBL%2F">Switch</a><br /><strong>Length:</strong> 61-386 hours</p><h2><em>Tetris Effect</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UZXRyaXMtRWZmZWN0LUNvbm5lY3RlZC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gvZHAvQjBCN1FWMzNCNz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcipBM_eShXD02VhVDSfE1NNRXCpF0Q5MV-_MTVPOzeN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTetris-Effect-Connected-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0B7QV33B7"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a> is, in essence, a prettier version of the falling-block puzzle game that has compelled the globe since the mid-’80s. Its spacey pop soundtrack and themed boards have an ethereal, almost spiritual quality, one that fits neatly with the trance-like condition <em>Tetris</em> can induce. (This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">helps explain</a> where the title comes from.)</p><p>To be clear, <em>Tetris</em> is not the most relaxing game in the abstract. The way it makes you scramble to fix your past decisions is part of its magic, and several modes in <em>Tetris Effect</em> specifically thrive on stress. Others, however, are explicitly designed to tap into the game’s zen aspects. “Chill Marathon,” for one, simply resets your score upon failure instead of giving you a game over. And since <em>Tetris</em> itself comes as second-nature to an unusually large amount of people, we’ll make an exception for it here. It can be difficult, but even in failure, <em>Tetris Effect</em> induces a mind-freeing <em>state</em> like few games can.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UZXRyaXMtRWZmZWN0LUNvbm5lY3RlZC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gvZHAvQjBCN1FWMzNCNz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcipBM_eShXD02VhVDSfE1NNRXCpF0Q5MV-_MTVPOzeN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTetris-Effect-Connected-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0B7QV33B7">Switch</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI3UU0xTEZXLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdJUCH7_F4fgPbj1hAc-gBDMG4RCKPCgvHXIBncxy8e8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B7QM1LFW%2F%3Fth%3D1">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0751-CUSA13594_00-TETRISEFFECT0000">PS5</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvdGV0cmlzLWVmZmVjdC1jb25uZWN0ZWQvOXBwYnZrM3RrODNtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX2e4-AAgm5j9Y1UOA7K3awg4WA-FdnaBucqzT2tkeD6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ftetris-effect-connected%2F9ppbvk3tk83m">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/">PC</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6f7ae225-b81d-43cd-a3c7-b24c85091f6f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Oculus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZjdhZTIyNS1iODFkLTQzY2QtYTNjNy1iMjRjODUwOTFmNmYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2N1bHVzLmNvbS9leHBlcmllbmNlcy9xdWVzdC8zMzg2NjE4ODk0NzQzNTY3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATuiPgQxg69u298TYaMR-EKXYZzPgdkCtnrHuZzctFXl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3386618894743567%2F">Meta Quest</a></p><h2><em>Dorfromantik</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2RvcmZyb21hbnRpayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXCI4wIde9lRRWYp1e0kr-wKatfdEzV6wuqQKdptoJHE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdorfromantik"><em>Dorfromantik</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a puzzle game in which you lay down tiles to create an idyllic countryside. The tiles come in distinct types: forests, fields, rivers, railroads, little houses and so on. The idea is to chain similar pieces together, and the game will give you little “quests” to connect a certain number of matching tiles to grow your overall stack. Since you can only see a few tiles at once, exactly what your landscape looks like differs from game to game.</p><p>The need to keep gaining tiles creates a contingent sort of pressure, but even still, <em>Dorfromantik </em>is a game that encourages slowness and going at your own pace. There’s no time limit, and no way to even really “win.” You’re led to consider each piece, look at the land and see how it all fits. When the tiles run out, you’ve usually created a beautiful little scene. And if you just want to build a landscape without any restrictions, there’s a separate mode for that.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2RvcmZyb21hbnRpay1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXNWdj-vCW6lozA7iDPhUYR_YP39jKq9DcjbNZ2N3ohM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdorfromantik-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2RvcmZyb21hbnRpayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXCI4wIde9lRRWYp1e0kr-wKatfdEzV6wuqQKdptoJHE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdorfromantik">PC</a></p><h2><em>A Short Hike</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2Ffc2hvcnRfaGlrZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAV1rWZsmZNEEkcI36Pg9s1eXaTpKo8eiPPSgvSAyqd1s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fa_short_hike"><em>A Short Hike</em></a> is a lovely little adventure game that is completely in tune with itself. You play as Claire, a young bird in a world of anthropomorphic animals, who is staying in a small yet bustling provincial park. Something is weighing on her, and she needs to make a phone call, but the only place with cellular reception is the top of the mountain at the park’s center. Your only real objective in the two-hour game is to get her there.</p><p>There is a conventional core to <em>A Short Hike</em> that involves doing light fetch quests for other park-goers and collecting golden feathers to climb higher and double-jump more. But most of these tasks are straightforward, and it quickly becomes apparent that you can (literally) soar around most of the park as you please, taking in the sights and interacting with the other park visitors as they go about their lives. Apart from simply feeling nice, this freedom ties beautifully into the game’s themes: That mountain is calling, but you don’t have to climb it right away. When you do, the world will still be there for you to explore.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2Etc2hvcnQtaGlrZS1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXnbvPTNCCA9VfXzAmo_Ei8gdUGXc0Xo3bjAZPKWSU1Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fa-short-hike-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP7124-CUSA29611_00-5721900664542776">PS4</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvYS1zaG9ydC1oaWtlLzluazc4ZGYyMDdzZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZHAusFATjJOEY_GFU7B-rHu0VX-lskzCVfJ6GFjkkCy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fa-short-hike%2F9nk78df207sd">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2Ffc2hvcnRfaGlrZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAV1rWZsmZNEEkcI36Pg9s1eXaTpKo8eiPPSgvSAyqd1s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fa_short_hike">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/66152">2 hours</a></p><h2><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYXB0YWluLVRvYWQtVHJlYXN1cmUtVHJhY2tlci9kcC9CMDdDRFFEUERXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYCGDSA76FAjgY23_Yrc026O9sKiUN17RpS5ZX5mZVeZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCaptain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB07CDQDPDW"><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></a> is an adorable puzzle-platformer from Nintendo that has you navigate a series of contained, diorama-like levels, each with a gold star at its end. It’s technically a spin-off of the <em>Super Mario </em>games, but here, you can’t jump. Instead, you need to explore the multiplayer game’s densely-packed spaces from new angles, shifting the camera to find hidden pathways and bonus treasures.</p><p>The whole thing is neither overlong nor super difficult, but it is determined, in that delightful Nintendo way, to constantly hit you with new ideas, each as playful and meticulous as the last. While it doesn’t reach the creative heights of the best <em>Mario </em>games — some of which were developed by the same team — it is similarly amiable and more easygoing.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYXB0YWluLVRvYWQtVHJlYXN1cmUtVHJhY2tlci9kcC9CMDdDRFFEUERXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYCGDSA76FAjgY23_Yrc026O9sKiUN17RpS5ZX5mZVeZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCaptain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB07CDQDPDW">Switch</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/19217">11 hours</a></p><h2><em>Desert Golfing</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757040/Desert_Golfing/"><em>Desert Golfing</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is exactly what its title says and nothing more. There is a ball, a hole, and some procedurally generated desert land in between. That’s it. No par, no club selection, no music, no items, no pause menu, no restarts, not even a physical avatar. Only dragging a cursor back to determine the next shot’s angle and power, and an attempt to get A to B. Once you do, a new hole appears, and you go on, infinitely. (The game <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3nnv4/one-players-21000-hole-quest-to-beat-the-seemingly-endless-desert-golf">technically has</a> an “ending,” but may God have mercy on anyone who plays long enough to see it.)</p><p><em>Desert Golfing</em> reads as overly simple on paper, and sure, it makes sense as a sneaky critique of time-sucking, player-debasing mobile games. Actually playing it, though, borders on meditative. The game’s radical minimalism makes everything and nothing matter all at once. There’s a shot counter at the top, but it’s functionally meaningless, merely signifying how long you’ve played. You may spend 60 shots on one hole, but there’s no invisible eye judging you. Instead, you’re allowed to focus entirely on the simple pleasure of arcing a ball through the air, seeing it kick up sand and eventually making it <em>plonk</em> in the hole. It’s about the act of play more than the rules of a game: golf<em>ing</em>, not golf. And when something new does pop up — a well of water, a setting sun, a cactus — it feels momentous.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757040/Desert_Golfing/">PC</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9kZXNlcnQtZ29sZmluZy9pZDkwMjA2MjY3Mz9pZ24tbXB0PXVvJTNEOCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX4she92RWsxtDfr4i6Jk4NU5J-EL2bOWCxamB1xYZFb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fdesert-golfing%2Fid902062673%3Fign-mpt%3Duo%253D8">iOS</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmNhcHRhaW5nYW1lcy5nb2xmIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc1SyhX-OTCD9ZKPFKw2K4j7GbqkFBIKdSiRty_Da2sJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.captaingames.golf">Android</a></p><h2><em>The Ramp</em></h2><p></p><p>Much like <em>Desert Golfing</em>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3RoZS1yYW1wLXN3aXRjaC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXj50fS0koKpkoVqRd5EmxMxu5j66IIo0-zebjY6k5vw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fthe-ramp-switch%2F"><em>The Ramp</em></a> is a successful experiment in minimalism. It’s a skateboarding game, but its approach is a far cry from the <em>Tony Hawk </em>series. It doesn’t burden you with high scores, skill points, objectives, camera adjustments or a HUD, and it respects you enough to unlock all of its courses and characters after a brief tutorial.</p><p>While it takes a moment to get the hang of its controls, <em>The Ramp</em> excels at conveying the joy of motion and momentum in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vert_skateboarding">vert skating</a>, from launching at speed, to that brief moment of weightlessness in the sky, to the rush of gravity pulling you back down. There’s a handful of tricks to pull off, some chill music to help set the tone, and no real penalty for biffing it.</p><p><em>The Ramp </em>doesn’t have much “depth” by conventional gaming standards; its developer describes it as a “digital toy,” which sounds about right.

It’s crudely animated and maybe an hour long, but it develops more identifiable and <em>human</em> characters in that time than most big-budget games do in 30 hours of gameplay.</p><p>The story follows the camping trip of a young couple, Brad and Cloanne, their 13-year-old niece Mord and her friend Ben, and the subsequent lessons they learn about love and each other. It has the air of an indie comedy: a little quirky, funny but not mean-spirited, honest but not long-winded, and moving when it’s time to bring the story home. Its world isn’t ending, and there’s no combat. It’s a game about <em>these </em>characters in <em>this </em>specific moment, and it’s presented like a series of memories, something its bold colors amplify.</p><p>The game’s approach to interactivity plays a big role in selling all of this. Instead of merely controlling a specific character, you’re often in charge of the camera, a sort of director role that brings you closer to each scene but distances you, the player, from the action (or what qualifies as action in this case).</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3dpZGUtb2NlYW4tYmlnLWphY2tldC1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVD5zevdP8ciReCydP3Rj7IIV8GwSPRQss3tp-2YXHwP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fwide-ocean-big-jacket-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS93aWRlLW9jZWFuLWJpZy1qYWNrZXQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcwETJEl471KX1MGHffNZn2FrubK86O3rpZlbnVO_qoA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwide-ocean-big-jacket">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/75015">1 hour</a></p><h2><em>Hidden Folks</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2hpZGRlbi1mb2xrcy1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARz6BVhYwZm-CUQpdHRnqDonQKJqrsxYo534yYWBSf4i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fhidden-folks-switch%2F"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a> is like a digital take on those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where's_Wally%3F"><em>Where’s Waldo?</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>puzzle books you might’ve had as a kid.

There’s no rush; nobody on the screen is going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2hpZGRlbi1mb2xrcy1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARz6BVhYwZm-CUQpdHRnqDonQKJqrsxYo534yYWBSf4i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fhidden-folks-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435400/Hidden_Folks/">PC</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9oaWRkZW4tZm9sa3MvaWQxMTMzNTQ0OTIzP2xzPTEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATEJYd0aSw1AEiCVoxZrR0QKEDLa44AlKsMgPEbpXzrF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fhidden-folks%2Fid1133544923%3Fls%3D1">iOS</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmFkcmlhYW5kZWpvbmdoLmhpZGRlbmZvbGtzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT4hYfrDzWVzpo0IEnsvwS90MH2-rtmdTUYXhbltksoJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.adriaandejongh.hiddenfolks">Android</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/43852">6 hours</a></p><h2><em>PowerWash Simulator</em></h2><p></p><p>You know those oddly satisfying YouTube videos of people deep-cleaning <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1KQm0xYWFTRlhTOCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVLOrD1tIV8AJiSQZJXwtkKC9yI8aJuDE6fibqp0Y9PG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJBm1aaSFXS8">rugs</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1zMG80Zl9YYUhQMCZ0PTExcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAa-5gBNlv0jX0y-iDUPnGgKFmBy61jq6xvth2UI2e6I1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ds0o4f_XaHP0%26t%3D11s">driveways</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1sTXliMGVyTnVDRSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbakM9nGx8hdYBUlx6fIVNVTzNq2gdb-Flr-lQBWhxT3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlMyb0erNuCE">old electronics</a> and the like? <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9wb3dlcndhc2gtc2ltdWxhdG9yIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARE1ONLnjrYOpxQe6xEkAsFIuSCjQvkk0B_gHPvRUa2D&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fpowerwash-simulator"><em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a> is the popular relaxing game version of those. You take on a range of power washing jobs around the town of “Muckingham,” slowly but steadily erasing the grime from various objects in each gig. There’s no time limit or score to meet, and each dirty <em>thing </em>has a corresponding progress bar to complete.</p><p>There’s more meat to <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> than you might expect: You can earn money to spend on upgraded power washing equipment, and there’s a narrative mode that goes places, literally and metaphorically. It probably doesn’t need to do quite as much as it does, but <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>’s pleasures are layered: the immediate satisfaction of making dirty things pristine, and the larger one of systematically “working” toward a job well done.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3Bvd2Vyd2FzaC1zaW11bGF0b3Itc3dpdGNoLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAY-1bwWrkFikAUrKOOgG4lkgtKroTG7tl-K65tz49kfX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpowerwash-simulator-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA04987_00-3528315769842001">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA04987_00-3528315769842001">PS5</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcG93ZXJ3YXNoLXNpbXVsYXRvci85bmhkamMwbncyMG0iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb45P3NVbHuJ5XKPxKGz-rIGKFoKPmnjXAe2Nw3yWiSN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fpowerwash-simulator%2F9nhdjc0nw20m">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9wb3dlcndhc2gtc2ltdWxhdG9yIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARE1ONLnjrYOpxQe6xEkAsFIuSCjQvkk0B_gHPvRUa2D&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fpowerwash-simulator">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/92511">43 hours</a></p><h2><em>Unpacking</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9VbnBhY2tpbmctU3RhbmRhcmQtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjA5TTZIOVJXVy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbTYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATtebjb9oUlH3aRSywRvsB17Fu286I3ZvsHWz_77jLl5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUnpacking-Standard-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB09M6H9RWW%2F"><em>Unpacking</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a stripped-down puzzler about unpacking boxes. You methodically work your way through each collection of knick-knacks, placing them around different rooms in a sequence of homes. The game is nearly wordless, but it manages to tell a story almost entirely through its isometric environments: The boxes you unpack all belong to the same character, and each move takes place in a different year of their life. This, combined with the pixelated visuals, gives the game a vaguely wistful tone.</p><p><em>Unpacking </em>is still a puzzle game, so it’ll make items glow red until you put them in a “correct” location. This feels like a misstep: If I want to leave my bookbag off to the side of my bed and just be done with things, why can’t I? Isn’t moving messy? Still, even if <em>Unpacking </em>is a bit too gamified, there’s a quiet catharsis to its fantasy of putting everything in its right place. If nothing else, it’s far less stressful than moving in real life.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9VbnBhY2tpbmctU3RhbmRhcmQtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjA5TTZIOVJXVy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbTYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATtebjb9oUlH3aRSywRvsB17Fu286I3ZvsHWz_77jLl5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUnpacking-Standard-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB09M6H9RWW%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3864-PPSA07117_00-UNPACKINGPS5000A">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3864-PPSA07117_00-UNPACKINGPS5000A">PS5</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvdW5wYWNraW5nLzluaDVobjExZmc0bSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATMf9kjr0O327ywEOImrWf-kLrkRkD6uw3FADKfidUfw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Funpacking%2F9nh5hn11fg4m">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3VucGFja2luZyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYCYww_WhY-Ft5in91aR0zbyBOnB8_TP_tdVUBhQ7Q4f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Funpacking">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/69666">4 hours</a></p><h2><em>Please, Touch the Artwork</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BsZWFzZS10b3VjaC10aGUtYXJ0d29yay1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWU6Q39vKaV6N9CuaCHp7MXrmwm2ZwyB9WMxnysk_qS0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fplease-touch-the-artwork-switch%2F"><em>Please, Touch the Artwork</em></a> is a set of three earnest puzzle games, each inspired by abstract art. The specifics of the games differ: One has you mechanically recreate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian">Mondrian-style</a> paintings, another turns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Boogie_Woogie"><em>Broadway Boogie Woogie</em></a> into a little love story, and the third reframes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_(painting)"><em>New York City</em></a> as a metaphor for adjusting to life in, well, a big new city. Only the first can get particularly difficult, but the game tells you right upfront that it’s made to be a low-stress experience, with no timers, and hints and redo buttons there if you need them.</p><p>What intrigues about <em>Please, Touch the Artwork </em>isn’t what it says about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl"><em>De Stijl</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and abstract art (as if such works could ever be “solved”). Rather, it’s what it conveys about the experience of taking in art itself, and how close it brings you to the lone developer (Thomas Waterzooi) behind the game. The whole project has an intensely personal feel, like peering into someone’s brain and seeing how this kind of art speaks to them.

<p>“Let’s see what a Snickers bar does to my blood sugar,” Justin Richard, a 52-year-old Toronto-based TikToker says just before eating the candy bar on camera. After an edited time skip, Richard says, “It’s been several hours since I’ve had the chocolate bar, let’s have a look at the glucose monitor and see what actually happened.” He slightly lifts his arm flashing the device, an inconspicuous blue circular patch that almost looks like a Band-Aid. Above his head flashes a screenshot of his blood glucose reading, which appears to have spiked, dipped, and spiked again. “I had a spike in my blood sugar,” he says. “That's not a shock because this is loaded with sugar.” A red ‘X’ graphic appears over some b-roll of the Snickers bar. “I did this test because I’m trying to establish a benchmark.”<br /><br />This is a typical <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@insulinresistant1/video/7221725285064903942">60-second TikTok</a> from Richard, whose handle is @insulinresistant1 on the platform. In the following clip, Richard eats a cup of broccoli before eating another full Snickers bar, then goes on to share the results of his blood glucose levels from his personal continuous glucose monitor. He eats this oddball combination to show how variations in his food intake can impact or even prevent a blood glucose spike.<br /><br />Continuous glucose monitors (or CGMs) have long been used as a tool to track blood sugar levels for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Here’s the thing, though: Richard does not have diabetes.</p><div id="dd8d4329ac1f4b83bff08a5a8ebb1c5c"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@insulinresistant1/video/7221725285064903942" class="tiktok-embed"><section><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@insulinresistant1?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@insulinresistant1">@insulinresistant1</a> Snickers and my blood sugar.

Users like Richard that have integrated a CGM into their daily life have stormed platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Some internet health coaches and dieticians have trumpeted their praise. On TikTok, the hashtags #insulinresistance has 1.2 billion views, while #continuousglucosemonitor has over 32.7 million views. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@insulinresistant1">Richard</a>, who has over 800,000 TikTok followers, is just one influencer who  helped fuel this trend. On his page, which he started during the pandemic, showcases him eating a wide range of foods and drinks, from sodas to chocolate bars, reacting to readings emitting from his Signos-sponsored CGM device.<br /><br />Richard says he got into continuous glucose monitoring to “optimize his health” and prevent chronic illness, which was especially important to him considering his extensive family history of Type 2 diabetes. “It's like having a coach,” he said in an interview. “But the coach is telling you to do something.” That something was to make some pretty dramatic dietary changes. “'I'm not a healthcare professional and I don't pretend to be. All of my tests are about my blood sugar, and what I read online and how it affects me,” he said, adding that his disclaimer that “individual results will vary” is a key part of his messaging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 02: Taylor Jane Stimmler, whose had type 1 diabetes since she was a teenager, displays her continuous glucose monitor she wears on her arm on March 02, 2023 in New York City. Drugmaker Eli Lilly announced yesterday that it will cap the out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month. Medical experts believe that the unexpected move may compel other insulin makers in the U.S. to follow suit and cap their prices of insulin. For those without health insurance or a health plan, the cost of insulin can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars a month for a diabetic.

In the late 1990s, medical companies like Medtronic, Dexcom and Abbott revolutionized the way diabetes could be managed. The importance of continuous glucose monitoring for patients is well established as a means of improving glycemic control, especially in the case of Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>CGMs are a vital tool for preventing diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication seen in Type 1 diabetic patients. When sugar levels are too high and the body begins to break down fat as fuel, it can lead to a high amount of acid circulation in the bloodstream. For non-diabetics, however, complications stemming from extremely high or low blood sugar levels isn’t a concern. There is little to no research to back that monitoring blood glucose levels in generally healthy adults equates to an overall improvement in health.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Man putting new sensor on the back of upper arm" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c03c4140-2580-11ee-bf7b-2b20f766b597" style="height: 4320px; width: 6886px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Getty Images</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr_idz">Dr. Idz,</a> another TikToker with over 1.7 million followers, calls the use of CGM devices for adults without any prescribed medical need a “feature of disordered eating.” Dr. Idz, short for Idrees Mughal, is a board-certified UK-trained medical doctor with expertise in nutritional research. He became a prominent figure when he started rebuking the “nonsense health information” circulating on TikTok that “prey[s] on people's vulnerabilities.” He says CGMs aren’t really intended for non-diabetics because “our body is designed to regulate the spike.” Dr. Idz says people need to understand that spiking blood glucose is not a problem. In fact, that is supposed to happen when you eat food. “Even protein can spike your blood glucose, and no one is really hyped about that, right?”</p><p>Although there may not be an inherent physical risk for people who wear a CGM device to monitor and track sugar levels, there is a real possibility that access to “too much data” can lead to information overload, false alarms, unnecessary anxiety, confusion or misinterpretation. Slight fluctuations in blood sugar levels are normal in people who don’t have diabetes. Dr. Robert Shmerling, a senior faculty editor for Harvard Health Publishing and author of “Is blood sugar monitoring without diabetes worthwhile?” writes that, “we're at the very beginning of the learning curve for home monitoring of blood sugar in people without diabetes. Before buying into what may be the next fad in health monitoring, I think we need to learn a lot more.”</p><div id="a13397152d98484ca29148b6005a319b"><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;"><div style="padding: 16px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr8qC3IIsjz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div><div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"><div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"><div style="width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr8qC3IIsjz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Dr Idrees Mughal (MBBS, MRes, DipIBLM) (@dr_idz)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>Still, it’s no surprise that more people are interested in experimenting with CGM devices. Not only are TikTokers promoting blood glucose monitoring as an indicator of health and wellness, but ads for CGM devices from up-and-coming brands like <a href="https://www.nutrisense.io/?nbt=nb%3Amicrosoft%3Ao%3A424379905%3A1358997787864074%3A84937692299608&amp;nb_mt=e&amp;nb_bmt=be&amp;nb_oii=84938194092100&amp;nb_qs=nutrisense%20continuous%20glucose%20monitor&amp;nb_fii=&amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;nb_lp_ms=164262&amp;nb_pi=&amp;nb_pc=&amp;nb_ci=&amp;b_adgroup=nutrisense_continuous_glucose_monitor&amp;b_adgroupid=1358997787864074&amp;b_adid=84937692299608&amp;b_campaign=brand_exact_desktop&amp;b_campaignid=424379905&amp;b_isproduct=&amp;b_productid=&amp;b_term=nutrisense%20continuous%20glucose%20monitor&amp;b_termid=kwd-84938194092100:loc-4116&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=brand_exact_desktop&amp;utm_adgroup=nutrisense_continuous_glucose_monitor&amp;utm_keyword=nutrisense%20continuous%20glucose%20monitor&amp;msclkid=3aef8c7736341658ab48e8ffb02ea026">Nutrisense</a>, <a href="https://www.veri.co/">Veri</a> and <a href="https://www.signos.com/">Signos</a> have been flooding social media.</p><p>The companies use language designed to sell the average person on the importance of regularly tracking blood sugar levels as a way to lose weight or as a “metabolism hack.” The idea is that eating refined carbs and sugary foods can spike blood glucose levels and, over time, the cells that are supposed to take up insulin and regulate glucose production in the liver become resistant to the hormone due to habitual bad dieting. Heather Davis, a registered and licensed dietitian and nutritionist at Nutrisense denies that the company promises weight loss through glucose monitoring. “A CGM is not a weight loss device per se,” she said. “The CGM is simply one tool among many that may support insights into how different dietary and lifestyle approaches influence metabolic health, including weight factors.”</p><figure><img alt="The needle of a glucose sensor in the insertion device" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/0fe8ca20-2580-11ee-bfff-c813278048d2" style="height: 2592px; width: 3888px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Getty Images/iStockphoto</div></figure><p>Dr. Idz would disagree with Nutrisense on that. He argues that the vast majority of people won't even know how to interpret CGM results. “Even me as a medical doctor, I would probably need to look at some reference values for each individual, you know, perhaps have to do some calculations. And that's me who's actually a medical doctor. Imagine the average person who's just going, ‘oh, my gosh, I've had a spike. That must mean it's bad, right?’ You don't even know how to interpret it. So it's going to be completely useless.”</p><p>Nutrisense’s Davis concedes that there is limited research currently looking at CGM use in non-diabetic populations, but she argues that “once upon a time, there was also limited research looking at CGM use in diabetic populations” and that the “risks of wearing a CGM are extremely minimal for most people.” Still, the FDA has never recommended continuous glucose monitoring for healthy individuals. It has only even approved a handful of devices for people who do suffer from diabetes. Although it may be useful for predicting a risk for pre-diabetes and diabetes, there is a consensus that more scientific studies are needed to observe CGM use among healthy populations.</p><p>Companies marketing their wearables to healthy people are entering a crowded, but growing market that’s ripe for exploitation. There is arguably an enormous opportunity for companies advertising to healthy individuals to reap financial benefits from the latest health fad.</p><figure><img alt="Signos CGM app and attachment " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/40563590-257f-11ee-b3ff-c23e25507438" style="height: 664px; width: 623px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Signos </div></figure><p>TikToker Richard says he thinks continuous glucose monitoring is only going to grow from here. “I don't think this trend is going to end anytime soon,” he said. “Anybody and every country that's adopted this fast food, highly processed diet is having this same increase in Type 2 diabetes and you really can't ignore it. So I think this trend is gonna continue as long as this fast food is so prevalent.” Dr. Idz, on the other hand, would argue that if you want to prevent diabetes, “that's fine but you're not going to do it by wearing a CGM because you know, as long as you're not insulin resistant, you'll find that you don't need you don't need a CGM.”<br /><br />To make matters worse, not only are CGMs questionably useful for healthy individuals, but they can be expensive, too. The devices must be replaced every seven to 14 days depending on the manufacturer. Nutrisense does not accept insurance coverage on the grounds it is a “wellness program,” with monthly subscriptions starting at $225 and no-commitment plans reaching $399 a month. Competitors like Signos, which accepts insurance with a diabetes diagnosis, offers a monthly plan for its wearable and monitoring app, and that costs upwards of $449 a month. Veri may accept insurance, depending on the provider. And even though it’s able to dramatically undercut its competitors, the monthly fee of between $40 to $109 is hardly cheap. Richard, who has historically paid out of pocket for his CGM devices, believes the high cost is going to “save him money in the long run.”</p><p>Unfortunately, these lofty prices don’t just affect health-conscious TikTokers. Access to CGM devices for diabetic populations can be spotty. Individuals covered by Medicaid are less likely to have one covered, especially people of color, according to the <a href="https://diabetes.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/ADA-CGM-Utilization-White-Paper-Oct-2022.pdf">American Diabetes Association</a> (ADA).</p><div id="c10d5f53c6eb4077898c9c2626ca4e9b"></div><p>Aside from the technology’s often inaccessible price points, some experts argue that there simply isn't enough guidance from the scientific community on CGM applications for healthy individuals. The ADA does not recommend CGM device use by healthy people, only clearly stating that the technology should be considered “from the outset of the diagnosis of diabetes that requires insulin management.”</p><p>Dr. Idz takes this a step further, stating flatly that “there is no evidence whatsoever that blunting blood sugar spikes does anything for our health.” He backs up his argument with research from a retrospective and randomized trial that focused on the impact of blood glucose monitoring in diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Dr. Idz says, if anything, research suggests that a low average blood glucose level is bad for you and might increase mortality risk over time due to diminished consumption of healthy nutrients and decreased liver function.<br /><br />Harvard’s Dr. Shmerling reports he could not find a published study suggesting that monitoring blood glucose levels directly translated into improved health. “Unfortunately, some makers of CGM systems aren't waiting for solid research results to market these devices to healthy people. So, consumers and marketing professionals — not researchers or doctors — may wind up driving demand for the product,” Dr. Shmerling writes. Despite the lacking body of evidence to support blood glucose monitoring among healthy populations, the inflated price points for direct to consumer products, and the technological handicaps still present in the burgeoning industry, the growing popularity of CGMs among health and fitness enthusiasts does not seem to be slowing down.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/why-are-non-diabetics-suddenly-wearing-continuous-glucose-monitors-161506594.html?src=rss

<p>Spain has fined Amazon and Apple a total of 194.1 million euros (over $218 million) for antitrust violations. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/spain-antitrust-watchdog-fines-amazon-apple-218-million-2023-07-18/">According to</a><em>Reuters</em>, the penalties relate to a deal the companies made in 2018 that made Amazon an authorized Apple dealer but also included alleged anti-competitive clauses. “The two companies restricted without justification the number of sellers of Apple products on the Amazon website in Spain,” Spain’s antitrust regulator, Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC), said today.</p><p>The CNMC fined Apple 143.6 million euros and Amazon 50.5 million euros for their role in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, based on contracts signed on October 31st, 2018. The agency said over 90 percent of existing vendors selling Apple products on Amazon were blocked from the storefront after the deal. In addition, Amazon allegedly restricted non-Spanish retailers in the European Union from reaching Spanish customers. The online retailer also supposedly diminished the allowed advertising from Apple’s competitors in consumer search results for Apple devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the CNMC, the result was higher online prices for Apple devices listed and sold in Spain.</p><p>Amazon and Apple denied that the deal hurt consumers in separate statements to <em>Reuters</em>. “We reject the suggestion made by CNMC that Amazon benefits from excluding sellers from its market place, as our business model hinges precisely on the success of the companies selling through Amazon,” an Amazon representative told the news outlet today. Similarly, Apple said the deal was about limiting counterfeit sales, adding that it had previously spent lots of money on hundreds of thousands of take-down notices for fake products.</p><p>The companies have two months to appeal the antitrust watchdog’s decision. Spokespeople for both firms told <em>Reuters</em> they plan to do just that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spain-fines-amazon-and-apple-for-alleged-price-fixing-160021453.html?src=rss

## Unopened first-gen iPhone sells at auction for $190,000

<p>Someone with deep pockets has snapped up a piece of tech history after <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elusive-apple-iphone-2007-sells-115301361.html?guccounter=1"><ins>forking over</ins></a> $190,000 for a first-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-01-09-the-apple-iphone.html"><ins>iPhone from 2007</ins></a>. That's around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/17/first-generation-apple-iphone-sells-auction-in-us">300 times</a> the device's original price.</p><p>Don't expect to fetch anything close to this kind of windfall by selling a 16-year-old smartphone you have stuffed in a drawer somewhere. This was a factory sealed device in &quot;exceptional condition,&quot; <a href="https://auction.lcgauctions.com/bids/bidplace?itemid=1102"><ins>according to the listing</ins></a>. Auctioneer LCG Auctions noted that the consignor of the lot was part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple's</ins></a> engineering team when the iPhone debuted. &quot;Collectors and investors would be hard pressed to find a superior example,&quot; the auction house wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lot drew interest from multiple parties as 28 bids were lodged, including five that were over $100,000. In recent months, LCG Auctions has sold two 8GB variants of the first-generation iPhone for $39,000 and $63,000. But what helps this item stand out is that it's a rare 4GB model. Apple only produced this model for two months as consumers overwhelmingly preferred a version with double the storage.</p><p>It's unlikely that the buyer will actually open the package up and use the phone, since breaking the seal would send its value nosediving. If they did, though, they'd be tinkering with a device that probably wouldn't even be able to make a phone call, since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-17-att-shuts-down-2g-network.html">2G networks have shut down</a> in many parts of the world. FaceTime would be a no-go, since there's no front-facing camera and the OG iPhone can't even run a version of iOS that supports the feature. The vast majority of other apps won't work on it.</p><p>Even so, the original iPhone may still make for a decent iPod. It even had a headphone jack. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-12-apple-iphone-headphone-jack-se-6s.html">Remember those?</a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/unopened-first-gen-iphone-sells-at-auction-for-190000-154549102.html?src=rss

## Microsoft will charge businesses $30 per user for its 365 AI Copilot

<p>At the Microsoft Inspire partner event today, the Windows maker announced pricing for its AI-infused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-copilot-uses-ai-to-automate-everyday-tasks-in-multiple-apps-151133434.html">Copilot for Microsoft 365</a>. The suite of contextual artificial intelligence tools, the fruit of the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-reportedly-warned-microsoft-about-rushing-gpt-4-integration-into-bing-182044458.html">OpenAI partnership</a>, will cost $30 per user for business accounts. In addition, the company is launching Bing Chat Enterprise, a privacy-focused version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">AI chatbot</a> with greater security and peace of mind for handling sensitive business data.</p><p>Revealed in March, Microsoft 365 Copilot is the company’s vision of the future of work. The GPT-4-powered suite of tools lets you generate Office content using natural-language text prompts. For example, you can ask PowerPoint to create a presentation based on a Word document, generate a proposal from spreadsheet data or summarize emails and draft responses in Outlook — all by typing simple commands. “By grounding answers in business data like your documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings and contacts, and combining them with your working context — the meeting you’re in now, the emails you’ve exchanged on a topic, the chats you had last week — Copilot delivers richer, more relevant and more actionable responses to your questions,” Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft’s Chief Communications Officer, wrote in an announcement today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft began testing Copilot with a small group of select enterprise partners earlier this year but hasn’t yet announced when all business customers will gain access. However, announcing its pricing could mean that date is fast approaching. The $30 / mo. pricing will apply to Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium customers. The company still hasn’t announced Copilot consumer pricing or availability.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bing Chat Enterprise is Microsoft’s more security-minded variant of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-brings-bings-ai-chatbot-to-its-ios-and-android-swiftkey-apps-113528183.html">popular AI chatbot</a> that launched for consumers in February. “Since launching the new Bing in February, we’ve heard from many corporate customers who are excited to empower their organizations with powerful new AI tools but are concerned that their companies’ data will not be protected,” Shaw wrote. “That’s why today we’re announcing Bing Chat Enterprise, which gives organizations AI-powered chat for work with commercial data protection. What goes in — and comes out — remains protected, giving commercial customers managed access to better answers, greater efficiency and new ways to be creative.”</p><p>Bing Chat Enterprise begins rolling out today in a preview — at no additional cost — for Microsoft 365 E5, E3, Business Premium and Business Standard customers. In addition, the company says it will make the enterprise-focused chatbot available as a standalone $5 subscription “in the future.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-charge-businesses-30-per-user-for-its-365-ai-copilot-153042654.html?src=rss

<p>College will be back in session soon enough, which also means a new batch of freshmen will start living the dorm life. If that applies to you, we think it’s a good idea to stock up on a few essentials for your new tiny abode before you get there, especially if this is your first time away from home. We’ve got tech recommendations, of course, but not everything on this list is a gadget. That’s because we also wanted to cover the other items that will bring you the comforts of home to your dorm and hopefully make student life less stressful.</p><h2>Echo Dot</h2><p></p><p>I resisted a smart speaker until a few months ago.

For example, if you wanted your team to guess the words “costume,” “web,” and “spider,” you might say “Peter, 3” to indicate that there are three clues on the board that match that word.

<p>A Canadian air cargo startup called <a href="https://www.flyribbit.com/">Ribbit</a> is planning to test pilotless flights for deliveries in remote areas of the country, <a href="https://www.northernontariobusiness.com/industry-news/transportation/company-testing-pilotless-airplane-flights-to-remote-communities-7286570"><em>Northern Ontario Business</em></a> has reported. The company signed a $1.3 million contract with Transport Canada and Innovative Solutions Canada to start autonomous test flights &quot;over the next 12 months,&quot; the company said.</p><p>&quot;Many rural and remote areas are served by larger airplanes that fly infrequently,&quot; CEO Carl Pigeon said in a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cargo-airline-ribbit-signs-1-3m-contract-with-transport-canada-to-test-autonomous-flights-across-northern-canada-869610910.html">press release</a> earlier this month. &quot;Ribbit takes a smaller aircraft and uses autonomy to drastically change the unit economics of that plane. This lets us offer reliable next-day or two-day service and improve supply chains.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is starting small with two-passenger recreational-style aircraft. It plans to remove the seats to open up room for cargo, then make the aircraft fully autonomous using remote control software and hardware. The idea began as a project from University of Waterloo students, including co-founders Jeremy Wang and Carl Pigeon. Ribbit said its aircraft would use remote pilots to monitor progress, communicate with air traffic controllers and generally provide a backup.</p><p>The company has already signed contracts with retailers and wholesalers, including locally owned businesses that serve the province. The aim is to fill a demand for timely delivery of food, medical items and more. &quot;The goal is really to try and improve that transportation link so that we can get food and other perishables, time-sensitive items, medical supplies, etcetera, into these communities at a lower price to the end consumer more reliably, and more frequently,&quot; Wang told <em>Northern Ontario Business</em>.</p><p>There are a number of competitors in this space already, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-texas-factory-has-produced-its-first-cybertruck-161840934.html">most notably Xwing</a>, which has already performed autonomous gate-to-gate commercial cargo flights.

## Canon EOS R50 review: Big performance for a tiny camera

<p>Canon’s mirrorless EOS R mirrorless camera family now sits at a healthy 11 members, but most of those to date have been high-end models priced at over $1,000. Recently, though, the company has been wooing budget-minded shoppers with models like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eos-r100-is-canons-cheapest-r-series-mirrorless-camera-yet-084049616.html">$480 R100</a> and the subject of this review – the $680, 24-megapixel R50.</p><p>The R50 uses a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r10-mirrorless-camera-review-180003395.html">$980 EOS R10</a>, so image quality should be on par. Otherwise, you can think of the R50 as an RF-mount version of the older <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canons-eos-m-50-mark-ii-mirrorless-camera-is-aimed-at-creators-093954801.html">M-mount M50 Mark II </a>– but with updates like uncropped 4K that make it better for creators. At the same time, it’s even lighter and smaller, so it’s ideal for travel, street photography and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Where the $480 R100 is aimed at the bottom end of the mirrorless market, the $680 R50 is targeting users a bit more serious about photography and content creation. Does it have enough going for it to entice such users? Let’s take a look.</p><h3>Body &amp; Handling</h3><div id="f8dd7826f608444da97d90b993f66149"></div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>The EOS R50 is diminutive in both weight and size, weighing in at just 375 grams with a battery and memory card. With a similarly light and small lens, like the 18-45mm kit or the new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi1SRjI4bW0tV2lkZS1BbmdsZS1GdWxsLUZyYW1lLUNhbWVyYXMvZHAvQjBDNjZKTVg5MS9yZWY9c3JfMV8yP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFwdi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzk5M2NhNGQtZTk3ZS00YThhLTk3NzktMTI3ZGViZmRkNjdhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdIN8JCaWDgU_ovNKuwr1db_kXc5C6YXQgW_DYP_x0mD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-RF28mm-Wide-Angle-Full-Frame-Cameras%2Fdp%2FB0C66JMX91%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2">28mm pancake model</a>, it can easily slip into a small bag. Travelers and tourists will often settle for a smartphone rather than lugging around a heavy camera, but the R50 removes that barrier.</p><p>There’s a price to be paid in terms of usability, however. It has a relatively small grip that’s effectively unusable with large lenses, though it does have a nice rubber material so it shouldn’t slip out of your hands.</p><p>The R50 is also lacking in controls compared to other models. It has just a single dial to change settings, meaning you have to hit the exposure compensation button to toggle between shutter speed and aperture in manual mode. But since the camera is designed for beginners used to smartphones, it’s essentially designed to be controlled by the touchscreen. That works well enough, but the main menu items are a little small and fiddly.</p><p>The 2.95-inch touchscreen is nice though, with a relatively high 1.6 million dot resolution. As with all other Canon EOS R cameras, it fully articulates, making it useful for selfies and vlogging. The electronic viewfinder is on the low end though, being relatively small and with a low 2.36-million dot resolution.</p><p>With the same small battery as the EOS R10, it gets just 370 shots on a charge – perhaps the camera’s biggest weakness. It is, however, a significant improvement over the 305 shots you get with the original M50 II.  Other features include a mic but no headphone port, a single slow UHS-I card slot, USB-C and micro HDMI ports and yes, a built-in flash that’s perfect for its target market.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>One significant problem with budget-oriented cameras is the lack of a good autofocus system – something that’s crucial for camera novices. Luckily, the R50’s hybrid phase-detect autofocus is very solid. A simplified version of the AF from high end cameras like the R3, it tenaciously follows subjects and captures sharp photos.</p><p>It can track eyes, faces and heads, along with animals including dogs, cats, birds and horses. It also tracks vehicles like race cars, bicycles, trains and airplanes. You can either let the system choose a subject, or tap the touchscreen to select it yourself.</p><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R50 review: Big performance for a tiny camera" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/5c228cd0-2181-11ee-96ee-0dc1db762817" style="height: 1238px; width: 2200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>Performance is a little less dependable for animals and vehicles than it is for people. And subject tracking will often drop the subject if you’re too far away from it. But overall, the AI system is dependable, particularly with people.</p><p>That serves it well for burst shooting, which is surprisingly fast for such a small camera. It can grab frames at up to 12 fps in mechanical shutter mode or 15 fps in silent electronic mode. However, you’re limited to 42 JPEG images in a burst and just 7 uncompressed RAWs, due to the small buffer and slow memory card slots.</p><p>On top of the usual manual and auto shooting modes, the R50 has creative settings for beginners including something called A+ Advanced Auto. If it detects a scene that’s tricky to shoot due to high contrast or darkness, it takes four shots and combines them into a single JPEG image, much like smartphones have done for years. The results can be pleasing, but may also look overprocessed.</p><p>As you’d expect, there’s no in-body stabilization, so you’ll need to rely on optically stabilized lenses for that – and there are only two of those in the APS-C lineup. Those only deliver 4 stops of shake reduction, but it’s enough to allow for sharp shots at 1/10th of a second or so. When using the silent shutter function, beware that some rolling shutter effect is present, but it’s reasonably well controlled.</p><h3>Image quality</h3><p>As the R50 shares the R10’s 24-megapixel sensor, photo quality is nearly the same. For normal shooting, I saw color accurate photos with skin tones leaning on the warm side as is typical with Canon’s color science. JPEGs strike a good balance between sharpening and noise reduction, while RAW files allow for a decent amount of room to tweak images.</p><p>Low-light performance isn’t amazing, though. ISO 6400 is pretty much a hard limit, and even then you won’t have a lot of room to boost blacks without getting tons of noise. And you don’t have in-body stabilization to help at low shutter speeds.</p><p>Luckily,  the R50 does have a built-in flash that can fill in if you’re lacking light. Just make sure to dial the illumination levels down in the settings to avoid blowing out your subject.</p><section><img alt="Canon EOS R50 review: Big performance for a tiny camera" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c70f5ca0-217f-11ee-8895-5058fc70c54e" style="height: 1467px; width: 2200px;" /></section><h3>Video</h3><p>Where the EOS R10 offers cropped 4K 60p video, the R50 is limited to 4K 30p.

<p>The Neopets Team has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23798368/neopets-relaunch-website-flash-games">huge plans</a> for the once-beloved virtual pet website in hopes that it could finally catch up with the times. In a <a href="https://medium.com/@neopetsofficial/a-new-era-for-neopets-fdb5c9ac187e">lengthy post on Medium</a>, the team has announced that a new Neopets website is coming on July 20th. It'll still live on the <a href="https://neopets.com/">same URL</a>, but it'll contain all the brand's announcements and links to all its different games and products. The people behind the revamp are currently trying to resolve bugs and mobile browser compatibility issues. They're also exploring the use of Ruffle, a Flash player emulator, to make old Flash-based Neopets games playable again.&nbsp;</p><p>The company that owned Neopets planned to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-11-neopets-tv-show.html">create an animated show</a> based on the once-beloved virtual pet website, but it failed to release the series before it shut down. In its announcement, the Neopets team has revealed that it's under new leadership and has raised over $4 million in funding for its future projects. The team members definitely seem optimistic for the future of the brand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In fact, the team doesn't intend to stop with a revamped website. Apparently, it has decided to transition to a mobile app and to build a social life-simulation game called <em>World of Neopets</em> from the ground up. At the moment, the plan is to develop a game from the perspective of a Neopet. Players will be able to decorate their homes, explore lands in 3D and play mini-games with their friends, akin to titles like <em>Animal Crossing</em>. It sounds like the project is still in its very early stages, though, and it remains to be seen if it will materialize.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/neopets-is-fixing-its-flash-games-and-working-on-a-social-life-sim-mobile-app-121509727.html?src=rss

## The best GPS running watches for 2023

<p>Because I'm the editor of Engadget by day and a volunteer coach in my free time, I often get asked which GPS watch or fitness tracker to buy. (People also ask what I'm wearing and the answer is: All of them. I am testing all of them.) For my part, the best running watches are quick to lock in a GPS signal, offer accurate distance and pace tracking, last a long time on a charge, are comfortable to wear and easy to use.</p><p>Advanced tracking features like monitoring VO2 Max, or maximum oxygen intake during workouts with increasing intensity, are also nice to have, along with training assessments to keep your workload in check and make sure you're getting in effective aerobic and anaerobic workouts. It's also a plus when a watch supports other sports, like cycling and swimming, which all of these do to varying extents. As for features like smartphone notifications and NFC payments, they’re not necessary for most people, especially considering they drive up the asking price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Without further ado, I bring you capsule reviews of four running watches, each of which I ultimately recommend, none of which is perfect. And keep in mind, when it comes time to make a decision of your own, there are no wrong answers here: I like Apple and Garmin enough, for instance, that I switch back and forth between them in my own training.</p><h2>Best GPS running watches</h2><h2>The best running watch that’s also a smartwatch: Apple Watch</h2><p></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stylish design; a great all-around smartwatch you'll want to use even when you're not exercising; automatic workout detection; heart-rate and blood oxygen monitoring; support for lots of third-party health platforms; auto-pause feels faster than on Garmin watches; zippy performance and fast re-charging; optional LTE is nice to have.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> For iPhone users only; shorter battery life than the competition might concern endurance athletes; fewer performance metrics and settings than what you'd find on a purpose-built sports watch.</p><p>Don't think of <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJESE00OUJKL3JlZj1mc19hX3d0Ml91czI_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1pZy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWRhYTUwMGMtMzE0Ny0zZGM5LThmNWUtZDUwOGZhMTQwODczIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAToraXkDYFKj-9PFJffEwa7b2dXTT668LWG07ldGLb84&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHM49BJ%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us2%3Fth%3D1">the Apple Watch</a> as a running watch. Think of it as a smartwatch that happens to have a running mode. Almost eight years after the original Watch made its debut, Apple has successfully transformed its wearable from an overpriced curiosity to an actually useful companion device for the masses. But being a gadget for the masses means that when it comes to running, the Apple Watch has never been as feature rich as competing devices built specifically for that purpose.</p><p>Before I get to that, a few words on why I like it. The<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html"> Apple Watch</a> is the only one of these watches I’d want to wear every day. (And I do: After reviewing Apple Watches for years,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-our-favorite-gadgets-of-2021-irl-140052965.html"> I finally purchased one</a> in fall 2021.) The most recent model is stylish, or at least as stylish as a wrist-based  computer can be, and certainly more so than any running watch I've encountered. The aluminum, water-resistant body and neutral Sport band go with most outfits and will continue to look fresh after all your sweaty workouts and jaunts through the rain. And the always-on display is easy to read in direct sunlight.</p><p>The battery life is 18 hours, according to Apple. Indeed, I never have a problem making it through the day. I’m often able to put the watch back on after a night of forgetting to charge it and still have some juice left. If you do forget, even a few minutes of charging in the morning can go a long way, even more so now that the Watch supports even faster charging than before. Plus, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjEzMzM2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZGFhNTAwYy0zMTQ3LTNkYzktOGY1ZS1kNTA4ZmExNDA4NzMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWoa1BRKRvxq3ycGetv7OGtXY74YRp7b9sMdiaKEbpid&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT213336">new low power mode</a> in watchOS 9 can help you extend the life of your Watch on particularly long days.</p><p>That said, it’s worth noting that other running watches claim longer usage time — between 30 and 40 hours in some cases. When it comes to workouts specifically, Apple rates the battery life with GPS at up to seven hours. Given that, I would trust the Watch to last through a short run or even a half marathon, but I'm not sure how it would fare in one of my slow, five-hour-plus marathons. We haven't put the higher-end <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html">Apple Watch Ultra</a> through such paces yet, but it's worth mentioning that it has the longest battery life of any Apple Watch with a promised 36 hours (and we got about three days worth of regular use during our testing).</p><p>The built-in activity tracking app is simple and addictive: I feel motivated to fill in my "move" (active calorie), exercise and stand rings each day. I enjoy earning award badges, even though they mean nothing. I'm grateful that the Apple Health app can pull in workouts from Garmin and every other brand featured here, and then count that toward my daily exercise and stand goals (but not my move goal, curiously).</p><p>My one complaint is that the sensors don’t always track standing time accurately. I have failed to receive credit when standing for long periods in front of a stove, but occasionally I’ve been rewarded for doing absolutely nothing.</p><p>As for running specifically, you're getting the basics and not much else. You can see your distance, calorie burn, heart rate readings, average pace and also rolling pace, which is your pace over the past mile at any given moment. You can also set pace alerts — a warning that you're going faster than you meant to, for example. Like earlier Apple Watches, you can also stream music or podcasts, if you have the cellular-enabled LTE model.</p><p>Because the watch has a GPS sensor, you can leave your phone at home while running. Of course, no two brands of running watches will offer exactly the same distance readout on a run. That said, though Apple never explicitly claimed the Watch offers improved accurate distance tracking, the readouts here do feel more accurate than on earlier models. It’s possible that Apple is making ongoing improvements under the hood that have added up to more accurate tracking performance.</p><p>For indoor runners, the Apple watch integrates with some treadmills and other exercise equipment, thanks to a two-way pairing process that essentially trades notes between the device and gym gear, formulating a more accurate estimate of your distance and effort using that shared data. In my experience, the Watch usually agrees with the treadmill on how far I ran, which is not always the case with other wearables.</p><p>I also particularly appreciate that the Apple Watch automatically detects workouts after a certain period of time. I use this feature daily as I walk to and from the subway and around my neighborhood. After 10 minutes, the familiar vibrating tick, with a message asking if I want to record an outdoor walk. The answer is always yes, and the watch thankfully includes the previous 10 minutes in which I forgot to initiate a workout.</p><p>Regardless of the workout type, all of your stats are listed on a series of pages, which you swipe through from left to right. In my early days using the watch, it was tempting to use the Digital Crown as a stopwatch button, similar to how I use other running watches. This urge has mostly subsided as I've gotten more comfortable with the user interface.</p><p>Like many of its competitors, the Apple Watch has an auto-pause option, which I often use in start-and-stop workouts. I also found in side-by-side comparisons (one watch on each wrist), that auto-pause on the Watch reacts faster than on Garmin models.</p><p>Conveniently, the Apple Watch can export workouts to MyFitnessPal so you get credit for your calorie burn there. Of note, the Watch has all of the health features that the previous generation, including a built-in ECG test for cardiac arrhythmias, along with fall detection, a blood oxygen test, respiratory tracking, emergency calls and menstrual tracking. Also like previous models, there’s a built-in compass and international emergency calling.</p><p>Unfortunately, the stats themselves are fairly limited, without much room for customization. There's no mode for interval workouts, either by time or distance. There's also not much of an attempt to quantify your level of fitness, your progress or the strenuousness of your workouts or training load. None of this should be a dealbreaker for more casual runners.</p><p>For more detailed tracking, your best bet is to experiment with third-party running apps for the iPhone, like Strava, RunKeeper, MapMyRun, Nike Run Club and others. It's through trial and error that I finally found an app with Watch support and timed intervals. But at the end of the day, it's easier to wear a purpose-built running watch when I'm running outdoors, sync my data to Apple Health, get my exercise and standing-time credit, and then put the Apple Watch back on the first chance I get. But if you can only afford one smartwatch for training and life, there's a strong case for choosing this one.</p><h2>The best for triathletes: Garmin Forerunner 745</h2><p></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Accurate distance tracking; long battery life; advanced fitness and training feedback; stores up to 500 songs; works with Garmin Pay.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Garmin’s auto-pause feature feels slower than Apple’s; more advanced features can sometimes mean the on-device UI is tricky to navigate; features like Garmin Pay drive up the price but may feel superfluous.</p><p>If the Apple Watch is for people who want a smartwatch that also has some workout features, the $500<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HYXJtaW4tRm9yZXJ1bm5lci1Fc3NlbnRpYWwtU21hcnR3YXRjaC0wMTAtMDI0NDUtMDAvZHAvQjA4RzU4NVhZSi8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1pZy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWRhYTUwMGMtMzE0Ny0zZGM5LThmNWUtZDUwOGZhMTQwODczIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAW41yNXs-eDtxB16qsjEKkp4UW92GtIFe4nCrG7KNNHG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGarmin-Forerunner-Essential-Smartwatch-010-02445-00%2Fdp%2FB08G585XYJ%2F%3Fth%3D1&amp;uuid=CXL7gLO4V547tfth15967"> Garmin Forerunner 745</a> is for athletes in training who want a purpose-built device to help prepare for triathlons. The various sensors inside can track your heart rate zones, VO2 Max and blood oxygen (with the option to track all-day and in-sleep, as opposed to just spot checking). On the software side, you get daily workout suggestions, a rating that summarizes your performance condition, animated on screen workouts, a cycling power rating, a sleep score and menstruation tracking. You can also create round-trip courses as well as find popular routes though Garmin’s Trendline populating routing feature.</p><p>Like other Garmin watches, even the entry-level ones, you also get feedback on your training load and training  status (unproductive, maintaining, productive, peaking, overreaching, detraining and recovery), a “Body Battery” energy rating, recommended recovery time, plus Garmin Coach and a race time predictor. And you can analyze “running dynamics” if you also have a compatible accessory.</p><p>The slight downside to having all of these features is that the settings menu can be trickier to navigate than on a simpler device like the entry-level <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HYXJtaW4tRm9yZXJ1bm5lci1SdW5uaW5nLVRyYWluaW5nLVN1cHBvcnQvZHAvQjA3UjJZV1ZXOD90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlnLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZGFhNTAwYy0zMTQ3LTNkYzktOGY1ZS1kNTA4ZmExNDA4NzMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWbQoANzRUpXw8zlWMgoO21jqGprV9AaPIyvstFZ5cIv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGarmin-Forerunner-Running-Training-Support%2Fdp%2FB07R2YWVW8%3Fth%3D1">Forerunner 45</a>. Fortunately, at least, a home screen update released back in fall 2020 makes it so that you can see more data points on the 1.2-inch screen with less scrolling required.</p><p>Speaking of the screen, the watch face, available in four colors, is easy to read in direct sunlight, and weighs a not-too-heavy 47g. That light weight, combined with the soft silicone band, makes it comfortable to wear for long stretches. Garmin rates the battery life at up to seven days, or up to 16 hours with GPS in use. (That figure drops to six hours when you combine GPS tracking with music playback.) In my testing, I was still at 88 percent after three hours of GPS usage. Most of my weekday runs are around 35 minutes and that, it turns out, only puts a roughly two- or three-percent dent in the battery capacity.</p><p>In practice, the watch also seemed quicker than my older <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-11-garmin-forerunner-645-music-review.html">Forerunner 645 Music</a> to latch onto a GPS signal, even in notoriously difficult spots with trees and cover from tall buildings. As always, distance tracking is accurate, especially if you start out with a locked-in signal, which you always should. Like I said earlier, though, I did find in a side-by-side test, Garmin’s auto-pause feature seems sluggish compared to Apple’s.</p><p>Aside from some advanced running and cycling features, what makes the 745 one of the more expensive models in Garmin’s line are its smartwatch features. That includes Garmin Pay, the company’s contactless payments system, and music storage for up to 500 tracks on the device. You can also mirror your smartphone notifications and use calendar and weather widgets. Just know you can enjoy that even on Garmin’s entry-level model (more on that below).</p><p>I can see there being two schools of thought here: if someone plans to wear this watch for many hours a week working out, it may as well get as close as possible to a less sporty smartwatch. Then there’s my thinking: You’re probably better off stepping down to a model that’s nearly as capable on the fitness front, but that doesn’t pretend as hard to be a proper smartwatch.</p><p>For those people, there’s another mid-range model in Garmin’s Forerunner line that’s cheaper and serves many of the same people who will be looking at the 745.

And would other runners?</p><p>It turns out, mostly not. As an entry-level watch, the 45S offers everything beginners (and even some intermediate) runners could want, including distance tracking, basic fitness tracking (steps, calories), heart rate monitoring and a blood oxygen test. Also, as much as the 45S is aimed at new runners, you’ll also find modes for indoor and outdoor cycling, elliptical machines, stair climbers and yoga.</p><p>Coming from the 745, I was especially pleased to see that many of Garmin’s best training tools and recovery features carry down even to the base-level model. That includes training status, training load, training effect, Garmin Coach, Body Battery, stress tracking, a race time predictor and running dynamics analysis (again, an additional accessory is required). Like other Garmin watches, you can enable incident detection, with the caveat that you'll need your smartphone nearby for it to work.</p><p>It even functions as a perfunctory smartwatch, with smartphone notifications, music playback controls, calendar and weather widgets, and a duo of “find my phone” and “find my watch” features. Although I’ve criticized Garmin’s smartwatch features in the past for feeling like half-baked add-ons, I was still pleasantly surprised to find them on what’s marketed as a running watch for novices.</p><p>As for the hardware, the watch feels lightweight, at 32 grams for the 39mm model (36g for the 42mm). It’s available in five colors, slightly more than Garmin’s more serious models. The 1.04-inch touchscreen was easy to glance at mid-workout, even in direct sunlight. The battery, which is rated for seven days (or 13 hours in GPS mode) does not need to be charged every day. In fact, if it really is beginners using this, their short trail runs  should barely put a dent in the overall capacity. As with the Forerunner 745, my complaint is never with the impressive battery life, just the fact that you have to use a proprietary charging cable.</p><p>And, while this watch wasn’t made for competitive swimmers, you can use it in the pool without breaking it. The 5 ATM water resistance rating means it can survive the equivalent of 50 meters of water pressure, which surely includes showering and shallow-water activities.</p><p>For what it’s worth, there is a slightly more expensive model, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDkyUkgyOEdOP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taWctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVkYWE1MDBjLTMxNDctM2RjOS04ZjVlLWQ1MDhmYTE0MDg3MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASBx4FMC_pYNLNlf4BAdS3zqBfkyXYSVlYsk31jmJlx2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB092RH28GN%3Fth%3D1">Garmin Forerunner 55</a>, which adds respiration rate, menstrual tracking, an updated recovery time advisor and pacing strategies.</p><h2>The best under $100: Amazfit Bip S</h2><p></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lightweight design; long battery life; accurate GPS tracking; built-in heart rate monitor; water resistant; basic smartwatch features.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Crude user interface; limited support for third-party apps; can’t customize how workout stats are displayed on the screen; pausing workouts feels labored (which is a shame because you’ll be doing it often).</p><p>I kept my expectations low when I began testing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazfit-bip-s-review-133036996.html">Bip S</a>.

Although I didn’t know much about Amazfit or its parent company Huami, I was intrigued by the specs it offered at this price, most notably a built-in heart monitor — not something you typically see in a device this cheap.</p><p>As you might expect, a device this inexpensive has some trade-offs, and I’ll get to those in a minute. But there’s actually a lot to like. The watch itself is lightweight and water resistant, with a low-power color display that’s easy to read in direct sunlight. That low-power design also means the battery lasts a long time — up to 40 hours on a charge. Perhaps most importantly, it excels in the area that matters most: as a sports watch. In my testing the built-in GPS allowed for accurate distance and pace tracking. If you’re not a runner, or you just prefer a multi-sport life, the watch features nine other modes covering most common activities, including walking, yoga, cycling, pool and open-water swimming and free weights.</p><p>And did I mention the heart rate monitor? These readings are also seemingly accurate.</p><p>What you lose by settling for a watch this cheap is mainly the sort of polished user experience you’d get with a device from a tier-one company like Apple or even Garmin (not that Garmin’s app has ever been my favorite either). In my review, I noticed various goofs, including odd grammar and punctuation choices and a confusingly laid-out app.</p><p>I was also bummed to learn you could barely export your data to any third-party apps, other than Strava and Apple Health. You also can’t customize the way data is displayed on-screen during a workout, while your goals don't auto-adjust the way they might on other platforms. Fortunately, at least, these are all issues that can be addressed after the fact via software updates — hopefully sooner rather than later.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html?src=rss

<p>How many times have you posted to Threads this week? After becoming the fastest-growing social network of all time, new data from analytics firm SimilarWeb suggests engagement on Threads has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-users-are-already-spending-less-time-in-the-app-182738755.html">substantially declined from initial highs.</a></p><p>Threads saw daily active users decline from 49 million on July 7th to 23.6 million on July 14th, SimilarWeb writes in a new report. That’s still… millions, of course. And in the United States, which reportedly saw the highest engagement, use plummeted from 21 minutes per day to just over six minutes in the same period. To couch these estimates, SimilarWeb’s analysis is based only on Android app use, but it tallies with other companies’ findings – and anecdotally, I’ve seen my close friends and Threads favorites post a lot less.</p><p>In a Threads post on Friday, Instagram’s top exec, Adam Mosseri, suggested the company wasn’t particularly focused on engagement metrics at this stage.

## Tesla directors agree to return $735 million following claims they were massively overpaid

<p>Elon Musk, Larry Ellison and other current and former members of Tesla's board of directors will return $735 million to settle claims that they massively overpaid themselves, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-directors-settle-lawsuit-over-compensation-735-mln-2023-07-17/"><em>Reuters</em></a> has reported. The deal wraps up a saga that started in 2020 stemming from a lawsuit filed by a police and firefighter retirement fund challenging stock options granted to Tesla's board starting in 2017. Directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023, and change the way compensation is calculated.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla's current board includes Elon Musk, his brother Kimbal, Fox News mogul James Murdoch, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia and former Tesla CTO JB Straubel. The case is separate from a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-hear-final-arguments-trial-over-musks-56-bln-tesla-pay-2023-02-21/">lawsuit</a> filed by shareholders against a $56 billion compensation package awarded to CEO Elon Musk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit accused Tesla's board of giving itself unfair and excessive compensation in the form of 11 million stock options between 2017 and 2020, saying it grossly exceeded norms for a corporate board. The $735 million settlement will be paid back to Tesla in what's called a &quot;derivative lawsuit&quot; — the largest ever awarded by Delaware's Court of Chancerty, according to <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla argued that stock options were used to ensure Director's incentives were aligned with investor goals. Tesla has yet to comment on the affair, but in court documents, said that it agreed to settle to eliminate the risk of future litigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is fighting a separate lawsuit to defend his $56 billion pay package.

## Tesla's 'Charge on Solar' lets Powerwall owners send excess energy to their EV

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-texas-factory-has-produced-its-first-cybertruck-161840934.html">Tesla</a> has launched a feature called &quot;<a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app/charge-on-solar">Charge on Solar</a>&quot; that allows owners to fill up their electric vehicles' batteries using only excess solar energy. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/tesla-lets-owners-recharge-with-solar/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, the automaker started testing the capability in May, but now it's more widely available to Tesla customers in the US and in Canada. The number of people who can access the feature, however, likely remains pretty limited. To start with, it will only be accessible to those who have newer Teslas — 2021 and later — who also have a Powerwall. That's the company's battery system that stores solar energy harnessed by solar panels.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots of Tesla's new Charge on Solar feature." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/db445110-2546-11ee-affe-bd8d5e67861e" style="height: 1051px; width: 1536px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tesla</div></figure><p>To enable Charge on Solar, users will need to fire up their Tesla app, choose the feature and then set it up. They'll then see a slider with a sun icon within the feature's settings that they can drag left or right to set the charge limit. The vehicle will charge itself from solar and the grid like usual before it reaches the sun slider, ensuring users have enough power to get where they need to. But after reaching the sun slider, the vehicle will only charge itself using excess solar energy.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Powerwall will still prioritize storing backup energy or charging other appliances when it's in Storm Watch mode before allocating any excess solar power for vehicle charging. Charge on Solar will truly only charge EVs using excess energy, which is also why owners worried about not having enough juice can set a time limit for it. Of course, they can also adjust their charge limit, or switch off Charge on Solar entirely if they want to be absolutely sure that their batteries will get fully charged.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/teslas-charge-on-solar-lets-powerwall-owners-send-excess-energy-to-their-ev-102018496.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/vanmoof-s4-x4-e-bikes-release-date-pricing-colors-110017301.html">E-bike company VanMoof</a> has declared bankruptcy for all its Dutch entities and aims to find a buyer in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot; The announcement comes alongside the court of Amsterdam's withdrawal of suspension of payment proceedings and appointment of two trustees to oversee a possible third-party sale of the assets to ideally keep VanMoof functioning. The news came through a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vanmoofbicycle/comments/152g897/vanmoof_bankruptcy_statement_in_full/">mass email to Dutch employees</a> that was subsequently shared on Reddit.</p><p>Bankruptcy proceedings have come to VanMoof less than two years after it claimed to be the &quot;most funded e-bike company in the world&quot; while announcing a $128 million investment. Yet, trouble has been brewing for some time, with it allegedly costing more money to sell and service its bikes than people were paying for them. Dutch financial outlet <a href="https://fd.nl/financiele-markten/1465594/vanmoof-is-te-goedkoop">FD reported</a> an €11.9 million ($13.4 million) gross margin loss for VanMoof in 2021, with €8 million ($9 million) spent on repairs and replacements. The company's international entities, in places like the United States and Taiwan, aren't part of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>VanMoof told employees there are &quot;no funds to pay the salaries&quot; long-term and gave them a six-week notice period in which they are expected to work and will receive their final payments. Part of this time will entail returning bikes currently in service back to customers. VanMoof is really leaning in on its employees to keep working hard, stating: &quot;It is necessary to stay strong and to continue with your required work. We hope everybody keeps up their best efforts so we can secure a good future for this beautiful company and brand together.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vanmoof-e-bikes-has-declared-bankruptcy-094041635.html?src=rss

<p>Loupedeck, which started as an Indiegogo project with its original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-17-loupedeck-hands-on-controls-better-lightroom.html">Lightroom editing console</a>, has been acquired by Logitech for an undisclosed &quot;non-material&quot; sum, the companies <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230718341629/en/Logitech-Acquires-Loupedeck">announced</a>. &quot;This acquisition augments Logitech’s product portfolio today and accelerates our software ambitions of enabling keyboards, mice and more to become smarter and contextually aware,&quot; said Logitech G general manager Ujesh Desai in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>After launching an advanced editing console in 2019 (the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-29-loupedeck-creative-tool-control-surface.html"> Loupedeck CT</a>), the company pivoted toward video streaming with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loupedeck-live-versus-the-stream-deck-170020781.html">Loupedeck Live</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loupedeck-live-s-livestream-twitch-indiegogo-crowdfunding-130006900.html">Loupedeck Live S</a>. Those offer an alternative to Elgato's Stream Deck, used by content creators to add titles, picture-in-picture and more to live streams. Loupedeck also collaborated with Razer on its own creator product, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-stream-controller-loupedeck-180707882.html">Stream Controller</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Buying Loupedeck gives Logitech the ability to deliver a &quot;premium experience&quot; for content creators including gamers, livestreamers and others, it said. At the same time, Logitech is promising more &quot;seamless&quot; usage for onboarding, presets and the coupling of Streamlabs apps and Loupedeck devices. For its part, Loupedeck said that joining Logitech will help it &quot;exponentially&quot; broaden its audience.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Logitech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-logitech-streamlabs.html">acquired Streamlabs</a> back in 2019 to get deeper into game streaming — one of a number of brand purchases it has made over the past few years. In 2016 it bought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-16-logitech-acquires-saitek.html">gaming peripheral company Saitek</a>, in 2017 it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-12-logitech-astro-console-headset-gaming-acquisition.html">purchased Astro</a>, which makes headsets popular with gamers and streamers, and in 2018, Logitech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-30-blue-logitech-acquisition.html">aquired Blue Microphones</a>.</p><p>How have those acquisitions worked out? Earlier this year Logitech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-retires-the-blue-microphone-brand-083111975.html">retired</a> the Blue branding, though it still manufactures most of the company's original products like the Yeti and Snowball mics. Loupedeck's products are nice but a bit expensive, so Logitech may be able to bring the price down while increasing manufacturing quality. In any case, &quot;Loupedeck will continue supporting its customers and partners and will operate as usual for the foreseeable future,&quot; the press release states.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitech-acquires-streaming-console-maker-loupedeck-081558711.html?src=rss

## TikTok rolls out passkey login for iOS devices

<p>The list of third-party apps that support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html">passkey</a> login on the iPhone has grown by one, thanks to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/passkeys-fido-alliance">TikTok</a>. Users of the popular video-sharing service will now have the option to sign in with their passkey associated with their Apple ID, which means they can easily get into their account using Face or Touch ID. Passkeys are considered a safer option than password logins, since they're comprised of a cryptographic key pair.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the keys is a public key that's associated with the website or service, while the other is a private key stored only in the user's device. Services and apps like TikTok don't have access to that private key, and users can't copy it down or give it out, making passkeys resistant to data breaches and social engineering by bad actors. iOS devices authenticate users' identity for logins using their biometric data before matching their private key with a service's public one.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be able to use passkeys on TikTok for iPhones and iPads, their device must be running the latest version of iOS. Their iCloud Keychain must also be enabled, because Apple stores passkeys in its password management system. Finally, two-factor authentication must be switched on for their Apple ID.&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok will start rolling out passkey support to certain regions in Asia, Africa, Australia and South America this month. The video sharing service said the feature will be available in other locations and on other operating systems over time, so it will most likely make its way to North America and to Android devices. TikTok users who get access to the login option can activate it by going to their Profile at the bottom of the app and then accessing Settings and privacy in the Menu. From there, they need to access the Account option and then tap iCloud passkey to see the setup screen.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-rolls-out-passkey-login-for-ios-devices-053212136.html?src=rss
