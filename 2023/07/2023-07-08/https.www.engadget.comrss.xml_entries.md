<p>Hayao Miyazaki's final film, the tentatively titled <em>How Do You Live</em>?, is coming to IMAX theaters. The milestone marks a first for Miyazaki and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-studio-ghibli-netflix-hbo-max-streaming.html">animation studio</a> he co-founded nearly four decades ago. According to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-07-07/hayao-miyazaki-how-do-you-live-anime-film-to-be-1st-ghibli-film-with-simultaneous-release-in-imax/.200064"><em>Anime News Network</em></a>, the film will also screen in Dolby Atmos, Dolby Cinema and DTS:X when it arrives in Japan on July 14th.</p><p>As <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-do-you-live-studio-ghibli-imax-release-1850618453"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> notes, past Studio Ghibli films did not receive the IMAX treatment during their original theatrical runs. When you add that to the fact <em>How Do You Live? </em>is supposed to be Miyazaki's swan song<em>&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/t-magazine/hayao-miyazaki-studio-ghibli.html">or so the auteur claims</a>), you have the makings of a must-see movie event. However, one potential hitch is that the film doesn't have an international release date yet, and it's unclear if a North American distributor could secure IMAX screens for <em>How Do You Live?</em> when and if it arrives outside of Japan. In recent weeks, the availability of IMAX screens has been a contentious issue in Hollywood, with Tom Cruise <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/oppenheimer-mission-impossible-battle-imax-screens-1235633537/">reportedly calling</a> some theaters to convince them to screen <em>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One </em>instead of Christopher Nolan's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppenheimer-trailer-shows-chris-nolans-take-on-the-birth-of-the-atomic-bomb-152022327.html"><em>Oppenheimer</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Details on <em>How Do You Live</em>? are sparse. Studio Ghibli has not released a trailer for the film or bought any TV spots. In fact, the only promotion it has done so far for <em>How Do You Live? </em>is the single poster the studio <a href="https://gizmodo.com/miyazaki-ghibli-how-do-you-live-poster-trailer-anime-1850499515">released last month</a>. The film is an original work but is named after the 1937 novel of the same name by Genzaburo Yoshino. In interviews, Miyazaki has said the book plays an influential role in the life of his film's protagonist.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hayao-miyazakis-final-film-will-be-studio-ghiblis-first-imax-release-195624834.html?src=rss

<p>Late last month, Apple uploaded the debut episode of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silo-review-wool-tv-show-123024485.html"><em>Silo</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>to Twitter to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-has-posted-the-entire-first-episode-of-silo-on-twitter-182403011.html">promote the show's season one finale</a>. Now it's doing the same with its other tentpole sci-fi series. Starting Monday, you can watch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-foundation-trailer-184005079.html"><em>Foundation's </em></a>first episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=122IHwZn1yU">YouTube</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-trailer-for-the-second-season-of-apple-tv-series-foundation-140019714.html">season two's</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/foundation-will-return-to-apple-tv-on-july-14th-140038865.html">July 14th</a> premiere.</p><p>Apple's live-action adaptation of Issac Asimov's classic novel series of the same name <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-foundation-isaac-asimov-release-date-152711615.html">premiered in 2021</a> following a <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/03/foundation-tv-series-suspends-production-ireland-coronavirus-pandemic-1202882010/">pandemic-related production delay</a>. As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/08/apple-streaming-first-episode-of-foundation-free-on-youtube-ahead-of-second-season-premiere/"><em>9to5Mac</em> notes</a>, you can already watch the first episode of the series for free on Apple TV, but that requires access to the app and not everyone might want to install Apple's streaming service on their smart TV. Season two of <em>Foundation </em>sees some of season one's original cast, including Lee Pace and Jared Harris, return. Filming of season three is rumored to be already underway. In the meantime, you can watch the show's first episode on Monday at 2PM ET, followed by a live Q&amp;A with showrunner David Goyer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a6f2edcba2394ada99ba87259478ff20"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-stream-the-first-episode-of-foundation-on-youtube-175203218.html?src=rss

## Twitch is finally adding Stories and a feed for discovering new streamers to watch

<p>It’s probably safe to say no one could have predicted that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/linkedin-launches-redesign-with-disappearing-stories-140052516.html">LinkedIn</a> would add Stories before Twitch, but here we are. Nearly eight years after Instagram <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-02-instagrams-stories-feature-looks-a-lot-like-snapchats.html">lifted the feature from Snapchat</a>, Twitch <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/07/08/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-paris/?_branch_match_id=1206245588316052524&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXLynPLEnO0EssKNDLyczL1s9OrczLL0mNT8rJTwcAmIWwOCQAAAA%3D">announced Saturday</a> that its own users will be able to begin recording Stories starting later this year. At its TwitchCon Paris event, Twitch said it plans to roll out the ephemeral media format in October. Once they arrive, Stories will live on the Following page of the Twitch mobile app, where they’ll be subject to Twitch’s Community Guidelines and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-reporting-and-appeals-tools-181800017.html">automated safety systems</a>. Additionally, creators will have the option to limit the visibility of their Stories to only those who follow them.</p><p>Stories is one of a handful of features Twitch announced on Saturday. In the fall, the company said it plans to introduce a new Discovery Feed it promises will make it easier for creators to grow their audiences, even when they’re not streaming. Like Stories, the Discovery Feed will live on the company’s mobile app and include live and recorded content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Because Twitch is all about live, interactive channels, it’s not our goal for viewers to spend hours in a Clips feed,” Twitch said. “Our investment in Clips is to help viewers discover your channel so they join you and your community when you stream.” Twitch plans to conduct limited testing of the Discovery Feed before rolling out the feature to the broader Twitch user base in late 2023. Other features the company said it was working on include improvements to the platform’s built-in clip editor. Come late next month, the tool will allow creators to export vertical videos directly to TikTok.</p><p>On Saturday, Twitch said it would also give creators more control over when ad breaks play during their streams. A new chat countdown timer will display exactly when an ad is about to play. Streamers can delay an advertisement if it’s about to disrupt an exciting bit of gameplay or a conversation with their community. The feature comes after Twitch last month backpedaled on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23751472/twitch-branded-content-new-ad-guidelines-rules-asmongold-mizkif-tos">proposed ad policy</a> that would have restricted the kinds of branded content creators had the ability to include in their streams.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitch-is-finally-adding-stories-and-a-feed-for-discovering-new-streamers-to-watch-163846190.html?src=rss

## James Webb telescope captures the most distant active supermassive black hole yet

<p>The James Webb space telescope has given scientists the capability to discover celestial objects they wouldn't have been able to otherwise, such as ancient galaxies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-ancient-galaxies-theoretically-should-not-exist-102034475.html">theoretically shouldn't exist</a>. Now, as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, researchers have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/webb-detects-most-distant-active-supermassive-black-hole-to-date">discovered</a> the most distant active supermassive black hole we've seen to date.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to the near- and mid-infrared images James Webb has taken, researchers were able to find a supermassive black hole in the galaxy they've dubbed CEERS 1019. They were also able to determine that the black hole has existed merely 570 million years after the Big Bang and that it's around 9 million solar masses. In addition, the data provided by the telescope allowed them to come to the conclusion that the black hole is eating up a lot of gas and churning out new stars. &quot;A galaxy merger could be partly responsible for fueling the activity in this galaxy's black hole, and that could also lead to increased star formation,&quot; CEERS team member Jeyhan Kartaltepe of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York explained. In the image below, you can see CEERS 1019 appearing as three bright clumps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A graph showing some of the oldest galaxies found by the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec6c7440-1d94-11ee-bfdd-53008e2e888c" style="height: 1023px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA, ESA, CSA, Leah Hustak (STScI)</div></figure><p>At 9 million solar masses, this black hole is much smaller than other active supermassive black holes previously discovered. Those celestial objects typically contain more than 1 billion times the mass of the sun, which makes them much brighter and easier to detect. The CEERS 1019 black hole is more similar to the one in the center of our galaxy, which is around 4.6 million times the mass of the sun. NASA said scientists have long known that smaller black holes must have existed earlier in the universe, but it wasn't until James Webb became operational that they were able to confirm their presence.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the CEERS Survey team also found two other ancient but small black holes through their data. The CEERS 746 black hole existed 1 billion years after the Big Bang, while the CEERS 2782 black hole has been around since 1.1 billion years after the event. When viewed through other instruments, these black holes appear as ordinary star-forming galaxies. Astronomers are also reviewing other more distant black holes found using James Webb's data at the moment, so CEERS 1019 might lose the record sooner rather than later.</p><p>CEERS team lead Steven Finkelstein from the University of Texas at Austin <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-114">said</a>: &quot;Until now, research about objects in the early universe was largely theoretical. With Webb, not only can we see black holes and galaxies at extreme distances, we can now start to accurately measure them. That’s the tremendous power of this telescope.&quot;</p><p>Scientists still find it difficult to explain how this black hole formed so soon after the universe began. But in the future, Webb's data could give them the information they need to be able to figure out how early black holes are formed.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-captures-the-most-distant-active-supermassive-black-hole-yet-150244921.html?src=rss
