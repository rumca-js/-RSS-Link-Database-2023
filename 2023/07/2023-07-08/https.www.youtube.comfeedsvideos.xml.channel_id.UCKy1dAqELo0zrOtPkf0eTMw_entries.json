The Greta Gerwig Barbie film has been banned in Vietnam due to a depiction of a world map in the background of one scene. How will this affect Barbinheimer? A little historical background, the Nine-Dash Line is a contour shape China uses on maps laying arguable claim to most of the South China Sea. While that Barbie map might look harmless at a glance, the placement of a dashed line bears enough resemblance to it that it\u2019s earned a ban in Vietnam. We have an update on Baki Hanma season 2 on Netflix, Elon Musk isn\u2019t too happy with Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Threads, and a whole lot more on today\u2019s fix with Akeem Lawanson.\n\n#IGN #Entertainment", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLKThwUgbo", "date_published": "2023-07-08T00:43:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
