## Andy Murray unlikely to walk away while his fire still burns so brightly | Kevin Mitchell

<p>Former Wimbledon champion’s performance in defeat by Stefanos Tsitsipas shows that his strength and desire remain</p><p>Is he done? The headlines say, maybe; history and sentiment say, don’t bet on it. From this keyboard, however, It is inconceivable that Andy Murray will walk away from tennis while there is strength in his 36-year-old legs, power in his whirring racket and the odd tear in his reddened eyes.</p><p>If there is a single compelling argument for the best player these islands have produced since Fred Perry to continue into the gloaming of his illustrious career it surely lies in Murray’s almost perverse compulsion to defy all odds, predictions and whispers in tournament watering holes. He has been doing it at least since 2019, when his body started to fall apart. And, just as important, he is probably dreading the day when it is all over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/08/tennis-andy-murray-unlikely-to-retire-while-his-fire-still-burns-brightly">Continue reading...</a>

On the eve of his visit to meet Rishi Sunak and the King, his critics here are wrong to claim the US leader is ‘anti-British’<p>It’s fair to say elements of the UK’s political establishment and rightwing media don’t much like Joe Biden. The US president was accused of being “anti-British” when visiting Northern Ireland in April. Conservative commentators sneered uneasily at subsequent scenes of him playing to the crowd in Ballina, his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/joe-biden-returns-county-mayo-roots-last-leg-ireland-tour" title="">family’s ancestral home in County Mayo</a>, as he recalled how his forebears fled famine-stricken (British-ruled) Ireland for a better life in America.</p><p>What really annoyed rightwing critics was that Biden visited Dublin on that trip, winning standing ovations in the Dáil Éireann, but didn’t find time to come to Westminster. “I’m at home,” he declared in Ireland’s capital. “I just wish I could stay longer.” It’s unlikely Biden will feel the same way on Monday when he makes a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/02/joe-biden-meet-king-charles-rishi-sunak-uk-visit" title="">brief stopover in London to meet Rishi Sunak and King Charles</a>, en route to Nato’s Ukraine crisis summit in Lithuania.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/08/joe-biden-warm-welcome-britain">Continue reading...</a>

## Hernan Diaz: ‘If ever I find myself on the page, I view it as an immense failure’

<p>The Pulitzer prize-winning author on<em> </em>the punk rock provocation of his writing, an epiphany at the gym, and working with Kate Winslet on the HBO adaptation of his novel Trust</p><p>Hernan Diaz, 50, was born in Buenos Aires and lives in Brooklyn. A finalist in 2018 for the Pulitzer prize in fiction with his debut <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/06/in-the-distance-hernan-diaz-review-western">In the Distance</a></em>, which the <em>New Yorker</em> called “an offbeat western”, he is the joint winner of this year’s award – together with Barbara Kingsolver – for his second novel, <em>Trust</em>, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/trust-9781529074529">out now in paperback</a>. A slippery story of a Depression-era tycoon and his late wife as told four different ways, it made the longlist for last year’s Booker prize, whose judges called it “sly, sophisticated, insistently questioning [and] determined to rob us of every certainty”.<br /><br /><strong>What led you to tell (and retell) the fictional life of a Wall Street financier?</strong><br />Almost no novels in the American canon talk about money-making. Many American novels revolve around money, but the money’s already been made and the books are only about the adjacent symptoms bubbling up around money: the corseted manners of the wealthy and so on. Money has this almost transcendental place in American culture, yet it’s also taboo – we don’t talk about it and we don’t even understand it. That seemed bonkers and fascinating. On one hand, money resists narrative because it is coated in this rhetorical varnish of pseudo-science in order to be purposefully impenetrable. We’ve all had these experiences negotiating a loan or a credit card; like, it isn’t <em>meant</em> to be understood. But on the flipside, money is very reliant on storytelling: look at how desperately those who amass any kind of fortune try to account for how it was accumulated so they can present it in a legitimate way to the public.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you avoid dialogue almost entirely in the novel’s first half?</strong><br />The first section is written in this hyper-careful turn-of-the-century prose, but there’s a punk-rock provocation at its core. My editor said: “Do you realise there are no physical descriptions in the first part?” And I was like, yes, it’s very intentional: nobody has a body, nobody has a face, and in the first 160 pages there’s only one line of dialogue – one word, one letter, “I”. It was a formal dare, almost like an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jul/12/oulipo-freeing-literature-tightening-rules">Oulipian</a> constraint. As the book moves forward, we end up inside a body and a mind, and I thought that journey would be more powerful after a highly abstracted opening. The novel is about who has a voice: who, throughout history, has been given a megaphone. Who has been gagged? Rather than thematise that in an expository way, I thought it would be more vivid – and fun – for readers to be presented with this polyphonic arrangement of four voices in succession and gently ask them to question why we trust one over the other.</p><p><strong>That word “trust” resonates throughout the novel, not least </strong><strong>in defining the relationship between you and the reader as you jump from one version of the story to the next. When did you know it should be the title?</strong><br />It came to me on an elliptical trainer at the gym! I was two-thirds into the writing and I was desperate because I didn’t yet have a title, but I knew I wanted it to be as layered as the book. It was like an epiphany; I typed it into my phone, very excited.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/08/hernan-diaz-pulitzer-prize-trust-writing-and-erasing-myself-are-one-and-the-same">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artist and musician <a href="http://johnleebird.com/">John Lee Bird </a>started making dolls when chronic spinal problems prevented him from painting. He felt “like an alien far removed from my own existence due to the pain I was in”. When he found some sheets of felt in his desk drawer, Bird decided to make a Low-era David Bowie doll, appropriate to his mood. “When I started stitching, the little movements were soothing, and having to focus helped me ignore my suffering.” Three years and more than 1,000 dolls later, Bird is exhibiting these portraits of his friends and idols, all hand-stitched and 33cm (13in) tall. “Adversity shouldn’t stop you from creating,” says Bird. “I only get a real sense of accomplishment if I can look at something I’ve physically made. Then I can haul myself upstairs to bed and feel I’ve achieved a tiny something with my day.”</p><ul><li>Dolls (and other works) is at <a href="https://uglyduck.org.uk/event/dolls/">Ugly Duck, London SE1, 19-23 July. </a>See more dolls on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnleebird/?hl=en-gb">@johnleebird</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jul/08/doll-for-love-an-artists-stitched-tribute-to-his-heroes-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The celebrated film-maker, one half of the duo behind Fargo and No Country for Old Men, saw something of himself in the work of the American photographer. Now he’s curated a new book and exhibition</p><p>The actor Frances McDormand, who was present when her husband, the film-maker Joel Coen, first met the photographer Lee Friedlander, was struck by their immediate rapport. It was rooted, she writes in her afterword to a new book, <em>Lee Friedlander Framed by Joel Coen</em>, in “a familiarity that comes from their lifetimes of singular and eccentric visions”.</p><p>At 88, Friedlander is 20 years older than Coen, and has been looking at the world in his off-kilter way since he first picked up a camera, aged 14. His subject matter is extravagantly wide-ranging, from busy streets and deserted parking lots to the gloomy interiors of motel rooms and shadowy self-portraits, but his style is unmistakeable. “I’m still shooting the same subjects when I go out west,” he said recently. “The more jumble, the better I like them – if they work.”</p><p>Nyack, New York, 1967.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/08/singular-eccentric-visions-lee-friedlander-photography-framed-joel-coen">Continue reading...</a>

But when, at the end of the 90s, Moore’s career ground to a halt, he found it hard to get another job. He retrained to become a gardener.

Consumed by their fear of impending doom, the Conservatives increasingly behave like a party resigned to losing power<p>It is a tough gig, but someone has to do it. In pursuit of intelligence on the state of Tory morale, I attended the <em>Spectator</em> magazine’s July party, the highlight of the Conservative summer calendar. You won’t find a greater density of senior Tories per square metre anywhere else. So I trawled for opinions about their chances of hanging on to power at the general election. One former cabinet minister inhaled a glug of champagne before replying: “Obviously, we will be out. The question is whether it will be for five years or 10.”</p><p>The obvious source of their despondency is that they are trailing Labour in the opinion polls by about <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sky-news-poll-tracker-how-are-political-parties-performing-as-an-election-looms-12903488" title="">20 points</a>. That unpopularity will be confirmed when the Tories take a pummelling in the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/byelection-uxbridge-selby-labour-conservative-sunak-starmer-b1092842.html" title="">trio of byelections</a> which will take place on Thursday week.

<p>Yolanda Díaz set up her Sumar coalition to fend off the far right in this month’s election, but polls show she has a staggering amount of work to do</p><p>Almost exactly a year ago, Yolanda Díaz gave a newspaper interview that appeared under the pleasingly provocative headline: <em>“No basta con gestionar, a este Gobierno le falta alma” –</em> “Running things isn’t enough; this government lacks spirit.”</p><p>While <em>alma</em> could also be translated as soul, heart or enthusiasm, the thrust of her comments to <em>El País</em> was perfectly clear. Despite being a key figure in Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist-led minority administration – she serves as labour minister and second deputy prime minister – Díaz believes governing is about more than just delivery. For her, politicians are there to improve people’s lives, to defend and increase hard-won rights, and to leave their country in a better state than they found it. Still, as she told the paper, the odd “happy policy” never does any harm either.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/08/can-new-spain-leftwing-party-sumar-win-power">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I hate the colour pink’: Issa Rae on being a reluctant Barbie and the legacy of Insecure

<p>As a child, the actor and showrunner would play with Black dolls and imagine herself as an entrepreneur. The perfect grounding, both for her role in the new Barbie film, and her burgeoning status as a ‘bossy’ businesswoman</p><p>When the good dolls of Barbie Land were looking for a leader there was only one real candidate. “Basically, Greta said, very sweetly: ‘I would love for you to be my president,’” recalls Issa Rae, AKA Madam President Barbie, of the Barbie movie’s casting process. “I was like: ‘Awww, that’s so sweet! And also just wrong. Obviously I would not be a good president.” Still, she felt honoured to be the desired pick of Greta Gerwig, an Academy Award-nominated director. There was a catch, though: “I <em>hate</em> the colour pink. I’ve never thought that I looked good in pink … So this press tour has been ….” A pained expression passes over Rae’s face before she recovers her perky demeanour. “But I’ve been taking one for the team!”</p><p>Problematic pink aside, Rae has taken well to the clothes horse – or rather Barbie doll – aspect of being a female celebrity. The expectation that her appearance should meet certain fashion and beauty standards has been part of her life ever since Insecure hit it big back in 2016. Rae wrote, exec-produced and starred in the HBO series, as a directionless millennial woman – also called Issa – who stumbles through her early 30s in the same predominantly Black south LA neighbourhoods that Rae calls home. Insecure’s Issa may not have known what she was doing, but she always looked good doing it. And after five straight years of slaying all day, every day, Rae felt she must be due a break. “After Insecure was done, I willingly let myself go. I was like, I’m eating everything! I’m not working out! I’m not gonna be in front of a camera for a long time. And then instantly, when I found out I got Barbie, I was like: ‘Oh no! I gotta look like one!’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/08/issa-rae-barbie-insecure-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Sweden’s Biosphere Trail: ‘Everything is clean and fresh and uncomplicated’

<p>A gentle land of forest and water is revealed on an 85-mile walking route in south-west Sweden</p><p>The English language has spawned some cracking opening lines, from Jane Austen’s “a truth universally acknowledged” to Orwell’s “clocks striking thirteen”. And now another has been added to the canon: the opening gambit of an info board on Sweden’s Biosphere Trail. “Every village,” it declares, “was required by law to dig its own wolf trap.”<br /><br />It was only our second day on the trail, but we’d already been so enchanted by the scenery – the placid lake, the bright welcoming woods, the picturesque rural cottages – that it came as no real surprise to find we’d stumbled into a fairytale.<br /><br />Opened last summer, the 85-mile Biosphere Trail skirts the southern shores of Lake Vänern, Sweden’s largest and Europe’s third largest lake. The route is named after the Lake Vänern Archipelago Biosphere Reserve, designated by Unesco in 2010. I confess I’d not really come across biosphere reserves before but there are 738 of them worldwide, all promoting “solutions reconciling the conservation of biodiversity with its sustainable use”. There was certainly a good deal of conservation going on, for we seemed to be continually entering one nature reserve or other. And we’d arrived by train from the UK (a pleasant trundle through France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark), which we hoped would bolster the “sustainable use” bit.<br /><br />We started our walk at Mariestad, the town that marks the trail’s eastern extremity. It possesses one of Sweden’s best-preserved historic districts, so we had a wander through streets of what looked like giant doll’s houses, all decked out in bright pastel shades. After a shufti round a cathedral with fossils embedded in its stone floor, we set off along the shore, armed with maps that the frequent waymarkers made all but redundant. Very soon we saw our first wildlife: a statuesque heron, a rather busier woodpecker, followed by kestrels, butterflies, deer and lapwings.</p><p>Lake Vänern is so large (about quarter the size of Wales) that where the trail runs along the shore it seems more like a coastal path – an impression reinforced by the appealing sandy coves we come across. We discovered that south-west Sweden can get quite warm in August, so by the time we reached our first night’s lodgings, we were somewhat parched. <a href="https://www.appelgarden.eu/" title="">Äppelgården B&amp;B</a> is a perfectly preserved 19th-century farmhouse, full of pleasingly esoteric period antiques. It’s also far from the nearest off-licence so I asked co-owner Diedrich if we could buy some beer from him to accompany the meal we were about to cook in the kitchen. A few minutes later he was plying us with four bottles of a local brew for which he refused any payment. He replied to our protests with a wink and a laugh. “Don’t worry,” he said, “I’ve just stolen them from my son.”<br /><br />So began five days of gentle rambling through woodland and farmland, meadows and hamlets. While the route is mostly rural, there was always a shop or cafe en route where we could buy lunch. And this being Sweden, everything was extremely clean and fresh and uncomplicated. The only major town we encountered was Lidköping, a town that found fame and fortune as a producer of porcelain, and where we ate dinner at <a href="https://mellbygatans.se/sv/default" title="">Mellbygatans restaurant</a>. The owner, Emil, told us that running the restaurant was “all about having fun”. It seems a successful strategy since in Mellbygatans’ first year it entered the prestigious White Guide with ratings on a par with some Michelin-starred restaurants.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/08/swedens-biosphere-trail-everything-is-clean-and-fresh-and-uncomplicated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joe Gibson was 17, at school and hoping to get the grades that would earn him a scholarship at Oxford. But then a casual flirtation with his 35-year-old Spanish teacher turned into something far more serious</p><p>‘Just going out to see Nick, friend from school, might stay over, bye!” Ned and Celia, the family friends I’m staying with, barely look up from their enormous dining table. And I’m out the door. I take the most direct route. Sod being seen. I ring her bell and I’m buzzed in. My Spanish teacher, Miss P – Ali – is standing in the doorway, looking flustered. She grabs my hand and pulls me in, kicking the door shut behind me, and before I can say a word or take off my jacket, she’s kissing me. We stand in the hallway for ages, just snogging. Once or twice she holds my head and looks at me intently, then kisses me again. I forget trying to find words to say and let myself soar.</p><p>Then, without hesitation or any look or pause, she takes me to her bedroom and undresses me. I undress her. And there we are, naked. Very naked. I want to make excuses for looking ridiculous with swimming trunk tan lines, and not being built like the first XV boys. Perhaps sensing my self-consciousness, she speaks, and her voice is warm and sexy. “Your hair is lighter.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/08/joe-gibson-affair-with-teacher-seventeen-book-extract-nfbntw">Continue reading...</a>

If visual artists can be replaced by machines, who is safe?</p><p>There’s no talk of a “just transition” for graphic designers, or the other professions about to be destroyed. And while there’s plenty of talk about how education might change, little has been done to equip students for a world whose conditions shift so fast.

<p>A musical tradition has more weight than ever as Estonia looks hard at its neighbour Russia following its invasion of Ukraine</p><p>Aarne Saluveer recalls the time his cult Estonian rock band, Karavan, was invited to perform in Moscow in the 1980s, on condition they sang in Russian. “We were on a roll, performing 250 concerts a year. We refused the Soviet authorities’ request. Estonian and English only, we said, knowing that if we relented we’d lose our sense of self because if the music doesn’t come from your heart, you die.”</p><p>Four decades on he is no less steadfast, but has swapped his keyboard and vocals to conduct more than 23,000 young choristers at Estonia’s <em>Laulupida</em> youth song and dance festival in the capital Tallinn.

## ‘I became obsessed’: Maddie Mortimer on the diaries her mother left behind

<p>The novelist was in her early teens when her mother, the writer and film-maker Katie Pearson, died of cancer. She reflects on the insights, inspiration and comfort she’s found in journals written over 27 years</p><p>When my mother died in 2010 at the age of 52, she left behind two teenage daughters, a devoted husband, innumerable friends and an archive of beautifully written diaries chronicling nearly every year of her life from the age of 25 until her final days. My sister and I were aware of this growing collection throughout our childhood; her past selves were stacked neatly at the bottom of the living room bookcase, preserved in their various jackets of worn leather or patterned fabrics. “These diaries have been the only constant ritual of my life,” one entry reads. “After writing, I feel immediately better.” Convinced of the psychological benefits, she encouraged my sister and me to take up the habit. When I was seven, she bought me a miniature copy of the book she was filling at the time. It was a magnificent object composed of thick cream parchment, soft Italian suede and an impractically long tie that was always dangling out of my school bag, trailing in puddles or dripping in orange juice. We wrote in our matching books together in the evening, before bed. It was the only diary I ever managed to fill cover to cover.</p><p>Some writers are natural diarists. I am not one of them. As a child, I was far more interested in writing stories, disappearing into the lives and minds of others. I see now that this stems, in part, from an early distrust of my own voice, which struck me as so irregular, so various and so utterly contradictory that I believed it genuinely dangerous; the first person was a tool to be wielded only with the utmost caution. It is still only under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/01/maddie-mortimer-wins-the-desmond-elliott-prize-for-maps-of-our-spectacular-bodies" title="">the guise of fiction</a> that I feel I can travel confidently towards any kind of authentic truth. But for my mother – a documentary maker for much of her life – it was effortless.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/08/i-became-obsessed-maddie-mortimer-on-the-diaries-her-mother-left-behind">Continue reading...</a>

## Perfumes with tea scents are aromatic and uplifting – just like a brew | Sali Hughes on beauty

<p>These tea-infused fragrances are the perfect antidote to hot, humid days – and are mostly gender neutral, too</p><p>For someone so hopelessly addicted to both perfume and tea, I’ve been surprisingly late to sate both cravings in one hit. That is until last month, when I was given an early sample of Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s <strong><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/maison-francis-kurkdjian-aqua-media-cologne-forte-eau-de-parfum/p110527063?size=35ml&amp;amp;s_ppc=2dx92700071582059981_mixed_fashion_BAU&amp;amp;tmad=c&amp;amp;tmcampid=2&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwhJukBhBPEiwAniIcNYyZHrlhqcJqvG8PNTVAbc7OgVg5xGZzteb2duHuqA2QjFOS9K4XuxoCqkYQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="">Aqua Media Cologne Forte</a></strong> (£110 for 35ml), a perfume equivalent of a cold compress on a sweat-beaded forehead. Iced matcha tea, fizzy citrus, fresh coriander and pale woods lead my already frazzled, overheated brain to a nice quiet spot in the shade. I adore it.</p><p>Aqua Media inspired me to look for other tea fragrances that hit the same mark within a more inclusive price bracket. We should start with Elizabeth Arden, partly because the brand made tea-themed fragrances mainstream, but also because their Green Tea eau de parfum is the creation of the aforementioned master perfumer, Francis Kurkdjian, yet sold for a comparative song.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/08/perfumes-with-tea-scents-are-aromatic-and-uplifting-just-like-a-brew">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If Peaky Blinders made the Irish actor a household name, will Christopher Nolan’s nuclear blockbuster send him into the stratosphere? He talks about extreme weight loss, hating school and why his next character won’t be a smoker </p><p>Cillian Murphy is struggling with what he can and can’t say about his title role in Oppenheimer, the latest Christopher Nolan epic, such is the secrecy surrounding this film. Murphy is under “strict instructions” not to talk about the content. Which is awkward when you’ve flown to his home in Ireland to interview him specifically about playing the physicist who oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb, later detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It’s not clear who issued these instructions. Nolan? The studio? The US government? All I know is that as well as Murphy being gagged by hefty NDAs, I am not allowed to see it (“bit unfortunate”, he concedes).</p><p>So, yes, here we sit in an empty upstairs room of a restaurant near his house in Monkstown, Dublin, working out how to do this. The room is dark, the sun shining through a solitary Velux lighting his features like a Géricault. The only background noise is the low hum of a wine refrigerator. Murphy loathes interviews, looks visibly tortured at points. But he relaxes when I ask if he’s pleased with Oppenheimer. “I am, yeah,” he says. “I don’t like watching myself – it’s like, ‘Oh, fucking hell’ – but it’s an extraordinary piece of work. Very provocative and powerful. It feels sometimes like a biopic, sometimes like a thriller, sometimes like a horror. It’s going to knock people out,” he adds. “What [Nolan] does with film, it fucks you up a little bit.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/08/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-christopher-nolan-florence-pugh">Continue reading...</a>
