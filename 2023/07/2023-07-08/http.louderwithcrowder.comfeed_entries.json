But when you are such a failure that no one takes you seriously, even as you claim to be pointing a gun at them? I don't know how this guy shows his face at the next meeting of the National Brotherhood of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/these-thugs-tried-to-rob-the-wrong-elderly-gun-owner\" target=\"_blank\">Thugs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stolen-car-detroit\" target=\"_blank\">Thieves</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/armed-robbery-marine\" target=\"_blank\">Nogoodniks</a> Local 404.</p><p>The only thing missing from this video is someone saying \"muthaf*cka please\" as they turn their back on him.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"dbc47\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34303293&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>The easiest explanation for this is a possible language barrier. It looks like an Asian salon. They may not have understood what the guy was saying. But even if you don't speak criminal, someone screaming and pointing something at you is the universal sign of \"give me all your money or I'll shoot you with my gun.\"</p><p>My man here didn't even get off the phone.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2e0d6\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34303300&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>This woman was the least impressed. She's seen some sh*t in her day.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"855b8\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34303301&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Watching the video, it's unable to tell if he had an actual gun or was pointing with his hand covered to convince people he had one. Things didn't get that far. </p><p>After multiple attempts to get anyone to pay attention to him or give him any money, our friend turns around and leaves. How embarrassing.</p><p>Though not as embarrassing as when the police catch up to him. <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime/watch-robber-walked-into-a-buckhead-nail-spa-no-one-cared/UCNYYTJ67VDWNMY3X2JEMNJSRY/\" target=\"_blank\">According to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution</a>, police are hoping residents can help identify the man so they can have a few words with him. Whether those words are \"you have the right to remain silent\" or \"ROTFLMAO\" depends on the mood.</p><p><p><em>Facebook doesn't want you reading this post or any others lately.

I know that you know that I know who the main suspect should be. But Karine Jean-Pierre's main job is to ignore any questions about Hunter Biden. It is the sole aspect of her job that she doesn't suck at. We can't expect her to change now. However, if the goal is to convince America the nose candy did NOT belong to Joey's second favorite son, KJp should at least make an effort to fact-check her own lies.</p><p>When we left you, after ever-changing news reports of what the white powdery substance was and where it was found, it has been confirmed that someone left their cocaine in an uber-exclusive area of the Situation Room. How exclusive? <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/white-house-cocaine-situation-room\" target=\"_blank\">They were oddly specific in pointing out it was where the vice president parks her car</a>.

Not when the internet is lousy with videos of Hunter using illegal drugs... that Hunter uploaded to the interwebs himself. Do we need to do the flashback sequence?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0ab3d\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34303254&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-third-laptop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\" title=\"view post: 'My Dad's Running for President': Hunter Biden Loses Another Laptop with Video of Him Chatting Up a Hooker\">'My Dad's Running for President': Hunter Biden Loses Another Laptop with Video of Him Chatting Up a Hooker</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-crack-video\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\" title=\"view post: Genius video shows Joe Biden demanding harsher penalties for crack while Hunter Biden smokes along\">Genius video shows Joe Biden demanding harsher penalties for crack while Hunter Biden smokes along</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-sensory-tank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\" title=\"view post: Video Emerges of Hunter Biden Smoking Drugs, Crushing Claws, and...

Yes, even Hunter Biden.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevennelson10/status/1677410532846891008\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's see. In forty-eight hours the White House has been oddly specific about mentioning the blow was found in the same area where the vice president parks her car, the White House press secretary lashed out at a report for asking if they would rule out who the most likely suspect was, and if KJP didn't lie she at the very least spread invalid truths about where the Biden family was.</p><p>At this point, I'm starting to wonder if it's her coke.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Now, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bud-light-no-longer-one-americas-10-most-popular-beer-brands-1811601\" target=\"_blank\">per a new YouGov survey</a>, the water that identifies as beer has fallen out of the Top 10 of hops and barley-based libations in America.</p><h3>A Bud Light Timeline</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"eaf15\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34303183&amp;width=980\" /><p>Here are the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website's Keys to DERPtory:</p><p>1. At the end of March, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light\" target=\"_blank\">controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a> announced he and/or she was a new brand ambassador for Bud Light as part of their March Madness campaign. An odd choice since in Dylan's portrayal of a woman he presented as someone too ditzy and basic to know what March Madness was, as opposed to any of the thousands of women who love college basketball.</p><p>2. On April 4th, Kid Rock <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kid-rock-bud-light\" target=\"_blank\">shot up a few cases of Bud Light</a> and it was the first sign there might be a problem.</p><p>3. On April 10th, a  podcast appearance of now-former Bud Light VP Alissa Heinersceid came to light. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">The now disgraced marketing elitist lashed out at Bud Light customers as \"fratty\" and \"out of touch</a>. It was important to her to have another approach that included <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_blank\">a San Francisco-based \"influencer\" marketing firm</a> setting her up with Mulvaney. There is a trend of progressives where the only way to be \"inclusive\" and \"for everyone\" to sh*t on the people who currently enjoy a product. It's called the <a href=\"https://boundingintocomics.com/search/kathleen%2bkennedy\" target=\"_blank\">Kathleen Kennedy</a> method.</p><p>4. On June 7th, Modello <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-dethroned-beer-america\" target=\"_blank\">topped Bud Light in sales</a>.</p><p>5. On July 2nd, three months and OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS LATER, there were calls for Anheuser-Busch CEO <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-resigns\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan Whitworth</a> to either resign or be removed by the board.</p><h3>Bud Light sinks to #14.</h3><br /><p>In the 2023 YouGov poll, Bud Light fell out of the top ten to become the fourteenth most popular beer in America, down from the ninth most popular beer in 2022. This means even before the Mulvaney Mutiny, and even though Bud Light was #1 in sales, people still didn't want to admit they drank it.</p><p>The most popular beer in America is Guinness. Shout out to my people.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0da81\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34303217&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Bud Light has tried everything except apologizing to their now former customers in an attempt to win them back. I know executives are too busy sticking their noses up at middle-class, blue-collar, rube America. But hey, at this point they have nothing left to lose. Apologizing might be crazy enough to work.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
