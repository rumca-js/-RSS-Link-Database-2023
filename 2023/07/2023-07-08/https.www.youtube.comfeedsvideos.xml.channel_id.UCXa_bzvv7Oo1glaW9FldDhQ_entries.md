Player versus environment games essentially task players with taking on computer-controlled enemies in oftentimes co-operative gameplay, although PvE games also make room for solo experiences too. There’s a wide range of games on offer in this sub-genre, with MMORPGs, real-time strategy, and first-person shooter titles the most commonplace, with survival mechanics and team-based shooting the most popular of gameplay modes.
