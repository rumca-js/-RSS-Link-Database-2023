Final Fantasy 16 notably went all in on the action gameplay, but aside from combat, there's very little in Square Enix's newest Final Fantasy game that could be considered an RPG even compared to recent action games like God of War and Ghost of Tsushima. But is that a failure for Square Enix, or a necessary change?

The Barbie movie isn’t even out yet, but it’s already finding a little bit of controversy overseas. The Greta Gerwig Barbie film has been banned in Vietnam due to a depiction of a world map in the background of one scene. How will this affect Barbinheimer? A little historical background, the Nine-Dash Line is a contour shape China uses on maps laying arguable claim to most of the South China Sea. While that Barbie map might look harmless at a glance, the placement of a dashed line bears enough resemblance to it that it’s earned a ban in Vietnam. We have an update on Baki Hanma season 2 on Netflix, Elon Musk isn’t too happy with Mark Zuckerberg’s Threads, and a whole lot more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.
