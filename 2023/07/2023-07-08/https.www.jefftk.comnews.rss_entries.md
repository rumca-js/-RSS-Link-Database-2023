A few days ago I </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/mxr-talkbox-cap">asked for advice</a> on
how to make a cap for my 

<a href="https://www.jimdunlop.com/mxr-talk-box/">MXR M222</a> talkbox.
I got a lot of good suggestions, including looking for a matching
rubber stopper, 3D printing with 95A TPU for flexibility, or turning
something on a lathe and embedding a silicone O-ring.  But then Paul
Ganssle saw my post and reached out: he had made one of these a few
months ago (

offered to print me one.

He brought it by yesterday, and it's great!

It fits just right: not too hard to slide on, but doesn't feel like
it's going to slide off by accident.
