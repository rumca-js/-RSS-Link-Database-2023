  <p id="KhFcF6">G/O Media, who owns popular tech site <em>Gizmodo</em> along with a slew of other outlets, began publishing AI-generated articles last week, despite strong objections from many of the members of its staff, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/08/gizmodo-ai-errors-star-wars/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. The articles are all credited to various bots — <em>Gizmodo</em> Bot, for example — with no other indication that the article was created using an AI chatbot. Unsurprisingly, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23785645/go-media-ai-generated-articles-gizmodo-av-club-artificial-intelligence-bots">stories needed a lot of work</a>.</p>
<p id="5YdRh1">The internal reaction to <em>Gizmodo</em>’s first chatbot-created story — a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230706053620/https://gizmodo.com/a-chronological-list-of-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-1850592566">chronological list</a> of <em>Star Wars</em> movies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23549295">that wasn’t chronological</a> — wasn’t exactly enthusiastic, with journalists reportedly writing in Slack that it was “actively hurting our reputations and credibility.”</p>

  <p id="OAN83u">Overnight, users across Twitter began reporting that the older, and much better, version of TweetDeck has returned along with the free API access that made third party Twitter clients possible. TweetDeck was disabled last week when Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/1/23781198/twitter-daily-reading-limit-elon-musk-verified-paywall">abruptly threw up a rate-limiting paywall</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/3/23782585/tweetdeck-broken-twitter-rate-limits-scraping-elon-musk">killed the legacy APIs</a> that allowed the old version of the feature to function, while third-party apps were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562947/twitter-third-party-client-tweetbot-twitterific-ban-rules">banned in January</a>.</p>
<p id="txjV1H">An <a href="https://github.com/robertodoering/harpy/releases/tag/0.10.3">update this morning</a> from Harpy developer Roberto Doering says they switched to the “old v1 API” to get it working again, but they also noted “this doesn’t mean that harpy will be maintained again, seeing as Twitter will most likely shut down access to their legacy api (again) soon and third party apps are still against their...</p>

  <p id="RhVVJQ">Chromebooks were originally synonymous with lightweight, online-only, relatively inexpensive computing. Over time, however, they’ve become more and more capable, not only as useful day-to-day systems but as gaming machines, too. </p>
<p id="WTBsHJ">In fact, there are actually more gaming options on ChromeOS than many people may realize. So we’re going to take you through the options.</p>

<p id="6UjM7X">To begin with, as well as giving you access to web games that run in a browser, ChromeOS supports Android games as well. Add in the Steam client for Chromebooks, plus the possibilities offered by cloud gaming services, and you’re really spoilt for choice.</p>
<p id="zQQMUI">You can pick some or all of these options, depending on your gaming needs and your budget.</p>

  <p id="oFEpCM">A former Niantic employee filed a lawsuit against the AR gaming company on Friday, alleging that it devalued the work of female employees and women of color, denied equal pay to women employees and women of color. The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, accuses Niantic of creating a “boys club.” The employee was laid off as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778592/niantic-layoffs-shuts-down-games-la-studio-pokemon-go">last week’s job cuts</a> at the company, which affected about 230 staffers.</p>
<p id="YheH6s">The employee, who is an anonymous Jane Doe but is described in the complaint as an Asian female, started work at Niantic in February 2020 with a salary of $70,000, the complaint says. Later that year, she was promoted and received a raise to about $84,000, but in “approximately” 2021, she learned that Niantic was paying a male...</p>
