<ul><li>World No 5 beats Laslo Djere 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-4</li><li>Medvedev through in four sets to set up Lehecka clash</li></ul><p>Spectators of Friday’s blockbuster match between Andy Murray and Stefanos Tsitsipas will have noticed the Greek world No 5’s talent for tie-breaks. In that match, he won two. In his opening round, against the former US Open winner Dominic Thiem, he won three, including the 10-point super tie-break that decide final sets at grand slams. He has played 223 tie-breaks in his career and won 60% of them. As the tournament entered its first weekend, his prowess under pressure showed again.</p><p>Relegated to No 2 Court in view of the fact his opponent was Serbia’s fourth best player, Laslo Djere, rather than the home favourite Murray, Tsitsipas described his straight-sets win – 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-4 – as “the first match this week I’ve made it easy for me”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/08/tsitsipas-eases-into-wimbledon-last-16-while-medvedev-battles-past-fucsovics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This Glasgow-focused band of veteran alt-rockers promise an unpredictable, exhilarating ride</p><p>Post-punk and new-wave blending outfit <a href="https://currentaffairs.bandcamp.com/">Current Affairs</a> is an assemblage of veteran musicians: Glaswegian frontwoman Joan Sweeney (formerly of bands Aggi Doom and the Royal We); bassist Gemma Fleet (the Wharves, Order of the Toad, Dancer); drummer Andrew Milk (Shopping, Pink Pound); and on guitar Sebastian Ymai (Comidillo Tapes, Pissy, and Anxiety). With diverse roots – Ymai is from Chile and now based in Berlin, while Fleet and Milk are from London – it’s Glasgow, with its celebrated, longstanding DIY music scene, that the stalwart alt-rockers have claimed as their own musical nucleus.</p><p>A version of the band first emerged in 2019, releasing the EP <em>Object and Subject</em>, but it was only after Ymai launched Spite House, an initiative created to highlight female-led and queer music, that today’s iteration of Current Affairs was born. Ymai was driven to launch the project in response to the masculine vibe that proliferated in Glasgow’s gritty live scene at the time. “The motto was: ‘Everyone’s welcome, but don’t get it twisted’,” Sweeney said in <a href="https://www.loverboymagazine.com/current-affairs/">an interview with </a><em><a href="https://www.loverboymagazine.com/current-affairs/">Loverboy</a></em> magazine. “I think that sums it up quite well.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/08/one-to-watch-current-affairs-off-the-tongue-glasgow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the docuseries Last Call, the story of a killer stalking the city’s gay bars becomes an indictment of a system that let him get away with it</p><p>In the piercing, packed new docuseries Last Call, the activist Matt Foreman finds a chilling way to connect the shifting, multi-layered experience of being queer or trans: “If there’s one thing that is universal, in my experience, to LGBTQ people, that we all know intuitively, it’s violence.”</p><p>In early 90s New York City, that violence could find you in many forms. It could be via a deadly disease, one that had been around for a decade yet was still woefully under-researched and any infrastructure surrounding it maliciously under-funded (between 1990 and 1993, there were over 116,000 Aids deaths in the city). It could be on the street, a slur casually turning into an assault (in the first nine months of 1991, there were 600 anti-LGBTQ+ attacks in the West Village and Chelsea alone). Or it could be from the cops, gleefully over-policing a community that the NYPD had long treated as sub-human. As an exhausted and emotional gay man says in archival footage: “Do you know what it is to be assaulted for being alive?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/08/last-call-documentary-new-york-gay-bar-killer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Biden condemned by human rights groups for approving cluster munitions to Ukraine; Zelenskiy secures Turkey’s backing for Nato membership</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>US president Joe Biden has been condemned by human rights groups after agreeing to send widely banned cluster munitions to Ukraine</strong>, with one fellow Democrat labelling the decision “unnecessary and a terrible mistake”. Washington said it has received assurances from Kyiv that it would minimise risk to civilians, including by not using the munitions in populated areas. Biden said the decision was “very difficult”, but that Ukrainian forces were “running out of ammunition”.</p><p><strong>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has secured Turkey’s crucial backing for Ukraine’s pledge to join Nato</strong> during his meeting with president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Istanbul. “There is no doubt that Ukraine deserves membership of Nato,” Erdogan said. Turkey’s support could threaten its ties with Russia after the Kremlin warned it was watching Zelenskiy’s visit “very closely”. Erdogan said he will personally brief Putin on the negotiations when the Russian president visits next month.</p><p><strong>The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief said it was “making progress” on inspecting several areas of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant</strong>, after Ukraine claimed that “external objects similar to explosive devices” had been placed on rooftops at the site. UN officials said they had “not seen any indications of explosives or mines” while touring the cooling ponds and other areas, but have yet to visit the facility’s rooftops.</p><p><strong>Nato leaders will publicly recommit to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> becoming a member of the military alliance</strong> when they meet in Vilnius on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/07/nato-to-recommit-to-ukraines-accession-as-zelenskiy-campaigns-for-support">according to the organisation’s secretary general</a>.<strong> </strong>US president Joe Biden said he does not think there is “unanimity in Nato” to bring Ukraine into the military alliance. Zelenskiy has also criticised Nato over a lack of “unity” which he says explains the failure to provide a guarantee for Ukraine’s membership.</p><p><strong>If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> does not agree to extend a deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian ports, it is unlikely western states will continue cooperating with UN officials helping Moscow with its exports</strong>, the UN aid chief said. Russia has threatened to quit the deal, which expires on 17 July, because several demands to dispatch its own grain and fertiliser have not been met. The last three ships traveling under the deal are loading cargoes at the Ukrainian port of Odesa and are likely to depart on Monday.</p><p><strong>More than 9,000 Ukrainian civilians, including in excess of 500 children, are confirmed to have died since the beginning of Russia’s invasion,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-nato-membership?page=with:block-64a803888f089742d825aaea#block-64a803888f089742d825aaea">according to the latest United Nations data</a>.
