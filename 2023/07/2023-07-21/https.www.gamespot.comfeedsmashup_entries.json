These new ratings are always a hot topic in the Madden community, with players debating which players have been either overrated or underrated. These and more conversations all stem from the team-by-team and player-by-player ratings that annually create friendly debate in the Madden world. In this guide, we're breaking down the complete Dallas Cowboys roster, including overall (OVR) ratings for every starter and the team's best players. Here's what the Cowboys look like for the launch of Madden 24.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Dallas Cowboys roster and ratings for Madden 24</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The Cowboys feature five players rated 90 or better. Their best player is <strong>right guard Zack Martin,</strong> who kicks off this year with a perfect 99 OVR rating.

Patch 1.1.1 will bring a number of improvements to the game, several of which directly address one common complaint: inventory space.</p><p>In patch 1.1.1., an additional stash tab is being added to give players more room to store important items and gear. Going hand-in-hand with the new stash tab will be a change to the maximum elixir stack size.

But in terms of sales numbers for paid games, what are the best-selling games of all time? Here in this gallery we are running through the top 10 best-selling games of all time based on the latest publicly available data.</p><p>This list does not include free-to-play games, which is why you won't see juggernauts like Fortnite, Rocket League, Dota 2, and CS: GO on the list, among others. Those games have no doubt reached many, many more people and are probably best compared against other free-to-play games.</p><p>The list does, however, include sales of pack-in games for hardware bundles\u2013and that is an important distinction. For example, Wii Sports sold about 83 million copies thanks in part to it being bundled with the Wii. The original Super Mario Bros. was a pack-in game as well for the NES.</p><p>With these caveats out of the way, let's dive into the Top 10 best-selling games ever. We're betting you can probably guess a few of these! </p><p>We will continue to update this list over time as GTA 5 inevitably continues to sell more and more copies. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10: Super Mario Bros. -- 50 million (pack-in sales included)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4168664-screenshot2023-07-21at10.59.49am.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The original Super Mario Bros. for NES, released in 1985, is the first game on this list with a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20020311212658/http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060310p1.html\">reported</a> 50 million copies sold. This was not Mario's first appearance in a video game, but Super Mario Bros. remains beloved and its huge success helped propel the Mario franchise forward. The levels, the music, the enemies--it's all iconic. Numerous Mario games would follow, the latest of which is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which releases in October 2023 for Nintendo Switch.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt -- 50 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/536/5360430/3060658-the_witcher_3_wild_hunt_blood_and_wine_anna_henrietta_and_her_entourage_rgb.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt grew the franchise to new heights, with the latest release selling <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3-surpasses-50-million-copies-sold/1100-6514628/\">50 million copies</a> across all platforms. Released in 2015, The Witcher 3 was a hit right out of the gate and has continued to grow and grow and grow. The game is regularly discounted to low, low prices, but that doesn't take anything away from the fact it put up gigantic sales figures. Something else that helped Witcher 3 sales was the debut of the Netflix TV series. The entire Witcher series has sold 75 million units, and with Witcher 3 taking up 50 million of those, it's the biggest of the group.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After The Witcher on Netflix premiered in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-sales-rise-by-more-than-500-in-wake-of-t/1100-6473728/\">Witcher 3 sales rose by 500%</a>. CD Projekt Red released Cyberpunk 2077 next, and while it got off to a poor start in terms of player reception, things have since turned around and the game is doing great. The Witcher 4 is the next game in the main Witcher series, and it's in development now using Unreal Engine 5.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Red Dead Redemption II -- 50 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1593/15930215/3598465-rdr2_pc_screenshot%20039.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Rockstar has two games inside the list of the top 10 best-selling games of all time, and the first is the 2018 western Red Dead Redemption II, with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-stalling-gta-5-sales-pick-up-again-to-reach-175-million-copies-sold/1100-6511237/\">50 million copies sold</a>. A prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption that fans waited nearly a decade for, Red Dead Redemption II goes back in time and explains some of the events leading up to Red Dead Redemption. The game is set in a sprawling open world in the 1899 American West. The game's online mode, Red Dead Online, didn't take off in the way that GTA Online did, but the game overall still managed to put up big numbers</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim -- 60 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1197/11970954/3077757-skyrimspecialeditionriverwood_1465779535.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released back in 2011. It was a very successful release from Bethesda Game Studios at launch, and it has continued to sell well in the years that followed. In fact, the game's ubiquity has become a meme. It's been ported to pretty much every platform you can think of, and game director Todd Howard has explained why. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/\">\"If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it,\"</a> Howard joked in 2018. In an interview in 2023, Howard revealed that the game had reached <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-within-the-top-10-best-selling-games-of-all-time/1100-6515101/\">60 million copies sold</a>, making it one of the top 10 best-selling games ever. Next up for Howard and Bethesda is something new--the RPG Starfield. But after that, Howard and the team will make The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Mario Kart 8 + Deluxe -- 62.25 million (pack-in sales included)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1365/13658182/2847373-mario_vs_honekoopa.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Mario Kart series is one of the biggest and best-known in all of gaming, and Mario Kart 8 is the best-selling of them all. The game originally launched on Wii U, where it sold <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html\">8.46 million copies</a> (a substantial number, considering the Wii U itself only sold 13.5 million units). But the game really got a jolt in sales when it came to Switch via Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. On Switch, the game has sold an astounding <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html\">43.79 million copies</a> to bring its total to 62.25 million. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is featured in Nintendo's annual Black Friday bundle, so of course its sales figures are boosted by being a pack-in title. Nintendo has expanded upon Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with dozens of DLC tracks that players can buy via the Booster Pass. Unsurprisingly, it's been reported that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-is-reportedly-in-development-with-a-new-twist/1100-6499442/\">Mario Kart 9</a> is now in the works.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. PUBG -- 75 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4168665-screenshot2023-07-21at11.07.29am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>PUBG: Battlegrounds, or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds as it was originally known, is now a free-to-play game. But before the change in business model, the game tallied an impressive 75 million copies sold across PC and console. The game, which is based on an Arma mod, was released in 2017 and remains one of the leading battle royale games on the market. It's now also available with a dedicated version for mobile devices. At one point, there were plans to create a PUBG connected universe that would expand far and wide into the horror space with the game The Callisto Protocol, but those plans were scaled back.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Wii Sports -- 82.9 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/mig/2/4/8/7/752487-933010_20060914_004.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>The original Wii Sports was a pack-in game for the Nintendo Wii, and as such, it sold <em>a lot </em>of copies. Surely, its pack-in status helped it sell more than it might otherwise have. How many copies did it sell? 82.9 million by Nintendo's latest count. The game was many people's first introduction to the Wii's innovative motion controls. It really did feel incredible to swing the Wii Remote and see that swing translated on screen for a tennis shot or whipping a bowling ball down the alley. A sequel, Wii Sports Resort, was released in 2009 with more games like frisbee and basketball. A successor followed for the Nintendo Switch in the form of the very creatively named Nintendo Switch Sports.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. GTA 5 -- 180 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1365/13658182/2843117-rsg_gtav_pc_screenshot_056.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>It was only a matter of time before Grand Theft Auto V showed up on this list. Rockstar's celebrated open-world action game was released all the way back in 2013 but has been selling millions of copies every few months, bringing its total to 180 million+ and counting. The game originally launched on Xbox 360 and PS3 before coming to Xbox One, PS4, and PC, and then later with updated graphics and features to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Beyond sales alone, the game brings in money from its uber-popular GTA Online multiplayer mode. And 180 million doesn't even count all the people who might have played GTA 5 when it was available on Xbox Game Pass. In terms of dollars, it is the most successful entertainment product of all time. Unsurprisingly, Rockstar is now developing a new GTA game. Some people believe it could launch in 2024, but Rockstar has not made any official announcements yet.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Minecraft -- 238 million</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/536/5360430/2782819-simpsons%201.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Of course Minecraft is on this list. It's the No. 2 best-selling game of all time. As of 2021, the game had sold 238 million copies, according to franchise owner Microsoft. According to the company, a copy of the game has been sold in just about every country and territory in the world, and that includes Antarctica and Vatican City. The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson, who would go on to sell the game and his stake in developer Mojang to Microsoft in 2014 for $2.5 billion. Microsoft has never released a Minecraft 2, but has expanded the series in the form of other games like Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Legends. A film starring Jason Momoa is now in the works.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Tetris -- 520 million (pack-in sales included)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4168673-screenshot2023-07-21at11.11.24am.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"https://tetris.com/about-us\">official Tetris website</a>, the iconic puzzle game has exceeded 520 million in sales over its lifetime, with \"billions\" of sessions played online every year. The 520 million surely includes combined sales of the many different versions of the year released over the years.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The game is a cultural phenomenon, as pretty much anyone of a certain age would know what you're talking about when you mention Tetris. It's also become common parlance, of sorts, as people might often refer to \"playing Tetris\" when loading up a car with many items that might seem difficult to fit. The game was created by Alexey Pajitnov, an engineer from Soviet Russia. It wasn't until game designer and entrepreneur Henk Rogers discovered the game at a Las Vegas tradeshow in 1988 that the game really picked up steam, though. Rogers got the rights from Pajitnov and licensed the game to Nintendo, which released the game as a pack-in for the Nintendo Game Boy. This led to 35 million copies being sold for Game Boy alone, and the game has remained popular ever since, having been released on pretty much every platform under the sun. A movie about the origins of Tetris starring Taron Egerton was released in 2023.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/", "date_published": "2023-07-21T19:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Relive Sony's Meme-Heavy E3 2006 Conference In Glorious HD", "description": "<p>The Electronic Entertainment Expo <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-canceled/1100-6512853/\">might be on hiatus </a>with an unclear return, but like one of Metallica's best songs, the memory remains.

One of these new features is the grey health system, and we'll tell you how it works below.</p><h2>Why is my health bar grey in Remnant II?</h2><p>If you've noticed that taking damage leaves you with some grey health on your bar, that's due to Remnant II's regeneration mechanic. Half of all damage you take is converted into grey health. The grey portion of your health can be regenerated over time, while the other half of the health you've lost is permanent. This effect is fairly slow, but it's still nice to have passive regeneration, and it can sometimes offset the need to use your Relic--especially post-combat.</p><p>This system isn't just useful for its most basic function of regeneration, though--it can also be used as part of your build. A variety of equippable items can make use of grey health to increase your damage or provide other types of utility. For instance, you may stumble upon a ring that grants you 10% additional damage while grey health is present, so by combining this with additional items that take advantage of grey health, you can make a build that actually incentivizes you to take some damage. It may sound odd, but it can work--especially for builds focused on staying in melee or close-quarters range.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-grey-health-explained/1100-6516188/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-grey-health-explained/1100-6516188/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-21T15:48:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Remnant 2: How To Unlock The Explorer Archetype", "description": "<p>While you can initially only choose one of five archetypes (classes) at the start of your adventure in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/remnant-ii/\">Remnant II</a>, you can unlock additional archetypes by playing the game and completing certain requirements.

The Season 1 update introduced a slew of new content into the game, which is highlighted by the first battle pass in Diablo 4. For those unfamiliar with how battle passes work in Diablo, all you need to do to progress through the tiers is play the game on the Seasonal Realm between now and when Season 1 ends on October 17.</p><p>You can complete the Season 1 questline, slay both old and new enemies, and pretty much do anything else that you can find on the map. Of course, before you venture into the new season, you might be wondering if you should buy the premium version of the battle pass or stick with the free track. The Premium version costs $10 for those who did not preorder the Digital or Ultimate Edition of Diablo 4. Below, we go into whether it's worth the cost.</p><h2>The contents of the Diablo 4 Season 1 battle pass</h2><p>For starters, the battle pass mostly contains cosmetic items, meaning almost nothing you unlock on the pass will give you an advantage when it comes to gameplay. The only exception to this is the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-get-smoldering-ashes-and-what-to-do-with-them/1100-6516167/\">Smoldering Ashes</a>, which are available on the free track of the battle pass.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-diablo-4-season-1-battle-pass-worth-buying/1100-6516182/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-diablo-4-season-1-battle-pass-worth-buying/1100-6516182/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-21T14:37:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Diablo 4: How To Get Smoldering Ashes And What To Do With Them In Season 1", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/\">Diablo 4</a> Season 1 has arrived, bringing the first big content update to the dungeon crawler.

There are 20 Smoldering Ashes spread out across the 90 battle pass tiers. <strong>All Smoldering Ashes are free-tier rewards and do not require you to purchase the battle pass</strong>.
