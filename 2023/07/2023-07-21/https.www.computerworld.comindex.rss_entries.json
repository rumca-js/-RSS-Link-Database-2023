I\u2019ve used it for work tasks since about same time. I\u2019ve done it so frequently and interchangeably with a MacBook that I don\u2019t think I could accurately point to a single thing I've written in the past decade and confidently say \u201cI did that one on my iPad.\u201d I\u2019ve even given advice about the best keyboards and keyboard cases for the iPad and iPad mini.</p><p>Yet the iPad has always remained something of a secondary device. I use it for work when it\u2019s more convenient or when I\u2019m doing a task that is more touch oriented. Even with an excellent keyboard (and sometimes a mouse), tasks that revolve around typing or multi-tasking have generally gone to my MacBook Air. Often, I have both in my bag because there are times when the iPad might work perfectly fine for a particular task, but the MacBook Air and macOS work just a little better, or faster, or more intuitively.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702391/ipados-17-makes-the-ipad-becomes-a-true-laptop-replacement.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702391/ipados-17-makes-the-ipad-becomes-a-true-laptop-replacement.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-07-21T10:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/06/06/00/ipados-17-hero-100941814-small.jpg"}]
