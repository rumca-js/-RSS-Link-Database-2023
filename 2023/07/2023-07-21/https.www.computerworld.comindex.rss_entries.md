<p>New UK government surveillance laws <a href="https://www.applemust.com/here-is-apples-9-page-response-to-the-uk-snoopers-charter/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">are so over-reaching</a> that tech companies can't possibly meet all of their requirements, according to Apple, which argues the measures will <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700859/apple-warns-that-uks-online-safety-bill-puts-people-at-greater-risk.html">make the online world far less safe</a>. </p><h2><strong>Apple, WhatsApp, Meta all threaten to quit UK messaging </strong></h2>
<p>The UK Home Office is pushing proposals to extend the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) with a range of proposals that effectively require messaging providers such as Apple, WhatsApp, or Meta to install backdoors into their services. All three services are now threatening to withdraw messaging apps from the UK market if the changes move forward.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703055/apple-proposed-uk-law-is-a-serious-direct-threat-to-security-privacy.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>I didn't expect to be writing so effusively about the iPad after Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference this year — then I downloaded the first developer beta of iPadOS 17 and things haven’t been the same since.</p><p>I’ve advocated for the iPad as a work tool since the original was released in 2010. I’ve used it for work tasks since about same time. I’ve done it so frequently and interchangeably with a MacBook that I don’t think I could accurately point to a single thing I've written in the past decade and confidently say “I did that one on my iPad.” I’ve even given advice about the best keyboards and keyboard cases for the iPad and iPad mini.</p><p>Yet the iPad has always remained something of a secondary device. I use it for work when it’s more convenient or when I’m doing a task that is more touch oriented. Even with an excellent keyboard (and sometimes a mouse), tasks that revolve around typing or multi-tasking have generally gone to my MacBook Air. Often, I have both in my bag because there are times when the iPad might work perfectly fine for a particular task, but the MacBook Air and macOS work just a little better, or faster, or more intuitively.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702391/ipados-17-makes-the-ipad-becomes-a-true-laptop-replacement.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
