<p>There are good reasons for not voting for the Tories, but Sir Keir Starmer needs to offer compelling reasons to vote for Labour</p><p>A trio of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/uk-byelection-results-labour-tories-selby-ainsty-uxbridge" title="">byelections</a> in England was good news for the main party leaders but not necessarily for their parties. Rishi Sunak can breathe a little easier for not losing three seats. The Tory party, however, will be worried about being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/byelection-results-paint-ominous-picture-tories-despite-uxbridge-win" title="">defeated</a> in bluest Britain. Sir Keir Starmer has shown he can win in a Conservative heartland, as New Labour did in 1997, overturning a 20,000-seat majority in North Yorkshire. However, his party’s failure to win in London raises doubts about its electoral strategy. Voters seem to be saying that the Conservative party deserves to lose at the next election, but the Labour party doesn’t – yet – deserve to win outright.</p><p>Thursday’s votes might be less than they seem. Turnout in these byelections was low: on average 25% below that in the 2019 general election. Party loyalists often see them as a protest vote. At the next election, Britain’s political map will also be <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/boundary-review-2023-which-seats-will-change/" title="">redrawn</a>. Of this week’s three byelection seats, only Uxbridge and South Ruislip will be largely as it is today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/the-guardian-view-on-byelection-results-leaders-speak-of-successes-amid-party-defeats">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin call on ECB to reconsider decision not to allocate 2027 Ashes Tests to northern grounds as former England captain braves potential ignominy</p><p>Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, rang the five-minute bell on Friday and then attempted to also sound an alarm. He and Tracy Brabin, mayor of West Yorkshire, <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/news/mayors-call-for-decision-not-to-host-any-2027-ashes-tests-in-the-north-to-be-reconsidered/" title="">wrote a letter</a> calling on the ECB to reconsider its decision not to allocate any Tests in the next home Ashes series to grounds in the north of England. “It feels remarkable that an area so passionate about cricket, with a population of over 15 million people, misses out on a men’s Ashes Test in 2027 whilst the south hosts three,” they wrote. “We urge you to think again.” The ECB responded to say it would do no such thing: “In 2027 there will be an Ashes Test in the north – a women’s Test at Headingley,” a spokesperson said. “There will also be a men’s Test match against another opponent at Old Trafford. With seven grounds eligible to host men’s Test matches we recognise there will always be disappointment.” Their response won’t end the controversy, but really all cricket-related press releases should end with the phrase “there will always be disappointment”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/21/ashes-diary-northern-mayors-call-out-ecb-as-mike-gatting-relives-that-ball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>High expectations, recent goal drought and uncertainty over best XI mean England could do with a strong start against Haiti</p><p>‘Pressure is a privilege.” Those were the words Leah Williamson uttered on the eve of last summer’s home Euros. Just over a year later, England, with those winners’ medals still gleaming, have to deal with a different kind of pressure, perhaps more increased than ever before. The Lionesses open their World Cup against Haiti in Brisbane with the expectation of a nation on their shoulders. No matter the injuries or the raft of new faces, the wealth of talent within their squad means many will consider this the best opportunity England have had to lift the coveted trophy.</p><p>When asked about this pressure, Sarina Wiegman brushed off the notion with characteristic composure. “[It] is always on England,” the manager said on Friday. “Everyone expects England to win anyway – that’s for tomorrow but also last year for the opening of the European Championship. That’s not different. What we will do is just play our game and focus on what we have to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/21/lionesses-kick-off-world-cup-haiti-pressure">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Nintendo Switch; Nintendo<br /></strong>Nintendo’s outwardly bucolic strategy sequel may just as well be titled Parental Anxiety: The Video Game</p><p>As I survey the garden from my miniature spaceship – watching a team of minions breaking down a brick wall over there, another transporting treasure (a discarded rubber duck) back to base, and a third lot building a clay bridge – I feel a sense of peace and mastery, but also nagging annoyance. In real life I am the sort of person who forgets meetings and appointments even when they happen at the same time every week, can’t multitask, and I am continually, unpleasantly surprised by how few hours I have at my disposal and how much there always is to cram into them. Why can’t I manage myself half as well as I manage this virtual garden? Perhaps what I need is an army of tiny plant people as personal assistants.</p><p>Pikmin are cheerful, obedient creatures, colourful sprouts with eyes, some with noses and little boulder bodies. Each breed of them is suited to different tasks, such as digging, swimming or walking across hot lava on their tiny feet. You, a tiny spaceman, are part of a research and rescue crew that has crash-landed on a suspiciously Earth-like planet, and the Pikmin take a shine to you, allowing you to command them with your whistle in battles against garden beasties and an endless search for treasures. The descriptions of these finds are a highlight: in the minds of these tiny alien researchers, that toy duck becomes a Stately Rubber Cutie, a tennis ball a Sphere of Fuzzy Feelings. Do spend some time in the treasure catalogue – it is guaranteed to make you smile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/21/pikmin-4-review-a-gardeners-fever-dream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The red in tooth and claw classic now requires parental guidance rather than being suitable for anyone. This may seem quaint in the digital age, but it raises important questions</p><p>When the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) changes its certificate for an old movie, it is generally to ease up a bit and concede, like strict parents letting their teens have a glass of wine at dinner, that all right, times have changed. The Alien movies were once rated 18; now they’re 15.<br /><br />However, the recent decision to upgrade the 1978 animated version of Watership Down – the much-loved wild rabbit adventure – from U to PG (Parental Guidance) is a remarkable example of the censoring authority becoming more puritanical over time. Watership Down is violent apparently, with “bloody bite and claw injuries”. To which we can only say: yes. The overwhelming threat of violence is part of what has made Watership Down so compelling. Who can forget the terrifying figure of General Woundwort? Maybe Watership Down should be an 18 certificate, like all those children’s movies which were once routinely allowed to be terrifying and upsetting. Death of Bambi’s mum? 18. Child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? 18. Kaa’s creepy eyes in The Jungle Book? 18.</p><p>But of course, the BBFC isn’t just there to protect us from sex and violence etc. It is there to protect us from the past with all its inappropriate assumptions about what is and isn’t offensive. I like to imagine James Ferman, secretary of what was in those days called the British Board of Film Censors, saying to his colleagues over a good lunch: “Look, nature is red in tooth and claw and a children’s cartoon robustly showing this is perfectly all right. Cleared for newborns and above!”<br /><br />But are young people really going to be triggered by Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and their Peckinpah-esque ordeal? Or is the whole idea of distinguishing between U and PG a quaint absurdity to children who have long since mastered the art of disabling the parental restrictions on their iPhones? The BBFC might well find they have in no way restricted access to Watership Down, but there is something pleasing about the focus on film history, a way to make this old movie new and debate worthy and alive, blood dripping from its claw.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/no-more-newborns-watership-down-has-been-upgraded-to-a-pg-itll-still-terrify-children">Continue reading...</a>

## Will ‘close pals’ rally around Dan Wootton as he faces down catfishing allegations? He’d want that, surely | Marina Hyde

<p>The GB News presenter has always offered a very tabloid form of support to celebrities in difficulty. ​They can’t desert him now</p><p>What is the most shudder-inducing tabloid tone? I think it’s probably fake sympathy. Let’s see a master of it at work. “Danny Dyer’s friends fear he could be ‘heading down the path to sex addiction’,” <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2950999/danny-dyers-eastenders-pals-fear-actor-could-be-heading-down-path-towards-sex-addiction/">sympathised Dan Wootton</a> in the Sun in 2017. The next year, pals were fearing again – this time the possibility that the late Caroline Flack may reunite with a boyfriend. “Friends fear she is preparing to give their relationship another go,” <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6840158/caroline-flack-engagement-ring-back-on/">commiserated Dan</a>. An unnamed friend apparently told him: “Nobody wants to see her hurt.” A year after that, Dan voices “<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/9756816/ricky-hatton-health-tenerife/">fears for Ricky Hatton</a>” after the boxer is filmed stumbling in Tenerife. A fan supposedly tells Dan: “What a fall from grace for such a great champion.”</p><p>And so to this week’s revelations, after a Byline Times story alleged Wootton offered current and former Sun colleagues large sums of money under a pseudonym in return for sexual material. The Guardian newspaper has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/19/news-uk-hires-lawyers-to-look-at-claims-against-former-sun-columnist">spoken to seven</a> such individuals, who say they were contacted by a man named Martin Branning. (Though Wootton has not denied the allegation that he was “Branning”, the Guardian has not been able to independently establish the link between Wootton and Branning. Wootton’s lawyers have, however, made a legal complaint to Byline Times’s publisher.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/dan-wootton-catfishing-gb-news-tabloid-celebrities">Continue reading...</a>

## Dreaming Whilst Black: how Adjani Salmon made TV’s hottest new comedy

<p>He’s starred in Doctor Who, won a Bafta, and now is launching his own hilarious new series. Ahead of Dreaming Whilst Black’s release, he talks race, female empowerment – and YouTube fans</p><p>Achieving your dreams often comes with a day job, and those day jobs can be soul-destroying. Unless, that is, they’re in the hands of Adjani Salmon, writer and star of BBC sitcom Dreaming Whilst Black – who makes their despair hilarious. Aspiring film-maker Kwabena (played by Salmon) is trapped in a drab career in recruitment. He spends his days polishing the CVs of people who list “cooking dogs” as an interest (“you’ve missed a comma”) or who boast about never having quit a role: “It sounds like you’ve been fired from 14 jobs,” he says. “Unfairly!” they shoot back. While he fantasises about his true calling, directing on a movie set, his colleagues confide about their penis size (“I’m not a shower. Nor, to be fair, a grower”) and drag him on stage at karaoke after work to fill in each mention of the N-word during a rendition of Busta Rhymes’s Break Ya Neck. More often than not, his colleagues’ awkward interactions with him are because Kwabena is Black.</p><p>The joy of spending time with a show such as Dreaming Whilst Black – first created as a popular web series that earned a slew of awards, including a Bafta – is that it is charming and very funny even when pointing out uncomfortable truths. When Kwabena decides to follow his dream and finally make a short film, he applies to a scheme for underrepresented voices where the overseeing producer jokes to all the applicants that it’s not “your first time in front of a judge”. We also meet his film school pal Amy (Dani Moseley), a video producer who is asked to take the fall for an educational video that justifies the transatlantic slave trade – after all, it ultimately led to cricket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/21/dreaming-whilst-black-bbc-adjani-salmon-on-creating-tvs-hottest-new-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up to get the full article here</a></strong></p><p>For Jean Paul Gaultier, fashion’s greatest creation is not the bra, the skirt or even a conical bra. “My only regret is not having invented the condom, the most beautiful item of clothing,” he told a journalist after the death of his partner Francis Menuge in 1990 following an HIV diagnosis. (The Frenchman confirmed the quote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jul/19/jean-paul-gaultier-on-couture-conical-bras-and-condoms-no-sex-please-were-british-au-contraire">when interviewed by the Guardian</a> in 2021.) <br /><br />But Gaultier, beloved for his corsets and Madonna collaborations, isn’t the only one interested in unwrapping this intimate “garment”. The prevalence of condoms in fashion is ballooning, with designer collaborations and a new generation of innovative brands aiming to disrupt a once-flaccid, often unsexy market with more effective, inclusive and aesthetic designs. For his spring/summer 2023 show, Diesel creative director Glenn Martens partnered with Durex <a href="https://uk.diesel.com/en/fashion-show/fw23/">on a capsule collection</a> that quickly went viral. <a href="https://www.ysl.com/en-gb/saint-laurent-condom-599128YCL108000.html">Saint Laurent also sells £5 rubbers</a>, while <a href="https://www.neilbarrett.com/gb/shopping/limited-edition-printed-leather-condom-case-18002696">Neil Barrett offers a printed leather condom case</a>.</p><p>Riffing off the house’s slogan, the Diesel collection featured T-shirts emblazoned with “For Sucsexful Living”, with 200,000 co-branded condom boxes strewn across the catwalk. “The scale was meant to symbolise the significance of the topic and the continued need for communities to rally around individual freedom,” says Martinne Geller, director of media relations at Durex’s parent company, Reckitt Benckiser, noting that 30,000 condoms were also given away in Diesel stores worldwide <a href="https://uk.diesel.com/en/fashion-show/fw23/">as part of the campaign</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/20/fashion-statement-designers-condoms">Continue reading...</a>

He was always out and about in the local shopping centre, never without his daily paper.

<p>Extreme heat lingers, leading to wildfires and even giant hailstones. Plus Philippines braces for fifth typhoon of the season</p><p>Extreme heat has lingered over southern Europe throughout the past week, with all-time records broken in a number of locations. Just a few places that recorded their highest ever temperature on 19 July include: Decimomannu in Sardinia at 46.2C, Malaga airport in Spain at 44.2C, and Durrës in Albania at 40.4C.</p><p>The World Meteorological Organization confirmed that the highest <br />temperature ever recorded in Europe was 48.8C in Sicily in 2021, possibly spurred on by the risk of this week’s heatwave breaking records. Throughout the coming week much of Spain and France will have a respite from the highest temperatures. However, from Italy eastwards into the Balkans the heat will linger and the worst may be yet to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/21/weather-tracker-records-fall-europe-heatwave-wildfires-hailstones-philippines-typhoon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So how does the post-Fifa branded game hold up? Surprisingly well, thanks to new motion innovations and more inclusivity</p><p>The world of football is strange and unpredictable. Leicester City’s 2016 Premier League win. Diego Maradona’s Hand of God. Sylvester Stallone playing in goal in Escape to Victory. And then, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/10/electronic-arts-ditches-fifa-ea-sports-fc">May 2022, Electronic Arts lost the $20bn Fifa licence</a>, putting a sudden end to the world’s bestselling sports game. The split came after the football body demanded <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/analysis/fifa-ea-sports-fc-split-video-games-explainer/?zephr_sso_ott=dROfPw">double the previous $150m sum</a> to use its brand. Huge corporations falling out over eye-popping amounts of money? Not so strange and unpredictable after all.</p><p>Now, we have EA Sports’ solo version of their beautiful game: EA Sports FC 24. Also to be known henceforth as the slightly less clunky, FC 24. So, what is a Fifa game without the, erm, Fifa part? According to the development team (the same team that made the Fifa games), this latest iteration is built on new animation technology and a fresh PlayStyles feature. The latter offers an intricate level of player customisation recognising that every player has a distinctive style, allowing you to give special skills to your squad members to make the most of their specific abilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/21/ea-sports-fc-24-the-fifa-follow-up-brings-womens-football-and-slick-play-styles-to-the-fore">Continue reading...</a>

Somewhere between the concrete scones, the sludgy, tree-bark soup and the bottom-of-a-bird-cage tabbouleh, the truth came out, though.</p><p>Well, I say, “spat”, but it was actually more one of those silent, incandescent, mutual huffs couples seem to have in restaurants that involve much eye-rolling, sighing and passive-aggressive napkin-flapping.

Mallow, whose original restaurant is in <a href="https://mallowlondon.com/locations/borough-market/">Borough</a>, is vegan, but very quietly so, and its intention to feed you well, but without cruelty, is carefully communicated.

<p>It’s on to its third reshoot and has lost two Batmans but is Jason Momoa’s protector of the deep destined for a watery grave? Warning: contains The Flash spoilers</p><p>Back in the 00s, the idea of making an Aquaman movie was deemed so ridiculous that the Hollywood bro comedy Entourage <a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2022/12/15/23510822/james-cameron-entourage-aquaman">spent much of its second and third seasons taking the mickey out of the idea</a>. In the end, Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) only agrees to star in the superhero epic because box office king James Cameron signs on to direct it.</p><p>This, of course, was long before the advent of the Marvel and DC superhero universes, which have since gone on to dominate multiplexes and prove that people really will turn out in their droves to see (for the most part) preposterously entertaining films about spandex-sporting titans as conceptually silly as Shazam!, Star-Lord and Rocket Raccoon. During the peak of the comic book movie era, which on recent evidence appears to be long gone, it seemed as if almost any character from the pages of DC and Marvel could be spun off into their own big screen adventure. If Vin Diesel can be convinced to play a talking tree whose only utterance is “I Am Groot”, you know the creatives behind this are fully aware they are riding a gravy train to the land of psychedelic potentiality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-is-in-trouble-but-is-it-too-big-to-fail">Continue reading...</a>

One person who hasn’t, however, is his new wife Nisha (Janhvi Kapoor), whom Ajay resents because she has epilepsy.</p><p>When Ajay loses his cool at school one day, he slaps a pupil, unaware that the whippersnapper is the son of a legislator. Ajay had been due to teach his class about the second world war, but with his job in jeopardy, he decides to visit Europe and send his pupils videos of himself giving history lessons in key places where the war unfolded. He initially tries to force Nisha to stay behind – naturally, he doesn’t like her leaving the house because he’s scared she will have a seizure and embarrass him – but she comes along anyway and slowly they fall in love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/bawaal-review-redemption-romcom-in-spectacularly-poor-taste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If you want another show of blooms, you need to stop the plant in its tracks</p><p>As a child I was so unbothered by the outdoors that my mum would threaten to move us all to a flat without a garden if we didn’t start using our own. But I would happily deadhead daffodils of my own accord. I enjoyed the same things about it that I appreciate about gardening as an adult: the quiet repetition, the soft ease and satisfaction of it, the feel of pinching off a crispy little flower and swelling plant ovary into my palm. I still love snapping the stem of a spent daffodil.</p><p>That was spring, this is summer, but the principle remains the same. Plants exist to procreate in the form of reproducing seed. Many of us grow them because of the flowers they produce to attract pollinating insects to do just that. The flower is the main show for us, but simply a means to an end for the plant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/21/deadheading-will-keep-flowers-in-flush-for-longer-and-its-so-satisfying">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not only does this plant look striking, it can also improve the air quality in your home</p><p><strong>Why will I love it?<br /></strong>Prepare to be enchanted by the striking silver-green foliage of the silver snake plant, also known as <em>Sansevieria trifasciata</em> ‘Moonshine’. It’s easy to look after and makes a great beginner plant as it’s near indestructible. <br /><br /><strong>Light or shade?</strong> <br />It thrives in both low and bright, indirect light conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Where should I put it?</strong> <br />This versatile plant can adapt to different environments, making it suitable for well-lit rooms and dim corners, humid or dry spaces. Its upward-pointing leaves symbolise positivity, making it great as a home-office desk plant.<br /><br /><strong>How do I keep it alive?</strong> <br />Easy: it’s a low-maintenance plant that prefers its soil to dry out between waterings. Water weekly during the summer season and during the winter reduce this to every four weeks. It’s best to err on the side of under rather than overwatering. Make sure to place it in a well-draining potting mix to avoid root rot.<br /><br /><strong>Did you know …</strong><br />The silver snake plant can remove toxins such as formaldehyde, benzene and trichloroethylene from the air, enhancing the overall air quality in your home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/21/houseplant-of-the-week-silver-snake-plant">Continue reading...</a>

With the tide out the beaches and skies are overwhelming, especially on a sunny day. The coast is vast, so if you like solitude you’ll find it here. You have the bonus of a wander into the beautiful village of Warkworth and the small town of Amble.

<p>Our rental situation is better than most, yet we still found ourselves scrubbing mould from the windows to protect our son’s tiny lungs</p><p>Before we decided to have a baby, I thought a lot about what being a mother would be like, but there were some respects in which my imagination failed me. Both are related to my living environment. I live in a first-floor flat with quite a few steps leading up to the front door from street level, and it did not occur to me that this would be what might politely be termed a “complete and utter ball-ache”, both in respect of getting myself and the baby outside, but also his many effects, meaning it requires at least two trips and, unless I am using the Babyzen Yoyo, which is extremely light, the assistance of my husband or sometimes my very kind neighbour. Without that pram and someone there to assist, I’d basically be housebound, which makes me feel pathetic and a tad vulnerable. (For a while I could pop the baby on a blanket in the communal hall while lugging the pram down the steps, but now that he is mobile he’s on a kamikaze mission to go headfirst after me.)</p><p>The other was toys. For some reason, I had not realised that there would be so many toys, and that not tripping over those toys in the dark at 3.55am when retrieving a bottle would become quite key.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Break from the routine and don’t play it too safe on holiday. Try different headwear or switch up your shades. Just be sure to dress for joy. </p><p>The whole point of holidays is that you get to make joy and fun the main event. On holiday, having a lovely time is basically your job. And you know what they say about jobs, right? You should dress for the one you want. So on holiday, if you want to have a really super lovely time (which I’m thinking is a yes) then start by dressing for it.</p><p>That means forget about being taken seriously for a bit. On holiday, in fact, you want to dress to be taken as <em>unseriously</em> as possible. That way, everyone around you will understand that you have taken a hard time out from your to-do list, and that your decision-making responsibilities are zero (except in the ice-cream parlour). Lean in to dresses you can take a nap in (a whole genre of flowing dress known, incidentally, as nap dresses), a thin silk scarf you can tie your hair up with, and shoes you can kick off to paddle in the sea. Become the Sheryl Sandberg of broderie anglaise dresses and shorts you made out of last year’s jeans. Dress for joy, dress for fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/21/want-to-have-loads-of-fun-on-holiday-then-embrace-the-sillier-side-of-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

From the grandstand we watched Taichi Kho find himself in one for two, eventually getting on the green for eight, having decided he’d like another go in the same bunker after playing out backwards. Two-putt for a ten. Nightmare. Heading home tonight. Watching the rest this weekend smugly dry and warm from anywhere I can elevate my feet. Timing.”</p><p>Yes, it’ll be interesting to see how the bunkers play today all right. They’ve apparently raked them using a different method today, which is less likely to encourage the ball to run right up to the face. So that in theory should give players more of a chance of getting up, over and out. However as Dame Laura Davies pointed out on Sky, the slight upward slope of sand raked towards the face may lead to a few plugged balls, should they hit that face and drop straight down. Fun and entertainment guaranteed either way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/21/the-open-2023-round-two-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Squama Recordings)<br /></strong>The<strong> </strong>Ulaanbaatar-born singer shows there is more to her country than throat singing: her dextrous voice sits between jazz improv and ceremonial song</p><p>Mongolian music has a long history of producing captivating vocal styles. The best-known is throat singing – a reverberating technique that produces multiple pitches during a single phrase. Raw, earthy and a predominantly male pursuit, throat singing is more of a droning instrumental sound than a means of conveying lyrics. For the Ulaanbaatar-born singer Enkhjargal Erkhembayar, AKA Enji, there is another side to her country’s song – a delicate, dexterous vocal that sits between jazz improvisation and the ceremonial long song (Urtiin duu), a vibrato-laden style of singing where syllables are drawn out to create melismatic lines that can spend minutes expressing single words.</p><p>Born into a lineage of long song singers, Erkhembayar’s 2017 debut, Mongolian Song, featured traditional compositions with sprightly jazz arrangements, while 2021’s Ursgal comprised nine original songs. On Ulaan, Erkhembayar produces the most singular vision of her Mongolian jazz music yet, through 10 new compositions of scat singing, atmospheric soundscapes and acoustic instrumentation blended with her yearning voice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/21/enji-ulaan-review-elegant-and-powerful-twist-on-traditional-mongolian-music">Continue reading...</a>

## Jessy Lanza: Love Hallucination review – a sensual producer’s pursuit of pleasure

<p><strong>(Hyperdub)</strong><br />The uniquely puckish Canadian electronic artist spans pop and beguiling abstraction on her fourth album, as she writes about boldly confronting her needs</p><p>Jessy Lanza’s third album, 2020’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/23/jessy-lanza-all-the-time-review">All the Time</a>, traded in suggestion. The Canadian producer let fly little wisps of desire – “want / you” – on the breeze of her off-kilter, neon-hued club music in the hope that they might be reciprocated. Love Hallucination changes mode: Lanza is no longer asking but demanding orgasms, devotion and boundaries, sometimes losing herself in the gulf between desire and reality. “So frantic with no purpose,” she sings over the wonky funk of Gossamer, sounding pleasurably lightheaded in pursuit of her needs.</p><p>Lanza has credited this newfound boldness to her initially writing these songs for other artists. Yet Love Hallucination isn’t cosplay but an affirmation of Lanza’s unique ear. Her tactile heavy bass, cirrus-wisp synths and spun-sugar falsetto have deepened: the low end is diamond-hard, her playful freestyle-inspired melodies and moods glimmer like the light refracted through the gem. Don’t Leave Me Now is at once prowling and prismatic in its hi-NRG; the glimmering Drive is a study in liquid and solid. There’s pop potential (the sing-songy “you’re unkind!” chorus of Don’t Cry on My Pillow) and beguiling abstraction (Big Pink Rose swerves between petal-plucking dreaminess and breakbeat tremors).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/21/jessy-lanza-love-hallucination-review-a-sensual-producers-pursuit-of-pleasure">Continue reading...</a>

## From a match with 149 own goals to Scottish Cup routs: football’s most lopsided results

Judit Polgar, whose peak career rating was 2735 and who for more than a decade was ranked among or close to the world top 10 grandmasters, was and is in a league of her own, nearly 100 points ahead of her nearest challenger, Hou Yifan, who is herself clearly the all-time No 2.</p><p>Although Polgar is now a mother of two and no longer plays competitively, she has forged a new reputation as a high class commentator on major events, noted especially for her sharp and rapid spotting of hidden tactical resources.

<p>Aidan Turner is a tennis coach accused of sexual assault, but this unpredictable series’s real star is Ella Lily Hyland – who is superlative in her breakthrough role as an ex starlet</p><p>You know that it can’t be as simple as it first appears. But it does seem that way for an impressively long time as the story of Fifteen-Love begins. Aidan Turner plays professional tennis coach Glenn Lapthorn who is accused of sexual abuse by his former protege Justine Pearce (Ella Lily Hyland, in her first major screen role), five years after she suffered a career-ending injury just as they were both about to break into the sporting big time. The opening scenes show her at 17, just before what will turn out to be her last match, kissing him and him pushing her away, wiping his mouth in horror – “We talked about this!”</p><p>For most of the opening episode it looks as if this is a case of a hormonal teenager overcome by unavoidable daily close proximity to a handsome man with whom, in the way of elite athletes and their coaches, she also has an equally unavoidably intense mental relationship. After the kiss, we cut to five years later when Justine has become a physiotherapist at her former training academy, and is given to taking male clients’ minds off their pain as she works, by analysing the psychology behind women’s rape fantasises for them. Is this the hypersexualisation of someone abused in their teens? Or just a hyper-confident young woman not over-committed to her job or its boundaries? Either way, it is the beginning of an absolutely superlative performance by Hyland, who holds the many facets of her character (courtesy of a rigorous script by Hania Elkington) in perfect tension. She is dislikable, vulnerable, grief-stricken, a case of forced maturity and arrested development at the same time and mesmerising throughout.</p><p>Fifteen-Love is on Prime Video.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/21/fifteen-love-review-the-acting-in-this-impeccably-tense-drama-is-absolutely-mesmerising">Continue reading...</a>

## Meaty, chewy, sticky: how AI’s listening kitchen can redefine the art of cooking | Philip Maughan

<p>Written recipes have become too formulaic. Computing can help restore the fun and the fusion of the oral tradition</p><p>Over the past few weeks I have been using GPT-4 to help me cook. Need a substitute for an ingredient you forgot to buy? GPT can suggest an alternative. Time to clear out the cupboards? Simply type: “Please create a recipe using two eggs, a jar of borlotti beans, a potato, a leek, and the scrapings on the bottom of a jar of pickle.” I’m always polite, and so is GPT. It thinks for a moment – then whips up the instructions for an unusual but edible hash and even wishes me bon appétit. But that’s not all it can do.</p><p>On a recent trip to Venice, I wanted to know what sort of fish I should eat. “One of the local speciality fish is the branzino, or European sea bass,” GPT explained, without mocking my ignorance. And much as image generation models such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney can imitate popular artists, you can input well-known chefs to influence the results. When I asked for “beans on toast in the style of Yotam Ottolenghi”, for instance, I received a recipe for “spiced beans on sourdough toast” which included cumin, za’atar and greek yoghurt, among about 12 other components. The feeling of reading the long list of ingredients before realising I didn’t have the energy was almost like-for-like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/ai-listening-kitchen-cooking-recipes-computing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Retail sales rise more strongly than expected amid supermarket promotions; government borrows £18.5bn in June, third-highest June borrowing on record</p><p><strong>Is this the last hurrah?</strong> asks <strong>Jonathan Moyes</strong>, head of investment research at Wealth Club.</p><p>Retail sales in June came in much stronger than expected, this is despite fears of soaring mortgage costs and stubborn inflation dominating the news flow over the month. I am reminded of a well-known quote describing economics “if you are not a little confused, you don’t understand it”.</p><p>It appears that warm weather drove consumers onto the high street in search of new clothing and garden furniture over the month. Whilst the picture may look rosy now, as the months grow colder, there is a risk the chill of higher mortgage costs and inflation will weigh heavy on household budgets.</p><p>The hottest June on record painted a sunny picture for retailers as sales lifted for the third consecutive month. Spending on clothing and furniture rose as consumers devoted a larger share of their wallet towards discretionary items, as we’ve also seen in our latest Consumer Tracker.</p><p>Even as inflation begins to fall, the changing economic landscape is not immediately influencing consumer behaviours. <strong>Many consumers continue to source cheaper products through discounting and value-ranges, as well as opting to shop at budget stores.</strong> Mid-market brands and retailers will therefore need to show the value and quality of their product ranges to encourage spending.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jul/21/hot-weather-lift-retail-sales-britain-government-borrowing-falls-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A capacious political novel examines corruption, greed and daring in the UK’s oil boom</p><p>Given its ubiquity in the headlines of the 60s and 70s, the subject of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/01/does-the-uk-really-need-to-drill-for-more-north-sea-oil-and-gas" title="">North Sea oil</a> has inspired relatively few novels. While coal and steel went into terminal decline, the exploitation of the UK’s offshore oil fields was – and still is – going strong; fertile ground, you would think, for fiction, with rich themes of greed, corruption, ecological threat and human daring. Into this void jumps Richard T Kelly with his panoptic, compassionate fourth novel, The Black Eden, which follows the fortunes of five young men from Scotland whose lives are shaped by the search for “black gold” under the ocean.</p><p>We begin in 1956, with motherless teenagers Aaron Strang and Robbie Vallance diving “down in the blue limbo” off the coast of the Dornoch Firth, and follow their friendship as their career paths diverge. While Aaron becomes a geologist under the mentorship of Prof Hugh Munro, Robbie is a casual “roustabout” hand on one of the first oil platforms. When, in 1963, Aaron is persuaded by Munro to suspend his doctorate and take a job with the sharkish American firm Paxton Oil and Gas, he finds himself advising the government on the prospect of becoming an oil-producing nation, dispensing with the need to spend “five hundred million a year getting the bloody stuff off the Arabs”. The secretary of state observes that a chart of the North Sea continental shelf recalls “old maps illustrating the carve-up of Africa”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/21/the-black-eden-by-richard-t-kelly-review-the-story-of-north-sea-oil">Continue reading...</a>

This week, as hybrid working <a href="https://www.tozers.co.uk/insights/hybrid-working-is-there-now-a-legal-right-to-work-from-home">moves towards being a legal right</a>, Britain was revealed to be <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-work/canadians-work-from-home-more">second only to Canada</a> in the global work-from-home league. Since lockdown, its office working has fallen by more than a quarter, an average of one and a half days a week. Covid has revealed the truth, that white-collar staff are not 9-5 factory workers in disguise. Digital has freed “work” from the prison of geography. An office is the whole wide world.</p><p>Cut to the memorial citadel of Britain’s office age, east London’s Canary Wharf. I can remember when it was on its way to being the Shoreditch of the East End, its warehouses colonised by film-makers and artists. It would today be dancing all night. Instead, it was transformed by Margaret Thatcher’s infatuation with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8bb8bf5a-3db6-11e3-9928-00144feab7de">developer Paul Reichmann’s plan </a>to build a European Wall Street. She made the wharf the biggest state-funded project in UK history. She and her environment secretary, Michael Heseltine, hurled money at it. They declared Canary Wharf’s entire building programme a tradable tax dodge, costing taxpayers billions. They freed it of property taxes. They built it two new railways – the DLR and Jubilee line – a spaghetti junction of motorways and the most expensive road scheme in Britain per mile, <a href="https://www.routeyou.com/en-gb/location/view/48031621/limehouse-link-tunnel">the Limehouse Link</a>.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/government-planning-canary-wharf-office-cities">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Badenoch, Cairngorms:</strong> There’s nowhere to hide in such an open nest, when the cloud decides to shed its load</p><p>As we walk down to the lochside, the warm afternoon sun is muted by growing towers of cloud. Arriving from the south, they mass on the far side of the loch above the Feshie hills, where a faint mantle of light still shines. The air cools. A high-pitched repeated note carries from an island of trees, ringing like a piccolo. It is the osprey chick, hidden in the nest that sits precariously at the top of a ragged larch.</p><p>This year, we have seen only one. When we get to the water’s edge, a soft rain begins and we shelter under a spread of oaks. Their layered canopy keeps us dry as the shower swells, casting a veil over loch, shore and forest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/21/country-diary-ungainly-and-wet-the-osprey-chick-is-ready-to-fledge">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Atlantic)</strong><br />It falls to Sam Smith, PinkPantheress and Charli XCX to provide moments of flair on a relentlessly branded tie-in soundtrack that wears thin very quickly</p><p>There are, by my count, at least 14 different versions of Barbie the Album: a vast, brightly coloured array of vinyl and cassette variants and alternative covers, all ready for purchase from your favourite big-box store, streaming service or online retailer. For a certain kind of record collector, I imagine that it will be hard to pick between, say, the Target-exclusive “candy floss” coloured vinyl and the “cotton candy” coloured vinyl, or the standard “hot pink” vinyl and the Urban Outfitters-exclusive “neon pink” vinyl.</p><p>What shade of pink record you prefer to purchase and, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/various-artists-317-1191158">most likely, not play</a> doesn’t really matter. The point seems to be that, even if you’re a little past the age to pick up one of the many toys that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie film is ostensibly designed to promote, there’s still a hunk of plastic you can purchase to commemorate this auspicious union of art and advertising.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/21/barbie-the-album-review-a-cynical-exercise-in-corporate-synergy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Broadway Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>David Byrne and Fatboy Slim’s disco-infused extravaganza turns the theatre into a dance floor with thrilling results</p><p>Let’s get the shoes out of the way. Here Lies Love, David Byrne and Fatboy Slim’s pop musical about Imelda Marcos, does not dwell on the kleptocrat’s notorious shoe collection.</p><p>The show’s take-it-or-leave-it attitude toward Marco’s shoe fetish extends to the audience, many of them Filipino-Americans whose families fled the country under Ferdinand Marcos’s despotic regime. At a recent preview, the ground was thick with Hokas and On Clouds, Air Maxes and Reeboks. It wasn’t just a communal repudiation of what, by now, has become a cliched symbol of the former first lady’s boundless greed. The production is a roof-raising musical presented as interactive disco and the audience was all too ready to dance off against a modern-day Marie Antoinette.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/20/here-lies-love-review-imelda-marcos-broadway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She may have towered over the toy market for 60 years, but Barbie has never been short of critics. So why is a film about a plastic doll creating such fevered excitement?</p><p>Ever since she exploded on to the toy scene, Barbie, based on a risque doll for men, has inspired adoration and unease. Her glamorous lifestyle, endless wardrobe, dream home and accessory of a boyfriend, Ken, delighted generations of children. But for many critics this oddly sexualised doll with the bouffant blonde hair and unrealistic body shape was a way of selling little girls a damaging ideal of womanhood.</p><p>The toy brand Mattel responded to criticisms by making more Barbies who were scientists, teachers, even politicians, and who were no longer only white or able-bodied.
