IGN's Max Scoville, Kim Horcher, and Joshua Yehl discuss and debate the casting of new Clark Kent David Corwenswet and Lois Land Rachel Brosnahan, whether Superman: Legacy will be too overstuffed with setup, and the most important question of all: trunks or no trunks?

That Borderlands movie (that you definitely didn't forget about) has a release date, and it's August 9, 2024. That's a little over a year away, and although there have been the briefest of peeks more than a year ago, we haven't seen even a proper teaser for this movie. The plot isn't adapting any of the games specifically, but it does sound like it's bringing characters from the different games together, so that's cool.

Square Enix has insisted sales of Final Fantasy 16 are “extremely strong”, telling IGN the game has sold well relative to the PlayStation 5 install base. With its prospects of blocking Xbox's Activision Blizzard merger dimming, the Federal Trade Commission is hitting the brakes on its trial scheduled for August. Finally, Blizzard has explained its decision-making around the miniscule drop rate for Diablo 4’s coveted Uber Unique items, insisting obtaining one should be a "fall out of your chair moment".

## BattleBit Remastered Early Access Review

Battlebit Remastered reviewed on PC by Gabriel Moss.

BattleBit Remastered remembers what made Battlefield games great in their heyday: there are no flashy scripted tornados, just big maps teeming with combat hotspots and myriad destructible buildings. That kind of throwback fun shines through even the basic graphics, highlighting how this kind of gameplay was never about realism so much as it is goofy combat chaos with a ton of people. So it’s an easy sell for anyone looking to jump into hectic, squad-based action with hundreds of other players; whether for a few minutes or a few hours. Naturally the early access version isn’t fully cooked yet, especially due to some underbaked mechanics like stupid-fast running speed and clunky vehicle controls. But what already exists is an impressive first swing at what could become a much more comprehensive tribute to the Battlefield series, and even in its current state, it’s already one of the more captivating multiplayer shooters on Steam right now.

In today's Fix of Entertainment News:
James Cameron has made a couple of movies about the dangers of runaway artificial intelligence, and he sounds surprised we haven't listened to him. Speaking with CTV News, the acclaimed filmmaker is worried that AI companies will continuously one-up each other in a race akin to the nuclear arms race of the Cold War. And if you've seen his Terminator or Terminator 2 movies, you know what the outcome is. Yikes. In other news, the producers of Netflix's The Witcher series know how they'll transition from Henry Cavill to Luke Hemsworth, and they'll be taking some inspiration from the books. And finally, get a peek into an all-access family vacation at Universal Orlando Resort. This episode is brought to you by Universal Orlando Resort.
