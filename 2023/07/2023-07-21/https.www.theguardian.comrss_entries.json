This may seem quaint in the digital age, but it raises important questions</p><p>When the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) changes its certificate for an old movie, it is generally to ease up a bit and concede, like strict parents letting their teens have a glass of wine at dinner, that all right, times have changed. The Alien movies were once rated 18; now they\u2019re 15.<br /><br />However, the recent decision to upgrade the 1978 animated version of Watership Down \u2013 the much-loved wild rabbit adventure \u2013 from U to PG (Parental Guidance) is a remarkable example of the censoring authority becoming more puritanical over time. Watership Down is violent apparently, with \u201cbloody bite and claw injuries\u201d. To which we can only say: yes. The overwhelming threat of violence is part of what has made Watership Down so compelling. Who can forget the terrifying figure of General Woundwort? Maybe Watership Down should be an 18 certificate, like all those children\u2019s movies which were once routinely allowed to be terrifying and upsetting. Death of Bambi\u2019s mum? 18. Child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? 18. Kaa\u2019s creepy eyes in The Jungle Book? 18.</p><p>But of course, the BBFC isn\u2019t just there to protect us from sex and violence etc. It is there to protect us from the past with all its inappropriate assumptions about what is and isn\u2019t offensive. I like to imagine James Ferman, secretary of what was in those days called the British Board of Film Censors, saying to his colleagues over a good lunch: \u201cLook, nature is red in tooth and claw and a children\u2019s cartoon robustly showing this is perfectly all right. Cleared for newborns and above!\u201d<br /><br />But are young people really going to be triggered by Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and their Peckinpah-esque ordeal? Or is the whole idea of distinguishing between U and PG a quaint absurdity to children who have long since mastered the art of disabling the parental restrictions on their iPhones? The BBFC might well find they have in no way restricted access to Watership Down, but there is something pleasing about the focus on film history, a way to make this old movie new and debate worthy and alive, blood dripping from its claw.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/no-more-newborns-watership-down-has-been-upgraded-to-a-pg-itll-still-terrify-children\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/no-more-newborns-watership-down-has-been-upgraded-to-a-pg-itll-still-terrify-children", "date_published": "2023-07-21T14:38:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK visitor numbers up amid signs of shift away from mainland Europe\u2019s extreme heat", "description": "<p>Tourism to UK close to pre-Covid levels as Czech Republic, Ireland and Denmark also leap in popularity</p><p>Where once holidaymakers flocked south for the summer in search of scorching getaways, the climate emergency may be signalling a reversal of that trend.</p><p>It seems some tourists are shunning continental Europe, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/extreme-weather-continues-across-europe-as-more-hot-weather-looms\">temperatures are soaring to as high as 48C in the current heatwave</a>, in favour of Britain\u2019s cooler climes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/21/uk-visitor-numbers-up-tourists-europe-extreme-heat\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/21/uk-visitor-numbers-up-tourists-europe-extreme-heat", "date_published": "2023-07-21T14:37:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "No, I didn\u2019t imagine it \u2013 the \u2018NPC\u2019 craze really offers money for robotic gibberish | Arwa Mahdawi", "description": "<p>People online pretend to be jerky video-game characters \u2013 and some make tons of money doing it.

Love Hallucination changes mode: Lanza is no longer asking but demanding orgasms, devotion and boundaries, sometimes losing herself in the gulf between desire and reality. \u201cSo frantic with no purpose,\u201d she sings over the wonky funk of Gossamer, sounding pleasurably lightheaded in pursuit of her needs.</p><p>Lanza has credited this newfound boldness to her initially writing these songs for other artists. Yet Love Hallucination isn\u2019t cosplay but an affirmation of Lanza\u2019s unique ear. Her tactile heavy bass, cirrus-wisp synths and spun-sugar falsetto have deepened: the low end is diamond-hard, her playful freestyle-inspired melodies and moods glimmer like the light refracted through the gem.
