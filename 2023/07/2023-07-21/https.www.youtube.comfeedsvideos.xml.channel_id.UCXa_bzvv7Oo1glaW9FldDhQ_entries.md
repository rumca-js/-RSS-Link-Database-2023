In a genre like the action RPG, where there are so many games constantly competing for your time and vying for your attention, a game has to be a truly standout experience to merit a recommendation. Sadly, Killsquad falls woefully short on that front in more ways than one.

Though not completely without some strengths of its own, when all is said and done, the final product here is entirely too forgettable.
