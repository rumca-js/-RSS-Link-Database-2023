<p>You no longer need to try a beta to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-stream-android-phone-apps-to-your-chromebook-202830500.html">stream Android apps on your Chromebook</a>. Google has <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/226740277/introducing-chromeos-m115-to-the-stable-channel">released</a> a Chrome OS M115 update that makes Android app streaming available to many more people. If you have Phone Hub enabled, you can run an Android app directly from your mobile device rather than installing it on the computer. The update allows you to reply to a message or check your lunch delivery without the distraction of reaching for your handset.</p><p>The feature is still limited to a handful of Android 13-capable phones from Google and Xiaomi. From Google, you'll need a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4a-review-price-specs-availability-150050960.html">Pixel 4a</a> or later. Xiaomi fans, meanwhile, need at least a 12T. Both your Chromebook and phone must be on the same WiFi network and physically close by. Some networks might not support the feature, but you can use Chrome OS' Instant Tethering to establish a link if need be.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As during the beta, you won't want to use app streaming for games or other intensive Android apps. This is more for responding to notifications than any serious commitment — you'll still want to install apps for that. It gives Chromebooks some of the phone integration you find in macOS <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-your-phone-175356621.html">and Windows</a>, though, and may help you stay focused while you work.</p><p>The M115 upgrade also lets you sign PDF documents and save signatures to use later. Google has also redesigned the keyboard-oriented Shortcut app with a new interface and easier in-app search.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-rolls-out-android-app-streaming-to-chromebooks-following-beta-203014704.html?src=rss

<p>OpenAI’s trust and safety lead, Dave Willner, has left the position, as announced <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZGVlZmJmMi05NDFiLTQxNTYtOWY0MS1hNjFlYmI1MGQxM2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2ZlZWQvdXBkYXRlL3VybjpsaTphY3Rpdml0eTo3MDg3ODg3MDM5NzU2NDQ3NzQ0LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWY5ZDFjNDQtMzkyZC00OGFlLTk2MzAtYzVmOTE5ZTM5MTcyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASXXaVhmlD1rmaZpWt91xYB-wHoboCCQ3gwLvPgR8H_h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fupdate%2Furn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7087887039756447744%2F"><ins>via a Linkedin post.</ins></a> Willner is staying on in an “advisory role” but has asked Linkedin followers to “reach out” for related opportunities. The former OpenAI project lead states that the move comes after a decision to spend more time with his family. Yes, that’s what they always say, but Willner follows it up with actual details.</p><p>“In the months following the launch of ChatGPT, I've found it more and more difficult to keep up my end of the bargain,” he writes. “OpenAI is going through a high-intensity phase in its development — and so are our kids. Anyone with young children and a super intense job can relate to that tension.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>He continues to say he’s “proud of everything” the company accomplished during his tenure and noted it was “one of the coolest and most interesting jobs” in the world.</p><p>Of course, this transition comes hot on the heels of some legal hurdles facing OpenAI and its signature product, ChatGPT. The FTC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-opens-investigation-into-chatgpt-creator-openai-164551958.html"><ins>recently opened an investigation</ins></a> into the company over concerns that it is violating consumer protection laws and engaging in “unfair or deceptive" practices that could hurt the public's privacy and security. The investigation does involve a bug that leaked users’ private data, which certainly seems to fall under the purview of trust and safety.</p><p>Willner says his decision was actually a “pretty easy choice to make, though not one that folks in my position often make so explicitly in public.” He also states that he hopes his decision will help normalize more open discussions about work/life balance.&nbsp;</p><p>There's growing concerns over the safety of AI in recent months and OpenAI is one of the companies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-companies-will-reportedly-commit-to-safeguards-at-the-white-houses-request-185646283.html"><ins>agreed to place certain safeguards</ins></a> on its products at the behest of President Biden and the White House. These include allowing independent experts access to the code, flagging risks to society like biases, sharing safety information with the government and watermarking audio and visual content to let people know that it’s AI-generated.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/openais-trust-and-safety-lead-is-leaving-the-company-190049987.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon’s Starlink rival, Project Kuiper, is moving closer to liftoff. The company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-kennedy-space-center-florida">announced</a> today that a new $120 million satellite-processing facility for the initiative is under construction at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Amazon plans to launch its first satellites “in the coming months,” followed by the first customer pilots next year.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-is-getting-ready-to-test-its-starlink-satellite-to-cell-phone-service-181810564.html">Elon Musk’s Starlink</a>, Project Kuiper aims to provide fast and affordable satellite broadband to areas “unserved or underserved by traditional internet and communications options.” (It’s an Amazon initiative but should enjoy a cozy relationship with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-is-planning-to-open-new-launch-sites-outside-the-us-122518232.html">Blue Origin</a>, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.) Project Kuiper kickstarted in 2018, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-secures-fcc-approval-project-kuiper-broadband-satellites-071817672.html">receiving FCC satellite licensing</a> two years later. The company plans to create a constellation of 3,236 satellites to provide seamless broadband coverage for rural users. Amazon hasn’t yet announced consumer pricing, but it hints at budget-friendly plans, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/what-is-amazon-project-kuiper">saying</a>, “affordability is a key principle of Project Kuiper.” The company also intends to offer multiple speed / pricing tiers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kuiper’s satellites will be assembled at a new “state-of-the-art manufacturing facility” in Kirkland, Washington, by the end of 2023. The new Florida installation will receive the satellite shipments, perform final preparations ahead of their commercial deployment. Amazon says it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-launch-partners-131048042.html">secured launches</a> from Blue Origin, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-26-ariane-5-ferried-nasa-instrument-to-orbit-despite-launch-scare.html">Arianespace</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ula-may-4th-vulcan-centaur-rocket-inaugural-flight-125513492.html">United Launch Alliance</a> (ULA). Most units will deploy from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, near the new processing facility.</p><p>Amazon touted Project Kuiper’s anticipated job creation. It says over 1,400 people are already working on it, and the company expects the initiative to eventually support thousands of suppliers and highly skilled jobs — especially in Alabama, Florida and Colorado.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-builds-new-florida-satellite-facility-for-its-starlink-rival-173537256.html?src=rss

There aren't enough skilled workers available to complete construction on time, according to Chairman Mark Liu. The company is considering loaning technicians from its home country to help complete the project.</p><p>The Arizona facility is a highlight of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-signs-chips-and-science-act-145820799.html">CHIPS and Science Act</a> President Biden signed into law last year. The measure is meant to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and includes $52.7 billion in funding and tax credits for companies building factories stateside. TSMC seeks <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-seeks-15b-subsidies-wants-130836706.html#:~:text=TSMC%20expects%20to%20get%20tax,government%20caps%20its%20potential%20profit.">$15 billion in tax credits</a> for its two Arizona plants, although it anticipates investing a total $40 billion in the state.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The federal government isn't immediately concerned about the worker shortfall. In a statement, White House representative Olivia Dalton says provisions in the CHIPS and Science Act will get the "workforce we need."</p><p>The delay still poses problems for tech companies dependent on TSMC's manufacturing, most notably Apple. Future iPhones and Macs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-to-use-tsmc-arizona-factory-chips-214544360.html">will use 4nm and 3nm chips</a> made at the Phoenix plants. If the delay holds, Apple may have to either stall product launches or lean on alternative manufacturers. Intel is pouring $20 billion into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">two Arizona facilities</a> due to start chip production in 2024, but those won't necessarily be available for Apple's needs.</p><p>The delay illustrates one of the key challenges of bringing more tech manufacturing to the US. While there's no shortage of money or desire, fewer workers are trained for the jobs as there are in Taiwan and other major production hubs. Apple contractor Foxconn may have an easy time finding factory workers in China, for example but they're <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs?sref=10lNAhZ9">not nearly as common</a> in the US. Plants like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-apple-to-make-new-mac-pro-in-texas.html">Mac Pro factory in Austin</a> tend to focus on niche products that don't require large numbers of employees.</p><p>There's nonetheless pressure to get the TSMC factories up and running. Moves like this are not only expected to boost the US economy, but to diversify manufacturing away from China. The effort could address issues with labor conditions and limit problems if US-China relations deteriorate. They won't solve every issue (many components and raw materials also come from China), but they may reduce the fallout from political drama.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-supplier-tsmc-delays-arizona-chip-production-to-2025-153028238.html?src=rss

You should see the full discount at checkout. Normally, Apple sells this 9th-gen iPad for $329, though we've seen it retail closer to $275 on Amazon in recent months.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 9th-gen iPad is the budget pick in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">iPad buying guide</a> and earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">review score of 86</a> when it arrived in 2021. It's showing its age these days, as it still has a Lightning port, Home button, non-laminated display and thicker bezels than Apple's newer tablets. It doesn't work with Apple's latest Pencil stylus or iPad keyboards, either. That said, its aluminum frame doesn't feel cheap, it still gets a solid 10 or so hours of battery life, and its A13 Bionic chip remains fast enough for the essentials. Most importantly, it gives access to iPadOS at a much lower price than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html">10th-gen iPad</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">iPad Air</a>.

This is the fastest streaming stick in the Fire TV lineup and the only one to support WiFi 6. It works with just about all of the major streaming apps and HDR standards, and its remote comes with Alexa baked in.&nbsp;</p><p>Like all Fire TV Sticks, you'll get the most out of it if you regularly use Amazon services like Alexa or Prime Video, as Fire OS tends to prioritize the company's own apps and content.

For reference, Apple sells this model for $999, though it's gone for $800 for most of the last few months. This is another Apple device that's getting a bit long in the tooth, as it's saddled with a middling 720p webcam and a more dated design than newer MacBooks. Still, the M1 chip is powerful enough for most common tasks, and the notebook's comfortable keyboard, crisp display and excellent battery life keep it a strong value when it's discounted to this extent.&nbsp;</p><p>This config only includes 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though, so you won't want to push it too hard.

## Redditors troll an AI content farm into covering a fake 'WoW' feature

<p>Some redditors seem very excited about a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/"><em><ins>World of Warcraft</ins></em></a> feature called Glorbo, which some believe will &quot;make a huge impact on the game.&quot; Their palpable enthusiasm for Glorbo caught the attention of a blog named <em>The Portal</em>, which publishes &quot;gaming content powered by Z League,&quot; an app that aims to bring gamers together.&nbsp;</p><p>Just one problem: Glorbo isn't real. <em>The Portal</em> appears to be using AI to scrape <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/reddit/"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> posts and turn them into content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Redditor u/kaefer_kriegerin <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/154umm2/im_so_excited_they_finally_introduced_glorbo/"><ins>noticed</ins></a> that <em>The Portal</em> was seemingly turning discussions from some gaming subreddits into blog posts. They decided to try and trick the content farm into covering a fake <em>WoW </em>feature. The ruse was a success. Other redditors played along, as did some Blizzard developers, as <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/glorbo-isnt-coming-to-wow-but-the-impact-of-ai-is-already-here-334213"><em><ins>WoW Head</ins></em></a> notes.</p><div id="101ed4e47c5049b5a8a1a1bd6e1f45e2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Feels soooooo good to be able to talk about Glorbo finally, I remember my first day at Blizzard we were just starting to work on implementation, and that was almost 15 years ago!<br /><br />Excellent reporting to track this down👍 <a href="https://t.co/Wh1hm0gikM">pic.twitter.com/Wh1hm0gikM</a></p>— Zorbrix 💙 (@Zorbrix) <a href="https://twitter.com/Zorbrix/status/1682141040248233984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p><em>The Portal</em>'s now-deleted blog post even quoted u/kaefer_kriegerin as stating, &quot;Honestly, this new feature makes me so happy! I just really want some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this.&quot; You almost couldn't make this up. An <a href="https://archive.ph/4mOWr#selection-1077.197-1077.333"><ins>archived version</ins></a> of the post is still available.</p><p>There appears to be at least some level of human input on <em>The Portal</em>. The site added &quot;(Satire)&quot; to the headline of the post before eventually deleting it entirely. It also published an article based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/154zsbe/key_takeaways_why_does_blizzard_keep_taking_away/"><ins>another Reddit troll post</ins></a> about <em>WoW </em>taking away players' keys (which is not a thing that's happening). That blog post is also gone from <em>The Portal</em>.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Blizzard to find out whether it will address the hype for Glorbo and actually bring the feature to <em>WoW. </em>As it happens, Blizzard is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/arts/blizzard-diffusion-ai-video-games.html">reportedly using AI</a> to help create character outfits and concept art. We've also asked Z League for comment, and we'll let you know if it sends us a (presumably AI-generated) statement.</p><p>Given the rise of generative AI in recent months, we're likely to see a tidal wave of AI-generated guff appearing on websites, even including mainstream publications. Earlier this year, <em>CNET </em>had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html"><ins>correct dozens</ins></a> of AI-generated finance posts after errors were found. The site's staff has pushed back against <em>CNET</em>'s plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnets-new-guidelines-for-ai-journalism-met-with-union-pushback-152311269.html"><ins>keep using AI</ins></a> amid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/after-layoffs-and-an-ai-scandal-cnets-staff-are-unionizing-161508890.html"><ins>efforts to unionize</ins></a>. <em>Gizmodo </em>publisher G/O Media is also <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/18/23798164/gizmodo-ai-g-o-bot-stories-jalopnik-av-club-peter-kafka-media-column">forging ahead</a> with AI-generated blog posts, despite one that was widely mocked for getting a chronological list of Star Wars movies and TV shows <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/io9-ai-generated-star-wars-article-errors-1235662194/"><ins>very wrong</ins></a>. That and other AI-generated articles that appeared across the G/O network this month infuriated the company's human writers and editors.</p><p>Mistakes happen. Human writers can't get everything right all of the time. But any journalist worth their salt will strive to make sure their work is as accurate and fair as possible. Generative AI isn't exactly there yet. There have been many instances of AI chatbots <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html"><ins>surfacing misinformation</ins></a>.

## What we bought: Engadget’s favorite backpacks

<p>Most of us at Engadget haven’t been in school for some time, but we still appreciate a good backpack when we find one. We may have ditched textbooks a while back, but we still have a lot of gear to carry around. At minimum, most of us have to lug our laptops to and from meetings, while some of us have additional camera and video gear to schlep around town. So while our current backpacks don’t carry the same school gear that you might have, we’re confident that they can handle everything you need to bring with you to ace your classes.</p><h2>Timbuk2 Lane Commuter bag</h2><p></p><p>What’s green and portable and, oh hey wow, has a secret pouch in the bottom that holds a waterproof sleeve which I just right now discovered while writing this? Yeah, it’s this here <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9USU1CVUsyLUNvbW11dGVyLUxhcHRvcC1CYWNrcGFjay1CbGFjay9kcC9CMDg3SFFUN0tULz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xcW0tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjliODM3OWQ0LWNjY2UtNGFjYi1hNGVlLWQ1NmZkZTJmNDU0NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWYYKRHAtx_WO4STneDEvKlR28rKbmacRLN-m-8fDXrC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTIMBUK2-Commuter-Laptop-Backpack-Black%2Fdp%2FB087HQT7KT%2F">Timbuk2 Lane Commuter bag</a> that I’ve owned, but apparently never truly known, for the past 4 years. I bought it because it’s lightweight, comfortable to wear, could be expanded to accommodate oversized items, had a pair of exterior water bottle holders — one for soup, the other for more soup — and offered a generous number of pockets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Timbuk company has a well-earned reputation for quality construction. I still regularly carry their messenger bag a decade-plus after I bought it and this laptop bag is of parallel durability. Even after the rigors of a few CESes, the Timbuk has shown remarkably little evidence of wear and tear. The color hasn’t noticeably faded and the straps are still unfrayed. Nor is my laptop any worse for wear despite the bag’s rough-and-tumble travel. And while my bag was pretty well water resistant before, the discovery of this sheath is a handy additional layer of protection — not to mention a teaching moment about the importance of paying attention when unboxing new gear. <em>– Andrew Tarantola, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2>Baggallini Soho Backpack</h2><p></p><p>I had gone through a number of backpacks before receiving <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CYWdnYWxsaW5pLVdvbWVucy1Tb2hvLUJhY2twYWNrLUJsYWNrL2RwL0IwN044OFg4UkY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXFtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YjgzNzlkNC1jY2NlLTRhY2ItYTRlZS1kNTZmZGUyZjQ1NDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd_qUbcWNtBSk5AJ4XhUxJ_NUp7OdIBSGGmlqGhe2rYa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBaggallini-Womens-Soho-Backpack-Black%2Fdp%2FB07N88X8RF">this Baggallini bag</a> as a gift, and I can say that most of my previous daily carries can’t hold a candle to this one. It’s hard to find backpacks that are both durable and have some style that’s not strictly utilitarian. The Soho Backpacks fits the bill nicely with its water-resistant nylon fabric and taller doctor-bag profile. I can hold up to a 13-inch laptop in the interior padded sleeve and I like the healthy number of pockets the bag has. I most often use the front two pockets for quick-access things like my phone and keys, and pretty much every time I go out, both side pockets are filled with a water bottle and an umbrella. I also appreciate its luggage handle sleeve, which lets me rest my back a little bit while traveling.</p><p>While I’m glad I have this bag now to support me through all kinds of trips, I often think back on my college years and how useful it would have been to have then. I carried a lot of inadequate bags back then, and I’m pretty sure some of my back problems are a direct result of that. At least now I can prevent further injury by carrying this practical yet somewhat stylish backpack whenever necessary. <em>– Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>Peak Design 45L Travel Backpack</h2><p></p><p>I’m kind of a sucker when it comes to bags. I’ve enjoyed using Peak Design’s original Everyday Messenger for the past six years, but its size often felt a bit restrictive during longer trips. So last year I bought <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QZWFrLURlc2lnbi1UcmF2ZWwtQmFja3BhY2stQmxhY2svZHAvQjA3R0g0UEJXTS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXFtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YjgzNzlkNC1jY2NlLTRhY2ItYTRlZS1kNTZmZGUyZjQ1NDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASi-lY46xBH224yS1mk1_6Bk-K1qgaxLbmR4_HI0HY0q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPeak-Design-Travel-Backpack-Black%2Fdp%2FB07GH4PBWM%2F">Peak Design’s 45L Travel Backpack</a>, and it’s probably the best backpack I’ve ever owned. Just like the company’s other gear, you can tell a lot of thought went into making it. There’s a seemingly endless number of zippers, pockets, handles and loops smartly strewn across the bag, which makes it really easy to organize your gear or tie down bulkier equipment like a tripod. You can even transform it into a duffel by hiding its shoulder straps and hip belts behind cleverly placed flaps, while built-in compression snaps help slim it down for carry-on duty. And of course there are separate padded sleeves for tablets and up to a 16-inch laptop.</p><p>The only real downside is that it’s a bit large and sometimes wearing it makes me feel like a turtle. It’s a great backpack for hauling a bunch of gear and clothes around during a long weekend. Unfortunately, not long after I bought this thing, Peak came out with a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8747aed1-6586-46eb-856d-c95a5318901b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peak+Design&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NzQ3YWVkMS02NTg2LTQ2ZWItODU2ZC1jOTVhNTMxODkwMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVha2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdHJhdmVsLWJhY2twYWNrLTMwbC8_dmFyaWFudD0zOTU5OTg5NDcyNDY4NSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWI4Mzc5ZDQtY2NjZS00YWNiLWE0ZWUtZDU2ZmRlMmY0NTQ2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAblqLIJINgihAclyJFU-QTSf5FAHm9gawy74RlWQM8Gb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Ftravel-backpack-30l%2F%3Fvariant%3D39599894724685">less bulky 30L version</a>, and if I had to do it all over again, I’d probably go for the smaller one. <em>– Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2>Dagne Dover Dakota Backpack</h2><p></p><p>There are many reasons I love my <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c2bcb489-0cc4-42bc-b0c3-d7f6caad0094&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dagne+Dover&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjMmJjYjQ4OS0wY2M0LTQyYmMtYjBjMy1kN2Y2Y2FhZDAwOTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFnbmVkb3Zlci5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvdGhlLWRha290YS1iYWNrcGFjayNTdG9ybS1NZWRpdW0iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjliODM3OWQ0LWNjY2UtNGFjYi1hNGVlLWQ1NmZkZTJmNDU0NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATW66agR5SnmKgfowV-stIFr40Uck2YfPvzRAvRkPnov&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dagnedover.com%2Fcollections%2Fthe-dakota-backpack%23Storm-Medium">Dagne Dover Dakota backpack</a>, but the main one is that it has pockets. A lot of pockets. One big pocket on the front, three more on the other side of the front flap, two internal side pockets, two external side pockets, and two more pockets on the back. Oh, and there’s also a large padded laptop compartment that’s big enough to fit my 13-inch MacBook Pro (According to the company, it should fit most 13-inch laptops).</p><p>All of these pockets give me enough room to store a multitude of cables, external batteries, accessories, a water bottle and so much more. I especially love the two back ones as I can reach them easily while I’m wearing the backpack, making them ideal for essentials like my wallet, phone and travel documents.</p><p>The internal cavity is roomy as well. I’ve managed to fit in a large DSLR camera along with a giant telephoto lens. It’s great as a gym bag, too, as I can fit in an extra change of clothes and a pair of shoes. I love it for travel too. It holds so much stuff but it’s still compact enough to fit underneath the seat in front of me. In fact, the latest version of the Dakota even has a sleeve that fits perfectly over your luggage handle.</p><p>Plus, this thing is durable. It’s made of neoprene, a soft lightweight material that dries quickly if it gets wet. It’s also insulating and shock absorbent. I bought it back in 2017 and five years later, it’s still holding up. It doesn’t look quite as pristine as it did back then, but it’s just as functional. Sure, it’s rather pricey at $185, but for a bag that has lasted this long, it’s worth it. <em>– Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer</em></p><h2>Waterfield Staad Attaché bag</h2><p></p><p>I’ve been buying gear from Waterfield in San Francisco for almost 20 years, a rather startling amount of time. But their bags, laptop sleeves, gaming cases and everything else I’ve tried has been exceptionally well-made and smartly designed. I’ve picked up a number of their bags over the years, but the one that I keep coming back to is the <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/staad-attache-laptop-messenger-brief">Staad Attaché</a>, a waxed canvas (or ballistic nylon) messenger bag with a full-grain leather flap.</p><p>The thing that I like the most about it is that it can carry a lot of gear but it’s still fairly compact. It has two built-in sleeves for carrying a laptop and tablet, two deep hand pockets, a key fob, and a main compartment that’s big enough to carry headphones, books, a camera, or whatever else you deem most essential. There are also two external zippered pockets for anything you might need to get your hands on quickly. This bag is big enough for me to carry everything I need for a day or two, but small enough that I don’t overpack.</p><p>The Staad Attaché looks classy and understated on the outside, but the interior is a bright yellow. That might seem an unusual choice, but it makes it easier to see what’s inside than a dark liner. It’s a good example of the smart design decisions Waterfield makes. And, perhaps most importantly, this bag can take a beating. Waterfield products are expensive; the Staad Attaché starts at $289. But they’re the kind of product you buy once and can use for a lifetime. I’ve taken this bag on tons of work and personal trips and is still in perfect shape. The waxed canvas and leather have aged well over the years, and I expect I’ll be lugging this bag around for another decade, easy — unless I get tempted by another Waterfield option before then.<em> – Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-favorite-backpacks-for-school-work-travel-irl-150008300.html?src=rss

## The best portable Bluetooth speakers for 2023

<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned about today’s Bluetooth speakers, it’s that for general consumers, the options are pretty good. However, that doesn't make the process of sifting through the dozens of choices to find the best buy any easier. So I set out to test out some of the most popular models in different price points, from entry level to midrange to expensive. Most of the speakers I tried sounded good on first listen; it was only through side-by-side comparisons that I began to suss out the nuances among the best-sounding ones. Just reading the spec sheets only goes so far. As such, we’re focusing a bit more on audio quality and dynamic range, while also taking into consideration other factors like utility and price. Ultimately, there isn't one best portable Bluetooth speaker out there, but we've found plenty of good options that will fit a range of use cases and price points.</p><h2><strong>What to consider</strong></h2><h3>Weather-proofing</h3><p><a href="https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings">IP ratings</a> (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a product’s spec sheet that define the tested resistance of a product to both solid objects (dirt, dust, fingers?) and water. It’s usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water. The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dust tight). The waterproof rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets). When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasn’t tested for resistance. If it’s waterproof, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but there’s no guarantee.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers suitable for outdoor adventures. These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower. They’re also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs.</p><p>Additionally, speakers with ports <em>and</em> a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports. If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the product's rated ability to fend off the elements.</p><p>Consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision. It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if you’ll mostly be using it indoors, for instance.</p><h3>Battery life</h3><p>The focus of this guide is on portable Bluetooth speakers, and while “portable” can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet. These days, around 12 hours of runtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better.</p><p>That said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (“up to” x amount of hours). This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume. If you like your tunes loud, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more. Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected hours of battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated.</p><p>Additionally, if your Bluetooth speaker also happens to have WiFi connectivity, they're usually designed for always-on functionality. Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery. If you're out and about, you'll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>Bluetooth range is tricky business. Some companies list their product’s longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment. Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.x or 5.x. That’s likely underselling the speaker's potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and there’s little point in promising the moon only to get complaints.</p><p>I’ve seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment. I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range.</p><p>If you’re hosting a patio party and duck inside, it’s wise to have the source device remain close by just in case. It’s hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal. In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario.</p><h3>Latency</h3><p>This is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box. It’s annoying to find that your speaker’s latency isn’t low enough to avoid lip sync issues. Luckily, it seems that <em>most</em> speakers these days don’t often have these problems. Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues. Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard.</p><p>If you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth versions (4.x or 5.x) and lower latency codecs like aptX. Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor. To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input.</p><h2><strong>Price: $50 to $200</strong></h2><h3>Tribit StormBox Micro 2 ($60)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.3<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> N/A<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 70Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> No</p><p>If you’re just looking for a small speaker that can kick out some decent volume, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UcmliaXQtU3Rvcm1Cb3gtUG9ydGFibGUtU3BlYWtlci1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDlRNTkzMjFOLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1meC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWJkM2EwYmQtN2NhMS00NTRiLWI0Y2QtM2FmYTU1ZDUxODUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfuFzh0yGiZ9XlC2zXyydFGwoNIdOpGopFvwCXvWnSvl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTribit-StormBox-Portable-Speaker-Built%2Fdp%2FB09Q59321N%2F">Tribit StormBox Micro 2</a> fits the bill. The audio quality here is fine; it doesn’t stand out in terms of fidelity, but the volume you get from this affordable little speaker is what makes it a good choice. If you’re bopping about outdoors on your bike or chilling in the park, it’s usually more about portability and volume anyway. The rubbery rear strap works well on relatively thin things like belts, backpacks and bike handlebars.</p><p>While it’s small and affordable, the speaker doubles as a USB-C powerbank to charge your devices in a pinch and you can wirelessly connect two of them for party mode or stereo sound.

With an IP67 rating on top of the company’s five-foot drop test durability, it can go with you almost anywhere and survive to tell the tale.</p><p>The audio quality is punchy and bright enough for what you’d expect at this scale and price range. Although there’s no app support or connectivity with the rest of the Ultimate Ears speaker lineup, you can easily pair it with a second Wonderboom for stereo sound.

It may not be the loudest in its size range, but it focuses more on balanced output than raw power. There’s still 360 sound as well, making it a good companion for small get togethers. Although, with its 60hz low end threshold, you’ll find a better bass response when there are surfaces to reflect off of, and not so much if it’s in the middle of a table.</p><p>This new model now offers up to 30 hours of listening on a charge (10 hours better than before) and  a more rugged IP67 rating. There’s also a new ability to pair with another Emberton II or Willen II using the new “Stack Mode”.

The other output port is a single RCA for mono analog subwoofer support, although it does well in the bass category on its own.

If you don’t need a speaker that’s built for rugged on-the-go action, this speaker offers its own flex, with great sound quality, Bluetooth and plenty of hard-wired connections.</p><h3>Marshall Middleton ($300)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.1<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> 20+ Hours (At low/mid volume)<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br /><strong>Aux inputs: </strong>3.5mm<br /><strong>Frequency range: </strong>50Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>Marshall launched the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NYXJzaGFsbC1NaWRkbGV0b24tUG9ydGFibGUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLVNwZWFrZXIvZHAvQjBCVEhMNjczVj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1meC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWJkM2EwYmQtN2NhMS00NTRiLWI0Y2QtM2FmYTU1ZDUxODUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf3qHuNVn2CHgmOB2oJcq0LYYqF1nnRCSnrqUWTG60qD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMarshall-Middleton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker%2Fdp%2FB0BTHL673V">Middleton</a> in January 2023 and positioned it as the new flagship for its portable Bluetooth speaker line. It’s the largest of the company's IP67 rugged portables (measuring 4.3 x 9 x 3.75 inches) and offers a significantly louder output, with 50-watts of 360-degree sound. There are dual woofers and tweeters for the front and back, with passive radiators along each side. It also offers Stack Mode, which lets you pair with any other Middleton, Emberton II or Willen speakers nearby to expand your listening experience.</p><p>The Middleton can be managed through the Marshall Bluetooth app, but it also includes most of those same controls on the top. There’s a Bluetooth button (which doubles as the Stack Mode control) and a multi-use joystick for power on/off, volume control and track selection (forward or back). You also get bass and treble controls, which are a welcome addition and a first for one of Marshall’s speakers without physical knobs.</p><p>It has that traditional Marshall look, made with a soft-touch exterior composed of 55-percent post-consumer recycled plastic and is 100-percent PVC free. It also has a carry strap you can easily fit your hand through. Any dust, dirt or prints on the outside can be scrubbed off with a damp cloth, and even the exposed USB-C and 3.5mm input port components are waterproofed. That USB-C port can be used to recharge the speaker, or power up your other devices with its 9,600mAh battery.</p><p>Of course audio purists should know that it only supports SBC, but the sound quality is still top notch for most people. And while Marshall devices are usually priced at a slight premium, the good sound quality and decent low-end capability definitely makes this model worth checking out.</p><h3>Bose Portable Smart ($399)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 4.2<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX4<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> N/A<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> Undisclosed<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>We did test a couple smart home speakers, including the<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3NlLVBvcnRhYmxlLUhvbWUtU3BlYWtlci1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDdWRktCUTNLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZ4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxYmQzYTBiZC03Y2ExLTQ1NGItYjRjZC0zYWZhNTVkNTE4NTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR5ALZbpYaC4AOp4lI6p_XG55SUdOzf-03xSMHu1OgKq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBose-Portable-Home-Speaker-Built%2Fdp%2FB07VFKBQ3K"> Bose Portable Smart</a> and I decided to compare it with its closest Bluetooth equivalent: the<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da41807c-aae5-49ff-b905-2c3f70122c64&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bose&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYTQxODA3Yy1hYWU1LTQ5ZmYtYjkwNS0yYzNmNzAxMjJjNjQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zZS5jb20vZW5fdXMvcHJvZHVjdHMvc3BlYWtlcnMvcG9ydGFibGVfc3BlYWtlcnMvc291bmRsaW5rLXJldm9sdmUtcGx1cy1paS5odG1sI3Y9c291bmRsaW5rX3Jldm9sdmVfcGx1c19paV9ibGFjayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWJkM2EwYmQtN2NhMS00NTRiLWI0Y2QtM2FmYTU1ZDUxODUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYi8Wdc-VM5yAKhYsMCkvQaxH9KvZ_rmY9OifQqO1KH2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink-revolve-plus-ii.html%23v%3Dsoundlink_revolve_plus_ii_black"> Revolve+ II</a>. While that’s best suited for portability, has a loud bright sound that will carry outdoors and long battery life, its low end is a little less pronounced than its smart companion. If you’re willing to spend more and appreciate bass, the Bose Portable Smart speaker is a big improvement. It has a well-rounded low end and a bright dynamic sound with plenty of nuance that makes for a great listening experience.</p><p>This 360-degree portable comes as a combo WiFi/Bluetooth speaker primarily geared toward smart home use with the occasional outing. It’s rated IPX4, so not the most weatherproof, but good for casual outdoor listening. The battery is rated for up to 12 hours, but since this is an always-on smart device, you’ll need to be more attentive at keeping it topped up. There’s a charging dock accessory for use around the house, but as an away-from-home portable, you should power it down when not in use.</p><p><strong>Smart features:</strong> WiFi, voice and app control, support for Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Spotify Connect, Amazon Music, Chromecast (built-in), Apple AirPlay 2 and SimpleSync connectivity with Bose Bluetooth speakers.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Some users running Android 12 may encounter connectivity issues with the Bose Connect app. The company is working to resolve the problem.</p><h3>JBL Xtreme 3 ($380)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.1<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 15 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 53.5Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>If you’ve enjoyed any of the smaller JBL speakers out there and are willing to spend a bit more, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KQkwtWHRyZW1lLVdhdGVycHJvb2YtUGFydHlCb29zdC1NdWx0aS1zcGVha2VyL2RwL0IwOE5MQ1c5V1k_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbSd24wUYMtVJFfKWfNA6GoyDdlyUcp8D8yAj5Zy51rT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJBL-Xtreme-Waterproof-PartyBoost-Multi-speaker%2Fdp%2FB08NLCW9WY">Xtreme 3</a> is a good all-around choice. It’s big enough to warrant a shoulder strap, but still only about the size of a football. There’s a pleasant dynamic sound here with hefty lows and a lively high end that seems slightly better balanced at this size than the smaller options from JBL in this range.</p><p>This is easily a favorite if you want something under $400 with a little more gusto than your average portable, but still being IP67 weatherproof. It has enough output to breathe life into a small soiree or backyard hang, although while it’s quite loud, it’s best when it’s close by or indoors where the bass can resonate to its fullest.</p><h3>UE Hyperboom ($400)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 24 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX4<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm, Optical<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 45Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9VbHRpbWF0ZS1FYXJzLUhZUEVSQk9PTS1CbHVldG9vdGgtUmVzaXN0YW50L2RwL0IwN1hKOEI5TlY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcNPWM_l7hxPWF-aYRZXZ91RJxfAs4e8ofyC7kxRbG7Z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUltimate-Ears-HYPERBOOM-Bluetooth-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB07XJ8B9NV">UE Hyperboom</a> is an all-arounder with good looks, portability, plenty of connectivity options and a loud and punchy (albeit compressed) output. The technical fabric exterior (which now includes a white option) lets it live among your furniture without screaming “party box,” while the optical input offers a possible TV speaker alternative. The large capacitive buttons on top let anyone adjust the volume, pause or play the music and select from two concurrent Bluetooth connections or a hardwired input (3.5mm or optical). On the edge with the silicone carrying handle there are the wired ports, plus one for charging USB devices and another for power. You can expect to get up to 24 hours of battery life, and the Hyperboom is good at holding a charge on standby.</p><p>This capable and loud (roughly 100dB) speaker will please most people as long as the party is of primary concern over fidelity. The ability to remotely power your device on or off using the UE app is also a welcome feature. Plus you can easily expand the sound to other Ultimate Ears Boom speakers (except Wonderboom) using the PartyUp feature. The IPX4 rating means a few spilled drinks won’t hassle it, but it’s not the best Bluetooth speaker choice for all-weather adventures.</p><h3>Marshall Tufton ($400)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 20 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX2<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 40Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> No</p><p>If you didn’t know about Marshall’s history in amplifiers and rock music, the design should clue you in.

It has physical knobs at the top and a carry strap to help move it about. While it may appear as rugged as concert gear, it’s less impervious to the elements as some with just an IPX2 rating, so it’s protected from light splashes from above.</p><p>Whether or not you’re a fan of the brand, the rich and distinctly thumping output may make you one. We felt pulled into the sound while listening to the Tufton, a bit more than most other speakers we tested at this scale. It’s dynamic, warm and, dare we say, analog in its audio presence. It’s also multi-directional with a supplemental driver on the back along with a bass port.</p><p>There’s no app to adjust the EQ, just the physical controls including a Bluetooth connect button, a power/volume knob and two for bass and treble. Once powered on, you can use the volume knob to set a max headroom and adjust volume on the fly from your source. The bass and treble knobs help you choose the tone of your adventure, from a purely flat soundscape to an enhanced one. We just wish you could see the dial indicators in the dark. Other features include aptX support and quick-charge capabilities that provide four hours of listening time in just 20 minutes, plus great standby battery life.</p><h2><strong>Price: $450 and higher</strong></h2><h3>JBL Boombox 3 ($500)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.3<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 24 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX7<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 40Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>If you’re a fan of JBL’s smaller portables, but want to kick the volume up several degrees higher, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVlEUzhCSEs_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZpZJ5RN0EU4dauV-xJCkqxuAuWxZlqA1jluZeUyCyf5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09YDS8BHK">Boombox 3</a> is a good choice. This 160-watt-plus big brother to the Xtreme 3 provides that familiar JBL sound but, you know, louder. The output has bright and dynamic highs and floor shaking sub-bass that may benefit more from an indoor environment with surfaces to bounce off. It doesn’t have the long throw that “loudspeakers” have, although to be clear, it is pretty loud. This is a dance party tool for your basement rumpus room, garage hangout, beach or poolside craziness.</p><p>The Boombox 3 has a few upgrades from the previous gen. The exterior looks mostly the same, but it’s now IP67 rated making it very rugged. It’s also a touch heavier at 14.7 pounds, possibly since this device now has a woofer alongside the mids and tweeters.</p><p>It’s still a convenient grab-and-go speaker for most occasions when you want the music to be the star of the show (or at least not disappear into the background). The battery can keep you playing for up to 24 hours, but it also runs at full volume while plugged in. In fact, while it’s connected to an outlet, the total output wattage gets a boost from 160 watts to 180 watts.</p><h3>Sony SRS-XP700 (~$398)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 20 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX4<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm, USB thumb drive listening, Guitar, Mic<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> N/A<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>Sony’s big <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVBvcnRhYmxlLUJsdWV0b290aC1LYXJhb2tlLVBhcnR5LVNwZWFrZXItU3BsYXNoLVJlc2lzdGFudC1Ib3VyLUJhdHRlcnkvZHAvQjA5NFQ5OVY2Mz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1meC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWJkM2EwYmQtN2NhMS00NTRiLWI0Y2QtM2FmYTU1ZDUxODUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdy6iMeOziUFDec3PsldvU2pdcJfYoVrxHmthKZk8dHR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Portable-Bluetooth-Karaoke-Party-Speaker-Splash-Resistant-Hour-Battery%2Fdp%2FB094T99V63">SRS-XP700 Bluetooth speaker</a> is a good party speaker for fans of loud, thumping beats. The unit has the look of a futuristic stereo speaker at 2.25 feet tall and about 37 pounds, with pleasing lighting effects on the inside of both top and bottom grab bars. You’ll also find USB charging ports and LDAC support, while the app offers customization including light controls.</p><p>The XP700 remains portable enough for many people to shuffle around locally without <em>too</em> much effort and its IPX4 rating means it can handle spills and splashes. The exterior is hard plastic with some rubberized feet, but it’s not the type of speaker you want to treat carelessly. It’s mostly a homebody that can fire up parties in lofts, garages, basements or backyards. You can also wirelessly pair two for a more powerful experience.</p><p>While the sound is big and bassy, it comes up short on handling the lowest registers well. Also, the high end isn’t as pronounced as it could be, so it may not be for everyone. It’s more of a loudspeaker style, so it's better in bigger rooms and shines at louder volumes.</p><h3>Soundboks Go ($699)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br /><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 40 hours<br /><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP65<br /><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br /><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 40Hz - 20kHz<br /><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVlSTVJHS1Y_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVR6IRJRQbNa62mA9zIUHt7c2_oKphMrHKHo9U5-R4d1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09YRMRGKV">Soundboks Go</a> is a top performer if you’re looking for a portable Bluetooth option that provides a big sound for larger spaces, although it comes at a price. This unpretentious black rectangle is half the size of its more professional sibling the Soundboks Gen 3. It packs one 10-inch woofer and a 1-inch domed tweeter, both powered by two 72W RMS amps for massive sound and chunky bass, even at a distance.</p><p>At 20 pounds, this party speaker is fairly easy to lug around and looks about the size of carry-on luggage. You can even get the optional shoulder strap, which helps for longer missions. It has a flexible TPE handle on top, silicone bumpers around the edges and ABS+Polycarbonate exterior and grill. The IP65 rating also marks it as a resilient device in most environments.</p><p>The sound makes a big statement here. Output levels are rated at up to 121dB, with clear mids and highs projecting clearly across large areas. The low end also has a significant presence at a distance, matching up with 40Hz frequency response. It's definitely capable enough to support large gatherings.</p><p>The speaker is easy to connect to via Bluetooth and the partner app offers EQ customization, audio profiles and OTA firmware updates. There’s a solitary 3.5mm stereo input on the Go, but its wireless expansion shines, letting you connect up to five Soundboks Gen 3 or Go speakers at the touch of a button with its built-in SKAA wireless support.</p><p>Lastly, the battery pack is removable, swappable and also long-lasting for a speaker this size; at low to mid volume, it’s rated at up to 40 hours runtime. For transparency, Soundboks also lets you know to expect around 10 hours of play at full volume. You <em>can</em> also run this while charging, but there are strict warnings about keeping the volume low while doing so (it’s not recommended unless you're desperate).</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How does a Bluetooth speaker work?</h3><p>Bluetooth technology lets devices connect and exchange data over short distances using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves. It’s the frequency range that’s carved out for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, called the 2.4GHz ISM spectrum band. This range is available worldwide, making it easy for companies to use with devices for global markets.</p><p>Bluetooth speakers include this tech, which lets them communicate with source devices like smartphones, tablets or computers in order to exchange data. The two devices pair by sharing a unique code and will work within the proscribed range for the device and Bluetooth version.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since Bluetooth 4.0 was released over a decade ago, new iterations usually improve on range, use less power and offer expanded connectivity with features like multipoint (allowing more than one device to be connected at the same time, for instance).</p><h3>Who should buy a Portable Bluetooth speaker?</h3><p>If you want to play music while you’re out-and-about on something other than headphones, a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably what you want. There’s a broad range of devices for all types of circumstances. Many adventurous people will want a relatively lightweight portable that’s rugged enough to handle the elements while also packing enough charge to play for hours on end. Others may simply need a speaker they can move around the house or use in the backyard. In this case, you can choose larger less rugged models that may offer better sound.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: What to expect at Samsung’s Unpacked 2023 event next week

<p>As competition finally starts to figure out foldables, Samsung’s ready to prove it can still deliver them best. Its next Unpacked event is teasing a new generation of foldable phones, flanked by smartwatches and tablets. Here's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-samsung-unpacked-2023-what-to-expect-on-july-26th-150001571.html">what we're expecting.</a></p><p>While it hasn’t named the new hardware, the company is expected to reveal the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5. This year, though, the priorities are inverted. Where the book-style Fold is usually the main attraction, this year the Flip clamshell might get the most attention, with a substantially expanded front screen to go up against competition like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html#:~:text=The%20Moto%20Razr%2B%2C%20a%20foldable,widgets%20that%20you%20can%20use."><ins>Motorola’s Razr+</ins></a>. Both the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 may adopt a “waterdrop” hinge, which narrows the gap while closed. Why should we care? It’ll be a slimmer foldable and have a smaller gap when the device is closed.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-samsung-unpacked-2023-what-to-expect-on-july-26th-150001571.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/dd68c010-27a9-11ee-96dd-8d435a09fb78" style="height: 450px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnLeaks</div></figure></a><p>Wearable-wise, the company has not-so-subtly hinted the Galaxy Watch 6 will appear at Unpacked, and reports even hint at a Classic or Pro version to bring back the physical rotating bezel.

The first time Mitnick infiltrated a computer system was way back in 1979, but he wasn't convicted until 1988 when he was sentenced to 12 months in prison for copying a company's software. He broke into Pacific Bell's voicemail computers when he was under supervised release and continued to hack into cell networks, as well as company and government websites, as a fugitive in the ‘90s.</p><p>Mitnick was also involved in the theft of thousands of files and credit card numbers, but his obituary says he &quot;never took one dime from any of his 'victims.' Mitnick eventually ended up spending five years in prison, which he described as a &quot;vacation&quot; by the time he was freed. From there, he changed the course of his career and became a White Hat hacker and cybersecurity consultant.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/kevin-mitnick-formerly-the-worlds-most-wanted-hacker-has-passed-away-084912966.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-quietly-goes-up-in-price-to-14-per-month-100531473.html https://www.engadget.com/...">YouTube Premium quietly goes up to $14 per month</a></h2><h3>That's a significant $2 increase with no official announcement.</h3><h3></h3><p>I hinted at this yesterday, but here are the finer details.

<p>Telegram's new Stories feature is here as promised, but it's only available to Premium users for now, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1682243318074228737">said in a Tweet</a>. Last month, CEO Pavel Durov <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-stories-with-customizable-expiration-times-are-coming-next-month-113535087.html">revealed the upcoming feature</a> that offers more granular control than Stories on other apps, letting you select who can see them and how often they last before disappearing. Multiple users on Twitter reported seeing the new feature as well.</p><p>Telegram's Stories resembles the same feature on Facebook's Messenger, showing up as expandable bubbles at the top of the conversation list. Users can choose to make them viewable to the public, along with a range of other options: contacts only (with exceptions), selected contacts or Close Friends. You can add captions and links and tag others as well. Users can also share photos and videos captured by the front-facing and the rear cameras simultaneously, similar to posts found on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bereal-says-it-has-more-than-20-million-daily-active-users-172721921.html">BeReal</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5ac3fa04c60e4aee92d20cdbf00151dd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Telegram Stories 😎<a href="https://twitter.com/telegram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@telegram</a><a href="https://twitter.com/telegram_it?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@telegram_it</a><a href="https://t.co/B4H8pstS9J">pic.twitter.com/B4H8pstS9J</a></p>— Alessandro Antonucci (@techworldaleant) <a href="https://twitter.com/techworldaleant/status/1682135930117709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>If you don't want to see posts from a certain contact, you can move them to the "Hidden" list in their contacts section.

<p>Students at 68 colleges and universities across the US will easily be able to use their Samsung phones to tap for access and purchases. Samsung's Wallet app now <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc2Ftc3VuZy13YWxsZXQtYWRkcy1zdXBwb3J0LXVuaXZlcnNpdHktc3R1ZGVudC1pZC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc4NjBkNWQ1LTNmOTYtNDY4MC1iNTdlLWZlNGQ5Y2JjYjEwOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATbQh_E2GuYH-povxgLdBGhd6DXgz7YJ5htkaD76eYMS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsamsung-wallet-adds-support-university-student-id%2F">supports digital student IDs</a>, so long as it's on the United States versions of the brand's latest devices.

Google Pay also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-google-pay-school-ids.html">launched</a> student ID integration in 2020 in partnership with a company called Transact, which offers solutions for tuition and other student expense payment. That's the same company Samsung has teamed up with to enable this integration, which means users will have to download the Transact eAccounts mobile app from Google Play, as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like other digital student ID integrations, Samsung Wallet allows students to access school facilities with their phone. The app's Fast Mode feature will let users tap their phone without having to unlock their screen, while Power Reserve means they can use their digital ID even if their phone has switched off due to low battery reserves. That said, the capability to pay using NFC at on-campus stores and vending machines aren't available at all of the participating institutions.</p><p>At the moment, students can only use Samsung Wallet's digital ID support if they have a Galaxy S20 phone or later, a Note 20, a Galaxy Flip or Fold device, or a Galaxy A53. Galaxy Watch support is coming this fall. Samsung also says that it's working to expand the offering and make it available for students in more institutions.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-wallet-gets-digital-school-id-support-for-campuses-across-the-us-064807761.html?src=rss

<p><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em> will be available on PlayStation 5 in just three months, but you won't have to wait that long to learn more about the game's plot. In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/20/marvels-spider-man-2-new-story-trailer/">new story trailer</a> revealed at San Diego Comic Con, Sony and Insomniac give us our first look at how Peter Parker might find himself joined with the Venom symbiote.</p><div id="82fe320fcff74500afdb651d284531a7"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The trailer is laden with dramatic tension. Peter's best friend Harry Osborne wants to enlist his help to &quot;heal the world.&quot; Meanwhile, Spider-man has his hands full with Kraven the Hunter — and as the trailer presses on, a voice over emerges to describe a distressed Peter Parker presumably <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-look-at-spider-man-2-gameplay-shows-spidey-in-the-venom-suit-212740681.html">losing himself to the Venom symbiote</a> and in desperate need of the help of his co-Spider-Man, Miles Morales. The story teaser leaves us with an image of a bulked-up Venom terrorizing the city and the open question of who the symbiote has merged with.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to the intense story trailer, Sony has announced a special edition Spider-Man 2 PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller combo — both featuring the dark tendrils of the Venom symbiote crawling over the red colors of Spider-Man's costume.

Sony says the controller and PS5 console covers in the special edition will also be available to purchase on PlayStation Direct on September 1st.</p><p>Marvel's Spider-Man <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spider-man-2-launches-on-october-20th-203245436.html">will be available on October 20, 2023</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-spider-man-2-story-trailer-teases-more-venom-more-villains-and-more-drama-040056520.html?src=rss
