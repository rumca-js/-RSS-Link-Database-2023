Where has China's Foreign Minister gone? It has become a global manhunt, with all major mainstream media tracking him down. The foreign minister was last seen in public on June 25, this year. He then disappeared from the public eye, missing several major events during the peak diplomatic season. 
Previously, the official response was that Qin Gang couldn’t attend the ASEAN meeting for "health reasons." However, no one believes it now. Rumors about why Qin disappeared abound. One of the most widespread rumors is that he fell into an extramarital affair with Hong Kong's Phoenix TV host Fu Xiaotian and had an illegitimate child, thus falling into the trap of a double agent.
