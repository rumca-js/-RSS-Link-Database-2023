She was also fired by Lowes. Donna was hanging on to the other end of the shopping cart full of merchandise the thugs were trying to steal, so they punched her in the face. Repeatedly. Lowes fired her over their \"zero tolerance\" policy because, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/circle-k-shoplifter-lawsuit-knife\" target=\"_blank\">like what feels like</a> most <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/circle-k-shoplifter-lawsuit-knife\" target=\"_blank\">corporate chains in this country</a>, they care more about criminals than they do people.</p><p>Donna was in tears when she talked to the press. She loved her job, her customers, and the people she worked with. Lowes,  a publicly-traded company <a href=\"https://www.aisleofshame.com/is-lowes-owned-by-walmart\" target=\"_blank\">where The Vanguard Group the majority shareholder</a>, doesn't care.

If you are defending a small, independently owned business, that's one thing and encouraged. But time and again, these companies have made it clear they don't care about you. Start caring less about them.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

I can't just be outside and just running a f*cking business without getting punched in the godd*mn face.</blockquote><p>He went on to say the city shouldn't be like that. And he's right. No city should be like that. But you get the city you vote for. Case-in-point, many of you reading this live in real America. You can run and patronizes business without having to step over puddles of urine.</p><p>I will be fair to San Franciscans somewhat. There are signs they are getting fed up, and I don't mean <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-vigilante\" target=\"_blank\">the costumed vigilante Boots</a>. Over the past year, voters have recalled <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-recalled-san-francisco\" target=\"_blank\">a school board</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chesa-boudlin-lashes-out\" target=\"_blank\">their District Attorney</a> because they had gone too woke even by San Francisco standards. Though instead of acknowledging the pushback, in both cases the influence of Republican billionaires was blamed for the recalls. Yes. Republican influence... in San Francisco. Nothing is EVER the fault of progressive policies.</p><p>The rub is the same voters then elect people who are every bit as bad. People like San Francisco mayor London Breed who, instead of acknowledging the problems, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-desantis-mayor-responds\" target=\"_blank\">lashes out at people who acknowledge the problems and would rather focus on climate change and artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>It doesn't have to be like this in American cities. People who live there have to want to do something about it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

The one where six years later, we still don't know who did it. There are people in America who see tragedies like that and don't want their government to further make it more difficult for them to defend themselves. Especially a government that still hasn't found the guy who did it. And then there are people like Shannon Watts who are all over the media, vote for progressives, and wonder why their cities aren't safe.</p><p>But none of this touches on the most ridiculous part of Gun Control Karen bragging about how she got the video pulled from CMT.</p><p>Who the f*ck watches videos on television anymore? </p><p>People watch videos on YouTube.
