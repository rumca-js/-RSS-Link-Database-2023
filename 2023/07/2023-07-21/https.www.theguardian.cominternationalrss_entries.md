<p>Videos shared on social media showed hailstorms hitting the regions of Lombardy and Veneto in northern Italy as the country recovers from its third heatwave of the year. Footage published on Friday showed a stream of icy water flooding the streets of Seregno in Lombardy hours after hail battered the area. The governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, declared a state of emergency on Thursday after more than 110 people were injured by extreme weather. Near-record temperatures are beginning to ease across Italy, but forecasters have warned a fourth heatwave could hit southern Europe next week.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/20/extreme-weather-continues-across-europe-as-more-hot-weather-looms">Extreme weather continues across Europe as further heatwave looms</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/21/weather-tracker-records-fall-europe-heatwave-wildfires-hailstones-philippines-typhoon">Weather tracker: records fall but worst of Europe’s heatwave may yet to come</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jul/21/hailstorms-pummel-northern-italy-after-days-of-extreme-heat-video-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Simon McBurney narrates the tale of how a sexual relationship between a teenage boy and his piano teacher changes the course of his life</p><p>A vivid and detailed exploration of childhood trauma and tumultuous world events, Lessons, Ian McEwan’s 17th novel, spans the life of Roland Baines, who comes from an emotionally withdrawn army family and is sent to boarding school at the age of 11. There he meets a strict piano teacher, Miriam Cornell, who, when Roland hits a wrong note, reaches under his shorts and pinches his leg. Three years later, Miriam lures the 14-year-old Roland into a sexual relationship that ends up derailing his life. He tries and mostly fails at various professions, including photographer, poet, tennis coach and hotel pianist, gets married and has a baby. But after his German-born wife decides that motherhood is not part of her destiny, he is left to raise their son alone.</p><p>The book goes on to track Roland into old age, with much of his life mirroring the author’s own (including a childhood in Libya and the discovery of a brother who was adopted at birth) and pausing at momentous historical moments, from the Cuban missile crisis and the fall of the Berlin Wall to Chornobyl, 9/11 and the Covid pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/21/lessons-by-ian-mcewan-review-chance-memory-and-the-road-not-taken">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Austral by Carlos Fonseca; Whites Can Dance Too by Kalaf Epalanga; The Incredible Events in Women’s Cell Number 3 by Kira Yarmysh; You, Bleeding Childhood by Michele Mari; The Love of Singular Men by Victor Heringer</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/austral-9781529422603?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Austral</a> by Carlos Fonseca, translated by Megan McDowell (MacLehose, £20)</strong><strong><br /></strong>If a book-within-a-book isn’t ambitious enough for you, Costa Rican writer Carlos Fonseca has just the thing: two books within a book. US university lecturer Julio remembers British Aliza (“who swore she had kissed Sid Vicious”), whom he knew decades earlier. A letter tells him that Aliza, the author of four novels, is dead, and wanted him to edit her final manuscript, a “novel or memoir (that will be for you to determine)”. The manuscript, A Private Language – a story of the failed “New Germany” in Paraguay co-founded by Nietzsche’s sister – is accompanied by Aliza’s notebook, Dictionary of Loss, featuring collage images representing expression that words cannot achieve. (A photo of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/18/private-notebooks-1914-1916-by-ludwig-wittgenstein-review-sex-and-logic">Wittgenstein</a> shows “the tired eyes of a person who has spent his life chasing an idea to its logical conclusion”.) Aliza’s work was intended for only one person, but Fonseca’s novel – chewy but not clotted, expansive and thought-provoking – should have wider appeal.</p><p><br /><strong><a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/whites-can-dance-too-9780571371426?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Whites Can Dance Too</a> by Kalaf Epalanga, translated by Daniel Hahn (Faber, £16.99)</strong><strong><br /></strong>When the then Portugal-based Angolan musician Kalaf Epalanga was touring northern Europe in 2008, he lost his passport and was detained at the Sweden-Norway border. The incident inspired Epalanga’s satisfying debut novel, in which the narrative about the power of music and dance fizzes with energy, even if you don’t know your baile funk from your electroclash from your Angolan kuduro. Epalanga’s wry account of immigrant life in Portugal (“Frying chicken teriyaki for four euro an hour gave me a very real perspective on Europe”) is tempered with memories of the civil war and colonialism that brought him there. But what expands the novel beyond memoir are the second and third parts, from the viewpoints of Sofia – Epalanga’s wife back in Portugal – and Eyvind, a member of the Norwegian immigration police, whose story (“Why is arresting famous people always so complicated?”) is at once chilling and enthralling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/21/the-best-recent-translated-fiction-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>
