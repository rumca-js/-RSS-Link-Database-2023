<p>Microsoft is moving several significant features into its latest Windows 11 Insider Beta Channel release today, a sign that it&rsquo;s committed to updates like RGB lighting controls, an updated File Explorer, and a subtle but nifty improvement in inking.</p>



<p>Microsoft released Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22621.2050 and Build 22631.2050 to the Windows Insider Beta Channel today. Shipping them to users in the Beta Channel has historically been the first official signal that Microsoft has signed off on the features to eventually ship them. (The &ldquo;631&rdquo; build includes all of the features for testing, while the other holds some back.)</p>



<p>The &ldquo;new&rdquo; features may seem familiar, especially if you&rsquo;ve been following releases in the experimental Canary or Dev Channels, where Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t always bring new features to market if they test poorly. Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t said when these new features would be available, but with mentions of &ldquo;23H2&rdquo; already bubbling up, it seems likely that they&rsquo;ll appear in September or October.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at what Microsoft is promising:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-new-modernized-file-explorer">A (new) modernized File Explorer</h2>



<p>Microsoft has revamped the File Explorer app previously&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1071395/heres-what-microsoft-plans-for-windows-11-22h2s-first-update.html">adding tabs</a>, a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1530047/a-pizza-icon-debuts-today-in-windows-file-explorer.html">pizza icon</a>, better visibility into available OneDrive storage, and deeper insights into file previews in the preview page. It&rsquo;s heading further down this path, in part because the new WinUI framework allows additional customization, Microsoft says.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 23H2 File Explorer" class="wp-image-2004449" height="716" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/File-Explorer-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An attractive carousel view will greet you on the File Explorer home view.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>File Explorer will show Recommended files in a carousel view from the Home view. You&rsquo;ll also see your OneDrive status integrated into File Explorer, and any cloud folders will be better integrated into Windows. Finally, the Details pane in File Explorer (<strong>Alt+Shift+P</strong>) will even show you related content and show recent activity on a file if it&rsquo;s been shared and/or modified.</p>



<p>Specifically, when a user selects a file in File Explorer and enables the pane, a modern pane will display contextual information about the file including file thumbnail, share status and button, file activity, related files and e-mails, and other information, Microsoft <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/07/21/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22621-2050-and-22631-2050/&amp;xcust=2-1-2004412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="passkey-management">Passkey management</h2>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1969610/windows-hello-gets-new-passkey-powers.html">Microsoft began building in passkey support</a> within its Windows Insider Dev Channel. Passkeys replaces passwords on sites like BestBuy.com with the biometrics on your PC or phone&mdash;if a Web site like Amazon adds passkey support for the Web, you won&rsquo;t need to enter (or remember) your password. Instead, you&rsquo;ll use Windows Hello. </p>



<p>Microsoft is adding a Settings page (<em>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Passkeys</em>) where you can manage all of the passkeys for sites you&rsquo;ve visited. </p>



<p>This is a fantastic step forward for ease of use, but it will need industry support to move further ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unsafe-password-warnings">Unsafe password warnings</h2>



<p>If you <em>do</em> use passwords, though, as we all do, Microsoft is also warning you not to copy your password using cut and paste. Microsoft is adding a feature to Windows Security under App &amp; browser control &gt; Reputation-based protection &gt; Phishing protection to warn you on the unsafe habit of copying a password via copy and paste.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 23H2 password reuse" class="wp-image-2004444" height="298" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Unsafe-password.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="604" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dynamic-lighting-gets-a-stamp-of-approval">Dynamic Lighting gets a stamp of approval</h2>



<p>Given that Microsoft has already chosen to work with several PC accessories companies that include RGB, it seemed inevitable that the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html">overarching controls for PC RGB lighting, known as Dynamic Lighting</a>, would appear in Windows. Normally, vendors often provide their own RGB lighting control software. Third-party apps also try and provide umbrella access. </p>



<p>Microsoft decided to bring it all within Windows, so you can make your PC as sparkly as possible. A new Dynamic Lighting settings page will provide a one-stop shop for all of these controls.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 23H2 dynamic lighting" class="wp-image-2004445" height="729" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dynamic-Lighting-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">You&rsquo;ll be able to manage RGB accessories from within Windows with Dynamic Lighting.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>While Microsoft maintains an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/components&amp;xcust=2-1-2004412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">up-to-date list of hardware compatible with Dynamic Lighting</a>, at press time it was still dominated by Razer hardware.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="direct-inking">Direct Inking</h2>



<p>Inking finally works like you&rsquo;d expect it to. On Windows, inking has traditionally meant one of two things: drawing freehand with a pen or scrawling text inside of a dedicated box. If you needed to input text inside of a particular field, you could either ink it (like a signature) or write it inside of a separate input box, where it would be translated into text. </p>



<p>In the real world, you can write on a piece of paper such as a field-trip permission slip and our brains interpret that as text. Now Windows does too. If Windows presents a search box, for example, you can simply write in the search box and Windows will translate your inked handwriting into typed text and enter it in the proper field. Only English is supported, though.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 23H2 direct inking" class="wp-image-2004448" height="782" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-Ink-direct-inkng.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Direct inking could be a sleeper hit for Surface Pro tablet users.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-spotlight-tweaks">Windows Spotlight tweaks</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705519/windows-spotlight-adds-some-fun-back-to-windows-11.html">Windows Spotlight </a>has been one of my favorite features within Windows for years: a simple, gorgeous photo of the natural world which serves as that day&rsquo;s background. Microsoft&rsquo;s tweaking Spotlight further to offer more information about what you&rsquo;re seeing, so you can learn more about it or even potentially plan a visit. </p>



<p>To enable Windows Spotlight on your PC today, right-click on your desktop and choose &ldquo;Personalize&rdquo; and then choose the new Spotlight theme, Microsoft says. Microsoft has never said whether all of its backgrounds are formatted for 4K displays, though I&rsquo;m seeing more and more high-resolution photography on my screen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="updated-volume-mixer">Updated Volume Mixer</h2>



<p>Microsoft has added an updated volume mixer (<strong>Win+CTRL+V</strong>) where you can configure the volume and source of the audio on a per-app basis, which it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1531212/windows-11s-new-volume-panel-is-super-helpful.html">showed off earlier</a>. Microsoft is also trying to make it easier for users to find its Windows Sonic spatial sound in addition to other audio enhancement technologies (Dolby DTS and so on) that may be available.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 23H2 volume mixer" class="wp-image-2004450" height="1167" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Volume-Mixer.png" width="809" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Windows 11&rsquo;s new Volume Mixer.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="local-file-sharing-updates">Local file sharing updates</h2>



<p>File sharing within Windows has always been a bit of a pain. Now, if you right-click on a file to share it, you&rsquo;ll receive new options. You&rsquo;ll see a button to turn on nearby sharing, for example. </p>



<p>Everyone will now be able to email their files through Outlook directly within the Windows share window and you&rsquo;ll see a search box to type in contact names. Windows will now return suggestions as you do.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 23H2 local file sharing" class="wp-image-2004447" height="1134" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-Sharing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="894" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">File sharing among friends will hopefully get easier under Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-tweaks">Other tweaks:</h2>



<ul>
<li>If you accidentally closed your camera shutter and are beginning a meeting, you&rsquo;ll see a warning that your shutter is closed.</li>



<li>Windows now has new, more natural Narrator voices in Chinese, Spanish (Spain and Mexico), Japanese and English (United Kingdom).</li>



<li>Urgent notifications that are set to break through &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; will hide their contents for privacy&rsquo;s sake.</li>



<li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.unicode.org/review/pri435/pri435-background-emoji-candidates.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-2004412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Unicode Emoji 15</a> is beginning to roll out with new hearts and animals.</li>



<li>When navigating between desktops in Task View (<strong>WIN + CTRL + left or right arrows</strong>), labels will be shown to show you where you&rsquo;re headed.</li>



<li>Microsoft is adding a new Settings page (<em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; battery &gt; Energy recommendations</em>) to help save power by lowering the refresh rate of your display.</li>

## Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and more agree to voluntary AI safeguards

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Several of the top American companies developing AI have agreed to work with the U.S. government and commit to several principles to ensure public trust in AI, the White House said Friday.</p>



<p>Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI all signed off on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ensuring-Safe-Secure-and-Trustworthy-AI.pdf&amp;xcust=2-3-2004396-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">commitments</a> to make AI safe, secure, and trustworthy. In May, the Biden administration had said that it would <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809479/biden-administration-wants-to-use-ai-ethically.html">meet with leading AI developers</a> to ensure that they were consistent with U.S. policy.</p>



<p>The commitments are not binding, and there are no penalties for failing to adhere to them. The policies can&rsquo;t retroactively affect AI systems that have already been deployed, either &mdash; one of the provisions says that the companies will commit to testing the AI for security vulnerabilities, both internally and externally, before releasing it.</p>



<p>Still, the new commitments are designed to reassure the public (and, to some extent, lawmakers) that AI can be deployed responsibly. The Biden administration had already proposed using AI within government to streamline tasks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most immediate effects will be felt on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art</a>, as all of the parties agreed to digital watermarking to identify a piece of art as AI-generated. Some services, such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html">Bing&rsquo;s Image Creator</a>, already do this. All of the signees also committed to using AI for the public good, such as cancer research, as well as identifying areas of appropriate and inappropriate use. This wasn&rsquo;t defined, but could include the existing safeguards that prevent ChatGPT, for example, from helping to plan a terrorist attack. The AI companies also pledged to preserve data privacy, a priority Microsoft has upheld with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1997371/microsofts-price-for-its-business-ai-is-insane.html">enterprise versions of Bing Chat and Microsoft 365 Copilot</a>. </p>



<p>All of the companies have committed to internal and external security testing of their AI systems before their release, and sharing information with industry, governments, the public, and academia on managing AI risks. They also pledged to allow third-party researchers access to discover and report vulnerabilities. </p>



<p>Microsoft president Brad Smith <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/21/commitment-safe-secure-ai/&amp;xcust=2-3-2004396-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">endorsed </a>the new commitments, noting that Microsoft has been an advocate for establishing a national registry of high-risk AI systems. (A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481564/congressman-calls-for-a-federal-department-of-ai-to-prevent-skynet.html">California congressman has called for a federal office overseeing AI</a>.) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/googles-ai-red-team-the-ethical-hackers-making-ai-safer/&amp;xcust=2-3-2004396-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google also disclosed its own &ldquo;red team&rdquo; of hackers</a> who try to break AI using attacks like prompt attacks, poisoning data, and more.</p>



<p>&ldquo;As part of our mission to build safe and beneficial AGI, we will continue to&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/blog/insights-from-global-conversations&amp;xcust=2-3-2004396-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pilot and refine</a>&nbsp;concrete governance practices specifically tailored to highly capable foundation models like the ones that we produce,&rdquo; OpenAI said in a statement. &ldquo;We will also continue to invest in research in areas that can help inform regulation, such as techniques for assessing potentially dangerous capabilities in AI models.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DWF is an outstanding PC gaming monitor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monitor has a QD-OLED panel which is like that used in top-tier OLED televisions. OLED provides a nearly infinite contrast ratio, excellent color performance, and respectable brightness. The result is a punchy, vibrant image with an unparalleled sense of dimensionality. The monitor&rsquo;s ultrawide aspect ratio only heightens the sense of immersion.</p>

<p>Motion clarity is superb. The monitor has a refresh up to 165Hz and supports both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and VESA Adaptive Sync. The OLED panel technology it uses has lower pixel response times than competitors, too, so there&rsquo;s minimal added blur and ghosting in motion. Motion is as crisp as you&rsquo;ll find below 240Hz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is an alternative to the AW3423DW, a slightly older and nearly identical monitor. The AW3423DW has a higher fresh rate of 175Hz and supports Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate. It&rsquo;s also $100 to $200 more expensive. Though we recommend the AW3423DWF for most people, the AW3423DW is better for owners of high-end Nvidia graphics cards.</p>

<p>The AW3423DWF is expensive at $1,099.99, but its performance justifies the price. Competing 34-inch and 38-inch ultrawides without QD-OLED technology are often just as expensive but have less impressive image quality.</p>

<p>The Dell G2724D is an excellent choice if you&rsquo;re looking for a budget gaming monitor that doesn&rsquo;t compromise on quality. With attractive design, strong motion clarity at 165Hz, and wide Adaptive Sync support, it provides an immersive gaming experience at an affordable price.</p>

<p>It has a 27-inch IPS LCD panel with 1440p resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate. The color gamut spans 100 percent of sRGB, 86 percent of DCI-P3, and 82 percent of Adobe RGB, delivering a bright and vibrant image that&rsquo;s excellent in games and adequate for most content creation. The monitor&rsquo;s Adaptive Sync support is a standout feature, with official support for VESA Adaptive Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia G-Sync.</p>

<p>It also delivers a handsome design with a matte black and gray chassis and sporty rear vents that provide an aggressive yet unobtrusive look. The functional monitor stand offers a range of ergonomic adjustments and has a compact base that doesn&rsquo;t consume excessive desk space.</p>

<p>There are a few downsides: The monitor doesn&rsquo;t offer USB connectivity or 3.5mm audio-out. HDR performance is lackluster, too, making it a so-so choice for HDR gaming.</p>

<p>Yet it&rsquo;s hard to beat the G2724D&rsquo;s performance at $300 or below and, more importantly, it offers everything an average PC gamer is going to need for a smooth, responsive, and attractive gaming experience. It&rsquo;s the kind of monitor that, despite its budget price, could have a place on your desk for several years.</p>

<p>Thinking about a TV for your next gaming display? Stop! The Acer Predator CG48 is as large as many OLED televisions and better suited to use with a PC.</p>

<p>The Predator CG48 is a 48-inch OLED monitor with 4K resolution and a maximum refresh rate of 138Hz. It has the same OLED panel as LG&rsquo;s OLED televisions and delivers great image quality. The monitor&rsquo;s combination of excellent contrast, spot-on color accuracy, and a wide color gamut provides a realistic and lifelike picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motion clarity is great, too. The 138Hz refresh rate provides excellent motion fluidity in fast-paced games. OLED also provides low pixel-response times, which minimizes blur across a wide range of refresh rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike a television, the Acer Predator CG48 has a wide variety of options for connecting a PC. This includes DisplayPort, HDMI 2.1, and even USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts of Power Delivery. You can easily connect several gaming PCs to this display, if needed. The bundled remote can access a wide range of image quality options and adjustments that help you customize the image to your preferences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monitor retails at $1,499.99, which is expensive, but it&rsquo;s often on sale for at least a couple hundred dollars less. Be sure to shop around before buying.</p>

<p>Want a monitor that takes immersion to a new level and outshines your friend&rsquo;s measly 34-inch ultrawide? The Corsair Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240 is for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Xeneon Flex is a superb way to enjoy visually stunning games. It has an extremely high contrast ratio and a wide color gamut. Maximum brightness is high (for OLED) as well, which is a benefit if you want to play games with HDR turned on. The monitor&rsquo;s 240Hz refresh rate and low pixel response times provide top-notch motion clarity. Even its modest 3440&times;1440 resolution may be seen as a benefit. While it does soften the image, it also reduces the strain on your GPU, making it possible to enjoy high-quality settings on midrange hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s most unique feature is in its name: a unique flexible OLED panel that can be adjusted from a completely flat position to an impressive 800R curvature, one of the tightest curves available in a monitor. The curve is adjusted manually with handles located on each side of the display. It&rsquo;s a useful extra if you enjoy a wide variety of genres (you may want it flat while playing <em>Civilization IV</em> but curved in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>).</p>

<p>Measuring a whopping 45 inches diagonally, the Xeneon Flex is significantly larger than a standard 34-inch ultrawide, providing an incredibly immersive gaming experience and ample space for multitasking applications. It stands taller than a 49-inch super-ultrawide like the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9, although it&rsquo;s not as wide.</p>

<p>Build quality is good, too, as the Corsair Xeneon Flex features a robust and stable stand with integrated ports including USB-C. However, the stand doesn&rsquo;t offer height adjustment. With a retail price of nearly $2,000, the Xeneon Flex is an investment, but its versatile OLED panel and superior image quality make it an obvious choice for gamers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best HDR games, like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> or <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>, are transformed by a great HDR display. Unfortunately, most PC monitors fall short&mdash;except for Asus&rsquo; ROG Swift PG32UQX.</p>

<p>This monitor has a mini-LED backlight with 1,152 LED light zones that can turn on or off independently, boosting contrast and brightness. The monitor achieves extreme brightness in both small areas of the display or across the entire display and does so without noticeable fluctuations in brightness, a problem sometimes visible on the otherwise excellent Alienware AW3423DW.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s got top-tier color performance, 4K resolution, and a refresh rate of up to 144Hz. It doesn&rsquo;t support HDMI 2.1 but can handle 120Hz when connected to a Xbox Series X|S console thanks to a chroma subsampling mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ROG Swift PG32UQX&rsquo;s superb HDR performance comes at a high price. You can expect to pay around $3,000 for this monitor. Viewsonic&rsquo;s XG321UG is a similar and slightly less expensive alternative, but it lacks 120Hz support for Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>

<p>Gamers looking for good HDR for under $1,000 should consider AOC&rsquo;s Agon Pro AG274QZM.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a 27-inch gaming monitor with a Mini-LED backlight, a native resolution of 2560&times;1440, and a refresh rate of 240Hz. It officially supports Nvidia G-Sync, and our testing shows it also works with AMD FreeSync (though it isn&rsquo;t supported officially).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real story, however, is the monitor&rsquo;s VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certification. With a peak HDR brightness of 948 nits, this monitor is incredibly bright. It also has a good contrast ratio, excellent color performance, and top-notch motion clarity. HDR games look amazing on this display.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one image-quality flaw to note: sharpness. The monitor has minor issues with displaying small fonts and fine details smoothly. It&rsquo;s not often noticeable in games but can be annoying in day-to-day use.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s gamer-centric design includes red chrome accents and RGB lighting. It isn&rsquo;t as well-built as some competitors, most notably those from Alienware and Asus Republic of Gamers, but feels sturdy enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connectivity is excellent, too, with two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4, and a USB-C 3.2 port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts Power Delivery. The USB-C port also features four USB-A downstream ports for connecting wired peripherals.</p>

<p>If you are a gamer who enjoys slower-paced games that feature beautiful graphic detail then you may want to consider a 4K gaming monitor. The Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q is a 28-inch 4K display with a refresh rate of 60Hz and adaptive sync, making it compatible with both FreeSync and G-Sync. It&rsquo;s also only $400&mdash;a relative steal for a 4K display. It may not have the refresh rate that is required for quick e-sports or shooter games, but it makes up for that with an absolutely superb 4K display. It also has outstanding image quality and a vivid color range that will make most of the other monitors on this list weep.</p>

<p>Asus branded the VG289Q as a gaming monitor and it will deliver on that in most aspects. But ultimately, it is all about getting a 4K display on a budget and in that respect this monitor is second to none in image quality value for your money.</p>

<p>Want unparalleled motion clarity? Look no further than Alienware&rsquo;s AW2524H, the world&rsquo;s first 500Hz gaming monitor.</p>

<p>This monitor delivers fantastic detail in fast-moving objects and remains legible during rapid in-game map navigation. Competitive gamers will appreciate its ultra-low input latency, complemented by Nvidia Reflex Analyzer, which accurately measures PC response to input. The monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate is so high, in fact, that you&rsquo;ll need to double-check the maximum frame rate of your favorite games. Some have a hard frame rate cap below 500 frames per second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The AW2524H&rsquo;s design is outstanding. It relies on Alienware&rsquo;s sleek, futuristic aesthetic and outstanding build quality. The compact stand enables ergonomic adjustments while minimizing desk space consumption, and a headphone stand is included on the display&rsquo;s left flank.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s image quality doesn&rsquo;t rival similarly priced monitors but remains respectable and defeats most 24.5-inch 360Hz monitors. This is thanks to the monitor&rsquo;s vibrant, vivid color. HDR performance is underwhelming, but competitive gamers are unlikely to find this a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snagging the world&rsquo;s first 500Hz monitor doesn&rsquo;t come cheap: note the monitor&rsquo;s $829.99 price tag. That&rsquo;s a hefty sum for a 24.5-inch display. But, if you&rsquo;re on the path to pro, the monitor&rsquo;s price is a fair exchange for its class-leading motion clarity and responsiveness.</p>

<p>PC gamers looking for a mid-range monitor with excellent motion clarity and a high refresh should pick up the Gigabyte M27Q X.</p>

<p>This 27-inch monitor has 2560&times;1440 resolution, a refresh rate of 240Hz, and officially supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro (Nvidia G-Sync Compatible was tested to work, as well). This provides excellent motion clarity in competitive titles.</p>

<p>Gigabyte&rsquo;s monitor delivers high maximum brightness, good contrast, and excellent color performance. Its color performance is so strong that you&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to find better performance at any price. The M27Q X can serve double-duty as a photo or video editing monitor (if you don&rsquo;t mind 1440p resolution).</p>

<p>Excellent image quality at a reasonable price comes at the compromise of build quality. The M27Q X looks mundane and the stand only adjusts for height and tilt. Still, most gamers buy a monitor to play games&mdash;and that&rsquo;s where the M27Q X excels.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not a professional gamer or you just don&rsquo;t require the obscenely fast 240Hz, then you can find a whole host of great options at 144Hz instead. Our pick for the best of the bunch is the LG Ultragear 27GN950.</p>

<p>Not only is it still super fast, but it also has 4K resolution, all of the ports your heart desires, and impressively high color fidelity. It is a great option for those who will use it for multimedia other than just gaming and don&rsquo;t mind sacrificing a little speed to gain a lot of pixel density.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it&rsquo;s a bit pricey for a 27-inch monitor and you will need a high-end GPU to take advantage of its full potential, but if you can afford it, then this just might end up being the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance in your display setup.</p>

<p>The Dell G3223Q is a large, attractive 32-inch gaming monitor that&rsquo;s ideal for PC gamers who also want to connect a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>It supports 4K resolution at a refresh rate of up to 144Hz and has two HDMI 2.1 connections. You can connect a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S console simultaneously. DisplayPort is also available for your PC. The monitor supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync.</p>

<p>Image quality is strong with excellent brightness, good contrast, and great color performance. These traits, combined with the sharpness of 4K, makes for an excellent SDR experience. HDR isn&rsquo;t impressive, which could be a concern for console gamers. Most monitors in this price range aren&rsquo;t great at HDR, however, so we think this issue can be overlooked (for now).</p>

<p>The Dell G3223Q is a good value, too. Typically priced around $825, the G3223Q is among the more affordable HDMI 2.1 monitors with a 32-inch, 4K display panel. We also appreciate the monitor&rsquo;s design, which feels more durable and looks more attractive than similarly priced alternatives.</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE is a bit unique in that it was designed and built to be a top-quality gaming monitor that is easily portable and mobile friendly.</p>

<p>It is a 17.3-inch display with 1080p resolution and a screaming fast refresh rate of 240Hz. It also has adaptive sync technology and built-in speakers. You can easily connect it to your laptop or next-gen console of choice for on-the-go gaming.</p>

<p>The battery should last you about 3.5 hours without needing to be charged and it comes with a cover that can be folded back to make a stand for the monitor itself. However, if you can afford to buy the extra tripod stand it is recommended as this provides a more stable base as well as height adjustment options.</p>

<p>The specs alone make this an excellent gaming monitor in its own rights, but the ability to pack it up and take it with you makes this a great option for those who like to game on the go. You will pay for this convenience though as even the base option is quite steep, let alone the bundle which includes the tripod stand.</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA348CGV is an excellent ultrawide for professionals, digital artists, creatives, and anyone else wanting to work and play on the same display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PA348CGV delivers top-notch color accuracy, a wide color gamut, and numerous image-quality adjustments, making it ideal for demanding users who need to precisely calibrate a display. Pro users can switch to a preset mode, such as the DCI-P3 mode, or use a custom display mode to calibrate the image in detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most monitors of this caliber leave gamers in the cold, but the PA348CGV invites them in with a 120Hz refresh rate and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It offers smooth frame pacing and great motion clarity, especially at high frame rates. It looks great straight out of the box and is particularly pleasing in bright, vivid games like <em>World of Warcraft</em> or <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sold at an MSRP of $729, the PA348CGV is priced to compete with other premium ultrawides, yet its image quality leaves alternatives in the dust. You&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to find a better value in this category.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-gaming-monitor">What to look for in a gaming monitor</h2>



<p>Gamers have unique needs that exceed an average user. Here&rsquo;s what PC gamers should look for in a gaming monitor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="resolution">Resolution </h3>



<p>Most widescreen gaming monitors have a resolution of 1920&times;1080 (1080p), 2560&times;1440 (1440p), or 4K (3840&times;2160). A higher resolution improves sharpness and clarity, which helps games look more detailed and lifelike. Increasing resolution also increases demand on your video card, however. Gamers with less powerful hardware may want to avoid 4K.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="refresh-rate">Refresh rate</h3>



<p>A higher refresh leads to smoother motion by increasing the number of frames that can appear each second. It also reduces input lag, as each frame appears more quickly. A 144Hz refresh rate is a big improvement over the standard 60Hz, and 240Hz is better still. The improvement becomes more difficult to notice after 240Hz, but 360Hz monitors exist for those who want the lowest input lag possible.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DIsplayPort and HDMI 2.<strong>1</strong> </h3>



<p>DisplayPort is the best connection for PC gaming. Even DisplayPort 1.4, which is rather old, can support 4K at 144Hz. HDMI 2.1 can handle 4K at 120Hz and is an acceptable connection for PC gaming, though most gamers will use it for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S game console.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-gaming-monitors">How we test gaming monitors</h2>



<p>We test all monitors with a DataColor SpyderXElite calibration tool. This tool can report objective measurements for brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, color temperature, gamma, and other metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our results are recorded and compared to the results for past monitors. Though we rely on our eyes for initial impressions, comparing objective results lets us evaluate monitors against hundreds of older models from past reviews and testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We examine motion clarity by quickly moving the camera across the map in <em>Civilization VI</em>, playing a round of <em>Rocket League</em>, and panning the camera across the landscape in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>&mdash;among other games. Finally, we use the popular <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.testufo.com&amp;xcust=2-1-813301-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">UFO Test </a>for an apples-to-apples comparison between displays.</p>



<p>In addition to gaming prowess, we consider a monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menu, ergonomic stand (or lack thereof), and overall build quality&mdash;all important qualities irrespective of use case.</p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block"><h2 class="faq-block-title" id="faq"> FAQ </h2><hr class="block-horizotal-divider" />

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-resolution-is-best-for-a-gaming-monitor">What resolution is best for a gaming monitor?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Many competitive gamers prefer 1080p resolution because it allows for high frame rates and low input lag even on modest hardware. This also makes it ideal for budget shoppers. 1080p is not as crisp as higher resolutions but, if it allows for higher frame rates, can look good in motion.</p>



<p>1440p remains a great mid-range option. It looks much sharper than 1080p but doesn&rsquo;t drastically increase load on your video card. A variety of 1440p monitors now support a refresh rate up to 240Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4K is the last word in sharpness and clarity. Playing a modern game on a 4K monitor takes the experience to a new level. It&rsquo;s very demanding on your video card, however, so you&rsquo;ll need top-tier hardware for a smooth experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultrawide monitors differ in resolution because they have a wider screen. Most ultrawide monitors have a resolution of 3440&times;1440, which delivers sharpness similar to a 1440p ultrawide. Some larger monitors have more exotic resolutions: the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 Neo, for example, has 5120&times;1440 resolution.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-i-use-amd-freesync-or-nvidia-g-sync">Should I use AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync can synchronize the refresh rate of a compatible monitor with the output of an AMD or Nvidia video card. This ensures smooth motion and eliminates screen tearing, a distracting visual artifact.</p>



<p>You might be surprised to learn that most AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync monitors rely on the VESA Adaptive Sync standard. This is why many gaming monitors now support both. The difference in performance is minimal.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">G-Sync vs. FreeSync comparison goes in-depth</a> on their similarities and differences.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-i-buy-an-ultrawide-gaming-monitor">Should I buy an ultrawide gaming monitor?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394848/are-ultrawide-monitors-worth-it.html">The short answer? Yes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our top choice, the Alienware AW3423DW, is an ultrawide gaming monitor. An ultrawide aspect ratio is more immersive in racing, simulation, and role-playing games. It also offers a large, more impressive perspective in many strategy games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not all games support an ultrawide aspect ratio, however. It&rsquo;s wise to check that your favorite games support ultrawide monitors before making a purchase. Consoles rarely support ultrawide aspect ratios, so console gamers should stick with a widescreen display.</p>

## Microsoft 365 makeover: Office docs are getting a new default look

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft Office, which was renamed Microsoft 365 a while ago, is about to undergo drastic visual changes. Microsoft is giving its Office suite a new standard theme across all individual applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Everything from fonts to colors to even line weights are getting new default settings. </p>



<p>The changes are intended to make documents created with Microsoft 365 look more modern and accessible, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/office-has-a-new-default-theme&amp;xcust=2-1-2004293-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft says</a>. Here&rsquo;s brief overview of what Office users will need to adjust to once the new Microsoft 365 default theme goes live at some point in the future.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-standard-font-aptos-replaces-calibri">New standard font: Aptos replaces Calibri</h2>



<p>The first, most obvious change that every Microsoft 365 user will see immediately: Office will soon be using a new default font. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Calibri als Standardschrift von Microsoft 365" class="wp-image-2003315" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Calibri.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HCD</p></div>



<p>Since 2013, Calibri has been the default font for Office apps. But Microsoft users with five alternatives to choose from for a new default:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bierstadt</li>



<li>Grandview</li>



<li>Seaford</li>



<li>Skeena</li>



<li>Tenorite</li>
</ul>



<p>Bierstadt won the race and will now become the new standard font for Microsoft 365, albeit under the name Aptos. Aptos supports a variety of font styles (such as normal, italic, bold, etc.) and variants such as narrow, serif, and monochrome.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Aptos als neue Standardschrift f&uuml;r MS Office 365" class="wp-image-2003378" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aptos.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>As usual, you can of course use any other font available in Microsoft Office.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-color-palette">New color palette</h2>



<p>Microsoft also researched popular color palettes and design trends and then created a set of standard colors that should work well in all Office applications. The motivation behind the change is making your documents feel more accessible. The new colors are suitable for content such as charts, lists, and shapes.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Neue Farbpalette f&uuml;r MS Office 365" class="wp-image-2003386" height="256" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Farben.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-style">New style</h2>



<p>Microsoft wants to make the default style for Word documents and Outlook emails easier to read and more professional looking. This change should make it easier for users to navigate through documents.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft 365: Neue Stile" class="wp-image-2003428" height="276" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stile.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-line-widths">New line widths</h2>



<p>Microsoft has also increased the line widths, so the lines will be thicker. This should lead to better consistency between shapes and lines. Microsoft has also improved the contrast.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Neue Linien in MS Office 365" class="wp-image-2003417" height="351" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/linien.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-use-the-new-microsoft-365-theme">How to use the new Microsoft 365 theme</h2>



<p>With the introduction of the new theme, all new documents, presentations, worksheets, and emails you create in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook will automatically have the new theme applied. You won&rsquo;t need to take any special action to see it. </p>



<p>Your existing documents will not be changed to the new theme, however. They will continue to use the original design that was applied when they were created. You can continue to use the previous Office theme if you want, but you&rsquo;ll need to manually change to &ldquo;Office Theme 2013 &ndash; 2022.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="availability">Availability</h2>



<p>Currently, only Microsoft 365 Insider Testers can try out the new theme. These are the requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li>Win32: Version 2308 (Build 16701.20000) or higher</li>



<li>Mac: Version 16.76 (Build 23070400) or higher</li>



<li>Android: Version 16.0.16701.20000 or higher</li>
</ul>



<p>An iOS version isn&rsquo;t available yet.</p>



<p>Microsoft is not yet disclosing when all Microsoft 365 users will be swapped over to the new default theme. Until then, Calibri will remain the standard font in Office.</p>

<p>Nvidia versus AMD graphics is a battle as old as time. Or more accurately, as old as a 24-year-old person, because that&rsquo;s how long it&rsquo;s been since Nvidia&rsquo;s first discrete graphics card. But you use your laptop for more than just non-stop gaming. Today we&rsquo;re taking a look at which system, complete with fancy new &ldquo;AI&rdquo; powers, can give you clearer Zoom calls? And which one can do it without draining your laptop battery? Gordon&rsquo;s answering those questions in PCWorld&rsquo;s latest YouTube video. </p>

<p>Gordon&rsquo;s not actually testing GPU power specifically here, he&rsquo;s looking at the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&ldquo;Ryzen AI&rdquo; accelerator tools</a> for video adjustments like blurring your room background and more advanced techniques, like adjusting your eyes to make it appear like you&rsquo;re looking right into your webcam. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395101/nvidia-broadcast-v13-smooths-out-pain-points-in-an-already-awesome-tool.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia&rsquo;s Broadcast AI system</a> does a lot of the same things. Windows, the Zoom program itself, Nvidia Broadcast AI, and Windows + Ryzen AI are all on the testing block, complete with how much of a battery impact each one has. </p>



<p>At the end of the day, Nvidia&rsquo;s system is definitely ahead in terms of image quality, easily beating out the Windows + Ryzen AI for background blur quality (and beating the pants off of Zoom&rsquo;s software-only effect). But Nvidia Broadcast is going to drain your power pretty quickly by constantly hitting the GPU. As for the eye contact effects, it&rsquo;s a bit of a toss-up, with Nvidia being much more dramatic&hellip;to a possibly creepy degree. Hey, it&rsquo;s a beta feature. The Ryzen eye tracking tool is also a lot easier on the battery. </p>

## 4 reasons why I switched from Nvidia to AMD

<p>Nvidia has become one of the 10 most valuable companies in the world in just a few months, crowning a trend that was started with the crypto boom. But while Nvidia is raking in record sales with future technologies, as a gamer I&rsquo;ve turned away&mdash;at least for now.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought brand loyalty was a silly concept, especially in the technology sector. A product should be evaluated on its own merits, based on criteria relevant to its intended use. A graphics card, for example, is evaluated on factors such as performance, energy efficiency, range of functions, and price.</p>



<p>The company that manufactures the product should at most be included in the decision if it stands out for social commitment or environmentally friendly production, for example. </p>

<p>Now, no one can claim that Nvidia makes bad graphics cards. On the contrary, the company has set many trends in recent years: G-Sync, ray tracing, DLSS, and Reflex, to name a few. Especially in the upper class, Team Green&rsquo;s ferocious <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">RTX 4090</a> has no rival. And yet, having recently found myself due for a PC upgrade, I opted for an AMD graphics card.</p>



<p>Although my GeForce RTX 2080 Ti has served me well for years, I recently replaced it with an RX 6950 XT from AMD. Here are my very personal reasons for doing so.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1947085/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-vs-rtx-3060-ti-and-radeon-rx-6700-xt-fight.html">Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti vs. RTX 3060 Ti vs. AMD 6700 XT</a></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="h-die-tucke-der-neuen-technologien">The pitfall of new technologies</h2>



<p>In the past few years, Nvidia has introduced one new technology after another and ultimately (at least currently) won the duel against AMD. With ray tracing, Nvidia has set a graphics trend that will probably be with us for some time to come and in which Team Green is a pioneer. The DLSS upscaling technology is still ahead of the AMD and Intel alternatives.</p>



<p>However, it is becoming more and more of a trend that these innovations are not really backwards compatible&mdash;and that is a disaster from the consumer&rsquo;s point of view. For example, said Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), whose latest version 3 including frame generation is only compatible with Nvidia&rsquo;s current 40-series cards.</p>



<p>So if you bought a 20- or 30-series card in the past years, possibly for a lot of money given the graphics card prices of the last few years, you are now already looking down the tube.</p>



<p>There are of course technical reasons why these new technologies do not work on old cards. Nevertheless, as a consumer I don&rsquo;t like the feeling when an expensive product is consigned to the antique department by the manufacturer after only a few years. Especially since there is another way, as AMD shows.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Even though Nvidia has good arguments on its side from a technical point of view, AMD has not been idle in recent years either&mdash;and is pursuing a completely different strategy. AMD makes its in-house technologies available to as many users as possible. One example of this is FreeSync, which, in contrast to G-Sync, works with a significantly larger selection of monitors that are often also cheaper than counterparts with G-Sync certification.</p>



<p>It becomes even clearer when comparing FSR against DLSS. While AMD&rsquo;s technology is compatible even with competitor graphics cards from Nvidia and Intel, Nvidia not infrequently excludes GPUs from its own house when it comes to new functions. For example, DLSS only works when using an RTX GPU, older GTX models are left out in the cold, and DLSS 3 Frame Generation only works with the current RTX 40-series graphics cards. AMD relies on industry standards and open source solutions, while Nvidia implements proprietary solutions.</p>



<p>It felt like Nvidia was constantly bringing new features to the market without really addressing the needs of existing customers. Team Red may be a little behind in the latest high-tech features, but it relies on open source technologies and doesn&rsquo;t have to hide at all in fundamental areas like rasterization performance and memory.</p>



<p>And even if ray tracing is now implemented in more and more games, without ray tracing you can play any game, but without rasterization you can&rsquo;t play any game&mdash;apart from a few exceptions with path tracing. </p>

<p>While Nvidia, also as a result of the company&rsquo;s shift towards AI technologies, is indeed a driver of innovation, AMD has increasingly concentrated on the essentials in recent years. A shining example is the built-in video memory, which is becoming increasingly important at higher resolutions and levels of detail.</p>



<p>Only recently, Nvidia has once again shown with the RTX 4060 that the company does not succeed in the balancing act between the use of new technologies and a solid basic configuration. A strong ray tracing performance and DLSS 3 are of little use if the 8GB video memory is no longer sufficient for modern games in full HD. Especially since both technologies further increase the memory requirements.</p>



<p>AMD is not immune to these errors either, as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html">Radeon RX 7600 with only 8 GB of RAM</a> also shows, but it often has a better memory configuration, especially in the midrange and upper class. An illustrative example of this is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">RX 7900 XTX</a>, which not only has significantly more video memory, but is also cheaper than its Nvidia counterpart, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">RTX 4080</a>. And even in terms of pure rasterization performance, AMD cards are often on a par with or even ahead of Nvidia at the same price.</p>

<p>If we leave the RTX 4090 aside for a moment (at a starting price of $1,600 it&rsquo;s irrelevant for my eventual purchase decisions anyway), you will find an AMD equivalent for every Nvidia card that is on par in terms of memory equipment and rasterization performance. And in most cases, the AMD card will be the cheaper alternative.</p>



<p>Of course, if you value ray tracing and prefer DLSS to AMD&rsquo;s alternative FSR, this question does not arise. Because in these areas Nvidia simply cannot be beaten at the moment, and it is precisely for this reason that the company can also be very creative in its pricing.</p>



<p>AMD, on the other hand, must and wants to convince with classic arguments, namely solid performance, accessible alternative technologies, and ample memory at an attractive price (at least compared to the competition). And if, like me, these points are ultimately decisive for you, then you should at least consider Team Red for your next PC upgrade.</p>

<p>But not only the hardware, but also the software should play a role in the purchase decision. </p>



<p>As a long-time user of an Nvidia graphics card, it is still incomprehensible to me why the manufacturer does not manage to combine all functions in one software program. If I want to change the monitor resolution or refresh rate, activate G-Sync or use Dynamic Super Resolution, I have to do this in the Nvidia control panel, which, by the way, still looks the same as it did 20 years ago. </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, a driver update is to be carried out, a game automatically optimized or the game recorded or streamed via ShadowPlay, then GeForce Experience is necessary. As an old hand, I now know where to find which setting, but for newcomers it is already user-unfriendly if you have to click through two applications until you find the desired setting. In addition, the use of GeForce Experience requires a user account.</p>



<p>With AMD, on the other hand, the AMD software Adrenalin Edition can be installed together with the driver. There is no need to log in and all functions can be found clearly in one application. </p>

It&rsquo;s not particularly refined and it doesn&rsquo;t have many desirable extra features, but it&rsquo;s still a steal thanks to its great value.</p>
</div>


<p>If you&rsquo;re hunting for a gaming laptop it&rsquo;s tempting to assume your portable of choice will be far too expensive but that&rsquo;s not the case with the Asus TUF Gaming A15 for 2023.</p>



<p>This year&rsquo;s version starts at only $1,199/&pound;1,049 and rises to a reasonable $1,399/&pound;1,499 so you won&rsquo;t have to spend big money.</p>



<p>The model I&rsquo;ve reviewed costs $1,399 in the US but a more palatable &pound;1,199 in the UK. That gets you an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU and a 144Hz, 1080p display &ndash; the exact hardware you&rsquo;ll need to run almost every game smoothly for the next few years.</p>



<p>On paper, that&rsquo;s great. But there&rsquo;s more to success than components. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="design-build">Design &amp; Build</h2>



<ul>
<li>Familiar military design and MIL-STD-810H testing</li>



<li>A solid port selection, albeit without some future-proofed options</li>



<li>Slimmer and lighter than its key rival</li>
</ul>



<p>The Asus TUF range takes inspiration from military hardware, and this 2023 edition still looks like a supply crate. Make of that what you will. </p>



<p>Get beyond that &ndash; and the promotional stickers &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll find a notebook with MIL-STD-810H testing to ensure it can withstand shocks, drops, temperature changes and water spillages.</p>



<p>That said, there&rsquo;s significant movement in the screen, base and keyboard, so I&rsquo;d still recommend a protective sleeve if you frequently deploy the A15 out of the house.</p>



<p>More impressively, the A15 weighs 2.2kg and is 25mm thick, so it&rsquo;s slimmer and lighter than the Acer Nitro 5. This is not a slim and light laptop in the grand, but it&rsquo;s significantly easier to manage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You&rsquo;ll find a notebook with MIL-STD-810H testing to ensure it can withstand shocks, drops, temperature changes and water spillages</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A15 (2023) " class="wp-image-1989445" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-TUF-Gaming-A15-09.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mike Jennings / Foundry</p></div>



<p>There are full-size USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports on either side, but the USB 4 Type-C port, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C connector and the HDMI, audio and Ethernet outputs are all clustered on the left edge, which may not be handy for your cable-routing or for left-handed users.</p>



<p>The moves to USB 4 and HDMI 2.1 are the only upgrades from the 2022 A15, and the AMD chipset means no Thunderbolt. You&rsquo;ll find that, and one extra USB port, on the Acer.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the A15 has Wi-Fi 6 rather than 6E, a blurry 720p webcam with no Windows Hello sign-in and no fingerprint reader. There&rsquo;s Gigabit Ethernet but not faster 2.5Gbps. That&rsquo;s expected for an affordable gaming notebook and it won&rsquo;t hinder daily use &ndash; and the Acer suffers similarly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="keyboard-trackpad">Keyboard &amp; Trackpad</h2>



<ul>
<li>A good layout with extra buttons and RGB LED lighting</li>



<li>A soft, squishy typing action that won&rsquo;t satisfy many gamers</li>



<li>An inconsistent trackpad means you&rsquo;ll be better off with a mouse</li>
</ul>



<p>The keyboard could use a little more refinement, too. The buttons may have 1.7mm of travel, but they&rsquo;re soft, without the snappy feel you&rsquo;ll find on the best gaming notebooks.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not a disaster; you can use the A15 for gaming and typing. But if you want a robust keyboard to hammer through frantic sessions, you won&rsquo;t get it here.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A15 (2023) " class="wp-image-1989447" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-TUF-Gaming-A15-05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mike Jennings / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The trackpad is also soft and its buttons are inconsistent, with differing levels of force required across the pad.</p>



<p>Ergonomically the A15 is ok but not brilliant. The layout is better, with a numberpad, extra audio buttons and single-zone RGB lighting. There&rsquo;s hardly any difference between the Asus A15, the Asus A16, and the Acer &ndash; they&rsquo;re all fine but not amazing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="screen-speakers">Screen &amp; Speakers</h2>



<ul>
<li>A 1080p IPS panel at 144Hz means you&rsquo;ve got the pixels and pace for mainstream games</li>



<li>A lack of brightness means outdoor play is a no-go</li>



<li>Mediocre speakers</li>
</ul>



<p>There are no big additions to the display on this year&rsquo;s A15 &ndash; the 1080p IPS panel with 144Hz refresh rate reappears. You also get G-Sync support alongside Nvidia Advanced Optimus and a MUX switch so it&rsquo;s easy to use the laptop on mains and battery power.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s fine for mainstream gaming and esports, but this screen isn&rsquo;t fast enough for high-end competition. It doesn&rsquo;t have the extra immersion you&rsquo;ll get from 16:10 panels or screens with higher resolutions.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A15 (2023) " class="wp-image-1989448" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-TUF-Gaming-A15-02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mike Jennings / Foundry</p></div>



<p>In terms of quality, there&rsquo;s good and bad news. Positively, the A15&rsquo;s delta E of 1.46 means colors are accurate and the contrast ratio of 935:1 is fine for gaming &ndash; mainstream games will look good here.</p>



<p>Negatively, though, the maximum brightness of just 290 nits is not high enough for outdoor use. And it&rsquo;s always quite annoying when other specifications aren&rsquo;t available &ndash; the 2022 model could sometimes be found with 1440p panels and 300Hz refresh rates but there&rsquo;s no sign of that this year.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, you get mediocre speakers on this unit, with non-existent bass and a tinny top-end. Use a headset instead and you&rsquo;ll have a far better time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="specs-performance">Specs &amp; Performance</h2>



<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 processors</li>



<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, 4060 or 4070 graphics</li>



<li>16GB DDR5 memory and 512GB SSD</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU has 8GB of memory and a TDP of 140W, which is right at the top of the GPU&rsquo;s thermal envelope. Asus has deployed an AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processor with eight multi-threaded cores and a boost speed of 4.75GHz.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find that processor in the TUF A16, too, but it&rsquo;s odd when most other gaming laptops &ndash; including the Acer Nitro 5 &ndash; include Intel chips.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You have enough pace to handle any top single-player game for the next few years</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The A15 has 16GB of dual-channel memory and a 512GB SSD. That memory is fine, but the SSD is small considering the size of modern games. Thankfully there&rsquo;s a second SSD slot inside.</p>



<p>The Asus played CyberPunk 2077 at Ultra settings with an 88fps average, and returned a still-playable result of 55fps with Ray Tracing and DLSS. A 1080p average of 85fps in Far Cry: New Dawn and a mighty 247fps result in Rainbow Six Siege continued the A15&rsquo;s good form.</p>



<p>You have enough pace to handle any top single-player game for the next few years, especially if you don&rsquo;t want to run the top settings. There&rsquo;s easily enough speed for any eSports game too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A15 (2023) " class="wp-image-1989449" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asus-TUF-Gaming-A15-07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mike Jennings / Foundry</p></div>



<p>In 3D Mark Time Spy, the A15 scored 10,020 points &ndash; nearly 1,000 beyond the RX 7600S inside the A16. That result rose by 600 points in Turbo mode. That&rsquo;s as good as it gets for the laptop version of the RTX 4060.</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s processor does a decent job against Intel&rsquo;s chips. In PCMark 10 the AMD CPU scored 7,132, which outpaces the 6,926 scored by the i5-12500H in the Acer and the i7-12700H, which has actually proved a little slower in PCMark 10. The i5-13500H and i7-13700H don&rsquo;t make a huge difference here, either.</p>



<p>In Cinebench R20&rsquo;s single- and multi-threaded tests, the A15 scored 579 and 5,241, with the former behind Intel and the latter ahead.</p>



<p>The Ryzen chip&rsquo;s Geekbench 5 score of 9,291 is about 3,000 points shy of the Core i7-12700H and not far beyond the i5-12500H. Its Geekbench 6 result of 10,120 sits behind the i7, which is more than 1,000 points better in that test.</p>








<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Remarkably, the A15 lasted for almost nine hours when working with the display at full brightness</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For everyday browsing, photo-editing, multi-tasking and office tasks the AMD chip is great, but if you want true content creation ability you&rsquo;d be better off with Intel i7-12700H.</p>



<p>More positively the Asus never proved too hot or loud. Its fans only produced a tiny whirr in everyday Performance Mode and the noise wasn&rsquo;t much more intrusive in Turbo Mode.</p>



<p>You even get decent battery life. I got two hours of gaming from the TUF A15 &ndash; twice as much as the Nitro 5. Remarkably, the A15 lasted for almost nine hours when working with the display at full brightness and twelve hours when running a film with the brightness reduced to our normal test setting.</p>



<p>The A16 exhibited similarly lengthy results, so there&rsquo;s clearly something good happening in the 90Wh power pack and this is a laptop that&rsquo;s certainly usable for a full working day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="price-availability">Price &amp; Availability</h2>



<p>In the US and UK, the TUF A15 comes with RTX 4050, RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 graphics. The first two GPUs come with the Ryzen 7 7735HS processor, while the RTX 4070 is paired with a Ryzen 9 7940HS.</p>

<p>These prices align with the A16 and are competitive with the Acer.

<p>Alongside that better value the A15 delivers great 1080p and eSports power, superb battery life, a screen that&rsquo;s good enough for indoor, smooth gaming and a decent selection of ports inside a relatively manageable chassis.</p>



<p>The lack of future-proofed connectivity, screen brightness and a genuinely great keyboard reign the A15&rsquo;s ambition in, and the AMD processor is fine &ndash; but Intel remains better in many scenarios.</p>



<p>At these prices, though, the A15 glosses over its faults. It&rsquo;s a competent, reasonably fast gaming laptop with no huge flaws, so it&rsquo;s ideal if you want solid gaming power without spending silly money.</p>

<p>The Swift X discount isn&rsquo;t profound, but the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395111/acer-swift-x-review-a-rare-ultraportable-laptop-with-bite.html">laptop won an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award</a>. Note that we&rsquo;ve included two different versions; the more expensive model includes a faster processor and GPU, but comes with a substantial price premium. A student should be able to make do with the cheaper model.</p>



<p>Remember that the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538941/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review.html">Surface Pro 8 (review)</a> is last year&rsquo;s model, as is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394409/surface-laptop-4-ryzen-7-review.html">Surface Laptop 4</a>. While that doesn&rsquo;t matter that much, remember that the Surface Pro 8 is a tablet (and includes Thunderbolt) while the Surface Laptop 4 is Microsoft&rsquo;s traditional laptop, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">lacks Thunderbolt</a>. </p>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga 7i is just a solid laptop at a solid value, and the little brother of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/611108/lenovo-yoga-9i-review.html">Yoga 9i</a>. </p>



<p>Both of the HP deals are slightly iffy. HP&rsquo;s Envy 2-in-1 has a cutting-edge processor, but the memory and storage are skimpy. That&rsquo;s perfectly fine for a writing degree, but not for the hard sciences. (You can add storage with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">an external SSD</a>.) The HP 15, oddly enough, was on sale last year for back-to-school, and it&rsquo;s a perfectly fine (but 2-year-old) laptop. Oh, and we&rsquo;ve included a gaming laptop (don&rsquo;t tell Dad!) just for fun.</p>



<p>Not sure <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">whether to buy a laptop or a Chromebook</a>? We can help.</p>

<p>College life generally runs on laptops and not Chromebooks. Chromebooks are still useful for elementary and even middle-school students, though, especially as secondary machines. If you can, prioritize a 1080p screen, 8GB of RAM, and (if possible) a 1080p display when you buy a Chromebook.  The Acer Chromebook 315 for $208 is a fantastic bargain, but we&rsquo;d recommend that you buy either the second Acer Chromebook 315 for $279.99 or the Asus Flip C433, as they meet our spec requirements.</p>



<p>Right now, we&rsquo;re seeing sharp cuts on a bargain-basement HP Chromebook at the top of our list, though the Acer 315 should provide good performance at an aggressive price. We&rsquo;re not a huge fan of the Asus CX1500 deal, but the price is solid and the display is large and easy on the eyes. The N3350 is a 5-year-old processor and was discontinued last year, probably incenting the discount.</p>



<p>The Asus 16-inch Chromebook pushes into laptop-quality components at a price that enters cheap-laptop territory, too. You won&rsquo;t have to worry about performance with this model, though.</p>

<p>MacBook back-to-school sales just aren&rsquo;t as pronounced as in Windows laptops, though Apple&rsquo;s stock of older M1 hardware means you can buy an older MacBook at a surprisingly good price &mdash; for Apple, that is. That B&amp;H deal, for example, is insane but won&rsquo;t last long.</p>



<p>MacBooks rarely carry heavy discounts, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If students need a tablet for when they go back to school, we think that these suggestions offer the best deals for now. We may see better deals as the season goes on.</p>



<p>Amazon has some small discounts available for back-to-school tablets. We&rsquo;ve shied away from Amazon&rsquo;s own Fire tablets only because students will need flexibility to add apps that they may use in school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-back-to-school-monitor-deals">Best back-to-school monitor deals</h2>



<p>College dorm rooms and lecture halls don&rsquo;t offer an enormous amount of space for additional monitors, so there aren&rsquo;t as many back-to-school monitor deals as you otherwise might expect. Samsung, though, appears to be having a sale.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve (mostly) emphasized 60Hz displays, with a mix of 1080p and 4K. We&rsquo;ve included a gaming monitor, though, for those willing to spend a little more.

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Retailers often won&rsquo;t tell you when these sales end, though it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll be available into the first week of September. Students may go back to school and find they have the wrong equipment. Prices may change as retailer stock fluctuates. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;d expect that retailers will try to hold on to their sales until possibly September, though expect the quality and quantity of back-to-school deals to diminish as retailers sell through their available inventory. <em>Carpe diem</em>&hellip; or maybe <em>carpe</em> deal. (Sorry.)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-are-tax-free-weekends-scheduled">When are tax-free weekends scheduled?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Tax-free weekends are run by some U.S. states to encourage shopping, especially for items like back-to-school purchases that usually include computers. (Note: There are some price limits on certain purchases &mdash; in New Mexico, for example, PCs must be under $1,000 to qualify for the tax holiday.) </p>



<p>Five states&mdash;Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon&mdash;never charge sales tax. We&rsquo;ve listed the states that are scheduling tax-free weekends, as well as a link to the fine print. Virginia has cancelled their tax-free weekend for 2023.</p>



<p>For example, if you live in Arkansas and buy a laptop from Amazon on August 5, you won&rsquo;t pay sales tax. There are some exceptions that vary by state: In New Mexico, retailers aren&rsquo;t required to participate. Each state has different exemptions that apply to different products at different price ranges, and these discounts (generally) apply to national retailers. Check the details!</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>We have a lengthy overview of the advantages of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">Chromebooks versus laptops</a>, but the simple answer to this question is: whatever your school district tells you. </p>



<p>A Chromebook is better for school if your child will be working &ldquo;online,&rdquo; meaning in the classroom but on a website that&rsquo;s authorized by the teacher. A PC is more useful if your child will be using apps, such as Minecraft for Education, or transitioning from elementary school to middle school, or from middle school to high school. The extra flexibility to run apps (and, yes, games) will be appreciated by your child. Colleges and universities almost always ask their students to bring PCs or Macs with them, so a laptop is most appropriate.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-monitor-for-dorm-rooms">What should I look for in a monitor for dorm rooms?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Dorm rooms typically prioritize the efficient use of space, so laptops will be the most typical. Any way that you can use the extra space, though, is useful. A high-resolution display may mean that you can more effectively &ldquo;fit&rdquo; more information into the space with smaller fonts. But a monitor <em>mount</em>, like we&rsquo;ve included in our list of monitors, can clamp on to a desk and allow for a second display, which vastly increases productivity and can also be used to stream video for friends, too. Our back-to-school list of monitors includes both cheap 1080p options as well as 4K displays and even gaming displays for after hours.</p>
