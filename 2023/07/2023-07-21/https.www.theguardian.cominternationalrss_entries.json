Epalanga\u2019s wry account of immigrant life in Portugal (\u201cFrying chicken teriyaki for four euro an hour gave me a very real perspective on Europe\u201d) is tempered with memories of the civil war and colonialism that brought him there. But what expands the novel beyond memoir are the second and third parts, from the viewpoints of Sofia \u2013 Epalanga\u2019s wife back in Portugal \u2013 and Eyvind, a member of the Norwegian immigration police, whose story (\u201cWhy is arresting famous people always so complicated?\u201d) is at once chilling and enthralling.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/21/the-best-recent-translated-fiction-review-roundup\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/21/the-best-recent-translated-fiction-review-roundup", "date_published": "2023-07-21T11:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "India\u2019s ban on rice exports raises fear of global food price rises", "description": "<p>Attempt to curb domestic inflation behind country\u2019s decision on non-basmati white rice</p><p>India has introduced an immediate ban on non-basmati white rice exports to curb domestic inflation after heavy rains hit domestic crops, raising fears of further increases in global food prices.</p><p>The ban comes after a 20% duty on international exports introduced in September failed to curb foreign demand, which has soared after extreme climate conditions hit production in countries and demand rose on the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/20/rising-grain-prices-russia-pullout-black-sea-deal-food-crisis-fears\">grain supply disruptions</a> caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/21/india-ban-on-rice-exports-raises-fear-of-global-food-price-rises\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/21/india-ban-on-rice-exports-raises-fear-of-global-food-price-rises", "date_published": "2023-07-21T09:25:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Experience: Keanu Reeves \u2018crashed\u2019 my wedding", "description": "<p>I went outside and he was standing there, almost sheepish and shy</p><p>One of the bridesmaids was fixing my dress \u2013 my husband, James, had accidentally stepped on it as we walked in \u2013 when the wedding coordinator came up to me and said, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got a special guest outside.\u201d And I thought, \u201cReally?
