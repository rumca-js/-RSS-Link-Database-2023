Today, I catch up with Wētā Workshop's Sir Richard Taylor & Gino Acevedo as well as fan-favorite Middle-earth actor Jed Brophy to talk about their SDCC panel, their exciting new collectibles, over 20 years of working in Middle-earth, and whether they're ready for another go-round with potential new films!
