When we noticed the\nsmoke we opened three of the windows and put the fan in one of them\nblowing out.  You can see this on the chart, because CO2 (the yellow\nline) starts to fall.  Around 6:20 we stopped cooking, and you can see\nit almost immediately in the pm2.5 level (blue line).  The pm10 level\n(red line) is pegged at the maximum (1mg/m&#179;) so it's not clear if\nthis started falling at the same time, but they usually move together.\nYou can also see around 7:15 when we stopped eating dinner (nine\npeople, including two kids, one toddler, and one baby) and went\noutside, because CO2 levels fall again.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe can use that last phase to try to estimate how much the fan was\ndoing.  Zooming in on just that section and only showing CO2, here's\nactual CO2 vs modeling it as decreasing toward atmospheric by 18.5%\nper minute:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/co2-decrease-empty-room-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/co2-decrease-empty-room.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI think this is equal to 11 ACH: changing out 18.5% of the air each\nminute means the amount of air changed each hour is 60 * 18.5%.  If we\nguess the effective volume is 24x24x9 then that's consistent with the\nfan moving about 1,000 CFM which is plausible for a box fan.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile putting the box fan in the window does get the smoke out, pm2.5\nlevels still measured above an unhealthy level of 50&#181;g/m3 for\n~45min.  This is a pessimistic estimate, since one of the dining room\nwindows was open and the people were in the dining room, and the meter\nwas in the living room without any open windows.  Still, not so good.\nIdeally we'd have a proper exhaust hood: if the fan were pulling\ndirectly from where the smoke was being produced it probably would\nhave taken more like 500 CFM to keep up with it, instead of it taking\na fan twice as powerful to play catch-up.  We don't have any plans to\nredo the kitchen right now, but it does need to happen at some point\nand this is something I'll keep in mind!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn the mean time, aside from trying to remember to open the windows\nsooner, I'm going to try swapping out the fan for a more powerful one\nI have sitting spare in the basement.  And probably also run the air\npurifier when cooking smoky things.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(We only cook things this smoky about once a month, so this is a\nrelatively extreme example.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0etAmkXcBJzk76JFShDrt2F2SU9rFvSGDBJoMTU6msdoE3VgGngVWd7xbHpWvf2B5l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/vomstyu7cDdaWGsRF\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110753721508513914\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/cooking-air-quality", "date_published": "2023-07-21T08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
