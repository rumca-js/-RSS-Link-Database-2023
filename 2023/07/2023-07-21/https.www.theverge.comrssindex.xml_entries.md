  <p id="sv447d">Spotify is going to raise the price of its Premium subscription plan in the US, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-plans-to-raise-price-of-premium-plan-in-u-s-77c3f360?mod=latest_headlines">according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The price is “likely” to go up by $1, meaning it would cost $10.99 per month, and the change is “expected” to be revealed next week, the publication says. The price of Premium has remained $9.99 per month since it launched in the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/13/spotify-launching-8am-tomorrow-open-pre-registered-users">12 years ago</a>.</p>
<p id="EnzYTw">While perhaps not the most welcome news, it’s not entirely a surprise. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-spot-q3-earnings-report-2022-11666728321?mod=article_inline">has been signaling</a> that prices would go up in 2023 and reiterated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697866/spotify-overpay-fears-podcasts-siriusxm-own-renewal-tom-brady-ai">in April</a> that a price hike would be happening this year. Spotify didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p id="9P5hVS">Other music services have also increased prices to that $10.99 amount over the past several months. Apple...</p>

<p id="bDr1Wz">Sources tell CNBC that ESPN spoke with the NFL and NBA about a “variety of new partnerships and investment structures.” That could involve either sports league owning a stake in ESPN, which could help bolster the package of exclusive content on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23067682/disney-earnings-espn-streaming-direct-to-consumer">Disney’s vision of a streaming-only version of the sports network</a>.</p>

  <p id="rRv71d">Amazon is spending $120 million to build a new facility for its Project Kuiper satellites in Florida. On Thursday, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-kennedy-space-center-florida">the company announced</a> it will use the 100,000-square-foot building to prepare its internet satellites for their launch into space.</p>
<p id="xLnkq9">The building will be located at Space Florida’s Launch and Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, where NASA once landed its Space Shuttle missions. In addition to its large square footage, the facility will also feature a 100-foot-tall bay, giving Amazon plenty of room to integrate its satellites with rockets from Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and the United Launch Alliance (ULA).</p>

There’s only so much complexity you can embed in an experience where players aren’t conscious much of the time. Even still, after spending most of the past week with the gamified sleep tracking app tucked under my pillow, I can’t help but wish there were something more beyond looking at dozing Eevees and feeding berries to a Snorlax. It’s neither encouraging me to sleep more nor giving me much to do. It’s a bit of a snooze.</p>

  <p id="uqlWoo">The persistence of fare evasion on the New York City subway system has prompted the Metropolitan Transit Authority to install AI-powered surveillance software at several subway stations to track riders who avoid paying for a ticket. As <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/nyc-subway-using-ai-track-fare-evasion-rcna93045">reported by NBC News</a>, the MTA disclosed in a <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/111531">fare evasion report</a> that the tracking software was being used at seven undisclosed subway stations and eight physical fare barriers in May 2023, with plans for “approximately two dozen more stations” by year’s end and “more to follow.”</p>
<p id="AxXgSD">The MTA estimates it lost $285 million to subway fare evasion in 2022, according to the report, which didn’t contain the name of the third-party tracking software being utilized by the authority. MTA spokesperson Joana Flores...</p>

<p id="STfnOO">That said, before I tell you how to install it, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First off, watchOS 10 <em>is</em> a substantial update. Not only does it reintroduce widgets to the platform, but it also completely redesigns Apple’s native watch apps and reimagines how you interact with the device. The controls you’re used to have changed. Pressing the side button, for instance, now brings up Control Center while swiping up is how you access widgets. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="lO6F3o"><div></div></aside></div>

  <p id="szOmWw">The White House is bringing in AI’s top seven companies Friday to make a series of voluntary promises to protect users.    </p>
<p id="Iwmhtb">The companies — Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI — have all agreed to a series of asks from the White House to address many of the risks posed by artificial intelligence. The promises consist of investments in cybersecurity, discrimination research, and a new watermarking system informing users when content is AI-generated.  </p>
<p id="jzyVqQ">The companies have entered into these agreements voluntarily, so there are currently no consequences if they fail to live up to their promises. Many of these commitments are not expected to roll out on Friday, but the companies are expected to work on...</p>

  <p id="5WIeHG">Reddit is now in charge of r/malefashionadvice, which for a time was the biggest subreddit still closed in protest of the platform’s API pricing changes. The subreddit is now open, meaning Reddit users can browse content in the community once again, though in a restricted mode, meaning only certain users can make new posts.</p>
<p id="7FYSoW">As we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/13/23794110/reddit-male-fashion-advice-protest-discord-substack">reported last week</a>, the moderators of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/">r/malefashionadvice</a>, a subreddit with than 5 million subscribers, had taken the community private and were pushing its users toward Discord and Substack instead. At the time, the moderators expected to be removed after receiving a message from a Reddit admin (employee), ModCodeofConduct, telling them they would be replaced if they didn’t reopen.</p>
