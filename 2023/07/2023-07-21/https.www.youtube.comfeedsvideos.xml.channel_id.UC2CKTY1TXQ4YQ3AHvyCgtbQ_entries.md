I want an Inquisitor to ally in with my Imperial Guard in Warhammer 40k - but NOT the GW one. I want something more to my liking, so it's time to kitbash!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
