Sadly, Killsquad falls woefully short on that front in more ways than one. \n\nComing to PlayStation consoles four years on from its original PC launch, Killsquad does deliver some passing enjoyment in short bursts thanks to its snappy twin stick shooting, but from its progression and loot mechanics to the bland level design, from the uninspired mission objectives to the virtually nonexistent story, the game fails to make any kind of a lasting impression in nearly every key area. Though not completely without some strengths of its own, when all is said and done, the final product here is entirely too forgettable.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAX6FfWceCk", "date_published": "2023-07-21T17:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zAX6FfWceCk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Remnant 2 - 15 THINGS IT DOESN'T TELL YOU", "description": "Gunfire Games' Remnant: From the Ashes was already a challenging experience, but Remnant 2 takes that even further.
