Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Andrew Doyle discuss the intentional irrationality of far-left doctrines using religious rhetoric despite the absence of God, their paramount desire to dismantle societal structures, regardless of need or merit, the argument for transcendence inherent in the pursuit of art, and how woke culture stifles genuine expression, forcing dogma in the place of fundamental truths. 

Andrew Doyle is a writer, broadcaster and comedian.  His latest book is The New Puritans: How the Religion of Social Justice Captured the Western World.  He is also the author of Free Speech and Why It Matters, and has written two books under the name of his satirical character Titania McGrath – Woke: A Guide to Social Justice and My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism.
