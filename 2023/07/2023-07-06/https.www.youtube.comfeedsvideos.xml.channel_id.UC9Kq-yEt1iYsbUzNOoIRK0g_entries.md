What if an older Indiana Jones came back for one last big adventure? Wouldn’t that be crazy? Well wonder no more, because that movie came out 15 years ago and it was called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. But wait, what if an older Indiana Jones came back for one last big adventure AGAIN? Ahhh well if that sounds like a good time, you’re in luck!

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny definitely raises some questions. Like did they copy/paste this premise from The Force Awakens? Why do all older Harrison Ford characters now have terrible lives? How did Zoller survive without a scratch the exact thing that took out Dennis Hopper in Speed? How do these bad guys keep knowing where to pop out? How hard to Helena punch Indy to drag him from Ancient Greece all the way to New York City?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny!
