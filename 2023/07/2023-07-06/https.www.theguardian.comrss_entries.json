Now he has created a kind of wordless eulogy: Beside the Sea, which had its first UK performance at the <a href=\"https://spitalfieldsmusic.org.uk/events/spitalfields-music-festival-2023/\">Spitalfields music festival</a> after several in Ireland. Fifty minutes long, it\u2019s a solo music-theatre piece that is simultaneously a tribute to Wilson\u2019s father\u2019s passions, an examination of his long decline through Alzheimer\u2019s and a wider rumination on identity and loss.</p><p>The protagonist is not a representation of Wilson or his father but a female violinist, Du\u0161ica Mladenovi\u0107. Directed by Olivia Songer, she moves and plays on a small stage designed by Jack Scullion that looks like the interior of a fisher\u2019s hut, but with a guitar, sheet music and vinyl records hanging where you would expect ropes and buckets. There is the suggestion of ageing in Mladenovi\u0107\u2019s movements, initially perky, later weary \u2013 the hint of a journey through life. She plays alongside a soundtrack made by Wilson in collaboration with Steve McCourt, built on the noises of the things Wilson\u2019s father loved: the sea, the creak of a sailing boat, the clank of tools in a workshop, the strum of his guitar. Among these we hear recordings of the male choir he sang with for 40 years, and, most poignantly, of his wife, Wilson\u2019s mother, a professional singer whose voice is one of the last things he recognised.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/beside-the-sea-review-rich-mix-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/beside-the-sea-review-rich-mix-london", "date_published": "2023-07-06T10:28:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Shell boss under fire for saying cutting fossil fuel production is \u2018dangerous\u2019", "description": "<p>CEO Wael Sawan attacked by climate campaigners after comments defending the expansion of oil and gas</p><p>Climate campaigners have condemned as \u201ccynical\u201d comments from the boss of energy company Shell suggesting that cutting the world\u2019s oil and gas production would be dangerous and irresponsible.</p><p>Wael Sawan claimed in an interview that reducing fossil fuel production, which is considered crucial in limiting the rise in global temperatures, risked worsening the cost of living crisis by limiting global energy supplies and pushing up bills.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/06/shell-boss-under-fire-for-saying-cutting-fossil-fuel-production-is-dangerous-wael-sawan-climate\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/06/shell-boss-under-fire-for-saying-cutting-fossil-fuel-production-is-dangerous-wael-sawan-climate", "date_published": "2023-07-06T10:26:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Summer flopbusters: why have Indiana Jones and The Flash bombed at the box office?", "description": "<p>A de-aged Harrison Ford battling Nazis and a double helping of Batmen in The Flash have not proved sufficient for either of these \u2018tentpole\u2019 releases</p><p>It is thought that the Antikythera mechanism, rebranded the \u201cdial of destiny\u201d in the latest Indiana Jones movie, was a device invented by the ancient Greeks to predict eclipses and monitor the movement of the sun.

These single-storey dwellings are often thought of as sturdy and sensible, and are rarely considered to be glamorous or lovely. In 2007, the then Prince Charles <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-473917/Laurence-Llewelyn-Bowen-Prince-Charles-mock-bungalows-I-love-them.html\">called bungalows \u201chomogenised boxes\u201d</a> and accused them of ruining the natural beauty of the Highlands landscape.

I am as surprised as anyone to hear that they\u2019re \u201cseriously cool\u201d, though I have long harboured suspicions that they are far better than their reputation would suggest. Noted enthusiasts before me include Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who in 1882 was encouraged to move to <a href=\"http://www.birchingtonheritage.org.uk/articles/rossetti.htm\">one of the first bungalows</a> built in Britain, in the hope that the Kent air might improve his ailing health.
