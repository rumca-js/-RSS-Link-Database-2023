I remember when I was growing up a lot of parents would tell their kids to be careful about artificially sweetened things because they could cause all sorts of nasty conditions. In my teens a friend’s mother was convinced that her daughter’s Diet Coke habit was going to give her no end of issues later in life.</p><p>The latest news is no different.
