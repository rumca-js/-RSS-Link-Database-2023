Hafursey was used by the farmers for sheep grazing all year around during summers until 1854. The Sel (a natural cave used for shelter) inside is one of the best-preserved remnants in the history of Iceland. In 1755, when Katla erupted, six men took shelter in the cave during the glacier burst. Their signatures, plus the date and year of their stay there, are written on the wall and are clearly visible as you enter the cave. \n\nYet what makes Hafursey such a unique location is also the sublime diversity of wild, extraterrestrial landscapes that compose the area. The lonely Inselberg is surrounded by vast valleys of volcanic sand, sanders, glaciers, and waterfalls that render one of the most special, almost lunar sceneries in the world.\n\n\u261e About Hafursey (Yfir)\n\n\u00ab Yfir \u00bb (\"Above\") is a musical journey through Iceland's various moods and seasons. At times, the music swells with a powerful surge, mirroring the crashing waves against rocky cliffs or the thunderous roar of a distant volcano. Other moments evoke a sense of stillness and serenity, echoing the peacefulness found in secluded valleys and hidden fjords near the inselberg of Hafursey.\n\nThe song is the continuation of another track written by \u00d3lafur, Undir: \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing Undir for 5 years, and rearranged it every time for each set, changing every element one by one. Last year, we realized the latest version of Undir was not the same track that the one we originally composed!  On  the  occasion  of  our  Show  with  Cercle,  I  decided  to  take  the  track  back  to  the  studio, rearranging it especially for the Show to meet Cercle\u2019s energy\u201d.\n\n______\n\nOfficial Partners: \nWe were lucky to be supported by the audio brand Bang & Olufsen on this show: https://on.beo.com/rlmrvL \nThey lent us the Beoplay H95 headphones, which Derek and \u00d3lafur used during their interview alongside the A9 speaker behind them (with its iconic shape!). \nThe Beoplay EX earbuds were offered to \u00d3lafur in the Mystery box. Thanks guys! \n\nSpecial thanks to:\nSven Hasenj\u00e4ger, \u00c1rni \u00de\u00f3r \u00c1rnason, Beth Lawson, David Heath, Benedict Curran, Laura Monks, Lee Barter, Natalie Rapp, Jessica Graham-Wright, Yung-Yee Chen, Robert Raths, Courtesy of Erased Tapes Records Ltd., Luxor Iceland, Teitur Sigur\u00f0sson, \u00d3li Valur \u00derastarson, Marcos Viladomiu, George Papageorgiou, Cerys Weetch, Elli Thor Magnusson\n\n______\n\nFollow us on http://www.cercle.io", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMCiAKNUpTY", "date_published": "2023-07-06T14:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
