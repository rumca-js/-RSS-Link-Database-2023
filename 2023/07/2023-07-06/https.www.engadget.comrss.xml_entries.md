<p>French law enforcement may soon have far-reaching authority to snoop on alleged criminals. Lawmakers in France's National Assembly have <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html">passed</a> a bill that lets police surveil suspects by remotely activating cameras, microphones and GPS location systems on phones and other devices. A judge will have to approve use of the powers, and the recently amended bill forbids use against journalists, lawyers and other &quot;sensitive professions,&quot; according to <em>Le Monde</em>. The measure is also meant to limit use to serious cases, and only for a maximum of six months. Geolocation would be limited to crimes that are punishable by at least five years in prison.</p><p>An earlier version of the bill passed the Senate, but the amendment will require that legislative body's approval before it can become law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Civil liberties advocates are alarmed. The digital rights group La Quadrature du Net previously <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/05/31/transformer-les-objets-connectes-en-mouchards-la-surenchere-securitaire-du-gouvernement/">pointed</a> out the potential for abuse. As the bill isn't clear about what constitutes a serious crime, there are fears the French government might use this to target environmental activists and others who aren't grave threats. The organization also notes that worrying security policies have a habit of expanding to less serious  crimes. Genetic registration was only used for sex offenders at first, La Quadrature says, but is now being used for most crimes.</p><p>The group further notes that the remote access may depend on security vulnerabilities. Police would be exploiting security holes instead of telling manufacturers how to patch those holes, La Quadrature says.</p><p>Justice Minister Éric Dupond-Moretti says the powers would only be used for &quot;dozens&quot; of cases per year, and that this was &quot;far away&quot; from the surveillance state of Orwell's <em>1984</em>. It will save lives, the politician argues.</p><p>The legislation comes as concerns about government device surveillance are growing. There's been a backlash against NSO Group, whose Pegasus spyware has allegedly been misused to spy on dissidents, activists and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pegasus-spyware-found-on-phones-of-mexican-presidents-close-ally-154511274.html">even politicians</a>. While the French bill is more focused, it's not exactly reassuring to those worried about government overreach.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/french-assembly-passes-bill-allowing-police-to-remotely-activate-phone-cameras-and-microphones-for-surveillance-210539401.html?src=rss

## Twitter threatens to sue Meta over the new Threads app

<p>Twitter isn't exactly happy about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html">Meta's Threads app</a>, a new text-based Instagram sibling. As <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/06/2023/twitter-is-threatening-to-sue-meta-over-threads"><em>Semafor</em></a> reports, Twitter has threatened legal action against Meta, accusing it of poaching former employees and unlawfully misappropriating trade secrets and intellectual property.</p><p>“Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,” Alex Spiro, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-alex-spiro-232831688.html">Elon Musk's personal lawyer</a>, wrote <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ifn0l6bs/production/27109f01431939c8177d408d3c9848c3b46632cd.pdf">in a letter to Meta</a>. “Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice to prevent any further retention, disclosure, or use of its intellectual property by Meta.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spiro, who is acting on behalf of Twitter parent X Corp, claims that Meta has hired dozens of ex-Twitter employees over the last year. He claimed the company &quot;deliberately assigned&quot; them to work on Threads &quot;with the specific intent that they use Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property in order to accelerate development of Meta's competing app.&quot; He argued this violates state and federal laws as well as those employees' obligations to their former employer. In addition, Spiro said Meta is prohibited from scraping Twitter data relating to who people follow.&nbsp;</p><p>Engadget has contacted Meta for comment. The company told <em>Semafor </em>that Spiro's claims were baseless and that no members of the Threads engineering team were ex-Twitter employees.</p><p>For the time being, Threads users need to sign up for the app with their Instagram profile. It's an easy process that helped Meta quickly sign up tens of millions of users. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-gained-10-million-new-users-in-seven-hours-090838140.html">30 million people had joined Threads by Thursday morning</a>, just over 12 hours after the app went live.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-threatens-to-sue-meta-over-the-new-threads-app-191141961.html?src=rss

<p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> has been available for digital purchase and download from various sources for a little while now. The film will be available to rent starting July 11th on services such as Apple TV and Amazon Video.

But for those who prefer (or already subscribed to a ton of) streaming services, the movie will be hitting Peacock on August 3rd, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/the-super-mario-bros-movie-streaming-premiere-date-peacock-1235431016/"><em><ins>Deadline</ins></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite some earlier mixed reviews, most fans seemed to like it overall. <em>The Super Mario Bros.

When we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-fun-safe-romp-135146207.html"><ins>checked the movie out</ins></a>, our reviewer Devindra Hardwar thought that it was great for all ages with endless references that didn’t take you out of the movie if you’re not a diehard Nintendo fan. Its A-List cast includes Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad and Chris Pratt as the lovable Mario. The movie follows the Mario Bros struggling to get their Brooklyn-based plumbing business off the ground.

## ‘Pokémon Sleep’ is coming later this month and there’s a ‘gameplay’ trailer to prove it

<p>It’s been a whopping four years since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-28-pokemon-sleep.html"><em><ins>Pokémon Sleep</ins></em><ins> was announced,</ins></a> in the wake of the Pokémon Company’s success with <em>Pokémon Go.</em> For a while everyone thought the bizarre sleep tracking app would disappear into the dustbin of vaporware history, but there’s a brand-new ‘gameplay’ trailer and an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/pokemon-sleep-and-pokemon-go-plus-coming-summer-2023"><ins>approximate release date of late July.</ins></a></p><p>We put gameplay in italics because this isn’t a game. It’s a sleep-tracking app with a Pokémon skin. The app pairs you with the snooze-loving Snorlax. You increase your bond with the giant oaf by, you’ll never guess, sleeping. Getting a good night’s sleep increases your score and allows Snorlax to siphon “drowsy power” from your poor, lifeless husk. In return, more tired Pokémon visit and gift you rare sleep styles. Rinse and repeat until your “Sleep Style Dex” is filled to the brim. Gotta catch 'em all.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can also moderately increase your bond with Snorlax by feeding it berries and specialized drinks, but that won’t bring exhausted Pokémon like Slowpoke and Diglett to your “sleep island.” That requires rest and accurate sleep tracking.</p><div id="23a92cbab9e54d0699ff71329b26de1e"></div><p>To that end, the sleep tracking capabilities seem fairly robust, leveraging your phone’s microphone and accelerometer sensors to see how much you toss and turn or if you snore. Your personal sleep style seems to inform which pocket monsters come to visit. For instance, if you toss and turn all night, expect Togepi to impart its “Rocking Sleep” style. If you snore, Jigglypuff will offer a song via its signature “Singing Sleep” style. The company hasn’t noted which Pokémon comes to visit if you lay in bed all night staring at your phone surrounded by potato chips, nor have they stated why a sleep tracker took over four years to develop.</p><p>The app is a walled-garden and doesn’t integrate with any fitness tracking or sleep tracking apps. It does, however, pair up with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-17-pokemon-go-plus-hands-on.html"><ins>Pokémon Go Plus bracelet,</ins></a> letting users begin sleep tracking by pushing a button on the device. Using the bracelet also encourages a rare visit from a nightcap-wearing Pikachu. A bracelet costs around $30 and the forthcoming <em>Pokémon Sleep </em>is a free app.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-sleep-is-coming-later-this-month-and-theres-a-gameplay-trailer-to-prove-it-182444048.html?src=rss

## The US is destroying the world's last known chemical weapons stockpile

<p>All of the the world's governments will, at least officially, be out of the chemical weapons business. The US Army <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/chemical-weapons-stockpile.html">tells</a><em>The New York Times</em> it should finish destroying the world's last declared chemical weapons stockpile as soon as tomorrow, July 7th. The US and most other nations agreed to completely eliminate their arsenals within 10 years after the Chemical Weapons Convention took effect in 1997, but the sheer size of the American collection (many of the warheads are several decades old) and the complexity of safe disposal left the country running late.</p><p>The current method relies on robots that puncture, drain and wash the chemical-laden artillery shells and rockets, which are then baked to render them harmless. The drained gas is diluted in hot water and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-18-chemical-weapons-destroyed-metal-compound.html">neutralized</a> either with bacteria (for mustard gas) or caustic soda (for nerve agents). The remaining liquid is then incinerated. Teams use X-rays to check for leaks before destruction starts, and they remotely monitor robots to minimize contact with hazardous material.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Army initially wanted to dispose of the weapons by sinking them on ships, as it had quietly done before, but faced a public backlash over the potential environmental impact. Proposals to incinerate chemical agents in the 1980s also met with objections, although the military ultimately destroyed a large chunk of the stockpile that way.</p><p>The US last used chemical weapons in World War I, but kept producing them for decades as a deterrent. Attention to the program first spiked in 1968, when strange sheep deaths led to revelations that the Army was storing chemical weapons across the US and even testing them in the open.</p><p>This measure will only wipe out confirmed stockpiles. Russia has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/europe/russia-chemical-weapons-novichok.html">accused</a> of secretly making nerve gas despite insisting that it destroyed its last chemical weapons in 2017. Pro-government Syrian military forces and ISIS extremists used the weapons throughout much of the 2010s. This won't stop hostile countries and terrorists from using the toxins.</p><p>Even so, this is a major milestone. In addition to wiping out an entire category of weapons of mass destruction, it represents another step toward reduced lethality in war. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-objects-to-ukraine-starlink-drones-215629197.html">Drones</a> reduce the exposure for their operators (though not the targets), and experts like AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton envision an era <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-isnt-convinced-good-ai-will-triumph-over-bad-ai-181536702.html">when robots fight each other</a>. While humanity would ideally end war altogether, efforts like these at least reduce the casualties.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-us-is-destroying-the-worlds-last-known-chemical-weapons-stockpile-181026211.html?src=rss

## Simogo tries to explain the mysteries of ‘Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’

<p>Generally, the game-creation process begins with a mechanic. There tends to be an input method that developers want to explore, or maybe even a storyline that they think will be particularly powerful in an interactive setting. There’s usually a central theme grounded in a genre like “first-person shooter” or “isometric roguelike,” and the game comes together within this framework, its details and proper nouns crystalizing along the way.</p><p>In the case of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, Simogo started with the name.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“There wasn't a single <em>a-ha</em> moment,” Simogo co-founder Simon Flesser told Engadget. “We had the title which we really liked, and from there we have been trying to figure out what laser eyes are.”</p><figure><img alt="Lorelei and the Laser Eyes" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2de91e01-1c14-11ee-a3dc-fc969b6bdc46" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Simogo</div></figure><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is the ninth major game from Simogo, the acclaimed Swedish studio that’s responsible for <em>Device 6</em>, <em>Year Walk </em>and <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-direct-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-simogo-sayonara-wild-hearts-annapurna-interactive-161543878.html">Simogo revealed <em>Lorelei</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>in June 2022 with a noir-inspired trailer promising a murder mystery, a maze of deceptions and a palace of memories. A smartly dressed woman moves languidly behind the trailer’s text, eyes glowing red as she navigates the monochromatic grounds of a large estate.</p><p>Simogo didn’t divulge a ton of detail about <em>Lorelei </em>at its debut, and it hasn’t provided much clarity in the year since. The game’s latest trailer includes the years 1847, 1963 and 2014, and it hints at international espionage with a paranormal twist, emphasizing the player’s ability to recognize patterns and solve puzzles. “Do you remember the maze?” the trailer asks, over and over again.</p><p>So, here are some basic details about <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, directly from Flesser:</p><ul><li><p>It’s a third-person puzzle adventure.</p></li><li><p>It’s non-linear.</p></li><li><p>There are nearly 150 puzzles to solve.</p></li><li><p>It’s coming to PC and Switch.</p></li><li><p>It’s set in the “surreal memory of a house.”</p></li></ul><p></p><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> plays with cameras in a 3D space, drawing from the best ideas in <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> with shifting mechanics and perspectives. It feels mysterious because, well, that’s what it is.</p><p>“The project has been transformative to make, which reflects in its themes,” Flesser said. “It's not a singular concept, it's rather more of a collection of ideas over a long time. Thematically, there are a lot of ideas about stories within stories, stories reflecting each other, memories, dreams and parallel events and worlds.”</p><figure><img alt="Lorelei and the Laser Eyes" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2de91e00-1c14-11ee-b6a8-d4c1ad910c51" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Simogo</div></figure><p>Players will interact with objects including cameras, computers and locks; they’ll read passages from books and magazines; they’ll play games within games, according to Flesser.</p><p>“We're trying to instill a feeling of things not being what they seem,” he said. “Not dread, but a constant feeling of ambivalence, a story in which there is no good or evil. And a sense of absurdity — finding yourself in a strange situation in which you will eventually start questioning what is happening and what is not.”</p><p>Simogo wants to mess with your mind, basically. This is kind of the studio’s jam — its previous games like <em>Year Walk</em>, <em>The Sailor’s Dream</em> and <em>Device 6</em> successfully toyed with surrealism and paranormal events.</p><p>“I think there is something interesting that happens when you start blending realities,” Flesser said. “When [a piece of] media starts talking about our reality as if it is a story within its reality, it ends up becoming more real somehow. It creeps into your head in a very specific way. You become the story.”</p><div id="1060e81182514bf7a5bb590359614775"></div><p>There’s no release date for <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, but it’s being published by Annapurna Interactive and it's due out in 2024 on PC and Switch. The game’s second trailer landed last week: At the end, a series of maze blocks flash across the screen, positioned as if they’re words in a sentence. It feels like a challenge, or maybe an invitation, to solve one of Lorelei’s puzzles. It feels like the game has already begun.</p><p>At least one person on Steam claims they’ve translated the maze blocks into a complete thought, and their result seems to fit appropriately (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2008920/discussions/0/3809531058949238993/">linked here</a>, for those curious). I asked Flesser for a correct translation of the mystery blocks and he didn’t provide one. Instead, he said simply, “Everything is a puzzle.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/simogo-tries-to-explain-the-mysteries-of-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-161941692.html?src=rss

## New York is getting the first ever Angry Birds cafe

<p>To give you an idea how old <em>Angry Birds</em> is, it arrived on iOS, webOS and something called Maemo 5 (?) before it even came to Android, according to our <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-ever-angry-birds-retail-cafe-launching-in-nyc-301870951.html">2010 review</a>. Not only is it still around over 13 years later, but developer Rovio is being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-776-million-095400749.html">purchased by Sega</a> for around $776 million. And on top of all that, Rovio is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-ever-angry-birds-retail-cafe-launching-in-nyc-301870951.html">opening the first <em>Angry Birds</em>-themed restaurant</a> on Friday (July 8th). Called &quot;iSwii by Angry birds,&quot; it'll be located within the Food Court at Tangram's new mall in Flushing, Queens, NY — ready to fling cakes, pastries and other treats into your mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>Partnering with construction outfit SCG America, Rovio promises &quot;endless culinary treats, bright visuals, newest Angry Birds Games and interactive technology.&quot; Its decorated with &quot;Instagrammable&quot; NYC-themed statue installations outside the entrance, a ceiling mural, terrazzo counter and flooring that looks like dessert sprinkles. You'll also see &quot;nest-like wicker and hanging chairs, bird paradise graphic wall coverings, and tropical plants on the shelving units where hatchlings, the baby birds wander around.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>No menu was shown, but the press release mentions &quot;yummy seasonal holiday cakes and pastries,&quot; and the provided photo shows mostly deserts, candies and other sweets. It's also hosting private parties in &quot;nests&quot; or &quot;rooms that will offer Angry Birds VR games &amp; treats, including customizable Angry Birds-themed gift bags for party goers.&nbsp;</p><p>We're not sure if people will embrace a restaurant based on a game that peaked around 2015 with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-23-the-angry-birds-movie-trailer.html"><em>Angry Birds Movie</em></a>. In any case, Sega's purchase for three-quarters of a billion dollars shows the IP still has value, and the app has over 5 billion downloads to date — plus, the restaurant has a 2013 vibe that could make it a big nostalgia draw.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-york-is-getting-the-first-ever-angry-birds-cafe-130421618.html?src=rss

## The best Windows laptops for 2023

<p>One of the best things about the Windows PC landscape is the sheer amount of diversity. Laptops range from tiny 8-inch handhelds to huge 18-inch (or larger) gaming behemoths and beyond. And if there’s a specific feature (like a touchscreen or stylus input) that you really need, there’s a great chance you’ll be able to find it on a notebook that works for you. However, that abundance of choice can also make it difficult to know where to start when shopping. And before you even begin to search, it’s critical that you consider what you’re planning to do with your new laptop. If your main focus is on general productivity, a sleek ultraportable is all you need. But if you’re looking to edit photos and videos or play AAA games, you may want a bigger system with discrete graphics. That said, there’s a handful of general criteria we look for when selecting our top picks.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>The challenge when thinking about performance is figuring out your sweet spot. That’s because while a laptop with blazing speed is nice, you may be paying for more <em>oomph</em> than you need. But if you skimp and get a weak processor, even simple tasks can become a chore and you might end up in a situation where you need to upgrade again sooner than you’d like. Performance is more than just clockspeeds too, so we also consider things like fast wake times, storage speeds and more advanced features like support for ray tracing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Display and webcams</h2><p>Regardless of whether a notebook has a touchscreen or a more traditional panel, we look for bright displays (300+ nits or more) that are easy use outdoors or in sunny rooms, accurate colors and wide viewing angles. Screens with high refresh rates are great for competitive gamers, while those with wider color gamuts are important for content creation. And even if you don’t plan on spending a ton of time on video calls, every laptop needs a decent webcam (1080p or higher).</p><h2>Ports and connectivity</h2><p>Even with advancements in cellular modems and WiFi, dedicated ports for transferring data or connecting peripherals can make or break a laptop. Ideally, all but the thinnest and lightest systems come with three USB ports, while things like built-in SD card readers can be extremely handy when trying to import media from a camera. And if a notebook is saddled with a slow or outdated WiFi modem (we’re looking for Wi-Fi 6 or later), that’s basically an immediate disqualification.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how powerful a laptop is if it conks out when you need it the most. Typically we look for runtimes of at least eight hours on a charge, but longer is always better. That said, on gaming machines with thirsty GPUs, you may have to settle for a bit less. And on bigger machines, it’s also important to consider if the system can charge via USB-C or if it needs a larger, proprietary power brick.</p><h2>The best Windows laptops</h2><h2>Best overall: XPS 13</h2><p></p><p>It’s no surprise that we love the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMveHBzLTEzLWxhcHRvcC9zcGQveHBzLTEzLTkzMTUtbGFwdG9wL3huOTMxNWZxcnhzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MGNhZjhhZC1iZGVhLTQzOTItOWEwYS02NmZkNTVkNTU5ODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYK49lKBGnstkHMPO3LXblFvLD9JIuUqXj2aD04MWqs2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9315-laptop%2Fxn9315fqrxs">Dell XPS 13</a>. It’s thin, light and it has one of the best screens you can find on a 13-inch ultraportable. And while the XPS 13 doesn’t have the fastest CPU around, a 12th-gen Intel chip is more than enough for basic productivity work. The latest XPS 13 model is the slimmest yet, though it loses the headphone jack in the process. If you need a 3.5mm port, or you’re just looking to save some money, it’s also worth considering the slightly older XPS 13 models. And if you want to future-proof your next laptop a bit more, consider the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMvbmV3LXhwcy0xMy1wbHVzLWxhcHRvcC9zcGQveHBzLTEzLTkzMjAtbGFwdG9wL3VzZXhjcGJ0czkzMjBnaGh6IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MGNhZjhhZC1iZGVhLTQzOTItOWEwYS02NmZkNTVkNTU5ODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXNJkvGZ6kvvqlyz9V9Bb3SFd0XOcW5sESf3AWNCyKV-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-plus-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9320-laptop%2Fusexcpbts9320ghhz">XPS 13 Plus</a>, which comes with 13th-gen Intel processors and is currently the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html">best Windows laptop for college students</a> in our book.</p><h2>Best budget Windows laptop: Acer Aspire 5</h2><p></p><p>There’s a reason we selected the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BY2VyLUE1MTUtNTYtMzJESy1EaXNwbGF5LWkzLTExMTVHNC1Qcm9jZXNzb3IvZHAvQjBCTDg2Vk03Ri8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMW16LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MGNhZjhhZC1iZGVhLTQzOTItOWEwYS02NmZkNTVkNTU5ODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeP5o8pJOFDjWLcG4z3iQ2IOInXjg8abgxPJzpnjErvB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAcer-A515-56-32DK-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BL86VM7F%2F">Acer Aspire 5</a> as our top choice in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">best cheap Windows laptop guide</a>: It’s sturdy, fast enough and offers decent battery life. We typically don’t expect much with laptops under $500, but the Aspire 5 has consistently been a solid performer. It’s an ideal laptop for students or kids, or for anyone who isn’t particularly demanding. We’re also surprised by the wide variety of ports it offers, including HDMI <em>and</em> Ethernet. While we normally don’t recommend laptops with just 8GB of RAM and tiny 128GB SSDs, those specs are more excusable in the Aspire 5 since it’s so darn cheap.

That said unless you’re deeply familiar with using Windows on ARM-based systems, we’d recommend sticking with the Intel-powered version instead of the model based on Microsoft’s SQ3 chip.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html"><strong>Read our full review of the Microsoft Surface Pro 9</strong></a></p><h2>Best powerful thin-and-light: MSI Stealth Studio</h2><p></p><p>Regardless of if you’re editing videos or playing games, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4387ed04-0e34-4f98-9985-dfc1e1b53079&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Micro+Center&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0Mzg3ZWQwNC0wZTM0LTRmOTgtOTk4NS1kZmMxZTFiNTMwNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9jZW50ZXIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QvNjY0OTM1L21zaS1zdGVhbHRoLTE0LXN0dWRpby1hMTN2Zi0wNjR1cy0xNC1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wLWNvbXB1dGVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MGNhZjhhZC1iZGVhLTQzOTItOWEwYS02NmZkNTVkNTU5ODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWyuxoef6GND_4bS9iwrTZOYfemyRbrZx8zOdXrgu6Ft&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microcenter.com%2Fproduct%2F664935%2Fmsi-stealth-14-studio-a13vf-064us-14-gaming-laptop-computer">MSI’s Stealth 14 Studio</a> packs a lot of power in a very portable package.

## The Morning After: Meta’s Twitter rival, Threads, is finally here

<p>As teased, Meta’s launched its Twitter rival, timed perfectly to capitalize on the latter’s recent struggles and contractions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html">Threads</a> has started rolling out worldwide, though it won’t be available in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-twitter-rival-threads-wont-initially-launch-in-the-eu-090314803.html">European Union</a> until the company addresses potential regulatory concerns.</p><p>Some basic features are missing – the sort of thing Twitter (and normal Instagram) is already capable of. That includes hashtags (!), account switching on the same device and post editing. The company described Threads as a “separate space for real-time updates and public conversations,” which relies on users’ Instagram credentials but will eventually be compatible with a wider swath of decentralized services like Mastodon.</p><p>If you haven’t tried it already, you log in to Threads with your existing Instagram account – or make a new one. Usernames and verification status carry over, although you can tweak your bio and profile if you want to change it up from your Instagram one. It’s all very old Twitter in style, with support for text posts up to 500 characters, as well as photos and videos. Threads will also support reposts — its version of a retweet — as well as quote posts. Users can limit their replies and block and report other users, thankfully.</p><p>At this early stage, Threads is a reminder for all the users on Instagram that I muted long ago. Remember, just because you can post something to Threads, you don’t have to.

## Threads gained 10 million new users in seven hours

<p>Meta's Twitter rival Threads <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html">just went live</a> and has already exceeded 10 million signups within the first seven hours, according to (<a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuWNIVrt78c">a Thread by</a>) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The app is now available globally (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-twitter-rival-threads-wont-initially-launch-in-the-eu-090314803.html">except in Europe</a>), with the rapid signup pace showing Meta's enormous ability to scale up compared to other Twitter rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-begins-offering-custom-domains-in-its-bid-to-remain-ad-free-071922355.html">Bluesky</a> — which still requires invite codes.&nbsp;</p><p>To, er, mark the occasion, Zuckerberg tweeted for the first time in over a decade with the classic Spider-Man standoff picture (showing that unlike Elon Musk, he actually knows how memes work). &quot;10 million signups in seven hours,&quot; he added on Threads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="505525f466854170916437a049b27e8e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/MbMxUWiQgp">pic.twitter.com/MbMxUWiQgp</a></p>— Mark Zuckerberg (@finkd) <a href="https://twitter.com/finkd/status/1676747594460962817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>With Threads, Meta is taking on Twitter and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html">alternatives </a>like Mastodon. It's under the purview of Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, who is planning to make Threads compatible with ActivityPub. That's the source protocol that powers Mastodon and other decentralized services sometimes collectively referred to as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/leaving-twitters-walled-garden">“Fediverse.”</a></p><p>Threads is strongly tied to Instagram and built on the same platform, giving Meta an effective way to advertise it. Any users who pre-ordered the app on iOS received a push notification when Threads went live, another move that no doubt boosted signups.&nbsp;</p><p>The site is not without early teething issues, though. The biggest complaint is the lack of a chronological, following-only feed, with users stuck with whatever the Threads algorithm decides to push their way. (&quot;95 percent of the posts I see are completely irrelevant to me,&quot; <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVzkVySv9F">complained one user</a>). It also lacks post editing (which Facebook and Instagram both have), hashtags, account switching and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Mosseri has addressed all those issues, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVlg88I84C/">posting on Threads</a> that a following-only feature is &quot;on the list.&quot; He said the same about <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVgdSOoGY9/">post editing</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVe8ViJ132/">account switching</a>, and added that hashtags will be tappable <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVfly1oARY/">&quot;in time</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Threads has already signed up 10 million users" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/6c0c6970-1bd9-11ee-bb9f-0dd7ebc768da" style="height: 317px; width: 679px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Another key problem for many users is the lack of a web version of Threads. Much like Instagram was for a long time, Threads is read-only on browsers, with posting limited to the iOS and Android apps (Mosseri has yet to address this). Finally, the design of Threads seems to be a love it or hate it affair, with some users finding the layout less intuitive than Twitter.</p><p>Verification remains another key talking point. Elon Musk famously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-pulling-legacy-blue-verification-checkmarks-205010576.html">changed Twitter's system</a> so that only Twitter Blue subscribers would receive the blue check mark (or very notable public figures and news sites). That made the experience less enjoyable for many users, as it became difficult to tell who was an official athlete, celebrity, journalist, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, only users verified on Instagram (and not Facebook) have received the blue badge on Threads. While Instagram verification is notoriously more difficult to get, it's largely held by influencers and creators. But Threads is positioned as a discussion site and will likely be focused on news (if it's to compete with Twitter), so it might make sense to allow Facebook verified users to also be verified on Threads — or create an all-new verification system.</p><p>In any case, it's still early days for Threads and the app will no doubt change substantially in the near future. It's clear that users have strong opinions — whether Meta listens to them or not will be an interesting story over the next few months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/threads-gained-10-million-new-users-in-seven-hours-090838140.html?src=rss

## Bluesky begins offering custom domains in its bid to remain ad-free

<p>The Jack Dorsey-backed decentralized social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html">Bluesky</a> has launched a paid domain service in <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">partnership with Namecheap</a> as a way for users to verify their identity. In a <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">post</a> discussing its plans to make Bluesky sustainable, the team said &quot;users become the product&quot; when a company relies on ads. Since Bluesky set out to &quot;build a protocol where users can own their data,&quot; it chose to explore &quot;other avenues of monetization&quot; instead. It's worth noting that the social app started as a project funded by Twitter, but it has lost its connection to the website after Elon Musk took over.&nbsp;</p><p>Since earning by ads isn't an option, the team thought of offering paid services, starting with domain names. Users can already set up custom domain names to use with Bluesky, but they have to go through a separate process with a domain registrar first. This integration will supposedly allow them to do so in under a few minutes. They can simply log into their account, search for a domain name to use as a handle and then pay for it all within Bluesky's interface. For a Twitter competitor that doesn't have a centralized verification system, using a domain name is the best way for a user to verify that they are who they say they are. US Senators, for instance, have apparently been using the senate.gov domain to verify their identities.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users who use the integrated service will be able to manage their domain settings and configurations within Bluesky, and they can forward emails sent to their domains to an address of their choice. They can also choose to redirect their domain to their Bluesky profile or any URL they want. And in the event they decide to leave the platform or to use another registrar, they can transfer their domain away.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on Bluesky's announcement, domain integration is just the first in what could be several paid services available on the platform. It says it's exploring other services it &quot;can bundle to users to provide a more seamless experience.&quot; That said, Bluesky is still in private beta, and those interested will have to <a href="https://bsky.app/">join a waitlist</a> before they can get in.&nbsp;</p><div id="e95cf09e09bc47009ccbecbfda4b9a97"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-begins-offering-custom-domains-in-its-bid-to-remain-ad-free-071922355.html?src=rss
