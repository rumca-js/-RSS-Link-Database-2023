  <p id="QcTwPy">Reddit has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23779477/reddit-protest-blackouts-crushed">crushed the biggest protest in its history</a>. What’s next? Make AI-generated porn legal again, apparently — as long as it’s not deepfaked. Today, Reddit has added an explicit carveout to its Content Policy <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513411">that allows</a> “AI-generated sexual media that depicts fictional people or characters.”</p>

<p id="uT6OHu">Some backstory: In 2018, Reddit was among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16986602/deepfakes-banned-reddit-ai-faceswap-porn">the many platforms</a> that banned deepfake AI porn communities, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16982046/reddit-deepfakes-ai-celebrity-face-swap-porn-community-ban">declaring that</a> “involuntary pornography” was not okay. Specifically, Reddit modified its Rule 3 to ban depictions of nudity or sexual contact “that may have been faked.”</p>
<p id="GFQ68x">But as of 2018, Reddit left an explicit carveout for porn distributed with a sexual worker’s consent — and today, Reddit has added another carveout for AI-generated sexual...</p>

  <p id="zEJVa8">According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-googles-efforts-to-develop-custom-chip-for-pixel">a report by <em>The Information</em></a>, Google originally planned to replace the modified Samsung Exynos chipsets it uses in Pixel phones with a “Redondo” chip designed in-house sometime in 2024. However, the report claims that Google has now pushed that planned release window back to 2025 and will instead introduce a new custom processor codenamed “Laguna.”</p>
<p id="h4sYcb">A former Google chip executive told <em>The Information</em> that challenges with retaining employees and coordinating development between US and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220436/google-pixel-ai-chips-team-division-bengaluru-india-hiring">Indian teams</a> are at least partly to blame for the delay.

  <p id="sCjZyC">Twitter is threatening to sue Meta over concerns about its new Threads app, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/06/2023/twitter-is-threatening-to-sue-meta-over-threads">according to a letter obtained by <em>Semafor</em></a>.

  <p id="BfvQrO">Instagram’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784480/threads-instagram-meta-news-twitter-competitor">new Threads app</a> seems like it could be a hit. Mark Zuckerberg said that the app has more than 30 million signups <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuXCjGVrd6R">as of Thursday morning</a>, and people who are checking it out are posting... er, threading... a lot, too. According to internal data I’ve seen, users have already posted more than 95 million threads (or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23784842/threads-instagram-tweets-post-name-thread">tweets, depending on who you ask</a>) and dropped about 190 million likes.</p>
<p id="fjsJQL">All that has happened in less than 24 hours. The app launched Wednesday evening <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784263/instagram-threads-app-download-iphone-android">on iOS and Android</a> (significantly earlier than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784873/instagram-threads-launch-twitter-meta-countdown-7pm">the original Thursday launch time</a>), and <em>a lot</em> of people are checking it out; it’s currently the top free app on the App Store.</p>

  <p id="0WyFRo">If you’re already tired of Threads and want to delete your account, you can’t do that right now unless you delete <em>your entire</em> Instagram account. However, Meta is “looking into” a way for that not to be the case, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuXRXDdNOtH/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D">according to a post from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri on Thursday</a>.</p>
<p id="lJcuUO">Threads, Meta’s just-launched Twitter competitor, uses Instagram’s account system. That has the benefit of letting you bring over your Instagram username when you join the app. But it also ties the apps together in such a way that means you can’t delete your Threads account without deleting your Instagram one, which people may not want to do if they’ve been posting on Instagram proper for years.</p>

In a thread on Twitter <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/05/nothing-phone-2-camera-specs/">spotted by <em>9to5Google</em></a>, leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1676656052547231745?s=20">Kamila Wojciechowska shares</a> that the Nothing Phone 2 could feature some improvements to its camera system.</p>
<p id="cthLbt">According to Wojciechowska, the upcoming device could feature a 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) and in-sensor zoom. That’s the same <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23587883/oneplus-11-5g-review-screen-battery-camera-price">primary sensor used by the OnePlus 11</a>, which my colleague Allison Johnson listed as one of the positive aspects of the device in her review.

From Gordon Ramsay to Michael Strahan and Jennifer Lopez, Meta pre-filled its new Twitter competitor with a boatload of well-known users to make the app feel less empty at launch.</p>
<p id="dIVpaW">While Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram head Adam Mosseri got spots on the app ahead of time, so did big names such as Mark Cuban, Shakira, and Seth Curry.
