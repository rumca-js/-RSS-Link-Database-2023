id=\"what-to-look-for-when-buying-a-monitor\">What to look for when buying a monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to monitor specs, you can break it down into three main categories: size, refresh rate, and resolution. Regarding size, a 27-inch monitor seems to be the best option for most folks, as it doesn&rsquo;t take up a ton of desk space and it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes. A 32-inch monitor, for example, may cause eye strain if it&rsquo;s too close to your face. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refresh rate is another important aspect to consider, especially if you consider yourself a regular gamer. The refresh rate is the number of times a monitor refreshes the screen per second. 60Hz is fine for casual gamers, but if you&rsquo;re into competitive, fast-paced action titles, we&rsquo;d recommend a monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resolution is the other major point. 1080p monitors are totally fine for most tasks like web browsing and checking e-mail, but 4K is the way to go if you want the ultimate streaming or gaming experience. The thing about 4K monitors is that they can be more expensive. </p>\n\nGaming, Monitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/394751/early-prime-day-monitor-deals-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T17:52:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Sony\u2019s latest Bluetooth speaker adds surround sound to your laptop", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to speakers, you&rsquo;ve got high-quality setups that stay in one place and battery-powered systems that sacrifice quality for portability. Sony&rsquo;s latest design aims to split the difference. The HT-AX7 (named in Sony&rsquo;s typical robot fashion) is three Bluetooth speakers in one with satellite drivers that pop off the main unit for instant surround sound powers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1980931/sonys-ht-ax7-spatial-sound-portable-speaker.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1983115-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TechAdvisor got to try the &ldquo;portable theater system&rdquo;</a> out ahead of its European debut, declaring that the HT-AX7 was surprisingly capable outdoors and impressive indoors, where the &ldquo;360 spatial sound mapping&rdquo; feature could really shine. The setup looks kind of like a teddy bear head with the removable &ldquo;ears&rdquo; being the secondary satellite speakers. With just four active drivers &mdash; two in the main unit and one in each of the satellites  &mdash; it can&rsquo;t emulate a full 5.1 system, but initial hands-on impressions say the effect is convincing nonetheless. And, after all, you can&rsquo;t throw a 5.1-speaker system in a tote bag. The battery lasts for 30 hours with a 2.5-hour boost available from just ten minutes on a charger. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://electronics.sony.com/audio/speakers/all-speakers/p/htax7&amp;xcust=2-3-1983115-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">HT-AX7</a> can be connected to just about any Bluetooth device, but it&rsquo;s primarily designed with phones, tablets, and laptops in mind. The spatial effects, primarily for games and movies, can be shut off if all you&rsquo;re looking for is a Sonos-style multi-speaker system in a small package. But TechAdvisor pointed out a couple of potential pain points, too. There&rsquo;s no HDMI or even a headphone jack connection for direct wired sound &mdash; it&rsquo;s all Bluetooth all the time. And the price is $499/&pound;499/&euro;550, a premium for any Bluetooth speaker system and more expensive than the cheapest home theater setups, too. That said, Sony&rsquo;s high-end gear tends to go on sale on a regular basis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HT-AX7 is scheduled for release in the UK next month with a worldwide release yet to be detailed. But since there&rsquo;s a dollar price available, it&rsquo;s a safe bet we&rsquo;ll see it across the pond before too long. </p>\n\nSpeakers</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1983115/sonys-latest-bluetooth-speaker-adds-surround-sound-to-your-laptop.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T15:58:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "US Navy researchers expose Microsoft Teams security flaws", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The Navy does a lot of stuff that, ostensibly, has nothing to do with ships and submarines. One of them is information security research and the latest batch shows how some recent bugs discovered in the Microsoft Teams communication suite can be exploited. &ldquo;TeamsPhisher,&rdquo; as the experimental tool is called, can be used to send attachments throughout a Teams group from an outside source, potentially infecting an entire company without any security clearance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Python-based tool was published by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/Octoberfest7/TeamsPhisher&amp;xcust=2-1-1982873-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Reid of the Navy&rsquo;s Red Team</a>, a group that simulates attacks on vital infrastructure and suggests methods for mitigating the risks. Using multiple publicly-known flaws in Teams, the software package can access a Teams group as a member of an outside organization, then send messages and attachments to multiple members of an organization&rsquo;s internal Team. The only prerequisites are that at least one of the users have a Microsoft Business account and Sharepoint installed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-tool-exploits-microsoft-teams-bug-to-send-malware-to-users/&amp;xcust=2-1-1982873-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BleepingComputer</a>, the system can be used to implement fairly standard phishing or infection techniques. There are even ways to refine an automated attack like making files appear specific to the user or making messages appear with a timed delay so they&rsquo;re not obviously bot-generated. Once the messages and files are spread, it would be trivial for an attacker to gain remote access to Windows systems without some fairly robust extra security in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerabilities utilized by TeamsPhisher are known and acknowledged by Microsoft, but there&rsquo;s currently no plan for them to be addressed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re aware of this report and have determined that it relies on social engineering for it to be successful,&rdquo; a spokesman told BleepingComputer. Reid suggests that Teams users block external domains to prevent this kind of attack. </p>\n\nSecurity Software and Services</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1982873/us-navy-researchers-expose-microsoft-teams-security-flaws.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T14:43:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to use Steam Deck as a desktop PC", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2015, US company Valve had already released gaming systems with Linux. At that time, Steam OS was based on Debian and the hardware was built by companies such as Dell or Alienware. Despite the flexible price range between $400 and $6,000 US dollars, the idea turned into a financial flop. In addition, there was a lack of games and a functioning compatibility layer like Proton. The desktop mode was also hardly usable, but now it&rsquo;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck&amp;xcust=2-1-1981383-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam Deck</a> is a mobile gaming console with PC hardware and Linux in the background. If performance is sufficient enough for the 6,000 games that are certified as &ldquo;verified&rdquo; or &ldquo;playable&rdquo; for the console, then that should be enough for a desktop replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Better utilize your Steam Deck&rsquo;s features with these <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501480/master-your-steam-deck-with-these-22-tips-and-tricks.html\">22 useful tips and tricks</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"steam-os-is-based-on-arch-linux\">Steam OS is based on Arch Linux</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Valve has learned from past mistakes. Not only is the Steam Deck a mobile gaming device, but Steam-OS 3 is now based on Arch Linux. Similar to Manjaro, this will not be a rolling release, but will be delivered periodically. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The distribution benefits from faster releases of drivers and graphics APIs compared to the old Debian base. However, the system software with Linux kernel 5.13 (currently 6.1), KDE Plasma 5.26 (currently 5.27) and Qt toolkit 5.15 (currently 6.4) could be a bit more up-to-date. Thanks to Proton, games developed for Windows run better under Linux than with Wine alone. Desktop mode is also definitely usable now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"steam-deck-hardware-and-benchmarks\">Steam Deck: Hardware and benchmarks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AMD APU used is based on the Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architecture and is supposed to deliver the performance of a Ryzen of the 3000 series or a Radeon of the RX 6000 series. The quad-core CPU with eight threads clocks between 2.5 and 3.5 GHz. The working memory with 16 GB low-power DDR5 is also good standard. This equipment is identical for all deck variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.geekbench.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1981383-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geekbench 6</a> benchmark attests a single-core value of 1,191 for the most expensive Steam Deck version with NVME and 4,209 for multi-core. That&rsquo;s not exorbitant, but still more than many used laptop and thus absolutely suitable for desktop use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The various models have different display glass (the 512 GB version is anti-reflective and is supposed to deliver better color values) and hard drives: 64 GB eMMC, 256 GB NVMe SSD, and 512 GB NVMe SSD. All of them can be expanded with a micro SD card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steam Deck doesn&rsquo;t come with a webcam, but you can still do voice conferencing thanks to its stereo microphone and speakers. The loudspeakers sound rather thin with music, but the speech comprehension is good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, a headset via Bluetooth, jack plug, or USB adapter should be used. That&rsquo;s because the fan is clearly audible due to the close ventilation slots on the integrated microphones. In addition, the built-in Delta brand fan tends to whine. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"docking-station-for-desktop-use\">Docking station for desktop use</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Ohne Dockingstation ist das Steam Deck kaum als Desktop zu gebrauchen.

This turns the Steam Deck into a second monitor. The Steam Deck Dock offers three USB 3.1 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, Displayport 1.4, HDMI 2.0, and thus supports a maximum of two external monitors up to 4K at 60 Hz or 1440p at 120 Hz. An external monitor is mandatory for desktop operation in any case. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking to pick up a new monitor?

In practice, sooner rather than later. Generally, there are no problems with everyday programs such as Libre Office, Firefox, Thunderbird, Gimp, Kdenlive, Darktable, Obsidian, and Steam. All the typical desktop programs can be installed and should run flawlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memory and access times are on external micro SD cards and hard drives without noticeable delay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steam-OS 3 (or Steam-Deck-OS) relies on the desktop KDE and additional programs are installed by default only as Flatpak via the App Store Discover or in the terminal. This is especially worthwhile for users who want to use more than the pre-installed minimum package in the terminal. The Steam package sources, however, lack several popular programs such as the info tool inxi.

In rare cases, the system lags behind the inputs for a second or two, but catches itself again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Steam Deck can easily replace a stationary laptop. Only the partly outdated software base and the lack of encryption options mar the overall positive impression. At least a new kernel is to be introduced with Steam OS 3.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article, which originally appeared on PCWorld&rsquo;s sister site PCWelt, was translated from German to English.</em></p>\n\nGaming</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1981383/how-to-use-steam-deck-as-a-desktop-pc.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T11:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Speed up your Google searches with this hidden trick", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost everyone uses Google, and for most of us that means pasting text into our browser&rsquo;s address bar, or typing text into same. But next time you&rsquo;re reading an article online and come across a name, word, or phrase you want to research further, try this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlight the text.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Right-click on it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select &ldquo;Search&rdquo; in the pop-up context menu</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Highlight, right-click, search</em>. These three steps will instantly look up the selected text in a new browser tab using your default search engine. It might sound a little clunky, but in practice it&rsquo;s more efficient than copying, opening a new browser tab, and pasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also works for links, for those times when you see a link that doesn&rsquo;t have an actual hyperlink. Just click &ldquo;Go to&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Search&rdquo; in the context menu, and you&rsquo;ll be on your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I&rsquo;ve admittedly known about this trick for years, it never clicked for me until recently, when I made a point of turning it into a habit.

The app for the new social media platform is now live for both Android and iOS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Threads looks much like Twitter. Very much. You get to type 500 characters per post (versus 280 characters for Twitter), but your &ldquo;thread&rdquo; is aligned in a vertical hierarchy of posts, just like Twitter, and the user interface feels right at home. Naturally, you have the option of replying to and liking individual posts following others and responding to their own threads, too. And, of course, you can post photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Threads leverages your Instagram followers&mdash;which is important, because there are at least a few other apps named Threads on the two major app stores. Download <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.barcelona&amp;xcust=2-2-1981658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Threads, an Instagram app on Google Play</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002&amp;xcust=2-2-1981658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Threads, an Instagram app on iOS as well</a>. An unrelated productivity app called Threads is currently the first result for that term on each app store. Notably, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be an Instagram Threads web app or website quite yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-join-threads\">How to join Threads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After you download the correct app from either app store, you&rsquo;ll be asked to approve the permissions for the Threads app. Meta seems to want the same amount of data as Instagram can sample: everything from your health data to your credit score. Review the permissions before you decide to launch Threads.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Meta Threads feedback\" class=\"wp-image-1981675\" height=\"1060\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Threads-permisisons.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You&rsquo;ll need to step through a signup process when joining Threads.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The process to join Threads should feel very familiar to both Instagram and Twitter users. By default, your Threads name will be your Instagram handle, and those you&rsquo;ve followed, as well as your followers, will migrate over after those users also join Threads. And yes, Threads is free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta and Twitter are owned by competing organizations, so there&rsquo;s no way of &ldquo;migrating&rdquo; your Twitter follows over to Threads, and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hands-on-with-threads\">Hands on with Threads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Threads boasts a simple, clean interface, with an emphasis on sharing text and simple photos. GIF support is non-existent so far. You can create multi-post threads yourself, and comment on other posts to contribute. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any direct messaging within the Threads app itself. You can turn on notifications for individual followers, and a link on their profile page will take you to their Instagram&mdash;nothing too out of the ordinary for an Instagram app.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Meta Threads 1\" class=\"wp-image-1981676\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Threads-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Threads main feed.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The app&rsquo;s interface is oriented around five icons: the home feed, a search function, the center icon for authoring new posts, an activity feed designated by a heart icon, and your profile page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, Threads will certainly benefit from the massive numbers of people already on Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Meta presumably hopes that the latter app&rsquo;s users will transition over from private messaging to the group messaging that Threads offers. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that Threads is a relatively straightforward feature-copy of Twitter. The question is what Twitter CEO Elon Musk will do in return.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Meta Threads profile page\" class=\"wp-image-1981674\" height=\"956\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Threads-personal-page.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You can configure your own personal information within Threads, too.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, however, there are no blue checks, no trolls cluttering up replies&hellip;just early-adopter nerds.

Consequently, it&rsquo;s likely not the best value option money can buy right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking for more options?

The former can be paired with your choice of Nvidia RTX 40 series video card, SSD storage unit and RAM, with prices starting at $2,899.99 for the most affordable model. There&rsquo;s only one model you can choose with a Core i9-13980HX. It comes with an RTX 4090 GPU, 2TB SSD storage and 64GB of RAM as standard, and has a price tag of $4,999.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re on a budget but still want a top-of-the-line RTX 4090 GPU, you&rsquo;ll save $500 if you choose the Core i9&ndash;13950HX configuration (my review unit&rsquo;s configuration) with costs $4,499.99. That&rsquo;s assuming you don&rsquo;t find a better deal on an 18-inch gaming laptop with similar specs elsewhere &ndash; which you can currently do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can currently get an Asus ROG Strix G18 with 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13980HX processor and RTX 4080 GPU for $2,499.99 from Best Buy. Our benchmarking shows this laptop is a real performance dynamo too &ndash; even despite the step-down GPU. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily discount the Blade 18 as the best laptop for you. Its exceptional build quality, I/O options and upgradability are all very desirable features. But it&rsquo;s worthwhile knowing that &ndash; right now anyway &ndash; your dollar may go further if you look around. The specifications of our review unit are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i9-13950HX</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>RAM: </strong>32GB DDR5 / 5600 MHz</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Display:</strong> 18-inch, QHD+ (2560 x 1600), 240Hz refresh rate, 16:10 aspect ratio, 100 percent DCI-P3 color, 3ms response time, G-Sync</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 x 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 3 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, Thunderbolt 4, USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (supports DisplayPort and power delivery), HDMI 2.1, RJ45 Ethernet port</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Networking:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.80lbs (3.10kg)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.86 x 10.84 x 15.74 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> 91Whr</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $4,499.99 at Razer</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-design-and-build\">Razer Blade 18: Design and build</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I may as well address the elephant in the room right away&hellip; last year&rsquo;s Razer Blade 17 was big enough for me. With a gorgeous 17-inch display, a large spacious and stunning keyboard, and chassis that I could slip into a backpack, why would I need anything bigger? Well, Razer thinks I do, hence this year&rsquo;s even more gigantic desktop replacement, which doesn&rsquo;t dwarf the Blade 17 but might be large enough to have its measure in a wrestling match or two, something I found myself actually doing with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That last comment was a little unfair. But seriously, its sheer largeness did make it quite cumbersome at times. It measures 0.86 x 10.84 x 15.74 inches to the Blade 17&rsquo;s 0.78 x 10.24 x 15.55 inches, a size differential that made the Blade 18 a little more awkward to perch on my lap or carry around the house. It&rsquo;s without a doubt the most desktop-bound laptop I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, if you do happen to be balancing it on your lap and tip it to one side, you&rsquo;d better hope you&rsquo;ve got a beanbag or tower of pillows to catch your fall, because it&rsquo;s also very heavy. Again, not drastically more than the Blade 17, it weighs 6.80 pounds to the Blade 17&rsquo;s 6.6 pounds, but the weight increase has kind of pushed it to the upper limit of what a laptop should weigh.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977538\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Flat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"950\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those little nit-picks covered, lets discuss its merits, of which it has many. First and foremost is its wondrous display which in every way is even more impressive than the Blade 17 or the Asus ROG Strix G18 for that matter. It&rsquo;s not only extremely large but the whole panel comes framed up with amazingly thin 4.6 mm bezels. It also towered above my 15.6-inch work laptop, it&rsquo;s tall 16:10 ratio panel providing a visual feast really worth savoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its upgradability is another win. Razer has put a lot of thought into how you might actually want to use it like a desktop laptop. Hence inside the chassis you&rsquo;ll find two slots for RAM expandable to a maximum 64GB DDR5-5200MHz while two open M.2 NVMe spots allow you to upgrade to a maximum of 8TB dual sided SSD, so you can really max storage out, money permitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&rdquo;There&rsquo;s no denying what we see here is mighty GPU performance and frame rates that any self-respecting gamer would be happy to have. The big question is: can you get better performance elsewhere and at a cheaper price? </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cooling system is tailor made too, with a specially made vapor chamber that&rsquo;s bigger than any Razer forebear. This works continuously with a three-fan system that sounds remarkably quiet, even when AAA games are pushing the hardware&rsquo;s upper limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptop&rsquo;s styling also shows an enormous amount of flair and sophistication, as I&rsquo;ve come to expect from Razer laptops. The slick anodized black exterior feels exceptionally smooth, and the anti-fingerprint coating works a treat dulling your fingerprints so that your device doesn&rsquo;t end up looking like a farcical polka-dotted accessory after playing.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article&hellip;\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-4-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4999 Euro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>That classic razer styling is backed by a respectable robustness. The whole chassis has been CNC-milled from a single slab of aluminum and it really shows &ndash; the hinges are tight and unyielding, and the base is as hard as a rock. In fact, here, if ever there was one, is a laptop that can take any number of bangs, scratches and wallops and will stand up again and again without breaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-keyboard-and-trackpad\">Razer Blade 18: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the Razer Blade 17, Razer has opted not to build the keyboard out to the full periphery of the laptop&rsquo;s chassis, leaving plenty of space for generous-sized speaker grilles either side. While that seemed like a lost opportunity in the Razer Blade 17, where the keyboard felt a bit cramped, in the Razer Blade 18 it really works to make everything fit well. Indeed, the larger sized keyboard is ideally proportioned, and the almost dime-sized keys feel nearly impossible to miss hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key response is also balanced, being neither too mushy nor bouncy, despite the keys having quite a low vertical travel. The per-key backlighting looks brilliant too &ndash; it flashes green on start-up tantalizing you with all the possibilities you have to personalize the lighting effects and colors in Razer&rsquo;s Synapse 3 software.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977565\" height=\"911\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Keyboard_edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>The Razer Blade 18&rsquo;s keyboard layout is quite conservative, but its large keys are comfortable and responsive.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the layout is quite conservative. For one there&rsquo;s no media keys to speak of, which we&rsquo;ve seen lately in some rivals. Personally, I would have easily put up with smaller keys just for a set of dedicated media controls or shortcuts to manage my audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, you do get larger-sized arrow keys than in the Blade 17, so you&rsquo;re now a lot less likely to accidently hit Right Shift. This is a very welcome change. The Microsoft precision trackpad is also top-notch in every way, as it&rsquo;s spacious, smooth, and responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-connectivity-and-audio\">Razer Blade 18: Connectivity and audio </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Razer Blade 18&rsquo;s generous I/O options easily accommodated my must-have devices. I made short use of the three USB-A ports (that&rsquo;s one more than you get in the Asus ROG Strix G18) for gadgets like my Wi-Fi speaker, gaming mouse and a full-sized keyboard, but I still had a USB-C port and Thunderbolt 4 port free for my external SSD and smartphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, the HDMI 2.1 and Ethernet ports made my LAN gaming sessions considerably easier. They helped cut out some of the toing and froing that happens between friends before games start. For my part, I could simply just say: I&rsquo;ve got all the ports, so just hook me up!</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article&hellip;\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"asus-rog-strix-g18\">Asus ROG Strix G18</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ROG Strix G18\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lead.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4032\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809571/asus-rog-strix-g18-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6531333&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6531333%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-2-1977289-5-1809562-11291\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$2499.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://shop.asus.com/us/rog/90nr0cg1-m002e0-g834jy.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1977289-5-1809562-11291&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">3899.99 at  Asus</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The Razer Blade 18 also gets a thumbs up for its Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity, both these features are like a modern-day gauge for how well a premium laptop can handle the integrated connectivity demands and speed requirements gamers need to really be competitive. Consequently, it was nice to know the Blade 18 had my back with those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the audio front, the Razer Blade 18 can muster a commendable sound. In fact, its six speakers (consisting of 2 tweeter and 4 woofers) produce a much more natural sound than you&rsquo;ll find in most other laptops. To that end, you can enjoy some very decent music, complemented nicely with clear mid tones, but also bass notes and highs that stay true, even at higher volume levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-display-and-webcam\">Razer Blade 18: Display and webcam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All Blade 18 models come with a QHD+ (2560 x 1600) display with a 240Hz refresh rate. While fans of 4K may be put off by the lack of a 4K option here, they really shouldn&rsquo;t be. It&rsquo;s a premium feature that delivers the perfect balance between detailed visuals and frame rates fast enough to keep you competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, the display just looks spectacular. Notwithstanding its enormous size, which is memorable enough, just about every game I ran on it, <em>Sniper Elite 5</em> and <em>Green Hell </em>included, all looked like they&rsquo;d had graphics upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While videos and animations appear eminently smooth, the colors and darks in these moving images also look fabulous on the IPS-grade panel. The display&rsquo;s peak brightness level of 500 nits really does justice to how well the colors pop in stationary images, too. Although creators may still want to seek out a laptop with 1,000 nits display for professional design work or photo editing, in which they&rsquo;re likely to see even more brilliant colors.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977576\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Razer-Blade-18-screenshot-Green-Hell.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><p>Green Hell screenshot taken on the Razer Blade 18&rsquo;s QHD+ 240Hz display.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A 5MP webcam sits atop the display, which overall, does a decent job with both video and audio. You won&rsquo;t get the kind of images you&rsquo;d expect from a Full High-Definition camera, however, and I did witness some glitching on more than one occasion. Still for a gaming laptop it&rsquo;s perfectly decent for simple gamer chats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-cpu-performance\">Razer Blade 18: CPU performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having already reviewed a close 18-inch competitor, the Asus ROG Strix G18, the question begged: Could the Razer outperform this performance juggernaut? A good deal of testing aimed to find out just that and the result was kind of surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, I sized up my Razer Blade&rsquo;s Core i9-13950HX CPU against those from the Strix but also from another 18-inch behemoth, the MSI Titan GT77. These are both strong performers, each packing Intel i9-13980HX processors, the slightly zippier cousin to my laptop&rsquo;s CPU. For the actual benchmarking, I ran two standard tests, Maxon Cinebench&rsquo;s Multi-Threaded benchmark and a bespoke test that utilized the free HandBrake utility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Cinebench benchmark, the Razer Blade 18 placed third, considerably behind its two 18-inch rivals. Even so, this result proves its suitability for a range of CPU-intensive tasks like AAA gaming and video editing or encoding. Although, it must be said&hellip; it&rsquo;s clearly no match for the Strix or the Titan when it comes to such tasks, both laptops almost doubling the Blade 18&rsquo;s score.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977424\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cinebench-Multi-threaded-perfomrance.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of the HandBrake test is even less flattering. This CPU-intensive test is like a sprint to the finish line showing how well our laptop can keep thermals in check before it needs to throttle performance. While the Blade 18 handled this task with passable performance, once again it was seriously outclassed by both of its main competitors, as well as a field of older and less powerful laptops.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977439\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/HandBrake-performance.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these results mean? Put simply, they imply the Razer Blade 18&rsquo;s CPU performance, at least in this configuration, is a little off the pace of where it should be. While some performance differential was to be expected between our laptop and the i9-13980HX carrying 18-inch rivals, it really should have wiped the floor with the majority of the older laptops in the field. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, you <em>can</em> buy the Blade 18 with a more powerful i9-13980HX CPU, which although we didn&rsquo;t get to test it out this time may have performed better. But doing so will cost an extra $500. Considering this model with an i9-13950HX and an RTX 4090 already costs an arm and a leg, any extra cost is enough to make even the toughest gamers wince.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-gaming-performance\">Razer Blade 18: Gaming performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as packing the top of the line Nvidia mobile RTX 4090 GPU in my review unit, Razer has tuned its Total Graphics Power (TGP) to the maximum 175-watt rate, which made me very keen to see just what it was capable of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to witness the raw power of the RTX 4090 in quite a few laptops this year and there&rsquo;s no doubting its prowess. With 76 ray-tracing cores being one of its gun features, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a dream card for gamers with pockets deep enough to get one and entirely suitable for the latest AAA games. Accordingly, here I was more concerned about getting a sense of how well the GPU could perform in the Razer Blade 18 than proving its performance chops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, I ran the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark. As you can see in the graph below, the Razer Blade 18 trailed the Strix and Titan in the Overall score category. However, it still outperformed a handful of laptops with older Nvidia RTX 30 Series GPUs. This result proves the Razer&rsquo;s GPU is highly adept at handling the most demanding graphical tasks.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977461\" height=\"691\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3DMark-performance.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s move into the gaming benchmarks. During the <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> benchmark, the Razer Blade 18 fared somewhat better, this time defeating the MSI Titan, but placing slightly behind the Strix G18. Its score of 179 frames per second is respectable. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977498\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shadow-of-the-Tomb-Raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> gaming benchmark result is consistent with the above result. Here, the Razer Blade 18 outclassed the MSI Titan yet again but couldn&rsquo;t quite keep up with the Strix G18&rsquo;s pace.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977511\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rise-of-the-Tomb-Raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no denying what we see here is mighty GPU performance and frame rates that any self-respecting gamer would be happy to have. The big question is&hellip; can you get better performance elsewhere and at a cheaper price? Unfortunately, the answer to that is&hellip; yes. As mentioned earlier, one example is the Strix G18 highlighted in our performance graphs, which costs just $2,499.99. That&rsquo;s a whopping $2,000 cheaper. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if the Razer is the superior option when it comes to build quality, a price differential like that is hard to resist. That&rsquo;s the biggest letdown with the Blade 18. It&rsquo;s not that the performance is all that bad, but that the price just doesn&rsquo;t match performance expectations, which are always high for desktop replacements for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-battery-performance\">Razer Blade 18: Battery performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To test the battery, we ran a 4K Hollywood movie set to repeat with the sound switched down to 50 percent and a cheap pair of headphones plugged in to manage the noise. Wi-Fi was switched to Airplane Mode while the keyboard backlighting was disabled for consistency with our other tests. The generated graph shows the time the 91 WHr battery ran out of juice, which was approximately six hours.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Blade 18\" class=\"wp-image-1977532\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Battery-test.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a fairly average result. You can expect just three hours from the Blade 18 if you&rsquo;re gaming unplugged after charging the laptop to full capacity. That&rsquo;s approximately half the time of the Asus TUF Gaming A16, whose exceptional battery life is closer to what you&rsquo;d expect a productivity laptop to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"razer-blade-18-should-you-buy-it\">Razer Blade 18: Should you buy it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blade 18 lets you personalize your build from the get-go, enjoy the latest high-end visuals on a huge and gorgeous 18-inch 16:10 display, and gives you the option to upgrade parts of your rig down the track. Yet, regardless the pros, one big factor is hard to overlook. Despite its high-end hardware, our performance results show it to be a little under cooked for the price being asked, which is $4,499.99. Consequently, if you have the money to shell out for the model with the zippier Intel i9-13980HX processor, you&rsquo;re likely to get more bang for buck from that. Otherwise, you should probably look around for a better deal.</p>\n\nGaming Laptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1977289/razer-blade-18-review.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Stop roaming charges with a Prime Day-like deal on this eSim", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>We all need mobile data, especially on those big summer road trips.

This year, Prime Day will run from July 11 through July 12 and should include great deals on everything from gaming PCs to all-in-ones, as well as more traditional desktop machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve sifted through all of the humdrum sales to pinpoint only the very best laptops on sale during this year&rsquo;s Prime Day. You&rsquo;ll need to be a Prime member to take advantage of these steep discounts. Not a Prime member? Not a problem. By signing up for the 30-day trial, you can get <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402239/how-to-get-amazon-prime-for-free.html\">Amazon Prime for free</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re also including deals from other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Our picks offer strong processing and graphics performance, and we also take battery life, form factor, budget, and display size/quality into consideration. Whether you&rsquo;re a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html\">hardcore gamer</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/557622/the-best-laptop-for-college.html\">college freshman on a budget</a>, we&rsquo;re here to help you every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-prime-day-laptop-deals\">Best Prime Day laptop deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are already some great early deals from the likes of Amazon and other retailers such as BestBuy, Dell, and Newegg. If you&rsquo;re looking for a productivity laptop then the best value pick is the Acer Swift X Creator Laptop. For $170 off on Amazon, this Acer laptop comes with a Ryzen 7 processor and an Nvidia RTX 3050Ti GPU. Plus it&rsquo;s only 0.7-inches thick and weighs in at a very reasonable 3.31 pounds. Alternatively, if you are looking to get your hands on the latest 15-inch Macbook Air then Amazon is offering a rare sale for $100 off this brand new model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be argued that we&rsquo;re seeing even better deals on gaming laptops right now. The pick of the bunch has to be Alienware m17 R5 for a mouth-watering $1,150 off on Dell. It&rsquo;s loaded with upsides, including a Ryzen 9 processor, a Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU, and a whopping 32GB of RAM, which is enough to do 4K gaming. The 17-inch display is also capable of a blazing fast 360Hz refresh rate so you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about your opponents having a speed advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"

class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-look-for-when-buying-a-laptop\">What to look for when buying a laptop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Laptops come in all shapes and sizes, each with myriad features. All of these options can leave your head spinning. But before you dive into the deep end of laptop shopping, there are a few things you should consider first to help get you started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very first thing you should think about is what type of laptop will be best for you. There are traditional clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, and even Chromebooks. If you want something that is portable and can work as both a laptop and tablet, then a 2-in-1 is a good choice. Traditional clamshells can offer better hardware and often are the way to go for professionals and gamers who require strong performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For hardware, there are a few things to consider first. If you need a lot of processing power for gaming or work tasks, then a higher number processor such as an Intel Core i5 or Ryzen 5 is a minimum requirement. You can generally stick with integrated graphics unless you intend to game or do graphically demanding tasks such as 3D rendering. Memory is important and no matter what your intended uses are for a laptop, you should try to aim for at least 8GB of RAM, with 16GB the optimal amount for gaming and productivity work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there are two additional things you should consider before buying your new laptop: display size and battery life. Display size is dependent upon your personal preference. A smaller display will allow for your laptop to be more portable, but if you need to do multimedia work, you may want something bigger. As for battery life, look for something in the 10 to 12 hour range on a single charge as this should be enough to get you through a full work day before recharging.</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/796350/early-prime-day-laptop-deals-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T03:50:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best early Prime Day computer deals: Top discounts on PC desktops", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s annual Prime Day sales event is about to kick off, giving you the chance to score some great tech deals.

class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-look-for-when-buying-a-desktop-computer\">What to look for when buying a desktop computer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see a ton of options when searching for a desktop computer, but they all mainly fit into four main categories: productivity tower PCs, gaming PCs, mini PCS, and all-in-ones (AiO). Which you should end up buying is entirely dependent upon what your needs are and what you want to do with your computer. If you are looking for something that will work in a home office or family room, then a productivity PC or AiO with a solid CPU and lots of RAM and storage is probably the way to go. If gaming is your main concern, a gaming PC can offer a lot more bang for your buck than a laptop and you should focus on getting the best GPU possible. Or if you just want something that can fit anywhere and provide basic computing then a mini PC is a good bet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for a CPU, we recommend opting for at least the latest gen Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 which will provide plenty of processing power for everyday computing tasks. If you don&rsquo;t intend to do any gaming on your computer then feel free to save some money by going with integrated graphics. However, if you are looking to get your game on, then we recommend at least an Nvidia GeForce 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT as these are the least expensive discrete graphics cards that can handle ray tracing. The latest gen GPUs are becoming more readily available in pre-built systems so opt for that if you have the money and want a performance boost. But they&rsquo;re still running a bit expensive, so budget gamers will likely be better served with the previous generation cards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for RAM, we think its best to shoot for 16GB at the minimum for productivity and gaming, but for family computers and internet browsing, 8GB should suffice. Storage size is dependent upon your personal needs, but it is generally a good idea to opt for an SSD over an standard HDD as they are much faster and don&rsquo;t significantly affect the price of a desktop. Additionally, if you intend to go for an AiO, you should look for a display with a minimum resolution of 1080p.</p>\n\nDesktop PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/796457/early-prime-day-computer-deals-2023.html", "date_published": "2023-07-06T03:41:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
