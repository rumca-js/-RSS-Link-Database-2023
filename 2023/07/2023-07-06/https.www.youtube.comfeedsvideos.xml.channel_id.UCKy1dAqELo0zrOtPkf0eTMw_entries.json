No reason was given and no announcement was made. Obviously, fans of the movie flocked to social media to express their feelings, but it's not totally unsurprising: Disney is looking to save about $3 billion this year, and content providers like Max have pulled original movies and shows from their platforms as a cost-saving measure. In related news, Amazon's Citadel, which debute in April on Prime Video, is a flop. a two-hundred-and-fifty-million-dollar flop. The show wasn't a hit with critics, and audiences didn't turn up either; Citadel failed to crack the top 10 most streamed shows during its lifetime so far. In movie news, horror film producer Jason Blum is looking to make more video game adaptations, and his business and creative partner James Wan (of The Conjuring game) wants to do the same. But lets see how their Five Nights at Freddy's adaptation fares first. And finally, the Barney movie won't be the kid-friendly romp that the show was.
