It's a niche audience. It's from the people who brought you such hits as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woman-attacked-by-rabid-fox" target="_blank">Fox vs. Grandmother </a>and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bear-steals-snacks-7-eleven" target="_blank">Bear vs. 7-11</a>. I'll spoil the story and say that the raccoon won this round. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. And our journey begins on a street in Somewhere U.S.A.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Raccoon: 1<a href="https://twitter.com/riffoutdoors?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@riffoutdoors</a> <a href="https://t.co/y4K7E98VlL">pic.twitter.com/y4K7E98VlL</a><br />— Whiskey Riff (@WhiskeyRiff) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiskeyRiff/status/1513950125940375553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It is unclear what the woman, we'll call her Marge, and the raccoon were arguing about. Maybe the raccoon stole her cheesecake. Maybe the raccoon called Marge by the wrong pronouns. Maybe Marge was convinced the raccoon was Bradley Cooper in costume and wanted him to sign her <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> poster. Marge was saying "I know you're Bradley Cooper" and the raccoon was saying... I don't know, whatever sounds a raccoon makes.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The raccoon grew tired of such silliness and started chasing Marge away. I doubt the raccoon told her "I just wanted to take another look at you." Though if raccoons could laugh, this was had to be in hysterics when Marge -- dressed like... that -- wiped out in the street.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="170ae" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843528&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Here's where the boyfriend -- let's call him Reggie -- comes in. Or, if not the boyfriend, the guy Marge only likes as a friend. Reggie flexed on the raccoon. Like, legit flexed on him. He assumed a "come at be bro" fighting stance. To a raccoon. At this point in the video, I wish the raccoon <em>WAS</em> being voiced by Bradley Cooper. I'd love to hear the raccoon telling Reggie "you don't want these paws" before he starts gnawing Reggie's face off.</p><p>Instead, the raccoon responded to the flex with a flex of his own. And Reggie ran away.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The real MVP is my man in the car who saw it go down on sight and thought to record it. I won't even deduct him a point for not having sound. What's important is that he thought of those of us who hustle content for a living and didn't hesitate. 10/10 content.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Police need your help in finding a Bud Light thief because I guess paying for it was less embarrassing

A Bud Light fan who needs his fix, but knows if he is seen buying a Bud Light everyone will laugh at him. "Dy'lan Mulvaney" they'll call him. Sneaking it to a distributor and stealing a few cases was the only way to avoid embarrassment. Now he's a wanted fugitive instead of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yuengling-beer-patriotic-can" target="_blank">switching to Yuengling</a> or trying a local brewer.</p><p>Not since the guy who got busted DUI while <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-kansas-arrest" target="_blank">dressed as a bottle of Bud Light</a> has there been such an unfortunate incident.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The West Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WestBatonRougeParishSheriffsOffice/posts/pfbid02J54S1HBwyjDrUGMrVzC1mXfHEPREwF4QnGdFXypRygm4D629cgFJ4pr24jRACMHEl" target="_blank">is reaching out through Facebook</a> for help in finding this man and either bringing him to justice or at the very least getting him some help. According to one comment, the stolen Bud Light speaks volumes about this thief.</p><blockquote>The suspect recently entered a convenience store off U.S. Hwy. 190 where he walks into the beer cooler and selects three cases of Bud Light Beer. This suspect exits the store without making payment and is seen putting the beer into the backseat of a four-door sedan.</blockquote><p>The Sheriff's Office reminds everyone in the post that all suspects are innocent until proven guilty. So let's give this guy the benefit of the doubt. Maaaaaaybe he read on the internet that they were giving Bud Light for free, and misunderstood that you needed to buy it first and then send in a rebate coupon. </p><p>He only took Bud Light. It's not like he healed the store up. A grabbed a sixer of good beer and some munchies on the way out. I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding.<br /></p><p>Another in a long list of negative stories for the embattled beer. Ever since aligning themselves with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light-response" target="_blank">controversial titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a>, the company has been in freefall to where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-cheaper-than-water" target="_blank">it's cheaper than water in some places</a>.</p><p>There are calls <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-resigns" target="_blank">for the current CEO to resign</a> after allowing the marketing blunder that has cost the company over twenty billion dollars in losses to go on. Anything to avoid the company from admitting they f*ck up and will leave politics to cable news, Target, and the NBA.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Bride bans conservative uncle from her wedding, demands $1000 gift anyway, yet her mom doesn't get why the family is upset

	If you could bottle the lack of self-awareness from a mother who uninvites her brother from her daughter's wedding because his "conservative opinions" make her uncomfortable, then wonders why the family is upset with her, THEN wants to know where is wedding gift is, she could make her daughter drink it and maybe they'd both calm down. This <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/life/advice/2023/06/29/bride-wants-a-withdrawal-from-the-bank-of-uncle-dave/70348039007/" target="_blank">"Dear Amy" advice letter</a> shows that such self-awareness is potent.
</p><p>
	The bride is less the bad guy here because the mother, signed "Angry in Philadelphia," is old enough to know better. We've heard of leftists age zoomer-to-millennial freaking out and claiming they are "unsafe" because someone around them holds an opposing viewpoint. The fact that she wouldn't want her uncle in the room -- even though they both get along allegedly -- because Uncle Dave "is a conservative voter and has supported candidates we all abhor" isn't surprising. Though if I'm Uncle Dave?

</p><p>
	It's also not surprising that such an emotional hemophilia would demand her mother do her dirty work. Mom uninvited Uncle Dave in a "really nice note" and sent him photos from the wedding he was invited to.
</p><p>
	Here's where the mother should have asked herself if she was the assh*le here, and admitted that, yes, she was. Dave hasn't spoken to her, and her daughter wants to know where her $1000 wedding gift is for the wedding he was forbidden to go to.
</p><blockquote>
	I have not heard from Dave since then. When my siblings found out what I had done they were angry with me. That is just one problem. Another problem is that Dave has not sent my daughter and son-in-law a wedding gift. In the past, Dave has given family members wedding checks in excess of $1,000. She says she was counting on receiving the same type of gift.

</p><p>
	Wait, we're not even at the best part.
</p><blockquote>
	Dave’s behavior is upsetting and embarrassing to me. How can I get my brother to recognize and change his petty behavior? Please <strong>don’t tell me that I’m the one who started this by not inviting my brother to the wedding.</strong>
</blockquote><p>
	Ok, now.

</p><p>
	No, Mrs. Angry in Philadelphia, you did in fact start this. You started this by allowing your daughter to grow up to be a selfish, entitled brat. You started this by doing her dirty work for her. And, you started this by, with every ounce of sincerity in your words, writing a letter demanding Uncle Dave send your obnoxious dingbat of a daughter a thousand dollars when both of you should be told to go f*ck yourself.
</p><p>
	If Dave is as conservative as you say, he no doubt consumes conserve media on the internet and is reading all of us making fun of you. Your daughter deserves two things. The first is a $1000 donation to DeSantis 2024 in her name. The second is a bag of Uncle Dave's sh*t after a steak dinner.

There is <em>some</em> logic there. Firing someone for filming shoplifters, so that there is evidence of them shoplifting? One employee at a supermarket chain in Colorado discovered doing the right thing costs you your livelihood. </p><p>Here is the incident filmed by Santino Burrola, a now former King Soopers employee. It's owned by corporate supermarket chain Kroeger.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>You can hear Burrola talking to the nogoodniks in question "Really bro? You gotta resort to this? The economy's not <em>that</em> bad." he made it a point to film the license plate too.</p><p>Burrola tells <em>CBS Colorado</em> his intention was to post the video on TikTok to see if people could identify the men. Then he went to work the next day and discovered he was fired.</p><blockquote>I and the union rep sat down with them and King Soopers recommended termination and so I got fired that day. ... All I did was just record criminals and reveal them! I would never let any criminal conduct slide especially when it's happening right in front of me."</blockquote><p>Like many corporate chains, Kroger has a zero-tolerance policy about "interfering" with people stealing merchandise. They issued a statement to the local news outlet claiming they are "disappointed by the increased level of crime across retail establishments" and they "remain committed to working in partnership with local law enforcement to address this issue," adding they have security matters in place to prevent theft. Spoiler: they're not working.</p><p>The store it would not comment on personnel matters, but they "value our hardworking associates." Not unlike how Lululemon <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lululemon-fires-two-employees" target="_blank">values their associates when they fired two for calling the cops</a>. Or how a s<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/circle-k-shoplifter-lawsuit-knife" target="_blank">eventy-year-old woman was fired from Circle K</a> for defending herself and preventing herself from getting stabbed.</p><p>Here's the shameful thing. Kroger fired an employee whose video LED TO THE SHOPLIFTERS GETTING ARRESTED. Police were able to track down the vehicle used to the owner, who told police he lent it to his cousin.</p><blockquote>The driver, Jorge Pantoja, 32, the man in the green shirt, was then contacted, arrested and stated he picked up two other males at the Light Rail station at I-25 and Belleview and offered them an opportunity to make some money. The men told the driver their names were Robert and Bugsy. Law enforcement is still trying to locate the other two men.</blockquote><p>Pantonja is being held on felony charges and a Class 2 Misdemeanor of Theft/Shoplifting.</p><p>Side note: is there a street value to laundry detergent? This isn't the first video we've seen of thugs walking out with under $1000 worth of stolen Tide. I don't know if it's for resale value, or if people stopped paying for things when progressive policies made it easier for them.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## “You can’t f***ing remember that?” Indiana Jones star Harrison Ford goes off on Conan O'Brien for not remembering Han Solo

One is Han Solo, who was unceremoniously killed so woke twat Kathleen Kennedy could remake the entire Star Wars universe in her bitterly-partisan image. The other is a character he is doing press for now, Indiana Jones. The eleventieth sequel, <em>Dial of Destiny</em>, is in theaters now. </p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/conan-obrien-top-hat" target="_blank">Conan O'Brien</a>, apparently, needed help remembering one of the characters. He also needs better researchers, which Ford made sure he knew after the podcast host got the actor's nationality wrong.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>“If that’s the quality of your research, which I imagine it is, because right there it says ‘Harrison Ford’ and then you had to write down ‘Han Solo,.' You can’t f*cking remember that?”<br /></p><p>O'Brien tried to recover by pointing out how forgettable the Han Solo character was in the Star Wars movie. Conan remembered Chewbacca and whatshisface with the black helmet. But Ford didn't really pop in the movie.</p><p>That's when Ford, as the kids say, bodied his host:</p><p>“Why aren’t you still on television?”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p><br /></p><p><em>Dial of Destiny</em> has turned into yet another in a long line of box office flops for Disney. It was <a href="https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/07/05/sound-of-freedom-defeats-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-at-the-box-office-on-independence-day/" target="_blank">defeated on Independence Day</a> by independent Christian movie <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sound-of-freedom-review" target="_blank">"The Sound of Freedom."</a> Critics are quick to label this another example of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/little-mermaid-south-korea" target="_blank">Disney getting woke and going broke</a>, but that's not something I can speak to myself. Here's a little Brodi-fact: I've never seen an Indiana Jones movie.</p><p>I don't know how. I'm a kid from the 80s who grew up a huge Han Solo fan (Luke Skywalker was always a bit of a pussy). Yet the Indiana Jones franchise was one my parents never got around to seeing. As the years went on, I didn't see any reason to at that point.</p><p>But I hear Harrison Ford is good in it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Comedian Carrot Top was eyewitness to the crazy lady "he's not real" airplane freak out and here's what he saw

Because having a crazy woman demand to be let off a plane because the person she was sitting next to "was not real" isn't funny enough.</p><p>So we're all on the same page, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woman-american-airlines-freak-out" target="_blank">since this dropped on July 4th and you may have been off celebrating 'Merica</a>, this specimen demanded to get off an American Airlines flight because, and I quote, <em>"Everyone can either believe it or they can not believe it. I don’t give two f*cks. But I am telling you right now, that motherf*cker back there is not real. And you can sit on this plane and you can f*cking die with them or not.

<p>One of the passengers who now had a three-hour layover in Dallas was Carrott Top, whose real name is... wait, Scott Thompson?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="55c3b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34291875&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Top described the woman as a “f*cking nutjob" who just "lost her mind in front of the whole plane.” Then he made the claim this was all over losing an earbud. Which, don't get me wrong, I understand the panic. One time my cellphone fell onto the floor while I was in a center seat and I didn't know what I was going to do. But I wasn't panicked enough to question either aislemate's existence.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuOQhM9gmvF/?hl=en" target="_blank">In a follow-up video</a>, Top thanked American Airlines for how they handled the situation and hope the crazy lady was enjoying her 4th of July in jail. Though, reports from the original video were that she was not arrested.</p><p>We're going to have to wait for reporters to track the woman down to get her side of the story <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/just-stop-oil-stag-party" target="_blank">since that's what we do with viral videos these days</a>. I hope they do because I have questions. Top of the list is what this lady means by "that mother f*cker is not real." Was he an android? An alien? Was the woman on edibles? </p><p>Or was the other passenger dishonest and not being "real" with her? She looks kinda basic. The type of woman who has posted on at least one occasion that if you aren't there for her at her worst, you don't deserve her at her best. Spoiler: Those broads never have a best. And they are the kind who would cause a three-hour delay over an argument.</p><p>I'm also setting the over/under for when we find out <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woman-tesla-gas-station" target="_blank">she is a "social medial influencer"</a> for next Monday. I'm going to go under.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
