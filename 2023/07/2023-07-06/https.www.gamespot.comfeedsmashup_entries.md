<p>One of the lower-key awesome aspects of the Insidious series is its overall coherence. These movies don't contradict each other, and they've got a neat core saga with the Lambert family and the ever-haunted Elise. Insidious: The Red Door, the fifth movie in this franchise, proudly upholds that commitment to the big picture. If you're eager to understand where the story goes, we've broken down what happens during the ending of Insidious: The Red Door, including the after-credits scene.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for Insidious: The Red Door, including a detailed description of its ending.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">What happens in Insidious: The Red Door?</h2><p dir="ltr">The Red Door picks up a decade after the events of Insidious Chapter 2--the third and fourth movies were prequels, and they aren't being disregarded or anything like that. During Chapter 2, a possessed Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) chased his family around the house with a hammer and tried to kill them, but young Dalton (Ty Simpkins) ventured into the spirit realm that they call The Further, found Josh's spirit, and brought him back to his body. Both of them were then hypnotized so they would forget all this bad stuff and hopefully not get into another mess like this.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insidious-the-red-door-ending-and-after-credits-scene-explained/1100-6515744/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Review - Blame It On The Rain

<p dir="ltr">I have to hand it to the development staff of Rain Code: They are very skilled at completely upending your expectations from the get-go. I certainly expected to be shocked and surprised, given that these are the minds behind the beloved Danganronpa series--they know a thing or two about throwing players narrative curveballs out of nowhere--but even I wasn't expecting what happened after about 30 minutes of introduction. I wanted to put the Switch down and give a little "Well done!" clap. It's a bit of a shame, though, because after <em>that</em>, none of the other cases ever reach the same high, despite some great moments. That's Rain Code in a nutshell: It can't quite reach the greatness of what came before it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rain Code begins with a young man waking up in some sort of storage room. All he can remember is that his name is Yuma Kokohead and he's got to catch a train that's headed to Kanai Ward--a corporate city cut off to most of the outside world, shrouded in perpetual, neon-lit darkness and rain, run by the Amaterasu megacorp, and controlled by the militarized Peacekeeper force. It's not long after he boards the train that he finds out why he's going there: He's part of the World Detective Organization, which is sending several agents in to investigate Kanai Ward's ugly secrets. He also soon discovers why he has amnesia: It turns out he made a deal with a death god for special powers and offered up his memories in exchange.</p><p dir="ltr">That death god, Shinigami, mostly hangs around in the form of a tiny ghost that only Yuma can see. It reads his thoughts and makes sarcastic comments until there's a mystery to be solved, which is when Shinigami stops time and transforms into a buxom demon maiden to whisk him away to mind-palace Mystery Labyrinths where things get buck-wild. Here, he must battle logic monsters, evade dastardly false-solution traps, and unlock doors with Evidence Keys that Shinigami barfs up in a shower of rainbows. And also maybe crush thought barriers riding Shinigami as a giant kaiju. And play Pop-up Pirate with her in a barrel on the beach. Yeah, it's all just a <em>little</em> weird.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-blame-it-on-the-rain/1900-6418087/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Television producer Ryan Murphy, has threatened legal action against Warren Leight, a strike captain and committee member of the Writers Guild of America, according to a letter from Murphy's attorney obtained by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ryan-murphy-threatens-lawsuit-wga-strike-captain-1235530321/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The dispute arose when Leight alleged in a tweet that crew members working on Murphy's show American Horror Story would be "blackballed in Murphy-land" if they refused to cross the WGA's picket lines. Murphy's spokesperson denied these claims at the time. Following the letter sent by Murphy's attorney, the WGA held a meeting with Leight, who subsequently deleted the tweet and issued an apology and retraction.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ryan-murphy-takes-legal-action-against-wga-strike-captain/1100-6515742/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## When Will Disney Dreamlight Valley Be Free To Play?

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> has made quite a name for itself in the farm life sim genre since launching in early access in 2022, and its popularity doesn't seem to be slowing down. This is largely thanks to its nearly endless chest of iconic Disney characters from which to pull, ensuring that everyone can meet some of their favorites while exploring their valley. That is, everyone who is willing to pay for a Founders Pack, which starts at $29.99 and grants early access ahead of the game's eventual free-to-play launch.</p><p>Of course, it's reasonable that not everyone wants to drop half the price of a normal game on a title that sports microtransactions and will eventually be entirely free. But when exactly will Dreamlight Valley be free to play? Let's take a look at what we know so far.</p><h2>When Will Disney Dreamlight Valley Be Free To Play?</h2><p>Developer Gameloft has confirmed that Dreamlight Valley will launch its free-to-play version at some point in 2023, though the company has stopped short of making any promises about an exact release date. A recent content roadmap promises an entirely new chapter of the game much later this year, as well as the long-awaited addition of multiplayer, so it's possible that such a large update could accompany the game's official free-to-play launch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-will-disney-dreamlight-valley-be-free-to-play/1100-6515695/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite: How To Carry A Full Stack Of Ammo 10 Meters

<p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>, you'll want to carry a full stack of ammo 10 meters in order to unlock everything related to Purradise Meowscles, Chapter 4 Season 3's midseason bonus skin. The beloved cat himself will already be unlocked by the time you get this challenge in your quest log, but you'll need to complete it in order to unlock his related player emblem. The wording of the challenge--"full stack"--isn't often used in Fortnite, so it's maybe a bit confusing, but don't worry, as we have your answer here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to carry a full stack of ammo for 10 meters in Fortnite</h2><p dir="ltr">A "full stack" of ammo just means you've hit the carrying capacity for a type of ammo. Any type of ammo--light, medium, heavy, or shotgun shells--will suffice, but they each have different requirements for what counts as a full stack.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the <strong>requirements are actually slightly lower in Team Rumble mode</strong>, it may be in your best interest to play that mode, land in a named location with at least one vending machine--Mega City is your best bet, but all named locations have vending machines--and then buy out and/or pick up all the ammo you can. We've listed full stack totals below for each ammo type currently in the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-how-to-carry-a-full-stack-of-ammo-10-meters/1100-6515738/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Amid Xbox Exclusivity Concerns, Hi-Fi Rush Dev Says It Didn't Shelve Any Platforms After Acquisition

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, one of the early pleasant surprises of 2023, launched exclusively on Xbox and PC. But there were never any plans for the game to launch on other platforms before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-now-officially-owns-bethesda-in-7-5-billion-purchase/1100-6488574/">Microsoft acquired publisher Bethesda Softworks</a>, according to game director John Johanas, who also shared that Game Pass benefited developer Tango Gameworks.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot during an interview at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/anime-expo-2023-the-best-cosplay-from-attack-on-titan-to-overwatch/2900-4804/">Anime Expo 2023</a>, Johanas stated that when the Microsoft purchase happened, it was late into the game's development, and the team was "undecided on platforms right as this was happening, and then it was like, 'Okay, Xbox, that was easy.'" Johanas said. "It's not that we had something working, and we just shelved it or anything like that."</p><p>After Microsoft officially purchased Bethesda parent company ZeniMax in 2021, Johanas said Microsoft was very hands-off.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-xbox-exclusivity-concerns-hi-fi-rush-dev-says-it-didnt-shelve-any-platforms-after-acquisition/1100-6515737/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Anime Expo 2023: The Best Cosplay From Attack On Titan To Overwatch

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1746/17463818/4160895-axmainpic.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the main lures to get people to attend Anime Expo is to be among the first to view the latest trailers for their favorite shows or even get a chance to demo unreleased games revealed throughout the four-day event. After all, who doesn't like to be one of the first to experience something? But one thing you can't forget about is all of the cosplayers who attend. Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/san-diego-comic-con-2022s-best-cosplay-from-captain-america-to-squid-game/2900-4227/">San Diego Comic-Con</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nycc-2022-check-out-some-of-the-best-cosplay-from-the-con/2900-4395/">New York Comic-Con</a>, cosplayers come from all over to show off their latest creations. These cosplayers spent months creating--either with fine detail or something they whipped together last second with nothing but duct tape and love--ridiculously cool costumes and they deserve to be celebrated.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, Anime Expo is no different than other conventions in that regard, with various cosplayers walking around the Los Angeles Convention Center in full costume. Even though the convention is centered around anime, fandoms from all across came to show off what they made, with characters such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-mccrees-new-name-in-overwatch/1100-6497324/">Cole Cassidy</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> stopping by to heroes like Spider-Gwen, and Spider-Punk from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review/1900-6418074/">Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse</a> swinging through the halls.</p><p dir="ltr">Those were just a few, there were plenty of popular names to show up, such as Goku, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chainsaw-man-review-it-cuts-like-a-knife-and-it-feels-alright/1900-6417975/">Chainsaw Man</a>, and Deku, all running around. But that's just the tip of the iceberg of what characters ran through the halls during the four-day event. Did you attend the convention?

## Insidious: The Red Door - Once More Into The Further

<p dir="ltr">After a pair of prequels focusing on Lin Shaye's paranormal investigator, Insidious: The Red Door brings the series back to its original story thread: the Lambert family and the spooky ghosts who haunt them. This is a direct sequel to the second Insidious film--the third and fourth were prequels--picking up a decade later with Dalton (Ty Simpkins) all grown up and heading off to college, where he's about to meet some familiar malevolent spirits.</p><p dir="ltr">When I tell you that Insidious: The Red Door is a direct sequel to the second film, I'm saying this is not just another ghost story featuring the Lamberts that takes place after the last one. The Red Door is all about unpacking the trauma of those past events and actually trying to deal with them. That's a big deal--it's rare for horror sequels to be this concerned with ongoing stories like this. And it's that level of care that makes Insidious: The Red Door worth watching.</p><p dir="ltr">In the second film--which was released in 2013--the dad, Josh (Patrick Wilson, making his directorial debut with The Red Door), was possessed by the ghost of a serial killer called The Bride in Black, who had haunted him since childhood. The Bride made him try to kill his family, but in the end it was young Dalton (Ty Simpkins, who reprises the role as an adult in The Red Door) who braved the spirit realm and returned Josh to his body. To both bury the trauma of the event and hopefully prevent more incursions by ghosts, both Josh and Dalton were hypnotized and forced to forget every memory they had of these evil spirits.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/insidious-the-red-door-once-more-into-the-further/1900-6418086/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Diablo 4 Season 1's New Malignant Villains Are Changing The Game

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> brought modern sensibilities to the long-running action-RPG series, and it resulted in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/">refined gameplay experience with a surprisingly gripping story</a>. But there was clearly more that could be done with the foundation it laid. One of those modernisms is Blizzard's approach to seasonal content--and at a time where it seems like every other game has battle passes and seasons of updates, there's an understandable hesitancy to buy in. Diablo isn't an exception, either, especially since Diablo 3 followed a similar pattern. However, like an MMORPG, Blizzard has an opportunity to expand on and improve Diablo 4 at a more iterative pace. Its first shot will be the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-and-character-reset-details/1100-6514821/">Season 1--known as Season of the Malignant</a>--which brings on a new wave of enemies, dungeons, gear, and story content.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its July 20 launch date, we spoke with lead dungeon designer Michelle Piña and game director Joe Shely about how this first season is changing things up from a gameplay perspective. It seems that the focus is going to be on a tighter gameplay loop with regards to rewards and dungeon-crawling, but this all starts after finishing the main story, when a new plague spreads and morphs some existing monsters into what are called the Malignant.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo 4, Elite-level enemies are tough foes found throughout the world, but in this seasonal update, they have a chance of appearing as Malignant monsters. They're described as supercharged versions with new attack patterns and properties, and they can pop up in public events, normal dungeons, or Nightmare dungeons but will mostly be encountered in a new set of dungeons called Malignant Tunnels.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-1s-new-malignant-villains-are-changing-the-game/1100-6515727/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> Season 1 will kick off in just a few weeks on July 20, Blizzard has announced during a developer livestream, bringing with it a new seasonal questline, items, and gameplay mechanics.</p><p>The first season, titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-1s-new-malignant-villains-are-changing-the-game/1100-6515727/">Season of the Malignant</a>, will see players facing more powerful, Malignant enemies that can be conquered in order to capture their hearts. Those hearts can then be turned into powerful gem-like items called Caged Hearts that can be socketed into gear and grant additional effects. These Malignant powers are equivalent to Legendary powers and will allow players to create what Blizzard has described as "kind of new, stupid broken builds."</p><p>There are a total of 32 new Malignant powers players will be able to choose from. These powers come in Caged Hearts of three different colors and will need to be placed in gear with a matching color socket in order to be used. A rarer version of a Caged Heart will be eligible to be socketed into any of the three color sockets. Blizzard said players will want a combination of all Caged Heart color types, which will create new ways for players to customize their builds.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-starts-july-20-will-allow-for-stupid-broken-builds/1100-6515734/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Peter Molyneux, the famed video game designer known for his work on the Fable series and making bold claims about his projects, has begun to tease his next game.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/here-are-the-first-ever-details-on-peter-molyneuxs-next-project-at-22cans-1281593/">GameReactor</a>, Molyneux said his next game has a mechanic that has "never been seen in a game before."</p><p>"I feel like we are exploiting that mechanic in a world and an environment which may be familiar to people. And because it is in a familiar environment, it'll be a lot fresher," Molyneux said. "And a lot of this is very mystical because I'm trying to avoid to tell you what it's like. But it's going to be a lot more like a kind of Fable, Black and White, Dungeon Keeper kind of experience."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-says-next-game-includes-something-no-game-before-it-has-ever-had/1100-6515733/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Helldivers 2 got a new trailer and it outlines how co-op works in the tactical shooter sequel, including new and returning stratagems and friendly fire.</p><p>You can equip stratagems to drop resupply caches, powerful weapons, one-time attacks, and helpful aims like a gatling sentry gun. You can also customize your armor, with heavier builds letting you soak up damage and resist elemental attacks, and lighter ones letting you move more quickly and with less chance of enemy detection.</p><div>          </div><p>The kind of mission will also affect what loadout you should bring to it. Some enemies are heavily armored, so you'll want to bring armor-piercing weapons and equipment with you. If you are taking out a hive, you should bring explosive loadouts that will let you eliminate multiple enemies quickly and efficiently.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-keeps-friendly-fire-on-even-with-destructive-new-weapons/1100-6515731/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> patch coming later today will make it so players have a chance of earning Unique items from Helltide chests.</p><p>The change was announced during the latest Diablo IV developer update livestream, where details about the game's first season and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-new-blood-knight-class-is-a-first-for-the-whole-franchise/1100-6515729/">new class for Diablo Immortal were also revealed</a>. If you didn't know Unique items couldn't already drop from Helltide chests, you aren't alone. Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson also didn't know Unique couldn't drop from Helltide chests until now.</p><p>It's a nice change that should make Diablo IV's endgame a little smoother, making it easier to target-farm for specific items that players may be chasing in order to perfect their builds. Players have complained that some of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-ultra-rare-unique-items-are-so-rare-blizzard-had-to-confirm-they-actually-exist/1100-6515491/">ultra-rare Uniques are so rare they might as well not even exist</a>, so these changes will hopefully make them (ever so slightly) more common.

<p>More than six years after the console originally launched in March 2017, the Nintendo Switch has just set another sales record.

<p>The Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One crew constructed an actual train for Tom Cruise and co-star Esai Morales to fight on. After filming multiple elements of the train setpiece, the crew filmed the destruction of the train.</p><p>In a new featurette (via <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/tom-cruise-fought-mission-impossible-7-actor-speeding-train-60-mph-1235662651/">Variety</a>), director Christopher McQuarrie explained, "There was not a surplus of trains available to be wrecked. We had to build the train if we wanted to destroy it." As several scenes are shot in the interior of the train, that included designing the individual train car as well as ensuring they could function on a real track.</p><p>Cruise and Morales do battle on the top of the train. This was filmed practically, with both actors strapped on the train as it spend down a valley in Norway. The train hit 60 miles-per-hour during filming. Morales said, "I've done fight scenes, but to do them on a moving train is trial by fire. That's how Tom likes to do things." After finishing the rest of the photography, the crew had to film the train flying off the track. McQuarrie said, "every single camera had exactly exactly one shot at getting it right."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mission-impossible-filmmakers-built-a-train-and-then-destroyed-it-for-epic-action-scene-in-dead-reckoning/1100-6515723/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Malenia is a name that still strikes fear into the hearts of many an Elden Ring player, but the legendary boss has met her match in the form of a plucky goldfish. Tortellini, under the guidance of Twitch streamer and YouTuber <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1861683916"><u>PointCrow</u></a>, just managed to defeat the dreaded warrior in her first phase, seemingly without breaking a fishy sweat.</p><p>How is Tortellini capable of such a feat? According to PointCrow, a lot of coaching has helped Tortellini master the controls of Elden Ring, and depending on its position in the tank when it swims across controls mapped to the game, it's able to take on Elden Ring bosses with aquatic grace. "Depending on where Tortellini is in the tank, he'll press a button on a controller which will control Elden Ring," PointCrow explained in a stream (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/this-elden-ring-players-goldfish-just-beat-malenia-seriously/">GamesRadar</a>).</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">my goldfish beat the first phase of malenia LMAO <a href="https://t.co/d0FD6jHg0U">pic.twitter.com/d0FD6jHg0U</a></p>  — eric pointcrow (@PointCrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/PointCrow/status/1676280763304792064?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">video will be out sometime in the next week!</p>  — eric pointcrow (@PointCrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/PointCrow/status/1676281910790852608?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-goldfish-is-better-than-youll-ever-be-at-elden-ring/1100-6515719/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The Nun 2 takes place four years after the events in the first Nun movie and will be the ninth entry into the franchise. </p><p>The Nun 2 follows Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) as she once again comes face to face with the demonic force Valak, the titular and terrifying Nun.

<p dir="ltr">It's been over a decade since Kid Icarus: Uprising, and the wait for another game in the franchise has no end in sight. So don't expect to see Pit outside of Super Smash Bros.

<p>In the Sims 4 expansion Horse Ranch, you can raise and train horses, build with new farm and ranch-style materials, grow fruits and vegetables to make into wine, and even encounter ghost horses. All these features, as well as the new town of Chestnut Ridge, are shown off in a new trailer.</p><p>Every horse, just like every sim, has needs that must be accommodated if they are going to survive and thrive. Horses can be aggressive or prickly as well as friendly and accommodating. The more your sim bonds with their horse, the easier it will be to do tricks. After your sims train their horses, you can enter them in competitions like barrel racing and jumping. Horses can have foals, which will inherit traits just like pets and sims. Your sims can ride their horses around town and explore nature trails.</p><div>          </div><p>The expansion pack also adds additional animals, like mini goats and sheep. You can also grow and make nectar (read: wine) from a variety of base ingredients, like grapes, apples, and strawberries. You can even age your nectar to turn a higher profit. Your sim will mash the grapes (or whatever you are using) themselves. If taking care of your sim's horse or any of the work around the ranch becomes overwhelming, your sim can hire a ranch hand to help out around their property.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-horse-ranch-expansion-lets-you-raise-horses-and-run-a-vineyard/1100-6515713/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Before Steven Spielberg dropped out of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the story was expected to be pretty different than what was ultimately delivered, according to an actor. James Mangold, the Oscar-nominated director who made Ford v Ferrari, Logan, and Walk the Line, stepped up to direct the movie after Spielberg bowed out. Along with the director change also came a change in the script, it seems.</p><h3><strong>This story contains spoilers for The Dial of Destiny.</strong></h3><div>          </div><p>Karen Allen returns in The Dial of Destiny to play Marion Ravenwood, but her part in the film was reportedly scaled back significantly. Allen told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/indiana-jones-karen-allen-ending-marian-ravenwood-1235658680/">Variety</a> she thought The Dial of Destiny would continue Marion and Indy's story after the dramatic events of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</p><p>For anyone unaware, that movie ended with Marion and Indiana Jones getting married after Marion revealed that Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) was his son. But in The Dial of Destiny, it is revealed that Marion and Indiana separated after Mutt was killed in the Vietnam War.

<p>A new update has gone live for Final Fantasy 16, and if you've been hoping to see a menu option to tone down the game's extreme use of motion blur, you're in luck. Alongside a few other adjustments and new features, you'll now be able to adjust how much motion blur you want the game to produce or turn it off entirely.</p><p>Motion blur can now be adjusted from a range of five values, with five being the heaviest use of that option. <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/update-final-fantasy-xvi">Square Enix says</a> that the game will also have new settings for camera sensitivity and it can be switched off from automatically following you while moving and attacking, respectively. Three new controller layouts have been added, and some minor tweaks to text issues and menu stability are also being introduced in this patch.</p><p>Lastly, anyone looking to share their progress in the game on social media or just a cool snapshot of Clive flame-punching a wyvern into ashes will now see the FF16 hashtag automatically added to media shared on Twitter and YouTube. Final Fantasy 16 launched exclusively for PS5 on June 22, and like several other high-profile titles this year, it has been a big hit both critically and commercially.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-final-fantasy-16-update-lets-you-turn-off-motion-blur/1100-6515700/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
