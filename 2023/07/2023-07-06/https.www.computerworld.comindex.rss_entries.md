<p>The age of generative AI comes with the promise that it will <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3694349/do-the-productivity-gains-from-generative-ai-outweigh-the-security-risks.html">significantly increase productivity</a>. I can certainly see the potential given I’m using a form of it writing this column and it is doing a decent job of anticipating the next word I intend to write. But I’m also noticing that to get the most from this feature, I need to hit the right arrow key, which slows me down considerably. So, I generally end up typing the entire word anyway because the keyboard I’m using doesn’t lend itself to making autocomplete work.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3701930/digital-transformation-ai-and-the-productivity-problem.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Can you run your business on a 15-in. MacBook Air? I’ve used one for about a week, and I think most people can. It provides <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3668249/review-apples-m2-macbook-air.html">everything that's good in the existing M2 MacBook Air</a>, but with a bigger screen and an approachable price.</p><h2><strong>Out of the box</strong></h2>
<p>Out of the box you can expect the usual Apple "wow" factor. The 0.45-in. thin, 3.3-pound, Midnight 512GB model I tested looks great, though I have developed a somewhat obsessive habit of cleaning up finger-marks on the chassis. (This model sells for $1,499.)</p><p>The packaging is a story in itself. Apple continues working to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700156/with-its-green-commitments-apple-aims-to-go-where-consumers-are.html">reduce its environmental impact</a>, which means it has largely abandoned plastic in packaging. Instead, Apple’s boxes now make liberal use of clever paper tabs, glue, and highly effective design ideas <a href="https://www.applemust.com/apples-secretive-design-department-opens-up-to-wallpaper/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">borrowed from Origami</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3701891/apples-new-15-in-m2-macbook-air-is-a-consumer-workhorse.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
