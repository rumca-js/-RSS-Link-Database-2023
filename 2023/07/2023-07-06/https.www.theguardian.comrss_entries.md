<p><strong>London Palladium<br /></strong>This adaptation has a luminous performance from Georgina Onuorah as Dorothy and some great ideas but throws too much at the audience</p><p>This turbo-charged revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jeremy Sams’ musical adaptation serves up a hybrid theatre-cum-cinema experience. The proscenium arch is reframed as a luminous screen and the production pays clear homage to the 1939 film. But nostalgic imagery of rural Kansas is spliced with a futuristic world and we are taken to an Oz that is big, kitsch and unfamiliar.</p><p>Directed by Nikolai Foster, the adventures of Dorothy and her friends seem reconceived as a Steven Spielberg-style action movie, the back screen resembling a VR game. We slalom down the Yellow Brick Road and into Emerald City, which looks like New York’s Times Square with a green wash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/06/the-wizard-of-oz-review-london-palladium">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Briton comes from set down to lead fifth seed</li><li>Match resumes on Friday at 6-7 (3), 7-6 (2), 6-4</li></ul><p>Andy Murray has placed himself in a strong position as he chases his biggest win of the last six years by establishing a 6-7 (3), 7-6 (2), 6-4 lead against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the fifth seed, before their Wimbledon second round match was postponed at 10.40pm due to the 11pm curfew at the All England Club. Murray and Tsitsipas will return on Friday afternoon to complete their match with a place in the last 32 on the line.</p><p>While Murray waltzed to two grass-court challenger titles earlier this summer, Tsitsipas arrived at Wimbledon in curious form. Despite reaching the final of the Australian Open, seven months into the season he still has not won a title. His form was even worse on grass, where he compiled a dire 1-3 win-loss record before Wimbledon with two first-round defeats.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/06/andy-murray-battles-back-to-take-lead-over-stefanos-tsitsipas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jim Caviezel stars as a hero trying to stop child traffickers in a paranoid new movie turning into a surprise box-office hit</p><p>Type the words “sound of freedom” into Twitter (decent people who wish to live good, happy lives should under no circumstances actually do this) and the search will yield dozens of triumphant reports crowing about the improbable victory of a film by that title over the likes of Indiana Jones at the box office this week.</p><p>That’s not, strictly speaking, accurate – Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny had already been out for five days, the first three of which out-earned Sound of Freedom’s opening-day take, when the new independent thriller came to theaters on Tuesday. But for a fleeting moment this past Fourth of July, while the intended audience of Indy’s latest outing was presumably spending time with their families and friends at barbecues or in other social situations, an unoccupied fandom rallied by the star Jim Caviezel claimed the day with a $14.2m gross versus Dial of Destiny’s $11.7m. No matter that these figures require selective, almost willfully misleading framing to allow for the David-and-Goliath narrative trumpeted by supporters; as the copious tweets accusing Disney of being in cahoots with a global cabal of high-power pedophiles make clear, the truth doesn’t have too much purchase around these parts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/06/sound-of-freedom-movie-qanon-jim-caviezel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This emotive documentary follows the athlete’s attempt to find her birth mother – and tackle how achondroplasia influenced the decision to put her up for adoption. It’s revelatory stuff</p><p>Penny has been helping to place babies and children with dwarfism – the condition she has herself – with adoptive families for the last 30 years. She describes herself as “a link person” – her very presence demystifying and destigmatising what the child or baby “means”, lessening fears and making greater things possible. When she has a child come to her, she has a private message she whispers over them when they are sleeping. “I say: ‘You’ll be fine. Somebody will love you, somebody will come for you.’” She tells Paralympic gold medallist Ellie Simmonds this shyly, with an almost embarrassed laugh. She’s never told anyone she does this “daft” thing before.</p><p>She tells Ellie now because Ellie, in fact, has heard it before. Penny said it to her 27 years ago when Ellie was a baby in a foster family, having been given up for adoption a few days after birth. The Simmonds family came for her, and the Simmonds family loved her. They added her to their brood, which would eventually number five children.</p><p>Ellie Simmonds: Finding My Secret Family aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVX.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/06/ellie-simmonds-finding-my-secret-family-review-a-hugely-moving-journey-into-the-paralympians-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The goalkeeper will have to accept a wage cut or move on with André Onana the No 1 target to replace him</p><p>The key to the buy-to-sell transfer market challenge that Erik ten Hag faces is located in the Manchester United manager’s loss of confidence in David de Gea. Illustrated, the conundrum would depict the Dutchman as a juggler keeping aloft his ability to sign André Onana (or another goalkeeper) and a centre-forward only by offloading Harry Maguire, Fred, Anthony Elanga and, maybe, even more peripheral squad members.</p><p>Why? Because Ten Hag’s budget is about £120m, of which £55m has been spent on Mason Mount, meaning Maguire, Elanga and Fred are the prime candidates to be sold to raise the requisite cash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/06/david-de-gea-manchester-united-andre-onana-transfers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After his contentious dismissal of Jonny Bairstow, England’s bete noire was given a hostile reception in Yorkshire</p><p>“Just wait til Carey comes out.” The booing began before he even appeared, in fact. They were booing in the Western Terrace from the moment the umpires walked on to the field after tea. Without <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/05/a-crease-a-stumping-and-spirit-of-the-game-the-ashes-controversy-explained" title="">the benefit of the backstory</a>, you might have supposed an entire stand of passionate England cricket fans were dissing their own team, the soundwaves reaching the fielders long before the Australian batting pair followed them on to the ground. Not unlike a ball leaving Alex Carey’s hands before Jonny Bairstow walked out of his crease.</p><p>“He’s not worth booing,” said Nick to his friend Annie. “I’m not wasting my breath.” He saved it for the chants, sung on loop like an only-the-hits radio station. <em>Same old Aussies. That’s all you’re remembered for. Stand up if you hate Carey.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/06/were-like-piranhas-rowdy-western-terrace-sinks-its-teeth-into-alex-carey">Continue reading...</a>

He hit a top speed of 96.5mph on the speed gun but, more crucially for the fate of this third instalment, claimed five for 34 as Australia, inserted at the toss by Stokes, were bowled out for 263 in 60.4 overs.</p><p>The tourists slightly squandered a superb fightback from Marsh who, four years on from his last Test outing in the 2019 Ashes, had crashed a run-a-ball 118 during a one-sided afternoon.

<p>The Commons standards committee is right that the former government minister must be suspended for sexual harassment</p><p>A year ago on Friday, Boris Johnson announced his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnuVrYpEge4" title="">resignation</a> as prime minister. His Downing Street statement signalled the end of probably the worst and certainly the most chaotic government in modern British history. But it also brought an end to one of Britain’s most miserably consequential administrations of recent times, which took – or in some cases failed to take – actions for which this country is still paying the price, while the man himself coins it on the international speechmaking circuit.</p><p>Mr Johnson had presided, if that is the right word for someone so narcissistic and slapdash, over the government of the disastrous Brexit deal; over the botched response to the Covid pandemic (the courts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/06/ministers-lose-legal-challenge-over-boris-johnson-whatsapps-covid-inquiry" title="">ruled</a> on Thursday that Mr Johnson’s unredacted pandemic era WhatsApps will be handed to the Covid inquiry); and has showed a selfish disregard, verging on corruption, towards many of the most basic rules and ethics of government. A year ago it was clear that he did not understand he was not up to the job. That is still true a year on. <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNewsAgents/status/1676618884298752002" title="">In a new interview</a>, asked about the events that led up to his resignation, he leans his head to one side and pretends to snore. He just doesn’t get it. But he just doesn’t care either.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-chris-pincher-case-the-johnson-era-is-not-dead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The authorities have put a price on activists who fled abroad.

However admirable their cause or brilliant their tactics, it is hard to maintain the world’s interest and support as time passes. Hong Kong’s exiles are conscious of this problem. But it is Hong Kong’s government which has catapulted them back into the spotlight, by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/exiled-hong-kong-activists-in-uk-defiant-about-hk1m-bounties-for-their-arrest" title="">placing a bounty</a> of 1m Hong Kong dollars each – around £100,000 – on eight activists.

After the authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/25/opinion/hong-kong-protest-china-beijing.html" title="">crushed resistance there</a>, they tried to keep alive the cause from overseas. For this, they are accused of collusion with foreign forces, incitement of secession, and subversion. Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, has said the city will pursue them “to the ends of the earth”, and that they must “live in fear” – all for peaceful political advocacy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/06/the-guardian-view-on-hong-kongs-pursuit-of-exiles-these-bounties-should-backfire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour’s new education policy aims to give all children a better start. It will be a long road to undo the damage this government has done</p><p>Class? Labour was once too wary of the mine-strewn territory to use the word. Tony Blair talked of meritocracy – “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/13/labour.tonyblair">we are meritocrats</a>”, he declared in his first keynote speech of the 2001 general election campaign. He called for “equality of opportunity”. While his 18 taskforces on the causes of “social exclusion” yielded many successes – a <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/news/how-britain-cut-child-poverty-half-ten-years">50% decrease</a> in the number of poor children and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/12/teenage-pregnancy-study">sharp fall in teen pregnancy</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9e5a071d-b513-34a2-8b18-14ef572cf996">youth unemployment</a> – he generally avoided any talk of inequality itself, or class.</p><p>Keir Starmer strode into that minefield on Thursday outlining the fifth of his “missions”, and the one that may prove the most politically defining: he calls it “my personal cause”. He would “shatter the class ceiling”. He spoke of the “snobbery” of the academic versus vocational gap and of the mental barriers telling working class children “this isn’t for you”. Politicians avoid the word, yet there it still is, large as life.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/06/keir-starmer-breaking-down-class-barriers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a dearth of R-rated big screen hijinks, the industry bets again on films like No Hard Feelings and Joy Ride to lure crowds</p><p>Joy Ride, in theaters this Friday, is not for the modest. The R-rated road trip movie, from the director Adele Lim (Crazy Rich Asians), follows four friends, played by Ashley Park, Sabrina Wu, Sherry Cola and the Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu (from Everything Everywhere All at Once), on a weeklong romp through China that is deliriously deranged and unapologetically lascivious. There’s a moving plot about searching for one’s identity after a life in white America and a pointed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/04/newsflash-were-not-all-meek-how-brash-funny-asian-women-took-over-our-screens">subversion of the trope of meek Asian women</a>. But Joy Ride is primarily crass and vigorous, viscerally horny comedy, pulling from such R-rated touchstones as The Hangover, Bridesmaids and Girls Trip – binge drinking and vomit, copious references to several orifices, cartoonish clouds of cocaine, a raucous sex montage that made me giggle with a sound I have not heard from myself in a long time.</p><p>In other words, not something often seen on the big screen these days, as Hollywood studios, weathering the bite of streaming services and the pandemic, pivot even further into franchise fare and mined IP. Given the endless sinkhole of options from one’s couch, theatrical releases tend to bet on the appeal of a communal movie-watching experience – the hype of a franchise release, or a big-name spectacle (such as Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer), a new spin on a familiar name (the Barbie movie) or elevated, offbeat horror (this year’s surprise box office hits M3gan or Cocaine Bear). The 90s and 2000s were full of decently reviewed and profitable R-rated romps – American Pie, Superbad, The Hangover, the catalog of Judd Apatow stoner bro movies, etc – but it’s been a long time since moviegoers could rally around boundary-pushing, gut-twisting laughs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/06/summer-comedy-movie-no-hard-feelings-joy-ride">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Margaret Irvine, who has died aged 75 following a fall last year from which she did not recover, set crosswords for the Guardian as Nutmeg.</p><p>Despite a lifelong interest in words, Margaret came to setting crosswords relatively late in life, when she sent some puzzles on spec to the Guardian. The paper published her first in 2006 as an online Quiptic puzzle, but she was soon also setting regular cryptics for the paper. Her elegantly constructed clues quickly made her a hit with Guardian solvers. She chose Nutmeg as her Guardian nom de plume, because Meg is a diminutive of Margaret and she was happy to be considered a slightly eccentric “nut”. She went on also to set puzzles for the Times and the Church Times, and (as Mace) for the New Statesman.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2023/jul/06/nutmeg-margaret-irvine-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bridget Christie’s glorious sitcom tackles everything from sexism to the climate crisis. It gives us a sorely needed onscreen role model and its ending is gorgeous. Roll on season two!</p><p>Every woman’s relationship with her fertility is unique, but – in a world that has always valued a female based on what is happening with her womb – there is a trajectory most of us recognise. As teenagers, we are terrified of getting pregnant. For a small window in our 20s, we are allowed the luxury of choice – pregnancy feels so easy that we can “leave it until later”. But we hit 30 and suddenly “later” becomes today. We are told to hurry up and have a baby before it’s too late. With each year that passes, so too do our options. Then comes the menopause – more than 400 periods later, they begin to stop, only to be replaced for many by unpleasant symptoms.</p><p>In recent years, television has started to explore this wild, wonderful, infuriating, mind-boggling and, at times, horribly unfair journey. But it’s only now that the later chapters are being told – in the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/the-change-review-bridget-christies-super-cool-menopause-comedy-is-like-nothing-else-on-tv">The Change</a> (Channel 4), the debut comedy series from Bridget Christie. The 51-year-old comedian, who also performs standup shows about going through the menopause, has created a tale that both scrutinises and celebrates the experience. It is shot through with the kind of nuance that can only come from somebody who has been in the thick of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/06/the-most-profound-finale-of-the-year-why-menopause-comedy-the-change-is-life-affirming-tv">Continue reading...</a>

She became one of the most successful artists of all time, but it took her a long time. She grew up poor in Virginia. Her mother and father didn’t have a good relationship and she told a couple of her friends that her father had sexually molested her. When she was 13, she was hospitalised with a nearly fatal infection, and afterwards had this hoarseness which gave her a really booming voice.</p><p>After singing in the church choir with her mother, Cline sang in contests and begged to get backstage and meet people so that she could audition for them. She had a lot of conviction in her talents and what she wanted to do, and fought for it. She ended up moving to Nashville to work with 4 Star, a small record company, where she released her first couple of minor hits, including A Church, A Courtroom and then Goodbye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/she-makes-me-feel-seen-john-grant-on-the-greatness-of-patsy-cline-and-her-five-finest-songs">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Tommaso/Lynch/Hernández/Monte Carlo PO/Janowski<br />Pentatone (two CDs)<br /></strong>Recorded in two separate studios, Marek Janowski’s dashing recording of Verdi’s opera draws power from its authoritative star, even if the rest of the cast can’t quite measure up</p><p>New bespoke opera releases are rare commodities nowadays, and this is apparently the first studio sourced version of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/15/verdi-where-to-start-with-his-music">Verdi’s</a> tragicomedy since the mid-1990s. In fact this Un Ballo in Maschera has been sourced from two studios: the sessions took place in 2021 during and after lockdown, with the solo contributions recorded in Monte Carlo and the choruses by the Transylvania State Philharmonic Choir in Cluj, Romania, four months later. Not that anyone is likely to guess; the components have been seamlessly integrated in the final mix, with excellent orchestral playing and lustrous sound throughout.</p><p>Where many productions of Ballo these days opt to use the original settings and names that Verdi intended (the censors in Naples insisted on changes before the premiere), here we have the later ones – the action transplanted from Stockholm to the new world, with Rodrigo, governor of Boston, as the central character rather than King Gustavus III, his secretary Renato instead of Anckarströem, the conspirators Samuel and Tom not Ribbing and Horn, and so on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/verdi-un-ballo-in-maschera-review-freddie-de-tommaso-marek-janowski">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor discusses marriage to Peter Sellers, getting semi-naked with John Hurt, Rod Stewart’s legs and why she is happier now than in the swinging 60s</p><p><strong>Is it a constant annoyance that people seem to think it’s OK to ask you to explain how you have chosen to expose (or not expose) your body? </strong><em>Amongst</em><em>TheWaves<br /></em>Oh, have I exposed my body? Gosh, I’ve done my damnedest to use black camera tape to hide my nipples and cut my pants so you can’t see anything. The only film in which I expose the front of my body is The Wicker Man. I did a film with John Hurt called Scandal in which there was an orgy and we all had to be semi-naked. I was sitting on a couch in this big old building at the Polish Cultural Institute in [London’s] Exhibition Road, filled with half-naked people. Next to me is John Hurt. The director says: “Sit down” and he’s stark naked. He thought it would be helpful if he was naked, to make everyone feel free. But it doesn’t work that way. Probably like men trying not to look at a woman’s naked breast, I couldn’t help looking. Not that I wanted to see it, but the human mind draws you in. So, I don’t think that is a good question!</p><p><strong>You once said that you</strong><strong> have never been “anything other than mega famous</strong><strong>”. In the world of showbiz, </strong><strong>are ego and ambition more important than talent? </strong><em>liblabflab<br /></em>First of all, I have never in my life used the words “mega famous”. I would never speak about myself that way. Of course, there is a certain amount of ego and self-importance, but you don’t have to throw it around. I think I have always been respectful to my fans and to my fame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/06/britt-ekland-i-was-the-first-naked-female-a-lot-of-young-lads-ever-saw">Continue reading...</a>

In this exhibition Lagos invades Peckham enticingly: its sounds, sights and even flavours infuse the gallery.</p><p>Emeka Ogboh has worked particularly hard to layer the two cities together: his Lagos Soundscapes fill this London space with African urban street sounds, not just honking traffic but chants, street cries and rapping bus conductors. This recording was even played to Ogboh’s own craft beer – displayed in the show as a sculpture in crates and on sale at the cafe – as it fermented in south London to “flavour” it with the sounds of Lagos, as well as Nigerian spices. It is named after a tough Lagos saying: “No Food for Lazy Man”. And the magic realist brewing method works, for it tastes outstanding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/06/lagos-peckham-repeat-review-yoruba-culture-and-musical-craft-beer">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Exhibition Hall, SS Great Britain, Bristol<br /></strong>With a people-smuggling mariner, vigilant volunteers helping those seeking asylum and a setting evoking prison hulks, Lucy Bradley’s reworking is a sharp reflection of our island nation</p><p>OperaUpClose’s new production is not quite the opera as Wagner conceived it. The myth of the seaman condemned for eternity to sail the seas unless redeemed by love has been reconceived as a contemporary piece with political resonance. In a dystopian England hardening its borders, hostile to those seeking refuge, the Dutchman is a traumatised mariner who is a people-smuggler and Senta becomes Starlight, one of the vigilant volunteers out on the white cliffs, who has misgivings about the mission to “shield the island from invasion”.</p><p>When director Lucy Bradley originally conceived the idea – pre-pandemic – there was no inkling that, by the time the project came to fruition, the Home Office would have set in train such draconian anti-immigration measures as to make the imagined dystopia all too real. By way of underlining the opera’s coastal and maritime context, the company is touring at venues in historic seaports and, at a time when ships are being fitted out to house asylum seekers, no setting could be more symbolic than Brunel’s SS Great Britain in Bristol, the steamship rescued from the South Atlantic and restored as a monument to past glories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/the-flying-dutchman-review-exhibition-hall-ss-great-britain-bristol">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first ever Indian to be drafted into the NBA has reinvented himself in the world of pro wrestling under the AEW banner</p><p>Satnam Singh wouldn’t hurt a fly. Unless, of course, it was his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsEl8umGsaU">wrestling opponent</a> for a match in front of a cheering All Elite Wrestling crowd. Then, he might give the insect a little love tap or two. Still, though, Singh would inevitably play nice. No tearing off wings, no smashing under a frying pan. The 7ft 4in and 360lb former professional basketball player and current professional wrestler is as gentle a giant as they come in daily life. Singh is kind, considerate. Easily likable. Patience, he says, is a prized virtue. At the same time, he knows the magnificent power that’s in just his two hands. They could, without hyperbole, terminate someone in a blink – let alone a buzzing fly. Singh knows the strength of his hands from experience. Back in India where he was born, he lost his temper one day on the basketball court as a youth. He struck a then-smack-talking friend with what Singh says was merely 5% to 10% of his strength. A simple <em>slap </em>across the face. But his friend was knocked out cold and wouldn’t immediately wake up. In that moment, Singh knew he had to be careful. He’s never been in a skirmish since.</p><p>“No, never in my life,” Singh tells the Guardian in his low, cavernous voice. “Because I know who I am and how much power I have in my body, in my hands. So, I don’t want to use it outside of the ring. Because if I did, I’m sure, I’m 100% sure someone would be injured so bad.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/06/satnam-singh-aew-wrestling-nba-basketball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kicking off our new monthly series about emotions in literature, Sophie Ratcliffe finds the best literary descriptions of hopefulness</p><p>Many of us find it tricky to put our feelings into words, and few feelings are as slippery as hope. For the poet Emily Dickinson, it’s always on the brink of takeoff. Hope is, she writes, “the thing with feathers” that “perches in the soul”. For Virginia Woolf, though, hoping comes down to earth. Two years after her mother’s death, the teenager consoled herself by gardening. As she wrote to her brother:</p><p>Already we have created a flower bed … and we propose to renew the grass – to have a border of lilies and other flowers … in short do not be surprised if you behold a miniature Kew when you are next here … one of these days we hope to install a cow or at least a sheep on the luxuriant pastures.</p><p>after work, after dinner, after darkness had fallen, I couldn’t sit still. I went for long walks round and round our neighbourhood, retracing my steps, passing the same lit-up houses and shuttered corner shops again and again. As I walked I let thoughts come that were not so much hopes as pleas: <em>this month. I can feel it.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/06/the-last-word-on-hope">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Rough Trade)</strong><br />The New York singer’s voice will make you shiver as it soars over simple guitar, bass and drums on her most approachable album since the mid-00s</p><p>You would be hard-pushed to call <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/anohni">Anohni</a>’s sixth studio album – her first since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/anohni-hopelessness-review-the-most-profound-protest-record-in-decades">Hopelessness</a> seven years ago – anything other than an unexpected departure. Whatever path you imagined her admirably peripatetic career might take next, it’s unlikely you pictured it involving a collaboration with Jimmy Hogarth, producer and songwriter for the likes of James Blunt. Anohni’s recent releases had shifted her ever further into the musical left field – or rather, back towards the left field from where she sprang, Anohni being, in the words of her friend Rufus Wainwright, “a real underground downtown institution” in New York clubland long before the Mercury-winning success of 2005’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/observer/omm/10bestcds/story/0,12102,1416665,00.html">I Am a Bird Now</a> (recorded as Antony and the Johnsons) led another friend, Boy George, to suggest she could “outstrip Norah Jones and sell millions of records”. The feeling that the left field might have appealed more than the mainstream was hard to escape when listening to her 2020 cover of Bob Dylan’s It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue, her voice deliberately distorted in a way that made you wince. Or indeed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/03/anohni-on-her-new-track-rnc-2020-its-me-screaming-in-the-past-for-the-present">the same year’s RNC 2020</a>, a melange of screams and feedback that even its creator described as “pretty rough”.</p><p>But, three years on, here is Anohni’s album-length collaboration with the writer of James Bay’s gold-selling 2015 single If You Ever Want to Be in Love and Duffy’s Warwick Avenue. You can speculate as to the reasons – a disinclination to be pigeonholed? A desire for her serious lyricism about the climate crisis, gender and capitalism to reach as wide an audience as possible? Whatever the reason, My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross may be the most approachable album Anohni has made since the mid-00s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/anohni-and-the-johnsons-my-back-was-a-bridge-for-you-to-cross-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A poignant novel inspired by The Snow Goose about the search for connection and contentment</p><p>Elderly Freda is in a care home in Hackney, remembering her wartime evacuation to the Lincolnshire Wash, where at 12 years old she was sent on a train away from all she knew in east London. Hubbard’s description of this phase in Freda’s life – the bleak landscape, the cold house, the minimum rations, the abuse, Freda getting her first period, alone and with no one to ask – is affecting and memorable, as is the cruelty of most of the people Freda meets during this time.</p><p>For survivors, memories of the wartime years have become “a patchwork of events etched across our hearts”, thinks Freda. But the attempts of care home staff to interest her in a BBC programme commemorating the 75th anniversary of Dunkirk are met with listlessness. “Soon it will pass from living memory and be no more relevant than the Battle of Waterloo,” Freda muses in her diary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/06/flatlands-by-sue-hubbard-review-a-tender-portrait-of-wartime-youth">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Rich Mix, London<br /></strong>Ian Wilson’s music-theatre piece, a eulogy to his late father combining live violin with a poignant soundtrack, is haunting and moving</p><p>Five years ago, when the composer Ian Wilson was asked to speak at his father’s funeral, like so many people he found it hard to know what to say. Now he has created a kind of wordless eulogy: Beside the Sea, which had its first UK performance at the <a href="https://spitalfieldsmusic.org.uk/events/spitalfields-music-festival-2023/">Spitalfields music festival</a> after several in Ireland. Fifty minutes long, it’s a solo music-theatre piece that is simultaneously a tribute to Wilson’s father’s passions, an examination of his long decline through Alzheimer’s and a wider rumination on identity and loss.</p><p>The protagonist is not a representation of Wilson or his father but a female violinist, Dušica Mladenović. Directed by Olivia Songer, she moves and plays on a small stage designed by Jack Scullion that looks like the interior of a fisher’s hut, but with a guitar, sheet music and vinyl records hanging where you would expect ropes and buckets. There is the suggestion of ageing in Mladenović’s movements, initially perky, later weary – the hint of a journey through life. She plays alongside a soundtrack made by Wilson in collaboration with Steve McCourt, built on the noises of the things Wilson’s father loved: the sea, the creak of a sailing boat, the clank of tools in a workshop, the strum of his guitar. Among these we hear recordings of the male choir he sang with for 40 years, and, most poignantly, of his wife, Wilson’s mother, a professional singer whose voice is one of the last things he recognised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/06/beside-the-sea-review-rich-mix-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Summer flopbusters: why have Indiana Jones and The Flash bombed at the box office?

<p>A de-aged Harrison Ford battling Nazis and a double helping of Batmen in The Flash have not proved sufficient for either of these ‘tentpole’ releases</p><p>It is thought that the Antikythera mechanism, rebranded the “dial of destiny” in the latest Indiana Jones movie, was a device invented by the ancient Greeks to predict eclipses and monitor the movement of the sun. Whether its prescience can be applied to box office takings isn’t known: some estimates date the contraption to as early as 200BC, when there was a dismaying lack of interest in domestic grosses and opening weekends. But, if it could, it might have revealed that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/03/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-disappoints-box-office-harrison-ford">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a> was heading for a full-on Temple of Doom scenario. If you want to imagine what the studio executives looked like when they received word of the dismal grosses for their $300m (£235m) movie, cast your mind back to the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark: eyes popping, faces melting, that sort of thing.</p><p>“Tentpole” releases, as summer blockbusters are known, are no longer the guaranteed behemoths they were in the pre-Covid era: the marquee is sagging, the tentpole in danger of snapping. Last month, the DC superhero adventure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/06/the-flash-review-ezra-miller-doppelganger-superhero-is-a-gurning-smirking-mess">The Flash</a> took a catastrophic dive into the red, and is now on course to become one of the biggest flops in Warner Bros’ history. Expectations were high for the movie, though maybe there should have been a shade more scepticism when James Gunn, co-CEO of DC Studios, announced that it was one of the best superhero movies he’d seen. As scoops go, “Executive Claims His Company’s Product ‘Better Than Everyone Else’s’” lacks a certain rigour, not to mention novelty value.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-the-flash-bombed-box-office-harrison-ford">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Has the UK too readily adopted a US perspective when it comes to race?</p><p>The term <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/22/cultural-cringe-why-arent-there-more-songs-celebrating-birmingham-and-huddersfield-and-bolton" title="">cultural cringe</a> makes an early appearance in Tomiwa Owolade’s This Is Not America. Coined by the Australian critic AA Phillips to express the fawning relationship of some of his fellow citizens to traditional British culture, Owolade believes it applies to the attitudes of many contemporary Britons towards the US. America is often accepted as the primary shaper of truths. Its landscapes, myths and histories can seem closer to us than our own. Like it or not, we’re all, to some degree, in its thrall.</p><p>Black British people are even greater consumers of American ideas than other demographic groups. African American culture is often downed neat and uncritically. Its vision of a seemingly coherent community with an identifiable middle class, centuries of “blood in the soil” and racial solidarity go some way to assuaging the familiar, rootless condition described by the author Joan Riley as “the unbelonging”. African American experiences inform our lives and have come to underpin our dialogues around identity. They are central to what it means to be Black in Britain today. But how appropriate or helpful is it to play this subaltern role?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/06/this-is-not-america-by-tomiwa-owolade-review-a-british-take-on-black-identity">Continue reading...</a>

In his drama, Kwame Kwei-Armah takes Beneatha (Cherrelle Skeete) to Lagos – only to find colonialism’s enmeshed tentacles difficult to clear.</p><p>If Hansberry’s play is about ownership – whether Black Americans have a stake in the American dream – then Kwei-Armah’s concerns legacy: the persistent effects of colonialism and how Black thinkers can shape the future. After a first act set in 1959, the second returns a widowed Beneatha to present-day Lagos. Now a revered American social scientist, she brings her mostly white colleagues to her former home to discuss the future of the field – whether they should continue African American studies or instead launch a “Critical Whiteness” major. Are white students bored of guilt and Black students of this grim heritage? Is it true that “race as we know it is dead”?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/06/beneathas-place-review-young-vic-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Bungalows are now ‘seriously cool’? I don’t believe that – and I live in one | Rebecca Nicholson

<p>The sturdy, sensible single-storey homes are having a renaissance – but that may just be to do with Britain’s broken housing market</p><p>British bungalows have a beige reputation. These single-storey dwellings are often thought of as sturdy and sensible, and are rarely considered to be glamorous or lovely. In 2007, the then Prince Charles <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-473917/Laurence-Llewelyn-Bowen-Prince-Charles-mock-bungalows-I-love-them.html">called bungalows “homogenised boxes”</a> and accused them of ruining the natural beauty of the Highlands landscape. Yet according to recent reports, the once humble bungalow <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-the-humble-bungalow-is-now-cool-and-desirable-mhlxzg3ff">is now “seriously cool”</a> and in high demand – the average price of a bungalow rose by 17% in the year to May 2023, compared with 13% for houses and 5% for flats. Are people finally starting to fall for their homogenised boxy charms?</p><p>I can be rude about bungalows because I live in one, having bought my first house, a bungalow in Warwickshire, two years ago, at the age of 39. I am as surprised as anyone to hear that they’re “seriously cool”, though I have long harboured suspicions that they are far better than their reputation would suggest. Noted enthusiasts before me include Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who in 1882 was encouraged to move to <a href="http://www.birchingtonheritage.org.uk/articles/rossetti.htm">one of the first bungalows</a> built in Britain, in the hope that the Kent air might improve his ailing health. He died there. Changing Rooms legend Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has also gone on record as a fan and previous bungalow owner, writing in the Mail that his was “gloriously pungent with rose-scented associations of suburban bliss”.</p><p>Rebecca Nicholson is a columnist for the Observer and the Guardian</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/06/bungalows-cool-homes-britain-housing-market">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: Labour leader says he wants pupils to have debating lessons as he lays out party’s plans to ‘break down barriers to opportunity’</p><p>Good morning. <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has been giving speeches fleshing out the details of the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/23/five-national-missions-to-form-core-of-labour-manifesto-keir-starmer"> five missions for Labour</a> he announced in February, and today he is talking about the fifth and final one – “to break down the barriers to opportunity at every stage, for every child”. As he explains in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22942673/working-people-rigged-against-them-ill-change-it/">an article in the Sun</a>, he wants to break down the “class ceiling” which he says holds back people who were not born privileged. He says:</p><p>This is personal to me.</p><p>There was nothing about my working-class upbringing that suggested I would end up as the country’s most senior prosecutor or the leader of the Labour Party.</p><p>Talk is the currency of politics. It is our way of negotiating, deliberating, persuading and coming to decisions. Talk is also the currency of learning – how we develop and shape our ideas, deepen our thinking, explore subject matter and share our thoughts and feelings.</p><p>That’s why I want speaking skills, sometimes called “oracy”, to play an important part in Labour’s plans for a reformed school curriculum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/06/keir-starmer-class-ceiling-labour-debating-conservatives-chris-pincher-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>McLaren driver was in awe of Hamilton and Alonso as a young child and now youngsters look up to the 23-year-old</p><p>There is an air of cautious optimism at McLaren going into the British Grand Prix this weekend. Certainly for the team’s home-grown driver Lando Norris the event is special and one he admits has always meant the most to him ever since he was a child haunting the gates in the hope of glimpsing a driver. That he himself is now the inspiration for another generation is something the 23-year-old still finds somewhat hard to really take on board.</p><p>“When I was a kid I dreamed of winning my home race,” he says. “Even now when you see Lewis [Hamilton] win there it looks like the coolest thing on Earth.

## Art Monsters by Lauren Elkin review – daring to be different

<p>In a blend of criticism and memoir, the author examines the life and work of trailblazing female artists from Vanessa Bell to Carolee Schneemann</p><p>Who gets to be a monster? Is the term reserved for enemies or can it be applied to heroes too? Lauren Elkin’s work of radical feminist criticism asks us to meet her art monsters, who are all women, and to see their monstrosity as central to their being and their art.</p><p>She defines an art monster as someone “reaching after the truth of her own body”, someone who “takes for granted that the experiences of female embodiment are relevant to all humankind”, someone who “alerts us to what is outside of language”. Her book is written in a series of short and long snippets, separated by slashes. Some of them are critical engagements with works of art, others are fragments of memoir about existing in a female body or the process of writing the book itself; still others are more general art historical criticism or reflection. The immediacy of it all carries the reader along with Elkin as she thinks through her questions and disrupts traditional expectations of how “serious” theory should be written.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/06/art-monsters-by-lauren-elkin-review-daring-to-be-different">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Laughs, high energy levels and some outrageous set pieces make this examination of the complex relationship with distant family a fun journey of self-discovery</p><p>Writer-producer Adele Lim, who worked on the script for Crazy Rich Asians, now makes her feature directing debut with this likable and brash Asian-American comedy about four women leaving the US for a trip to the Chinese homeland; they come to terms with their roots in various ways, expressing sexualities queer and straight and of course celebrating friendship.</p><p>It all barrels along, with a journey-of-discovery narrative template not entirely dissimilar to the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/08/book-club-the-next-chapter-review-diane-keaton-jane-fonda-smirking-sequel">Book Club sequel</a>; the energy levels are high and there are some outrageous gags, between which the mandatory sentimentality is reasonably managed although occasionally the sex-positivity theme is rather earnestly signalled. And given how contemporary and hip the script is striving to be, and the fact that it’s specifically about four American nationals flying to China, the lack of any mention of the recent Covid lockdown and diplomatic froideur between China and the US is a bit weird. This project could, of course, have originated before the pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/06/joy-ride-review-slickly-likable-asian-american-comedy-dwells-on-family-and-identity">Continue reading...</a>

## Moms for Liberty is part of a long history of rightwing mothers’ activism in the US | Michael Feola

<p>While mothers’ movements are often associated with projects of social welfare, a counter-tradition has pursued staunchly conservative aims</p><p>The activist group Moms for Liberty has become the new face of the culture wars around education. The group was founded in 2021, during the Covid pandemic, and rose to prominence through outspoken opposition to school mask mandates. The group has now spread across the United States, its membership fueled by the Republican-led moral panic over a “woke ideology” that is supposedly sweeping public schools and “indoctrinating” children. At present, the group counts 285 chapters in 45 states.</p><p>As the group has grown, so too have its<strong> </strong>political ambitions. Moms for Liberty places particular emphasis on <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/08/the-most-powerful-moms-in-america-are-the-new-face-of-the-republican-party/">capturing local school boards</a> in order to secure greater control over school policy. More broadly, the group endorses legislation that would limit the topics that can be discussed in the classroom (for instance, Florida’s so-called “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/the-right-wing-mothers-fuelling-the-school-board-wars">Don’t Say Gay</a>” legislation), and they promote policies that allow parents to target <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/06/moms-for-liberty-john-birch-society-far-right-book-bans">books for removal</a> from school <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/books/book-bans-libraries.html">libraries and classrooms</a>.</p><p>Michael Feola is a professor of government at Lafayette College, a contributor to publications including Slate and The Washington Post, and the author of a forthcoming book on the far right, Rage of Replacement</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/06/moms-for-liberty-long-history-rightwing-activism">Continue reading...</a>

It’s on to the next. I recently watched the Arnold Schwarzenegger documentary [Arnold], and he was like, ‘I reached the top, and now I’m bored.
