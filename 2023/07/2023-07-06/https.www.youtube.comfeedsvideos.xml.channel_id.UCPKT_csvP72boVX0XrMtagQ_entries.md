☞ About the location

Hafursey is an exceptional palagonite mountain located on the north side of Mýrdalssandur and near the Katla volcano in Iceland. Hafursey was used by the farmers for sheep grazing all year around during summers until 1854. The Sel (a natural cave used for shelter) inside is one of the best-preserved remnants in the history of Iceland. In 1755, when Katla erupted, six men took shelter in the cave during the glacier burst. Their signatures, plus the date and year of their stay there, are written on the wall and are clearly visible as you enter the cave. 

Yet what makes Hafursey such a unique location is also the sublime diversity of wild, extraterrestrial landscapes that compose the area. The lonely Inselberg is surrounded by vast valleys of volcanic sand, sanders, glaciers, and waterfalls that render one of the most special, almost lunar sceneries in the world.

☞ About Hafursey (Yfir)

« Yfir » ("Above") is a musical journey through Iceland's various moods and seasons. At times, the music swells with a powerful surge, mirroring the crashing waves against rocky cliffs or the thunderous roar of a distant volcano. Other moments evoke a sense of stillness and serenity, echoing the peacefulness found in secluded valleys and hidden fjords near the inselberg of Hafursey.

The song is the continuation of another track written by Ólafur, Undir: “We’ve been playing Undir for 5 years, and rearranged it every time for each set, changing every element one by one. Last year, we realized the latest version of Undir was not the same track that the one we originally composed!  On  the  occasion  of  our  Show  with  Cercle,  I  decided  to  take  the  track  back  to  the  studio, rearranging it especially for the Show to meet Cercle’s energy”.
