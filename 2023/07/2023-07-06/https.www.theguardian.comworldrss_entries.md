<p>Long-awaited verdict on $1.8bn welfare scandal to come this morning while states and territories may decide to change ‘natural’ gas to ‘fossil’ gas</p><ul><li><strong>Get our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3">free app</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl">daily news podcast</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Education ministers agree in principle to reform teacher training</strong></p><p>Education ministers have agreed in principle to major reforms to how teachers are trained, following the release of the report of the teacher education expert panel.</p><p>Too many beginning teachers have reported that they felt they needed to be better equipped for the challenges they faced in the classroom on starting their teaching careers. Sadly, too many fail to complete their studies or stay in the profession long enough to flourish. Nearly four in 10 [initial teacher education] students leave their course within six years of commencing their degree and around one in five beginning teachers leaves within the first three years of entering the teaching profession.</p><p>Develop national practical teaching guidelines, and amend accreditation standards and procedures by the end of 2023.</p><p>Ensure core content is embedded in all programs before the end of 2025.</p><p>Drawing a stronger link between performance and funding of initial teacher education, including establishing an ITE quality assurance board to monitor the quality and consistency of ITE programs and their outcomes.</p><p>Enhancing postgraduate teacher education for mid-career entrants, including developing and scaling high-quality mid-career programs, such as paid, employment-based pathways</p><p>A lot of teachers tell me they did not feel like they were prepared for the classroom when they finished university. That their university course didn’t prepare them well enough to teach things like literacy and numeracy and manage classroom behaviour, and that prac wasn’t up to scratch. This report is about fixing that.”</p><p>Teachers have the biggest impact on student learning in the classroom. We want to make sure that all beginning teachers learn and can apply the teaching practices which work best.</p><p>The panel’s recommendations will support beginning teachers to successfully transition into the profession and will make them more likely to stay in teaching. The recommendations will make a crucial contribution to addressing workforce shortages.</p><p>Australia, on the other hand, lacks mammals typical of Asia, such as bears, tigers or rhinos.</p><p>At some point in earth’s timeline, Australia broke away from Antarctica and over millions of years drifted north, causing it to crash into Asia.</p><p>That collision gave birth to the volcanic islands that we now know as Indonesia.</p><p>They had evolved in a cooler and increasingly drier climate over time and were therefore less successful in gaining a foothold on the tropical islands compared to the creatures migrating from Asia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jul/07/australia-news-live-politics-robodebt-report-royal-commission-scott-morrison-stuart-robert-energy-gas">Continue reading...</a>

He leaves on Sunday for a one-day trip to Britain, then will attend the Nato summit in Vilnius and finish up with a stop in the alliance’s newest member, Finland.</p><p><strong>Will Biden reach out directly to his counterparts in Turkey and Hungary before the summit?</strong> “He’s been pretty, pretty steadfast” on the need to approve the application, said the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. “Sweden is a strong, capable defense partner that shares Nato’s values.”</p><p><strong>What is Threads like?</strong> The app closely resembles Twitter visually, although some of the wording has been changed, with retweets called “reposts” and tweets called “threads”. Meta has not been averse to copying rival products in the past, including the 2020 launch of Instagram’s Reels feature, noted for its similarity to TikTok’s short-form videos.</p><p><strong>What has been the reaction to it?</strong> Reaction to the debut on Wednesday ranged from caution to enthusiasm, many praising its ease of use and some saying that Elon Musk should be worried. Others pointed out that the app’s speedy integration with Instagram showed just how powerful Meta had become. Much of the conversation, ironically, took place on Twitter, where the hashtag “Threads” was trending on Wednesday evening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/06/first-thing-biden-ratchets-up-efforts-to-secure-swedens-nato-membership">Continue reading...</a>
