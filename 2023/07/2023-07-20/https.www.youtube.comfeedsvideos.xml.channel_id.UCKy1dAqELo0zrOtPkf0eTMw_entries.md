Exoprimal's unique take on the hero shooter genre is a bold one – with its best modes and surprises hidden deep within its goofy sci-fi story – but a variety of fun exosuits, the simple appeal of tearing through thousands of dinos, and great multiplayer design make that grind an easy one to recommend sticking with.

FPS: First Person Shooter review by Ryan McCaffrey. On sale through August 1.

It's fun to revisit forgotten first-person shooter favorites like Starsiege: Tribes and Dark Forces, and the filmmakers did an awesome job of getting clean gameplay footage from everything featured, but nevertheless FPS: First-Person Shooter plays more like a Wikipedia page turned into a four-and-a-half-hour movie than a true dissection and celebration of this highly influential genre and why it’s continually mattered over the past 30-plus years. You’ll no doubt learn something interesting that you didn’t know before about first-person shooters – particularly if you’re under 40 – but treat it like a limited-run series that you consume in several sittings rather than as a single 270-minute movie and you’ll get the most out of what FPS: First-Person Shooter has to offer.

Remnant 2 reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. 
It’s astounding to think that if I were to create a list of my favorite soulslikes, my favorite looter shooters, and my favorite procedurally generated games, Remnant 2 would appear on all of those lists. This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year. No matter which part of the multiverse you find yourself in, you should do yourself a favor and play this gem.

Unholy reviewed on PC by Tristan Ogilvie.

"With the exception of the rich environmental detail to be found in its sinister underworld setting, Unholy otherwise offers precious little to praise. It’s not scary enough to succeed as a horror story, its controls are too clumsy to provide a satisfying stealth experience, and its enemy and puzzle variety are too limited to make any part of the journey feel truly distinct. What begins as an intriguing incursion into a cult-ruled realm soon unravels into a repetitive slog stuck in the shoes of an unlikeable lead character. Unholy is never quite unplayable, but it’s certainly uninspired, unwieldy, and unlikely to hold your interest all the way to its completion."

Oppenheimer reviewed by Siddhant Adlakha. In theaters July 21, 2023.
A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.
