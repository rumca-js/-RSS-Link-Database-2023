Christopher Nolan has made a name for himself making intellectual mind-bendy movies with films like Memento, Inception and Tenet. Let’s just say it, the dude is a little obsessed with time. He’s one of the few filmmakers making truly “epic” movies, and it’s really cool when you can understand them.

Interstellar definitely raises some questions though. Like why doesn’t anyone seem to care about Tom? Why did they decide to go down to that time dilation planet first? Why did they try to collect that worthless data? Why was there a Matt Damon jumpscare on the second planet? Why did Tom name his kid Coop Cooper? Why did Cooper send the same “stay” message that he knew did not get him to stay?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Interstellar!
