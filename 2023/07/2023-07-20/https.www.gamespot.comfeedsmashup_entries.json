[{"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Snag A Wireless Switch Controller For Only $34", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Nexigo's wireless <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ79HXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Nintendo Switch controller is on sale at Amazon for just $34</a> (normally $50). The deal only applies to the Cosmic Nebula model, which features a purple, outer space-inspired skin, but this is an excellent deal on the third-party gamepad with plenty of cool features. Though this controller isn't as nice as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">official Switch Pro Controller</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Switch-Nintendo/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">8BitDo Ultimate</a>, it is pretty solid, especially at this price.</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"6516166 - nexigo switch controller\">  <div class=\"buylink-container\">                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ79HXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Nexigo wireless Nintendo Switch controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ79HXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">$34 (was $50)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1701/17013431/4168364-nexigowirelesshero.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ79HXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p>Nexigo's wireless controller features the same button layout as Nintendo's official Switch Pro controller, plus a turbo button with adjustable turbo speed.

It's compatible with both the standard Switch, Switch Lite, and Switch OLED models and connects via Bluetooth. The battery life lasts around 10 hours and supports fast-charging via USB-C.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ79HXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p dir=\"ltr\">We're not sure how long Nexigo's wireless Switch controller will be on sale at Amazon, so be sure to grab one while the deal is still available.</p><p>If you're looking for more Nintendo Switch controller deals, the excellent <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-one-of-the-best-switch-controllers-for-22/1100-6516132/\">8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch</a> is on sale for just $22.30 (normally $35) and the aforementioned wireless <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Switch-Nintendo/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">8BitDo Ultimate with charging dock</a> is 10% off.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snag-a-wireless-switch-controller-for-only-34/1100-6516166/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snag-a-wireless-switch-controller-for-only-34/1100-6516166/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-20T20:50:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Diablo 4 Season 1 Battle Pass: Every Cosmetic, Title, And Emote", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4168256-d4s1thumb.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/\">Diablo 4</a> Season 1 has arrived, bringing new content, like quests and items, to the action-RPG. To access the majority of the new content and the battle pass, players will need to roll a new character for the first season. One of the main new items in Season 1 are <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-get-all-malignant-hearts-season-1/1100-6516115/\">Malignant Hearts</a>, which can be socketed like gems but offer a larger variety of bonuses. There is also the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-all-seasonal-journey-rewards-and-objectives/1100-6516156/\">Season Journey</a>, which offers a series of objectives to complete in exchange for rewards, including battle pass progression.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 1 also marks the first battle pass offering for Diablo 4, which features a smattering of different items. There are both free rewards and premium rewards, with the premium options all being cosmetic only. This includes titles, horse cosmetics, and a large amount of new transmog options to make your characters look their best, no matter what gear you currently have. The paid version--which costs 1,000 Platinum, roughly $10 USD--also includes 666 Platinum, the paid shop currency.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As for the free tier, it includes some cosmetics and the important Smoldering Ashes, which can be applied to different passive stat bonuses of your seasonal characters. <strong>All of the Smoldering Ashes in the battle pass are included in the free tier</strong>. These also require you to be at a certain character level to collect and use, with the first one available at level 40.</p><p>It's important to note that <strong>the battle pass can only be progressed by playing Diablo 4 with a seasonal character.</strong> It does not progress when you play on the Eternal Realm, so make sure you want to roll a seasonal character before picking it up. Below you can see every item rewarded in Diablo 4 Season 1's 90 tier battle pass.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.

Each weapon upgrade will cost a certain amount of Scrap, as well as a certain amount of an Iron type. To max out the weapon at +20, you'll need to use a Simulacrum--a rare item that can only be found once per biome and is also used for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-relic-upgrades-simulacrum-guide/1100-6516080/\">upgrading your Relics</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Iron</strong> - Improves up to +5</li><li><strong>Forged Iron</strong> - Improves up to +10</li><li><strong>Galvanized Iron</strong> - Improves up to +15</li><li><strong>Hardened Iron</strong> - Improves up to +19</li><li><strong>Simulacrum</strong> - Improves up to +20</li></ul><p>If it all sounds pretty straightforward, be aware that there's actually a bit more to this process than meets the eye. In the early stages of the game, you'll just be finding lots of standard Iron because none of your weapons have been upgraded much.

The third-person gunplay has been tightened up and refined, there's more color and variety to its diverse locales, and the various RPG elements and character progression have been greatly expanded upon, giving you more options to construct a unique build along with the incentive to delve into the game's near-limitless replayability. \"Dark Souls with guns\" was used as shorthand to describe Remnant: From the Ashes, and although that label wasn't wrong, it also wasn't representative of the full picture. The first game stood out amongst a bevy of other Souls-likes because of the ways it deviated from the formula, and Remnant 2 continues to build on those foundations with a more dynamic and robust action-adventure that only falters in a couple of areas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The first game wasn't without its flaws, either, an underbaked story chief among them. Unfortunately, Remnant 2 doesn't fare much better in this regard, offering another forgettable tale that lacks personality and engaging stakes, almost to the point where it feels like a copy and paste of the original game. Even the setup is essentially the same, beginning on the dilapidated streets of a post-apocalyptic Earth that's been ravaged by an interdimensional being known as The Root. You eventually arrive at a small settlement called Ward 13--the same hub area as the first game, albeit in a slightly different spot--and despite being an injured newcomer, your custom character is immediately entrusted with a crucial task that quickly leads to a mission that decides the fate of all realms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Contrivances aside, it's difficult to care about the overarching story when the world as you know it consists of roughly a dozen people who might as well be cardboard cutouts. Characters such as McCabe and Rigs return, but they're one-note vendors like before, while the friend you arrived with and risked your life to save performs the same static role. There are more interesting characters found in the various realms you'll visit throughout the game; however, the game's procedurally generated structure ensures that it takes a few playthroughs to form a clear picture of the lore and composition of each world, and by that point you'll have probably forgotten everything you learned previously, such as the abundance of abstract concepts verbally thrown your way. The ending's emotional payoff lands flat as a result.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/remnant-2-review-what-the-dog-doing/1900-6418092/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/remnant-2-review-what-the-dog-doing/1900-6418092/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-20T14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Remnant 2: Best Class For Solo Players", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/remnant-ii/\">Remnant II</a> is a game that is designed from the ground up as a multiplayer experience.

At the moment, if you connect the new Pokemon Go Plus+ accessory to the game, you can unlock a unique quest in Pokemon Sleep that will net you a Snorlax wearing a nightcap. To get it, you need to track sleep using your Pokemon Go Plus+ for seven days--unsurprisingly, a lot of players don't want to do this, so they're skipping sleeping altogether.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As explained by players on the unofficial Pokemon subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1518v6d/exclusive_special_research_for_pok%C3%A9mon_go_plus/\">TheSilphRoad</a> (thanks, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sleep-exploit-sees-players-pretend-to-rack-up-weeks-of-sleep-for-pokemon-go-rewards\">Eurogamer</a>), Pokemon Sleep needs you to record at least 90 minutes of sleep a day, so to side-step this players are simply manually changing the dates on their phone to trick the app into thinking it's a new day. All you need to do outside of that is leave your Pokemon Go Plus+ somewhere with the sleep mode on for the required 90 minutes, then once it's done, turn it off and on again, and change the date on your phone. Easy peasy, though the point is obviously to encourage you to sleep.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sleep-players-are-cheating-by-not-sleeping/1100-6516122/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sleep-players-are-cheating-by-not-sleeping/1100-6516122/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-20T13:06:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "For Sea Of Thieves' Monkey Island Crossover, Rare Clearly Understood The Assignment", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike many <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/\">Sea of Thieves</a> fans, I didn't actually bring much affection for the pirate genre into my first experiences with Rare's huge sandbox. The game seems to have been a long-held dream come true for many would-be swashbucklers born in the wrong century, but even to this day, I don't have much experience with pirate media before or since playing Sea of Thieves.

Therefore, I came into Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island with a different view of things than other, more nostalgic players will, but I still left it enamored as ever with Rare's latest showcase.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Legend of Monkey Island is the collective name given to a trio of story missions to be released over time as free updates in Sea of Thieves. The first of those three, The Journey to Melee Island, is out today, and is what I was able to play last week ahead of its official launch.

She won't be far from where you'd start the Disney Pirates missions, and if you prefer, you can enter the game so that you spawn directly in front of her (rather than in the nearby tavern) by choosing the Monkey Island option from the main menu. Look beside her for a book that allows you to vote on the voyage like any other Tall Tale and a cinematic will begin in which she and the Pirate Lord tell you to find Guybrush Threepwood. A green portal will then open nearby at sea, so raise anchor and set sail to pass through it.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-the-journey-to-melee-island-guide-all-commendations-and-memoir-spots/1100-6516005/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-the-journey-to-melee-island-guide-all-commendations-and-memoir-spots/1100-6516005/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-07-20T13:04:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Watching YouTube Without Ads Will Now Cost More", "description": "<p>If you use the internet, you probably use YouTube.
