  <p id="VY1R3R">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter">suspending</a> its <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d09412_commission_order_withdrawing_from_adjudication_unsigned.pdf%5D">administrative challenge</a> (PDF) seeking to block Microsoft from buying Activision Blizzard. The FTC had taken a two-pronged approach against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23797238/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-agreement-extension">the $68.7 billion deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23498224/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-legal-challenge-sues-block">filing this case last December</a> that was scheduled to go before its own administrative judge on August 2nd. </p>
<p id="zZ6KTB">The other part was its pursuit of a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that would have stopped Microsoft closing its deal while the FTC’s administrative process continued. A US federal judge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23779039/microsoft-activision-blizzard-ftc-trial-win">denied the injunction request</a> earlier this month, and an appeals court also turned down its request to put an emergency hold on the deal. The FTC is still appealing the preliminary injunction denial, though.</p>

## AMC scraps plan to make the best movie theater seats more expensive

<p id="nE7RI3">The now-canceled Sightline plan was being tested in three US markets, and AMC notes customer response “clarified” things enough to end the pilot. The company stated that it “saw little or no incremental lift in front-row attendance, even with a price reduction applied to those seats” in the testing markets. </p>
<p id="B7TrJF">AMC notes, probably most importantly, that its competitors didn’t try to match the scheme, and so it will go in...</p>

<p id="wyqlng"><em>Neopets</em>, a virtual pet website that first launched in 1999, certainly isn’t the phenomenon that it was in the early days of the internet. I have fond memories of the site — as a kid, I remember spending hours taking care of my dog-like Lupe character — but I haven’t paid any serious attention to <em>Neopets</em> for two decades because a lot of the site felt stuck in the past. Much of <em>Neopets</em>’ design is straight 2005, a lot of the old games built on Adobe Flash don’t work anymore, and some of the more recent attempts to revive interest, including an NFT project, feel out of touch in their own ways.</p>

  <p id="f1S9v5">GitHub has announced that its new Copilot Chat feature — a ChatGPT-like experience designed to help developers with coding — is now available as a limited public beta for enterprise companies and organizations. GitHub says the Copilot Chat beta will be available to “all business users” via Microsoft’s Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code apps.</p>
<p id="AuZt6u">The chatbot was announced back in March as the cornerstone of GitHub’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23651456/github-copilot-x-gpt-4-code-chat-voice-support">Copilot X</a> initiative, an expansion of its original Copilot code completion tool that integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. The tool’s goal is to save developers time by enabling them to “execute some of the most complex tasks with simple prompts.”</p>

  <p id="g97o0L">A few months back, everyone wondered who would win the AI arms race. Microsoft aligned itself with OpenAI. Google launched Bard. Meta began working on its own large language model, LLaMA. Other companies began thinking of launching AI platforms, and curious users pitted the models against each other. </p>
<p id="mjMCw3">But a recent deal suggests we may also see a growing number of partnerships, not just head-to-head competition. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799025/meta-ai-llama-2-open-source-microsoft">Meta offered its LLaMA large language model</a> for free under an open license and brought it to Microsoft’s Azure platform.

  <p id="Dr0n1v">Elon Musk biographer Walter Isaacson has <a href="https://twitter.com/WalterIsaacson/status/1681304525767086085">shared a photograph</a> of the Tesla CEO during an early meeting about the Cybertruck that sheds interesting light on the alternative designs considered, as well as the pop culture that ultimately inspired it. On the left of the image we can see several concept images of Tesla’s electric pickup truck, while on the right is a mood board showing images from various movies and video games, including many sci-fi and cyberpunk titles. In the foreground Musk can be seen in conversation with Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen.</p>
