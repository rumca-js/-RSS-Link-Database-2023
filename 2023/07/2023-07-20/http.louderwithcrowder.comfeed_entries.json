Plus the reality is nothing will happen until conservatives take back the White House (and also nominate someone who can win a general election). We know the Bidens are scumbags. You know the Bidens are scumbags. The Left and the media know as well, hence they're twisting themselves into pretzels trying to avoid acknowledging \"Geez, this stuff looks bad.\"</p><p>Here are a few tweets from yesterday to store away for future reference. But first, who is \"Whistleblower X\" other than <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/irs-whistleblower-x-reveals-identity-tells-congress-he-was-blocked-from-investigating-hunter-biden/\" target=\"_blank\">someone who worked on the Hunter Biden criminal tax investigation</a>?</p><blockquote>Joe Ziegler, a special agent with the tax agency for 13 years, described himself as a \"gay Democrat married to a man\" and said he decided to come forward despite his personal politics because he believes \"no one should be above the law regardless of your political affiliation.\" It was the first public appearance by Ziegler, who had previously given closed-door testimony to Congress under the alias \"Whistleblower X.\"</blockquote><p>Ziegler revealed a LOT of money from Hunter's foreign business dealings. Remember, Hunter's dad is the former president of the United States and Hunter <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-whatsapp\" target=\"_blank\">NEVER discussed business matters with him</a>. Hashtag foreshadowing.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mirandadevine/status/1681727923982614530\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an interview with CBS News, Zeigler was uncomfortable answering a question about <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/irs-whistleblower-gives-jaw-dropping-answer-on-if-joe-biden-benefitted-from-sons-business-deals\" target=\"_blank\">if he saw any evidence Joe Biden financially benefited</a> from his son\u2019s deals.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1681718717489528839\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There can't be a discussion about Hunter Biden without mention of his fondness for prostitutes. Because you <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/irs-whistleblower-gives-jaw-dropping-answer-on-if-joe-biden-benefitted-from-sons-business-deals\" target=\"_blank\">got to give the people what they want</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1681771687212363776\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Democrats know the all-day testimony was bad for them because they spent most of it bringing up their favorite distraction when things are going bad for them.

Exhibit Q is Hunter Biden getting the same deal every other spoiled rich kid gets if their dad is powerful enough. The fact that Hunter's dad is the President of the United States makes it a bigger slap in the face. </p><p>These hearings won't lead to any direct action. A year and a half of reminding the American people about the detail is a different story.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
