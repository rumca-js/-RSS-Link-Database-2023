<p>Most people know the feeling of having an off-morning&mdash;e.g., sleeping past your alarm or the coffee just not kicking in. Putting on a full face of makeup is one way to shake yourself out of the doldrums before your video meetings, but it takes time. Or at least, it did before Microsoft&rsquo;s newest video filter for Teams, which lets you skip the real-world primping.</p>



<p>Called the Maybelline Beauty app, this set of effects lets users apply digital makeup colors and skin blurring to their faces&mdash;an amped up version of Zoom&rsquo;s long-available &ldquo;Touch up my appearance&rdquo; video setting, which smooths out skin imperfections. Microsoft&rsquo;s filters rely on AI-powered tech called Modiface (owned by Maybelline&rsquo;s parent company L&rsquo;Oreal), which creates a virtual map of faces to apply the digital makeup. At launch, Teams users will get <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/announcing-the-new-maybelline-beauty-app-in-microsoft-teams/ba-p/3877999?lightbox-message-images-3877999=490411i7FE50EE9F9E7F5F9&amp;xcust=2-3-2002560-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">what the company calls</a> &ldquo;12 unique looks&rdquo; to choose from.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2002562" height="242" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2.png" width="761" /></figure></div>



<p>While the filter should have its fans, initial response to the company&rsquo;s announcement is not universally positive. In possibly a shocker to no one, Teams still has feature deficiencies that, if addressed, could save people both time <em>and</em> sanity. Wrestling daily with recalcitrant settings in an app is generally unpleasant. Applying make-up can feel like self-care, at least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking forward to skipping makeup application and removal, you&rsquo;ll want to load up the public preview version of Teams&mdash;the filter&rsquo;s not yet available for general use yet. It also only began rolling out to Teams enterprise users today. You&rsquo;ll know if you have access to it if you see it your Video Effects settings under <em>Filters</em>.</p>

## Intel halts ‘Project Endgame’ cloud graphics project

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Intel has confirmed that it has halted plans for a unified gaming services layer, known as Project Endgame, possibly putting its cloud ambitions on hold while it prioritizes Arc GPU driver development.</p>



<p>Project Endgame is one of those behind-the-scenes projects that Intel never really announced, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623766/intel-wants-in-on-cloud-gaming-with-project-endgame.html">hinted at last year</a>. &ldquo;Project Endgame is a unified services layer that harnesses computing resources everywhere &ndash; cloud, edge, and your home, to improve your gaming, and non-gaming, PC experiences,&rdquo; the company said. &ldquo;With Project Endgame, we can untether our users from their local hardware specs.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Intel never clarified what it meant by that statement, though we can make some guesses: cloud gaming simply puts an GPU or a PC on a remote server. Users interact with it remotely, so that any mouse or keyboard inputs have to travel over the Internet, back and forth. What Intel seemed to imply with Endgame was a twist: use a local PC, a remote server, or even possibly a second PC as available hardware resources to power games.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s possible that that was the original plan. But Intel&rsquo;s Arc GPUs had a somewhat rocky launch, as shortly after Intel published its Endgame plans the company had to deal with an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/694578/intel-is-botching-the-launch-of-its-discrete-gpus.html">Arc notebook launch</a> plagued by high prices and low performance. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/698534/tested-intels-arc-a370m-laptops-already-compete-with-nvidia-and-amd.html">our tests were a little better</a>, though the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/810332/intels-first-arc-desktop-gpu-tested.html">first tests of the desktop A380 started off weird</a> until Intel began ramping up its driver development. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799919/intel-arc-gpus-how-much-improvement-has-intel-made-in-6-months.html">Intel&rsquo;s Arc drivers are in a much better place now</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our Project Endgame efforts are on hold. We don't have any updates to share at this time.</p>&mdash; Intel Graphics (@IntelGraphics) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/IntelGraphics/status/1681710493805707294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-3-2002388-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>All that may have soured Intel&rsquo;s management on Project Endgame. After all, developing a unified gaming services layer and improving Arc&rsquo;s drivers probably fell to the same team within Intel. Prioritizing one probably meant de-prioritizing the other.</p>



<p>So it&rsquo;s really no surprise that the Intel Graphics team casually disclosed <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/IntelGraphics/status/1681710493805707294&amp;xcust=2-3-2002388-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on Twitter</a> that yes, you won&rsquo;t be seeing any Project Endgame development anytime soon. &ldquo;Our Project Endgame efforts are on hold,&rdquo; Intel said.  We don&rsquo;t have any updates to share at this time.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Oh well.</p>

<p>In recent years, recorded audio has undergone a renaissance thanks to the breakthrough of podcasts. It&rsquo;s now easy to record audio and share it online, and things that used to require access to a high-end recording studio can now be done by anyone from home.</p>



<p>Our phones, computers, and tablets have built-in microphones that provide surprisingly good sound quality, and people who need even better sound can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394432/best-usb-microphones-for-streaming.html">buy a microphone for a surprisingly affordable prices</a>. Since many of those microphones have a built-in sound card, they can be connected directly to your computer&rsquo;s USB input.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="free-is-best">Free is best</h2>



<p>In most cases, the recordings we make won&rsquo;t be perfect from the start, so you&rsquo;ll also need audio editing software. One of the best is actually completely free. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.audacityteam.org/&amp;xcust=2-3-2002140-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Audacity</a>, and the software is so good, it&rsquo;s used by many audio professionals. It has all the features you need and is easy to use.</p>

<p>Editing audio is similar to word processing. You see the recorded sound as a wave pattern, and you can cut, paste and delete &mdash; just like editing text. So you can easily take a piece of audio from the beginning of the recording and move it to the end, or anywhere else.</p>



<p>You can also work with multiple audio tracks at the same time. The point is to make the sound mixes look better and to add background music and sound effects. You can also fade in and out the sound, change the speed, or apply different filters.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the latest version is easier to use and install. Be aware that it takes a long time to master all the features, however. If you run into problems, there&rsquo;s a good English-language manual at <strong><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://manual.audacityteam.org&amp;xcust=2-3-2002140-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">manual.audacityteam.org</a></em></strong>. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the basics of how Audacity works:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-how-do-i-update-audacity">2. How do I update Audacity?</h2>



<p>Do you have an older version of Audacity? It&rsquo;s easy to update to the latest version. Click on <strong><em>Help</em></strong> &gt; <strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>. If there are available updates, you can select <strong><em>Install update</em></strong>. Accept any warnings and press <strong><em>OK </em></strong>to start the update wizard. Please note that it&rsquo;s important to install the latest version of Audacity if you want to take advantage of all the features.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Audacity" class="wp-image-1984925" height="636" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-how-do-i-record">3. How do I record&hellip;</h2>



<p>To get sound into Audacity, you can use your computer&rsquo;s microphone and press the red record button. This makes the program work like an old-fashioned tape recorder. You can also choose <strong><em>File</em></strong> &gt; <em style="font-weight: bold;">Import</em> &gt; <strong><em>Audio </em></strong>to add an audio file located on your hard drive. You can  drag in an audio file from the Windows File Explorer as well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-and-how-do-i-edit">4. &hellip; and how do I edit?</h2>



<p>Audio in Audacity is displayed as a wave pattern on a timeline. By selecting a part with your mouse, you can cut, copy, paste, and delete. For example, you can take a piece from the beginning of the recording and move it to the end &mdash; or delete it completely.</p>



<p>You can also work with multiple tracks at the same time, so you can add background music and sound effects or create professional sound mixes. All audio tracks play at the same time, and you can see this in the timeline. To move an audio track sideways, just tap the bar at the top and move it to the right or left.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-how-do-i-save">5. How do I save?</h2>



<p>When you work with audio in Audacity, you save it in the program&rsquo;s own format. You can only open this in Audacity.</p>



<p>Therefore, when you finish editing your audio, you need to export it to a format that can be opened by other programs, such as mp3 or wav. You can do this by clicking on <strong><em>File</em></strong> &gt; <strong><em>Export</em></strong>. Depending on the format you are using, you can now adjust the sound quality and make other technical settings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-what-is-audio-com">6. What is Audio.com?</h2>



<p>The newest version Audacity has a direct link that allows you to save your audio files on Audio.com.

## Blizzard games head for Steam, starting with Overwatch 2

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>For years, if you wanted to play a Blizzard game on the PC, you had no choice but to load up the Battle.net installer application. Battle.net was even expanded to include some major Activision games after the companies merged &mdash; it&rsquo;s currently hosting a ton of <em>Call of Duty </em>games and <em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em>. But it looks like Blizzard&rsquo;s long aversion to other game stores and platforms is about to end. Starting in August, at least some Blizzard games will be available to download on Steam, the de facto standard for PC gaming.<em> Overwatch 2</em> will get the party started. </p>



<p>Words were long and details were scarce in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23982127/overwatch-2-coming-to-steam-on-august-10&amp;xcust=2-1-2002088-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Blizzard blog post</a> covering the news. Gamers will be able to download the free-to-play <em>Overwatch 2</em> <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357570/Overwatch_2/&amp;xcust=2-1-2002088-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam&rsquo;s system</a>, but will still need a separate Battle.net account (in addition to a Steam account, of course). This setup mirrors a lot of games from larger publishers on Steam, like Ubisoft and EA titles that require separate launchers and accounts even if you buy and download their games through the Steam interface. It isn&rsquo;t clear whether or not <em>Overwatch </em>players will need the Battle.net client installed as well, but the announcement says that Steam features like multiplayer friends lists and achievements will be integrated into the game. </p>



<p><em>Overwatch 2</em> has had a rough time lately. Initial excitement over the quasi-sequel quickly waned after its shift to a full free-to-play setup <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">left a sour taste in gamers&rsquo; mouths</a>. It didn&rsquo;t help that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1920679/overwatch-2-abandons-pve-mode-completing-the-bait-and-switch.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Activision-Blizzard axed an expanded co-op mode</a>, which was initially promoted as <em>Overwatch 2</em>&lsquo;s biggest content addition over the initial game. Recently the game&rsquo;s eSports push, the Overwatch League, has seen devastating setbacks <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23799550/activision-blizzard-esports-layoffs-overwatch-league-owl&amp;xcust=2-1-2002088-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as Blizzard laid off fifty employees</a> dedicated to its management. The company might be looking to expand the game&rsquo;s appeal by finally appearing on more accessible marketplaces. </p>



<p>More Blizzard games will be coming to Steam, though the announcement post doesn&rsquo;t say what or when. Given <em>Overwatch 2</em>&lsquo;s free-to-play setup, it seems possible that <em>World of Warcraft </em>and the card battler spinoff <em>Hearthstone </em>will make their way across at some point. Battle.net&rsquo;s stand-alone launcher isn&rsquo;t going anywhere for the time being. Activision games are already available to buy and play on Steam. </p>

</div>


<p>This Monoprice docks lands squarely in the middle of the messy reality that is USB-C hardware: numerous acronyms, ports, and features. What can this Monoprice 13-in-1 Dual-HDMI + DP MST Dock do? A decent amount, though it depends on your PC.</p>



<p>What the Monoprice 13-in-1 dock&rsquo;s documentation implies is that you&rsquo;ll be able to run a pair of 4K displays across this USB-C dock. (The &ldquo;MST&rdquo; in the product&rsquo;s name stands for &ldquo;MultiStream Transport,&rdquo; which signifies that it can power multiple displays.) At an MSRP of $54.99, this would appear to offer a pretty affordable deal in the world of USB-C hubs and docks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> This review informs PCWorld&rsquo;s roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">best USB-C hubs and docks</a><em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>What Monoprice doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that this dock&rsquo;s performance will depend on which laptop you own: The rule of thumb is the more recent, the better. A Microsoft Surface Book 2 with an 8th-gen Core chip inside didn&rsquo;t produce any output over its USB-C port; several recent Samsung and Surface laptops with 12th-gen and 13th-gen Core chips inside worked well, though. </p>



<p>So what&rsquo;s the best you can expect? Monoprice&rsquo;s in-box documentation is confusing, but the actual <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=44467&amp;AID=14099126&amp;PID=100357191&amp;ref=cj&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_term=Microsoft+Shopping+%28Bing+Rebates%2C+Coupons%2C+etc.%29-5250933&amp;utm_content=14099126&amp;cjevent=c1a75c47229711ee803201220a1cb82b&amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;xcust=2-1-1995216-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">product page</a> is somewhat clearer: If you&rsquo;d like to use a single external display, you can run it at 4K, 60Hz. (Our tests confirm this.) With two displays you can run one at 4K30, and the other at 1080p60. Three displays? All of them must be run at 1080p. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monoprice 13-in-1 Dual-HDMI + DP MST Dock" class="wp-image-1995238" height="725" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Monoprice-dock-alt-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Two HDMI ports, a USB port, and a USB-C input port for power adorn the front of this Monoprice 13-in-1 dock.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>But even on paper, it&rsquo;s muddier: One HDMI port supports 60Hz; the other, 30Hz. Which one? Pull out the documentation. And in reality, when I connected two external displays &mdash; no matter the configuration &mdash; one displayed 4K30, and the other defaulted to 1440p, at 60Hz. That&rsquo;s better than expected, but it&rsquo;s still confusing.</p>



<p>In part, that&rsquo;s because I had connected the displays, via the dock, to my PC&rsquo;s Thunderbolt port, which uses DisplayPort 1.4 as a transport protocol. If you have a PC or a laptop with DisplayPort 1.2 (and few people know if they do, offhand) expect even slower speeds. Without your laptop&rsquo;s documentation in hand, you&rsquo;re rolling the dice.</p>



<p>Get past that, though, and this Monoprice dock simplifies itself. The dock saves money by not supplying a power brick, but attaching your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C charger to the input port works fine &mdash; up to 100W of power delivery. Just realize that the dock and any bus-powered devices you have attached will eat up some of that power, too.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monoprice 13-in-1 Dual-HDMI + DP MST Dock" class="wp-image-1995236" height="859" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Monoprice-dock-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the side of the Monoprice 13-in-1 Dual-HDMI + DP MST Dock hide a DisplayPort connector and the Ethernet jack.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-ports-does-the-monoprice-13-in-1-dock-include">What ports does the Monoprice 13-in-1 dock include?</h2>



<p>Otherwise, there&rsquo;s a host of ports: five USB-A ports (three transferring data at 5Gbps, and two at legacy 480Mbps speeds), SD and microSD readers (both transferring data at a poky 104MB/s, or UHS-I speeds), an audio/mic jack, and gigabit Ethernet, plus the HDMI and DisplayPort ports.  </p>



<p>Just remember that everything is being transferred over the 10Gbps USB-C bus, so you may notice slowdowns or stuttering when downloading something over Ethernet, transferring data on a hard drive, and displaying it on multiple monitors. That&rsquo;s not the dock&rsquo;s fault.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monoprice 13-in-1 Dual-HDMI + DP MST Dock" class="wp-image-1995237" height="662" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Monorocie-dock-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the rear of the Monoprice 13-in-1 Dual-HDMI + DP MST Dock are four labeled USB ports and an SD/micro SD card slot.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Monoprice&rsquo;s dock doesn&rsquo;t suffer from any thermal issues; the plastic chassis gets warm, but barely so. It measures 5.5 x 2.2 x 0.65 inches.</p>



<p>This 13-in-1 dock is priced fairly aggressively, too. We&rsquo;re seeing 8-in-1 docks priced at about $25 to $35, depending on the configuration; the $54.99 feels appropriate. This is really more of a high-powered dongle than a true USB-C dock, anyway.</p>



<p>Monoprice&rsquo;s 13-in-1 dock is priced $5 less than Lasuney&rsquo;s offering, currently our pick for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">best full-featured USB-C hub</a>. We&rsquo;re going to hold to that pick for now, but the feature set is very comparable between the two. Make sure you compare prices on both to help you decide.</p>

## New US government guidelines fight back against tech’s mega-mergers

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, which would be the biggest such deal in the history of video games, is now all but finalized. That&rsquo;s despite the US Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430050/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-activision-gaming-deal.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">attempting to put the brakes</a> on the nearly $70 billion purchase, if not stop it entirely: The FTC&rsquo;s attempt to block the execution of the deal was denied by an appeals court last week. But regulators aren&rsquo;t taking the loss lying down. A new joint effort of the FTC and Department of Justice, the biggest hurdles for mega-mergers, is set to make them harder to accomplish. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p859910draftmergerguidelines2023.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-2001958-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a 51-page draft document (PDF link)</a>, the FTC and DOJ lay out proposed new guidelines covering the legality of mergers between mega-corps. Both agencies regulate interstate commerce in the United States and have legal authority to block company mergers and acquisitions. Reasons for doing so are varied, but the most often employed is the threat to competition &mdash; such was the case in the last major tech merger to be blocked, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/472986/atandt_t_mobile_merger_collapse_a_victory_for_consumers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AT&amp;T&rsquo;s thwarted purchase of T-Mobile in 2011</a>. But that was an outlier case; American regulators have generally been seen as friendly, even forgiving, to technology companies seeking to combine their economic powers, even when the executive branch is under nominally progressive control. </p>



<p>The new document is outlining a more strict approach to regulation for mergers. Thirteen broad guidelines cover a wide variety of situations in which the FTC and DOJ might intervene via direct regulatory action or the courts. Some cover areas the agencies have already claimed historically, like number two, &ldquo;<strong>Mergers Should Not Eliminate Substantial Competition between Firm</strong>s.&rdquo; Others apparently expand the regulators&rsquo; scope, claiming authority under the Sherman Antitrust Act and Clayton Antitrust Act of 1890 and 1914, respectively. </p>



<p>Take guideline number five, for example: &ldquo;<strong>Mergers Should Not Substantially Lessen Competition by Creating a Firm That Controls Products or Services That Its Rivals May Use to Compete</strong>.&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s nominal control of the online search and advertising markets, or Apple&rsquo;s exclusive control of apps available on the iPad and iPhone, could both fall under this provision. Number seven, &ldquo;<strong>Mergers Should Not Entrench or Extend a Dominant Position</strong>,&rdquo; could apply to both.&rdquo; Number nine, &ldquo;<strong>When a Merger is Part of a Series of Multiple Acquisitions, the Agencies May Examine the Whole Series</strong>,&rdquo; could have applied to Microsoft&rsquo;s Activision ambitions&hellip;at least if it was active a year or so ago. Microsoft has spent the better part of the last decade <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393528/microsoft-buys-bethesda-creator-of-doom-fallout-elder-scrolls-and-quake.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">acquiring developers big and small</a> to shore up its first-party publishing in an attempt to counter Sony&rsquo;s highly successful PlayStation exclusives. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-doj-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines&amp;xcust=2-1-2001958-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a statement on the updated guidelines</a>, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said, &ldquo;Unchecked consolidation&nbsp;threatens the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. These updated Merger Guidelines respond to modern market realities and will enable the Justice Department to transparently and effectively protect the American people from the damage that anticompetitive mergers cause.&rdquo; </p>



<p>The US federal government is currently under left-leaning Democratic control, with President Biden overseeing an incredibly thin majority in the Senate, while Republicans control the House of Representatives and the judiciary with a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. That makes the court system the go-to backup plan for any large tech company that wants to get even larger. That said, the courts aren&rsquo;t necessarily an instant win for corporations, even in the traditionally business-friendly United States. Fights over whether or not a particular merger violates regulatory guidelines, and whether those guidelines are actually in line with laws written by Congress over a century ago, can stretch across months and years of court cases and appeals. Larger mergers also face international hurdles, notably the European Commission, which is seen as particularly wary towards the tech industry. </p>



<p>The DOJ and FTC&rsquo;s redoubled efforts to fight consolidation in the technology market and other large sectors of the economy will undoubtedly face pushback from both corporations and the legislators that support them. How successful those efforts will be will inevitably come down to court battles and justices&rsquo; interpretation of the law. And of course, the guidelines themselves aren&rsquo;t set in stone: The current FTC has already revised guidelines put in place during the previous Trump administration. If Republicans gain control of the executive branch after the 2024 federal elections, it&rsquo;s likely that much of the new guidelines proposed today will be discarded in the same way. </p>

The price increase so far seems to apply only to the United States, where the price has been raised by two dollars to 13.99 dollars a month. We&rsquo;re also seeing that price on the YouTube Premium sign-up page. Neither YouTube, nor its parent company Google, has announced anything about the price increase.</p>



<p>A YouTube Premium subscription service lets you watch YouTube without ads, download videos to watch when you don&rsquo;t have internet access, and play videos behind a locked screen on your mobile phone. The subscription also gives you access to the music service YouTube Music Premium. Earlier this year, Google announced <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781123/youtube-is-getting-some-great-new-features-if-you-pay-up.html">a bunch of nifty new YouTube features</a> like enhanced video quality, better multi-screen support, and compatibility with Apple&rsquo;s iOS SharePlay &mdash; but only for YouTube Premium subscribers.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a high refresh rate gaming monitor, you&rsquo;re in luck. Best Buy&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-odyssey-g51c-32-led-qhd-freesync-premium-gaming-monitor-with-hdr10-black%2F6532282.p%3FskuId%3D6532282&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G51C gaming monitor for $229.99</a>, which is a savings of $170. This peripheral has a refresh rate of 165Hz and a response time of 1ms, which means you can expect buttery smooth visuals. This is important, especially when you&rsquo;re in an intense match where every second matters. </p>



<p>The 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G51C features a crisp 2560z1440 resolution, widely considered the sweet spot for modern gaming. For connectivity options, you&rsquo;re getting one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 connections. The monitor itself is tiltable and the stand can be adjusted. It also has FreeSync built-in, which is a technology that syncs your monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate with your PC&rsquo;s GPU. This helps reduce screen tearing, which can be super annoying when you&rsquo;re in the middle of a game. </p>



<p>This is a really solid deal. You better swoop in and pick it up now, though, as we don&rsquo;t expect it to last very long.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a cheap, cranky old journalist with two kids and not a whole lot of patience. Microsoft, bless them, caters to people like me via a Windows 10 and Windows 11 feature called Delivery Optimization, which <em>should</em> save me time, money, and bandwidth by using other PCs on my home network to download updates. But I haven&rsquo;t been able to get it work consistently, and boy, does that tick me off.</p>



<p>Chances are that you&rsquo;ve never heard of Delivery Optimization, which should do one thing and do it well: if you download a Windows app or an update to any PC on your network, any other PCs on your network can download it from <em>that</em> PC, bypassing the Internet. This eliminates the need to download and re-download updates again and again. And why haven&rsquo;t you heard of it? Because it stinks.</p>



<p>If you live in a rural area, the mainstream tech press doesn&rsquo;t care about your problems. If you live in California, the media who live in the Northeast (which is to say, most of them) don&rsquo;t care about Delivery Optimization, because it doesn&rsquo;t cost them a dime just to re-download everything. Why? Because after Verizon provided unlimited bandwidth to FiOS users, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394038/comcast-suspends-data-caps-for-certain-states-and-thats-unfair.html">Comcast was pressured into eliminating its data caps</a> with most of the Northeast states after first <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393158/data-caps-on-comcast-t-mobile-return-on-july-1.html">suspending them during the pandemic</a>. But that benefit isn&rsquo;t available to anywhere else Comcast serves, which sucks.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not willing to pay your Internet provider for unlimited data (and why should you?) all of that extra data costs money. For my family of four, Comcast Xfinity allows me 1.2TB a month, which goes fast with a pair of near-teenage boys and a media-savvy wife. Beyond that, I&rsquo;m charged $10 for every 50GB I go over. For games and video, that adds up.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Delivery Optimization" class="wp-image-1994039" height="633" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-Store-download.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Delivery Optimization allows you to still download games, but fetch them from nearby PCs.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Meanwhile, I have a few laptops that I use for testing. I&rsquo;ll play a game on the Xbox or on the PC. That adds up, too. </p>



<p>Delivery Optimization should help solve that problem. Within the Windows 10 and 11 Settings menu, you can toggle Delivery Optimization on using <em>Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced options &gt; Delivery Optimization</em> and the toggle to &ldquo;allow downloads from other PCs.&rdquo; Two more links appear near the bottom of the page: <em>Advanced Options</em> and <em>Activity Monitor</em>, which allow you to actually manage the amount of data your PC uploads and downloads from the Internet, versus what it receives from your nearby PCs.</p>



<p>For whatever reason, though, only a tiny fraction of my downloaded updates arrives from other PCs on my network, if that. Neither am I uploading anything to those PCs, or even to the Internet, though I&rsquo;ve had that option toggled on, too. I feel the frustration of this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2314475-windows-update-delivery-optimization-not-working&amp;xcust=2-1-1993965-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">random soul,</a> who bemoaned the fact that all anyone ever searches for is how to turn Delivery Optimization <em>off</em>, rather than on.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Delivery Optimization" class="wp-image-1994038" height="651" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-Delivery-Optimization-activity.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">If Windows&rsquo; Delivery Optimization truly worked, I&rsquo;d be downloading dozens of gigabytes from other local PCs.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>There are two ways to help determine whether or not Delivery Optimization is running: first, open the Run menu (<strong>Win + R)</strong> and enter <em>services.msc</em> . You should see a list of services on your PC, along with their status. The Services window identified the Delivery Optimization service as running, and set to begin automatically. So, no luck there.</p>



<p>I also tried a method <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techgenix.com/windows-10-delivery-optimization/#Failure%20to%20Communicate?&amp;xcust=2-1-1993965-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> by Brien Posey of TechGenix: Open an elevated PowerShell session and enter the following command:&nbsp;<em>Get-DeliveryOptimizationStatus</em> . That should produce an output where you can check the number of client peers from which the download originated. It should hopefully more than 0, which signifies that just the Microsoft server was used.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Delivery Optimization" class="wp-image-1994037" height="623" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-Delivery-Optimization-controls.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">You can turn on Windows Delivery Optimization  from the Windows Update setting.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Neither method seemed to tell me whether or not Delivery Optimization was working. And yet, my Windows Update delivery monitor indicated that it <em>did</em> work, though for just half a gigabyte or two. But why? And on what files? I don&rsquo;t know. Something happened, though nothing meaningful. So yes, it feels like Delivery Optimization is just taunting me.</p>



<p>The trouble with sharing apps and data among multiple PCs is the fact that the connection can be extremely sensitive to a variety of factors: whether they&rsquo;re on the same network, whether devices are protected by a firewall, the versions of Windows each device is running, and so on. Those are some of the issues you have to manage with an app like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407999/hands-on-how-one-mouse-can-control-multiple-pcs-with-microsofts-mouse-without-borders-app.html">Mouse Without Borders</a>, for example. </p>



<p>Some of this falls upon the user&rsquo;s shoulders. But Microsoft&rsquo;s rather <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/search/results?query=delivery+optimixzation&amp;isEnrichedQuery=false&amp;xcust=2-1-1993965-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">skimpy Delivery Optimization support documents</a> focus on <em>managing</em> Delivery Optimization, or at least managing user concerns that their PC will unwittingly spray data all over the Internet. There&rsquo;s really not all that much about what to do if Delivery Optimization simply fails to work. </p>

<p>The problem, though, is a real one. Not all of us <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612633/the-hidden-costs-of-multi-gigabit-fiber-internet-a-cautionary-tale.html">benefit from multi-gigabit Ethernet service</a>. Maybe Microsoft engineers do, working from their campus in Redmond or via high-speed connections from their homes. But many workers still work over slow, remote, Internet connections with limited data caps. If the FCC won&rsquo;t work to eliminate data caps entirely, than maybe Microsoft can help out those of us who have to put up with them. </p>

<p>Private Internet Access (PIA) has seemingly been around since the advent of third-party VPNs. Since that time, it&rsquo;s been a favorite VPN service for many users thanks to its excellent pricing and good privacy guarantees. Recently the service has made some truly promising improvements by lifting the device connection limit and undergoing a third-party audit. So, with these new updates how does it stack up against the other titans of the VPN market? Let&rsquo;s dive in and have a look.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="private-internet-access-vpn-features-and-services">Private Internet Access VPN features and services</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Private Internet Access" class="wp-image-1974969" height="608" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PIA-Homescreen.png" width="374" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Upon first opening PIA you&rsquo;ll notice that it has maintained the same user-interface design since the company overhauled its Windows app in 2019. You&rsquo;re presented with a simple panel in the lower-right corner of your screen. By default this panel is locked to that location and you&rsquo;re unable to move it. This design decision honestly felt a bit constrained and awkward. Thankfully, you&rsquo;re able to change this in the settings menu, but it isn&rsquo;t obvious at first glance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Otherwise the Windows app is pretty straightforward. There&rsquo;s a big on/off button at the top, and below that is the VPN server location&mdash;clicking it takes you to a different screen where you&rsquo;re able to view and choose a different country or server location. For countries with multiple location options you&rsquo;re able to click a drop-down menu to display all of the available server locations within that country. And boy are there a lot to choose from. PIA offers an 84 country server spread, and while not officially confirmed, it&rsquo;s believed to have more than 10,000 servers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Private Internet Access comes with a plethora of great features such as split-tunneling, multi-hop, and a kill switch. </p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Private Internet Access" class="wp-image-1974970" height="996" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PIA-Servers.png" width="373" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Private Internet Access server location display with name and latency of each server.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Next to each country location is its latency displayed in milliseconds and there&rsquo;s a heart icon which allows you to designate a server as one of your favorites. It also denotes which servers are virtual servers with an icon that states &ldquo;This is a geo-located region&rdquo; next to the name. A virtual server is not located within the country itself, but rather assigns an IP address of the country location instead. The transparency here should be commended as not many other VPN providers label which of their servers are virtual or physical.</p>



<p>Overall the server-list layout is nice and simple to follow. PIA allows you to sort its server list either by latency or location name, as well. This makes it much easier for people who are only interested in speed to find the optimal connection, or likewise by name to find their desired location.</p>



<p>Once connected, the app displays your actual IP address and the VPN address you&rsquo;re using. This basic information is all you can see in the compact view, but if you click the downward-facing arrow at the bottom you can see a ton of extra details as well. This includes quick-connect options with locations such as France, Germany, the U.S., and the UK. There are also tiles for bandwidth usage, a performance graph, data encryption and handshake settings being used, and basic settings control. If you prefer to see any of this information on the compact view instead you&rsquo;re able to click the bookmark icon on any tile to display it. You can add or remove any of these options as you see fit.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Private Internet Access" class="wp-image-1974971" height="825" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PIA-Settings.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Private Internet Access Settings menu.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Private Internet Access also comes with a plethora of great features such as split-tunneling, multi-hop, and a kill switch. Split-tunneling allows you to pick and choose which apps you wish to run through a VPN, allowing you to optimize bandwidth for low-risk activities such as streaming or gaming. In fact, PIA has one of the most dynamic split-tunneling features we&rsquo;ve ever seen. Power users can go to town tweaking things such as which apps, IP addresses, and DNS requests are allowed to bypass the VPN. It even allows you to designate an app-based kill switch, which will block traffic only on specific apps should the VPN connection break.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, taking after other VPN providers such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398777/nordvpn-review-3.html">NordVPN</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397529/surfshark-vpn-review-2.html">Surfshark</a>, PIA has added a handy security extra in the form of an ad- and tracker-blocker that it calls MACE. This is something we&rsquo;re seeing more regularly as a means to entice users with a complete online security suite rather than just a VPN service. You can even opt-in to an antivirus tool from PIA for an additional fee when you sign-up if you so choose. The convenience of this all-in-one approach is appealing, but generally speaking, a standalone antivirus software, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">our favorite antivirus suites</a>, will offer you more comprehensive coverage and overall security.</p>



<p>It seems that every time we do an updated review of Private Internet Access it has introduced new upgrades and features and this time is no exception. Since early 2023, PIA now allows for unlimited simultaneous device connections&mdash;which is increasingly becoming an industry standard. Also, PIA is in the process of upgrading its servers to <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100470607-14087873?sid=2-1-403379-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/pias-nextgen-vpn-network-is-a-huge-deal-update-to-try-it-out-now/" rel="nofollow">NextGen 10Gbps</a> instead of the 1Gbps it&rsquo;s had in the past. This should increase connection speeds significantly for users in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-private-internet-access-vpns-performance">How is Private Internet Access VPN&rsquo;s performance?</h2>



<p>In our testing we measured connection speeds across PIA&rsquo;s servers in five different countries all around the world and then compared them to our baseline internet speed. PIA&rsquo;s speeds were alright, but they weren&rsquo;t enough to make <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/616724/fastest-vpn.html">our top five fastest VPNs</a>. Across all locations tested, the speeds averaged 52 percent of the base download speed and a respectable 80 percent of the base upload speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, as one would expect, we noted that locations closer to our physical location had better speed averages, while server locations further away were slower. For a top VPN, these averages are a bit on the slow side. NordVPN, one of PIA&rsquo;s top competitors, has average speeds of over 70 percent of the base download speed. That being said, they aren&rsquo;t terrible and should be plenty fast enough to allow you to stream, game, or browse to your heart&rsquo;s content without noticeable lag&mdash;depending on your own home internet connection, of course.</p>



<p>As for streaming, Private Internet Access worked perfectly fine with all of the major streaming services such as Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. We didn&rsquo;t come across any servers that were blocked and geo-restriction access was never an issue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="private-internet-access-vpn-security-and-privacy">Private Internet Access VPN security and privacy</h2>



<p>[PIA website services screenshot]</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Private Internet Access" class="wp-image-1974972" height="756" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PIA-Features.png" width="1018" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Private Internet Access</p></div>



<p>When you sign up for PIA, it only asks for your email address. It accepts a good range of payment options including credit card, PayPal, Amazon Pay, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin&mdash;there&rsquo;s also an option to use Bitpay instead of direct wallet transfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PIA has been owned and operated by Kape Technologies, a UK-based company formerly known as Crossrider, since 2019. There have been some questions in the past about the somewhat dubious practices surrounding Crossrider. Its development platform for browser extensions was used by independent developers to deliver malicious adware and malware to users. Realizing this and facing backlash, Crossrider closed the platform in 2016 and rebranded as Kape Technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since this reset, and subsequent leadership reorganization, Kape Technologies has pivoted to become a major provider of digital security software. It has gone on a run in recent years of purchasing ownership over some of the largest VPNs on the market today including PIA, ExpressVPN, ZenMate VPN, and CyberGhost VPN, as well as Mac antivirus firm Intego.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To its credit, PIA has made an effort to ease the minds of privacy-focused users with <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100470607-14087873?sid=2-1-403379-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/private-internet-access-releases-updated-transparency-report-in-q1-2022/" rel="nofollow">regular transparency reports</a>. Additionally, in 2022 it underwent an independent audit by Deloitte to review its no-logs policy. Deloitte confirmed that PIA stores no logs and no details that could be used to identify users or their activities. Privacy is one of the pillars of a good VPN service and this independent audit and PIA&rsquo;s continued willingness to strive for transparency has done a lot to rectify concerns over its parent company&rsquo;s past.</p>



<p>PIA uses the industry standard AES-256 encryption and in the Windows app supports WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. There is also built-in protection against DNS leaks. We confirmed this by using a DNS Leak test tool and found that our real location information was never leaked while connected to PIA&rsquo;s servers.</p>



<p>PIA also uses diskless RAM-only servers, which boot on a read-only image and use RAM modules instead of hard disks. By not storing data on hard disks, RAM-only servers are more resistant to tampering both by hackers and physical breaches. This is also becoming increasingly popular among VPN providers, but it means that PIA is staying at the forefront of security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-private-internet-access-vpn-worth-it">Is Private Internet Access VPN worth it?</h2>



<p>Private Internet Access has been at this game for a long time and it shows. Its VPN is well polished with a nice interface, plenty of servers to choose from, and tons of tweakable features. Its continued publication of transparency reports and up-front nature regarding user privacy and security is commendable as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s true that the speeds might not be the fastest, and its parent company has had its fair share of dubious issues. But that is all seemingly in the past and PIA has done its best to show that it is removed from all of that anyhow. While there may be other services that do one single thing better, PIA stands apart as a jack-of-all-trades that does everything well. It continues to be a top-tier VPN that is only getting better with age.</p>

<p>Cloning Windows 10 to SSD requires only three simple steps, which including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Connect SSD to your Windows 10 computer</li>



<li>Download EaseUS Disk Copy disk cloning software</li>



<li>Clone Windows 10 to SSD with a disk cloning tool</li>



<li>Boot the computer from the cloned SSD</li>
</ul>



<p><em>&ldquo;I have bought a new SSD for my pc and its build in and works now I have 2 but I want to move all my data to the new one cause its faster and has more space than my old one. Both are SSD, one is 512GB, the other 1TB. Does anyone have a good tutorial or can tell me how to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; post from Reddit</em></p>



<p>The demand for faster and more effective computer systems grows along with technology. One of the best ways to improve the performance and speed of your computer is to go from HDD to SSD, and SSD to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/558324/nvme-vs-m-2-vs-sata-ssd-whats-the-difference.html" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">M.2 SSD/NVMe SSD</a>.</p>



<p>There are numerous advantages to transferring Windows 10 OS to an SSD, including increased system reliability, faster boot times, shorter program launch times, faster system responsiveness, and so on. Some possible scenarios in which you may need to transfer Windows 10 to an SSD include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Replace old HDD with new SSD:</strong> When you buy a new SSD and want to move your existing Windows 10 operating system from the old drive to the new disk.</li>



<li><strong>Install a new SSD on your computer:</strong> If you want to replace the old hard drive with a new SSD, you can <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.easeus.com/backup-utility/clone-windows-10-os-to-new-ssd.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1995663-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">clone Windows 10 OS to new SSD</a> </em>and boot from the new SSD for quicker performance.</li>



<li><strong>Upgrade from a smaller SSD to a larger one:</strong> When the original SSD runs out of storage space, you must upgrade the storage space and switch to a larger SSD.</li>



<li><strong>Replace an HDD with a smaller SSD:</strong> SSDs are more expensive per gigabyte than HDDs. You must clone the operating system to the smaller SSD if you wish to maximize their capacity and decrease costs by shrinking to a smaller SSD while still maintaining vital files and the Windows 10 operating system.</li>
</ul>



<p>In this context, we will walk you through the process of <strong>cloning Windows 10 to an SSD</strong>, which refers to the process of producing an exact copy or replica of your Windows 10 OS, including all installed programs, files, and settings, onto a new SSD with professional <em>disk cloning software</em>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.easeus.com/disk-copy/home-edition/&amp;xcust=2-1-1995663-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">EaseUS Disk Copy</a>.</p>
