Meanwhile, social media comments flash up on the screen, illustrating the kind of hate speech she is regularly greeted with online: from the disgusting slur “you are a retard” to the less overt, but still incredibly offensive, “windowlicker” and “the crowd drenched in dribble”. Is there any escape for Jones, you begin to wonder? Is there a safe place for her to exist?</p><p>Rosie Jones: Am I A R*tard? is available on Channel 4.</p><p>For advice on reporting a disability hate crime, please visit <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/">Scope</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/20/rosie-jones-am-i-a-rtard-review-a-truly-shocking-tale-of-the-online-abuse-faced-by-disabled-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Baltic, Gateshead<br /></strong>The Iraqi-American’s intricately-labelled planters and models form a repository for stories on everything from the destruction of Palestinian olives to homesick migrants</p><p>Among the potted geraniums, a pop-eyed man is being devoured by a lion. This would give you pause down the garden centre but that’s not all: a bull’s head rests on flowers, a gigantic snail makes its way towards nasturtiums and a model aeroplane, fabricated from food packaging, has somehow crash-landed between the tamarisks and the date palms. There is a lot more to discover in the high-sided planters, with their sandy soils and loam, the saplings and herbs, in Iraqi-American artist Michael Rakowitz’s <a href="https://baltic.art/whats-on/va-michael-rakowitz/">The Waiting Gardens of the North</a>, his project for the light-filled top-floor gallery at Baltic.</p><p>Small labels stuck in the soil between the plants give us more than growing advice. There are no bargain blooms here. Among the young olive saplings, a label tells us how up to 2m olive trees and countless groves have been destroyed by the Israeli authorities since 1967, as a primary form of land acquisition; the deficit in olive production affects 100,000 Palestinian households, the uprooted trees causing an annual loss of over $12m. Palestinian poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/11/poetry.israelandthepalestinians">Mahmoud Darwish</a> has written: “If the olive trees knew the hands that planted them, their oil would become tears.” “Douma [in Syria] used to smell of roses”, writes a perfumer. “Now it reeks of gunpowder”, and a gardener laments that the damask rose will not return “til this war is over”.

<p>From Do the Right Thing to Now and Then, Guardian writers pick the film that reminds them most of the warmest months</p><p>Anybody who has tried to multitask over a Zoom-assisted summer of late will find much to relate to in Swimming Pool, French director François Ozon’s first English language feature, about a working holiday that is anything but relaxing. British crime novelist Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) has hit a creative wall, and retreats to her smarmy publisher’s summer home in the south of France. Nothing like a change of scenery to help a hit-maker press the refresh button. Our belted-up, beige-clad protagonist stocks up on tubs of yogurt and clacks away at her computer, determined to rack up a handsome word count. But the stultifying heat and the sensuality rising from the home’s other resident, the libertine daughter that her publisher never mentioned having, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), wear away at Sarah’s calcified bearing (“she has a broomstick up her butt,” per Julie). Over these sweltering weeks, Sarah opens her hooded eyes and comes undone, and not just because she starts swilling gin and stabbing at midday profiteroles with a grapefruit spoon. Ozon’s depiction of Sarah’s awakening is electric, and rendered in a style that is, rather miraculously, both languid and taut. The film is bookended by scenes in an office, an unwelcome reminder that the laws of gravity apply to even the most gorgeously dizzying of dreams. <em>Lauren Mechling</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/20/best-summer-movies">Continue reading...</a>

The rightwing papers have always had a propaganda function, not just campaigning for the Tories but also distorting or suppressing inconvenient facts about the distribution of power and resources. Through the emotiveness of their coverage as well, they imply that their readers’ feelings about, say, immigration, matter more than lived experience or statistics.

<p><strong>King’s Manor, York<br /></strong>Large-scale community play has Henry VIII cancelling the city’s beloved Mystery Plays as a clever framing device in a striking adaptation</p><p>There’s more than one kind of mystery at play in this adaptation of CJ Sansom’s historical crime novel. The scene opens not on Matthew Shardlake, Sansom’s lawyer-detective protagonist, but on a centuries-old local theatrical tradition: the York Mystery Plays, performed on wagons by city guildswomen. Until, that is, Henry VIII arrives, putting an end to this much-loved ritual.</p><p>It’s an ingenious framing device from adapter Mike Kenny. Immediately, he connects this present-day outdoor community production to the city’s long history of theatre by and for the people. He also conjures up a chorus in the form of the thwarted guildswomen. They guide us through the rest of the drama, narrating offstage plot points, concealing key events to keep us in suspense and adding a collective female voice to what could otherwise be a male-dominated story.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/show/sovereign/">King’s Manor, York</a>, until 23 July</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/20/sovereign-review-cj-sansom-historical-doorstopper-comes-home-to-york">Continue reading...</a>

The heart of En Garde! is the carefully controlled chaos of its combat – you parry, attack and jump away from large groups of enemies, none of whom politely wait for their turn to stab you. Adalia can kick barrels, drop chandeliers, throw jugs left on tables and smack enemies with lutes. Foes come equipped with more than 3,000 individual voice lines, adding a chorus of “haha!” “hoho!” and “surrender now!” to the fighting as you run rings around them.</p><p>En Garde! is out 16 August on PC</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/20/fun-flamboyant-fabulous-en-garde-is-the-ultimate-swashbuckling-fantasy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London<br /></strong>The Irish standup’s new show swerves from the problems with getting older to 80s nostalgia, and just about pulls it off</p><p><strong>“</strong>I’m ageing by the minute,” says Deirdre O’Kane. But there’s nothing mellow about the opening stages of Demented, which finds her conjuring with that freighted phrase “woman of a certain age”. O’Kane sets out her stall here, trading in acidity and swagger as she jokes about her age-resisting regime and whether she might still lure younger men into bed. The frankness is winning, and carries us over into the meat of the show’s first half, an account of how O’Kane came to acknowledge her menopause (“I’m not just forgetting people – I’ve gone off them”) and seek help with her changing body.</p><p>If it’s not quite as wild as Bridget Christie’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/17/bridget-christie-who-am-i-review">recent material on the same theme</a>, the 55-year-old fashions enjoyable standup from her encounters with her well-heeled consultant and her adventures in HRT. OK, so the joke about not recognising her husband lands a bit awkwardly. More sure-footed are the jaundiced remarks about the inverse proportion between her own oestrogen (and collagen) and that of her teenage daughter.</p><p>At <a href="https://sohotheatre.com/events/deirdre-okane-demented/">Soho theatre, London</a>, until 22 July</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/20/deirdre-okane-review-comedy-adventures-in-ageing-and-hrt">Continue reading...</a>

Like many, I knew her story, having followed her on social media since my own sister passed away from breast cancer. Online, she comes across as both candid and joyful, sharing adventures, advice and pictures of her bright handmade dresses.</p><p>I had assumed her memoir would be the straightforward tale of a doctor turned patient. However, the experiences of illness, both depression and cancer, actually come in the final act of this revealing and ultimately hopeful book. The first two acts comprise a frank account of her long apprenticeship in medicine and surgery. She sets out in meticulous detail the complexities and demands of this process, which involves a new rotation every four months, in a different specialty where you effectively begin from zero, sometimes in a different hospital or a different town.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/20/under-the-knife-by-dr-liz-oriordan-review-cancer-from-both-sides">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For years the corporate diktat has been that happiness must be achieved alone, but many are turning to communities for joy</p><p>There are 11-year-olds with dyed blue hair, ripped men in their 40s and dirtbag hipsters in their 20s, all hanging from plastic crimps on the walls of a high-ceilinged gym. As electronic dance music plays loudly, Gatorade and microbrews are being served to the audience. They dance and clap in unison. Some gather to chat and cheer at those climbing the walls around them. It’s exuberant, anarchic, and although I am not a climber, I am in the middle of it, sitting cross-legged on the sweaty floor.</p><p>I’m not attending the event, which was organized by a Brooklyn climbing gym, because I love dim lighting, relentless bass and beer – although I do like these things. I am here because my tween daughter has a gift for climbing, and my attending those competitions turned parties is a requirement – she’s still a kid – but it also further connects us to this community. Watching her do “beta” with dance-like hand and arm movements to figure out a climb before she gets on the wall or smile shyly at the crowd when she “tops” and waves to her friends make me proud: she is thinking with her body, but also anchored in a group of enthusiasts I had never known of before she showed them to me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/20/how-find-happiness-corporate-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stumbling across my old paddleboard prompted a flood of memories, mostly of heaving the lumpen thing about. No wonder I abandoned it in my garden</p><p>Hacking away recently at some weeds in the garden, I chanced upon something discarded in the undergrowth: my old paddleboard.</p><p>It took me a while to get to paddleboarding. As a kid, I spent hours on those polystyrene boards, rubbing my nipples red raw. (They have been upsettingly sensitive ever since, but let’s not go there.) I tried <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jun/10/10-uk-best-surfing-and-boarding-beaches-spots-chosen-by-readers">proper surfing</a>, but was only any good flat on my belly; I couldn’t stand up and quickly became discouraged. I tried windsurfing, but found I was either getting fed up with all the falling off, or going so fast that I was frightened to death. Also, I was too scared to go out on my own as I didn’t trust myself to rig the bloody thing properly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/my-adventures-at-sea-have-brought-me-many-things-mainly-raw-nipples-and-exhaustion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ten years ago, Anne-Marie Cockburn’s only child died from an overdose of MDMA. She was determined it would not be the end of her own life – and that her daughter would have a positive legacy</p><p>Today, on the 10th anniversary of her daughter Martha’s death, Anne-Marie Cockburn will get married. The day will be emotional – elements of Martha and memories of her will be present, as they are every day – but joyful, too, which says so much about the way Cockburn has tried to live her life. This is an anniversary many parents might have dreaded but, she says: “It’s kind of this reworking and reshaping. But it’s all about love.”</p><p>On the afternoon of 20 July 2013, Martha Fernback, who was 15, took half a gram of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/high-street-dutch-ecstasy-shop-shows-possible-way-for-drug-reform-xtc">MDMA</a>, or ecstasy, and collapsed. She was at a lake near her home in Oxford with friends, and Cockburn received a call from the scene; she was told to head to A&amp;E but Martha hadn’t yet been brought in. When she did arrive, Cockburn watched as doctors tried to save her daughter. She remembers calling to Martha in the same tone – raw and primal – that she had last heard from herself as she gave birth. Cockburn couldn’t breathe, couldn’t stand. But there was also something else. “In the moment she died in the crash room, the words ‘I have a future, I have a life’ came into my head,” she says. “They were really loud, as if somebody shouted it in my ears, and I just thought: ‘How can you say this? Look at what I’m looking at.’ But that became my mantra: I have a future and I have a life.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/20/in-memory-of-martha-one-mothers-devastated-devoted-fight-to-end-drug-deaths">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Updates from the 151st Open, the year’s third major</li><li>Join the discussion! <a href="mailto:scott.murray@guardian.co.uk">Email Scott</a> with your thoughts</li></ul><p><strong>Jordan’s birdie at 2 was the first of the week.</strong> The first <em>eagle</em> of the week has been made by Pablo Larrazabal. The 40-year-old Spaniard rakes a 35-foot right-to-left curler across the par-five 5th, and that’s why you see him tucked in behind the leader at -1. Larrazabal’s best finish at the Open, and indeed any major, is a tie for 30th at Sandwich in 2011, so a sustained challenge is unlikely … but then again he’s won twice on the DP World Tour in the last four months, at the Korea Championship and the KLM Open, so you can understand why he’s currently striding the links in the confident style.</p><p><strong>The first shot of the 151st Open was hit by Matthew Jordan.</strong> The 27-year-old from Hoylake has been a member at his local club since he was seven, so knows the place pretty well. Still, taking the first shot at the oldest major makes things a bit different, not least because the 1st is the 17th for the members in the course’s everyday configuration. He had half of Liverpool looking on from the gallery, as well, or at least that’s what it felt like. So you couldn’t blame him for tugging his tee shot nervously into the thick rough down the left. But he gathered himself, advancing his ball into a greenside bunker, from where he got up and down for par. And now, having made several big putts along the way, he’s reached the turn in 33 strokes, birdies at 2, 5 and 8 more than compensating for a single dropped stroke at 6. The local hero leads the Open! Not bad for someone who has only played in it once before, last year at St Andrews, where he missed the cut. Now look!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/20/the-open-2023-first-round-updates-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the Argentinian’s Inter Miami debut nears, the terms of his contract could alter the game in North America long term</p><p>The symbolism of David Beckham welcoming Lionel Messi on to Inter Miami’s pitch as a Major League Soccer player for the first time was unavoidable.

## Pet by Catherine Chidgey review – a teacher’s masterclass in manipulation

<p>A Catholic primary school in New Zealand provides the setting for this atmospheric tale of cruelty and betrayal</p><p><br />On first reading, New Zealand author Catherine Chidgey’s new novel has little in common with her previous one, the Women’s prize-longlisted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/07/remote-sympathy-by-catherine-chidgey-review-bearing-witness-to-the-holocaust" title="">Remote Sympathy</a>. That book, set mainly in Buchenwald concentration camp during 1943-44, focused on the unlikely affinity between a Jewish doctor prisoner and his patient, the terminally ill wife of one of the camp’s Nazi administrators. It is worlds away from Pet, set in a Catholic primary school in a Wellington suburb in the 1980s, and a care home in Auckland 30 years later. And yet the claustrophobic, slightly surreal aspect of this school, its random violence, racism, misogyny and oppressive authoritarianism, are not dissimilar to the themes of Remote Sympathy, while Chidgey again displays her prodigious talent for psychological suspense and minutely evoking past eras.</p><p>Justine, an only child whose mother died of breast cancer a year before, is 12 in 1984. Like all her classmates in their last year of primary school at St Michael’s, she is in thrall to their new teacher, Mrs Price, who is “younger than our parents, and prettier than our mothers”. Superficiality and manipulation – whether by means of body image or religion – are uppermost in this book. Mrs Price “wore her wavy blond hair with a deep fringe like Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business – not that we’d been allowed to see the film, because it wasn’t suitable. Around her neck a gold crucifix, with a tiny gold figure of Jesus, all ribs and thorns<em>.</em>”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/20/pet-by-catherine-chidgey-review-a-teachers-masterclass-in-manipulation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A remarkable meditation on the murder case that rocked 1980s Ireland</p><p>Grotesque. Unbelievable. Bizarre. Unprecedented. The then Irish prime minister Charles Haughey famously used these four words at a press conference in the summer of 1982, when a double murderer, the subject of a high profile nationwide search, was found to be staying as a guest in the seaside penthouse of the attorney general, Patrick Connolly. The most wanted criminal in Ireland was occasionally chauffeured around in the state car provided to the Irish government’s chief legal adviser, complete with a garda driver.</p><p>It was Conor Cruise O’Brien who shortened this into the acronym that was to define an era: Gubu. The ensuing scandal cost Connolly his job and contributed to the fall of the Haughey government later that year. Picking up Mark O’Connell’s remarkable new book about these murders, I was half expecting social analysis, and perhaps some theoretical reflections on 1980s Ireland, such as Fintan O’Toole offers when dissecting the case in his recent autobiographical social history, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/20/we-dont-know-ourselves-by-fintan-otoole-review-sweeping-account-of-irelands-evolutions" title="">We Don’t Know Ourselves</a>. Yet while O’Connell tells the story of the crimes, their background and their fallout with painstaking care, his approach is too restrained and self-searching for state-of-the-nation diagnostics or political allegory around class and power. He has produced a profound meditation on violence and its roots, on the skeining of barbarism and high culture, and on our urge to make sense of chaos and brutality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/20/a-thread-of-violence-by-mark-oconnell-review-evil-in-a-bow-tie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new airport and new routes may take pressure off creaking buses – but at what cost to a valuable wetland for flamingos and other birds?</p><p>Black smoke billows from the front of the bus. With no air-conditioning besides the sympathetic wafting of a folded map from another passenger, I’m five hours into a bus journey from Tirana to Sarandë. Has the engine exploded? I’m not too sure. But judging by the groans of the driver and other passengers, this is far from ideal.</p><p>For many visitors, this is the reality of travelling in Albania. Buses and car hire are the primary methods of transportation – so incidents like these are pretty regular. The only two cities accessible by international flights are Tirana and Kukës in the north, leaving mid and south Albania fairly inaccessible unless travelling by bus or car. However, Albanian transportation is shifting. Flight routes to Albania are increasing, and not everyone is happy about it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/20/albania-fears-grow-over-environmental-impact-of-new-airport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plenty of people will tell you the East Neuk of Fife in Scotland is the best place in the world to eat fish and chips. So what happens when its chippies – and chippies across the UK – start to disappear?</p><p>One summer ago, before the region’s fish and chip industry was shaken by closures, before a death that was hard for people to bear, a lorry heaped with the first fresh potatoes of the season drove along the east coast of Scotland. This lorry wound its way along the East Neuk of Fife, dodging washing lines, mooring bollards and seagulls, parking with impunity to make deliveries. There was an understanding in the East Neuk that nobody would ever get angry and honk at the inbound “tattie” lorry, fish and chips being a staple meal, vital to the region’s economy. Tourists come shocking distances to sit on old harbour walls and stab around in takeaway trays with wooden forks. The fish and chips sold in the East Neuk might be the best in the British Isles and because of that (it follows) the best on the planet. Even so, by July 2022, local friers were finding it harder and harder to balance their books.</p><p>The driver of the tattie lorry, a red-cheeked Scotsman named Richard Murray, carried keys for most of the businesses on his route, to save from waking any tired friers who’d been up late the night before, poring anxiously over their sums. War in Ukraine coupled with ongoing complications from Brexit had driven up prices of almost all the goods that fish and chip shops depended on, from live ingredients to oil and salt to packaging. More distressing was the problem of rising energy costs. This meal is prepared using a great guzzler of a range cooker that must be kept on and roiling at all hours of a trading day. As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/31/uk-hospitality-firms-pubs-restaurants-hotels-energy-food-inflation" title="">price of gas and electricity</a> threatened to double, then triple, through 2022, friers were opening their energy bills with gritted teeth. A trade association called the National Federation of Fish Friers said that as many as a third of the UK’s 10,500 shops might go dark, warning of a potential “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-62650572" title="">extinction event</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/20/a-funeral-for-fish-and-chips-east-neuk-fife-anstruther-scotland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Barbara Iweins spent four years taking pictures of every object in her home, from her own clothes to her kids’ toys. She realised she could live without 99% of them</p><p>‘If I had known how much work was involved, perhaps I never would have started.” Belgian photographer Barbara Iweins is thinking about the decision she made six years ago to photograph every object she owned. The project took four years and 12,795 photos later, her task was complete. Now her work is on show at the <a href="https://www.cortonaonthemove.com/en/">Cortona on the Move photography festival</a> in Tuscany.</p><p>The decision came after a divorce and having to move house for the 11th time. “I was exhausted to have all these objects to pack once again. I really wanted to see what it was like – a houseful of objects. I decided to photograph room by room and drawer by drawer. I was putting Post-its on the drawers because I was scared of photographing the same thing again.”</p><p>Objects from Iweins’ bathroom</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/20/12795-possessions-barbara-iweins-photographer-every-object">Continue reading...</a>
