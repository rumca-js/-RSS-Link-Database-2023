British crime novelist Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) has hit a creative wall, and retreats to her smarmy publisher\u2019s summer home in the south of France. Nothing like a change of scenery to help a hit-maker press the refresh button. Our belted-up, beige-clad protagonist stocks up on tubs of yogurt and clacks away at her computer, determined to rack up a handsome word count. But the stultifying heat and the sensuality rising from the home\u2019s other resident, the libertine daughter that her publisher never mentioned having, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), wear away at Sarah\u2019s calcified bearing (\u201cshe has a broomstick up her butt,\u201d per Julie). Over these sweltering weeks, Sarah opens her hooded eyes and comes undone, and not just because she starts swilling gin and stabbing at midday profiteroles with a grapefruit spoon. Ozon\u2019s depiction of Sarah\u2019s awakening is electric, and rendered in a style that is, rather miraculously, both languid and taut. The film is bookended by scenes in an office, an unwelcome reminder that the laws of gravity apply to even the most gorgeously dizzying of dreams. <em>Lauren Mechling</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/20/best-summer-movies\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/20/best-summer-movies", "date_published": "2023-07-20T13:37:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Blur: The Ballad of Darren review \u2013 middle-age regrets voiced in gorgeous tunes", "description": "<p><strong>(Parlophone)</strong><br />Nostalgic melancholy fills Blur\u2019s ninth studio release, a courageous album that shows the band have something germane to say about getting old</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re taking down the scaffolds very soon,\u201d sings Damon Albarn, midway through Barbaric, presumably one of the songs he wrote for Blur\u2019s ninth studio album while on tour with Gorillaz last year.

Day one is done, day two is new. On into the future we go together. It was one of those days of back and forth yesterday: England win the toss and bowl, make early inroads, Australia pull it back, gain the upper hand at times, formed a partnership for almost every wicket, which England then found a way to break.

The 40-year-old Spaniard rakes a 35-foot right-to-left curler across the par-five 5th, and that\u2019s why you see him tucked in behind the leader at -1. Larrazabal\u2019s best finish at the Open, and indeed any major, is a tie for 30th at Sandwich in 2011, so a sustained challenge is unlikely \u2026 but then again he\u2019s won twice on the DP World Tour in the last four months, at the Korea Championship and the KLM Open, so you can understand why he\u2019s currently striding the links in the confident style.</p><p><strong>The first shot of the 151st Open was hit by Matthew Jordan.</strong> The 27-year-old from Hoylake has been a member at his local club since he was seven, so knows the place pretty well. Still, taking the first shot at the oldest major makes things a bit different, not least because the 1st is the 17th for the members in the course\u2019s everyday configuration. He had half of Liverpool looking on from the gallery, as well, or at least that\u2019s what it felt like. So you couldn\u2019t blame him for tugging his tee shot nervously into the thick rough down the left. But he gathered himself, advancing his ball into a greenside bunker, from where he got up and down for par. And now, having made several big putts along the way, he\u2019s reached the turn in 33 strokes, birdies at 2, 5 and 8 more than compensating for a single dropped stroke at 6. The local hero leads the Open! Not bad for someone who has only played in it once before, last year at St Andrews, where he missed the cut.

Unbelievable. Bizarre. Unprecedented. The then Irish prime minister Charles Haughey famously used these four words at a press conference in the summer of 1982, when a double murderer, the subject of a high profile nationwide search, was found to be staying as a guest in the seaside penthouse of the attorney general, Patrick Connolly. The most wanted criminal in Ireland was occasionally chauffeured around in the state car provided to the Irish government\u2019s chief legal adviser, complete with a garda driver.</p><p>It was Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien who shortened this into the acronym that was to define an era: Gubu. The ensuing scandal cost Connolly his job and contributed to the fall of the Haughey government later that year. Picking up Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s remarkable new book about these murders, I was half expecting social analysis, and perhaps some theoretical reflections on 1980s Ireland, such as Fintan O\u2019Toole offers when dissecting the case in his recent autobiographical social history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/20/we-dont-know-ourselves-by-fintan-otoole-review-sweeping-account-of-irelands-evolutions\" title=\"\">We Don\u2019t Know Ourselves</a>. Yet while O\u2019Connell tells the story of the crimes, their background and their fallout with painstaking care, his approach is too restrained and self-searching for state-of-the-nation diagnostics or political allegory around class and power. He has produced a profound meditation on violence and its roots, on the skeining of barbarism and high culture, and on our urge to make sense of chaos and brutality.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/20/a-thread-of-violence-by-mark-oconnell-review-evil-in-a-bow-tie\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/20/a-thread-of-violence-by-mark-oconnell-review-evil-in-a-bow-tie", "date_published": "2023-07-20T06:30:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Byelection polls open with Rishi Sunak forecasting \u2018tough\u2019 fight to save seats", "description": "<p>Opposition parties hope to overturn government majorities in three constituencies vacated by Tory MPs amid controversy</p><p>Polls have opened in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership.</p><p>The Conservative-held constituencies are being targeted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to overturn large majorities and send Tory MPs off into the summer recess nervous about their own political futures come the general election.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/20/byelection-polls-open-with-rishi-sunak-forecasting-tough-fight-to-save-seats\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/20/byelection-polls-open-with-rishi-sunak-forecasting-tough-fight-to-save-seats", "date_published": "2023-07-20T06:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Lover to lover: photographers\u2019 most intimate images \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>A new exhibition features photographic love stories, from the first rush of an affair to the pain of separation </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jul/20/lover-to-lover-photographers-most-intimate-images-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jul/20/lover-to-lover-photographers-most-intimate-images-in-pictures", "date_published": "2023-07-20T06:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Albania: fears grow over environmental impact of new airport", "description": "<p>A new airport and new routes may take pressure off creaking buses \u2013 but at what cost to a valuable wetland for flamingos and other birds?</p><p>Black smoke billows from the front of the bus.

So what happens when its chippies \u2013 and chippies across the UK \u2013 start to disappear?</p><p>One summer ago, before the region\u2019s fish and chip industry was shaken by closures, before a death that was hard for people to bear, a lorry heaped with the first fresh potatoes of the season drove along the east coast of Scotland. This lorry wound its way along the East Neuk of Fife, dodging washing lines, mooring bollards and seagulls, parking with impunity to make deliveries. There was an understanding in the East Neuk that nobody would ever get angry and honk at the inbound \u201ctattie\u201d lorry, fish and chips being a staple meal, vital to the region\u2019s economy. Tourists come shocking distances to sit on old harbour walls and stab around in takeaway trays with wooden forks. The fish and chips sold in the East Neuk might be the best in the British Isles and because of that (it follows) the best on the planet. Even so, by July 2022, local friers were finding it harder and harder to balance their books.</p><p>The driver of the tattie lorry, a red-cheeked Scotsman named Richard Murray, carried keys for most of the businesses on his route, to save from waking any tired friers who\u2019d been up late the night before, poring anxiously over their sums. War in Ukraine coupled with ongoing complications from Brexit had driven up prices of almost all the goods that fish and chip shops depended on, from live ingredients to oil and salt to packaging. More distressing was the problem of rising energy costs. This meal is prepared using a great guzzler of a range cooker that must be kept on and roiling at all hours of a trading day. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/31/uk-hospitality-firms-pubs-restaurants-hotels-energy-food-inflation\" title=\"\">price of gas and electricity</a> threatened to double, then triple, through 2022, friers were opening their energy bills with gritted teeth. A trade association called the National Federation of Fish Friers said that as many as a third of the UK\u2019s 10,500 shops might go dark, warning of a potential \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-62650572\" title=\"\">extinction event</a>\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/20/a-funeral-for-fish-and-chips-east-neuk-fife-anstruther-scotland\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/20/a-funeral-for-fish-and-chips-east-neuk-fife-anstruther-scotland", "date_published": "2023-07-20T04:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Extreme heat: what does it do to us and how can we adapt? \u2013 podcast", "description": "<p>As record temperatures spread across the world, Ian Sample sets out to understand what heat does to our bodies and what we can do to mitigate it without causing more damage to the environment.
