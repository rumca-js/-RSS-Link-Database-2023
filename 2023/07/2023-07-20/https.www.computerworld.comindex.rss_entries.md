<p><em>Disclosure: Microsoft is a client of the author.</em></p><p>I remember when Office was first announced and released. Compared to the mess of applications that came before it, it was a Godsend. Yes, Lotus Symphony was on the market and many of us preferred it — at least, those of us in accounting because it was spreadsheet-based. But it would not have arrived at all had not Office shown up first.</p><p>Office turned out to be better for most users. Even with challenges from rivals like IBM and Google/Alphabet, it held on and remains the standard when it comes to a set of personal productivity tools. That’s true on Windows, macOS, iOS and Android’s different forms.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703189/microsoft-365-copilot-a-new-desktop-productivity-revolution-begins.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Networking giant Cisco Systems is laying off staff again, employees reported on social media this week.

<p>By and large, wading your way around the web isn't exactly an inspiring process. You open up Chrome — or whatever browser you prefer on Android — and you pull up the site you want. Right?</p><p>Okay, so sure: You can always use Android's system-level screen-splitting setup if you want to look at two tabs side-by-side or view another app at the same time. But let's be honest: For most common purposes, that isn't the most effective way to get work accomplished. Unless you're using the plus-sized screen of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700795/google-pixel-fold.html">Google's Pixel Fold</a> or another expandable phone, that approach squeezes an awful lot of stuff into an awfully small space.

<p>Fifteen years ago, if you <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2551936/the-killer-in-the-er.html">entered an emergency room a thousand miles from home</a>, the ER doctors would not have had access to potentially lifesaving information in your medical records, such as your allergies or a list of drugs you were taking.
