It\u2019s not scary enough to succeed as a horror story, its controls are too clumsy to provide a satisfying stealth experience, and its enemy and puzzle variety are too limited to make any part of the journey feel truly distinct. What begins as an intriguing incursion into a cult-ruled realm soon unravels into a repetitive slog stuck in the shoes of an unlikeable lead character. Unholy is never quite unplayable, but it\u2019s certainly uninspired, unwieldy, and unlikely to hold your interest all the way to its completion.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmyZ2VjE3g", "date_published": "2023-07-20T07:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/OWmyZ2VjE3g/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Diablo 4 Season 1 Leveling Guide for Landslide Druid", "description": "Diablo 4 Season 1 is going to bring about a ton of changes, but the Druid will still be one of the top characters you can use.

In theaters July 21, 2023.\nA biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h1zKWfOGyg", "date_published": "2023-07-20T01:35:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1h1zKWfOGyg/hqdefault.jpg"}]
