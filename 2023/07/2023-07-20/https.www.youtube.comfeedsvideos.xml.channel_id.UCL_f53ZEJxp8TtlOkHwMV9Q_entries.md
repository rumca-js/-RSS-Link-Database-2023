Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Douglas Murray, author of “The War on The West,” discuss how a misguided purpose leads to abject misery, the cowardice of experts who choose silence in the face of malevolence, the psychology of fear, and the necessity of willful exposure to combat it.

​​Douglas Murray is a British writer, playwright, media correspondent and political commentator. He is the founder of the think tank the Centre for Social Cohesion, which is now part of the Henry Jackson Society. His publications include but are not limited to:  “The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam (2017),” “The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity (2019),” and most recently “The War on the West: How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason (2022)”. Murray has also written columns for publications such as “The Wall Street Journal” and is an associate editor for “The Spectator.” 

Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8
