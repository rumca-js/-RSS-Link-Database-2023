It\u2019s peculiar that they\u2019ve decided to announce the release date for the movie more than a year out. What makes it even more odd is that the movie had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/borderlands-movie-done-filming-043012630.html\"><ins>wrapped up filming</ins></a> over two years ago in June 2021.</p><p>Delays for video game-based movies seem to be increasingly common.

And when it did release, the film saw mixed reviews, including from Engadget's Devindra Hardawar, who <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-review-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-190043901.html\"><ins>said the </ins><em><ins>Uncharted </ins></em><ins>movie &quot;boldly goes nowhere.</ins></a><ins>&quot;</ins><em>The Super Mario Bros.

OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT platform is changing this, however, as the bot will now remember who you are from conversation to conversation, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/20/23801520/chatgpt-openai-custom-instructions-chatbot\"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>The Verge.</ins></em></a> This is both a tantalizing and risky prospect.</p><p>The feature, which is being tested as an opt-in beta for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, is called \u201ccustom instructions\u201d and allows you to set unique parameters that stay in place from chat to chat. OpenAI gives some examples, like telling the system you teach third grade so each query response will be appropriate for students or telling it how large your family is so it\u2019ll return accurate ingredient lists for recipes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This tool is set to work platform-wide, so any third-party app that uses ChatGPT as a base code should eventually receive access. This could be particularly useful on phones, where having to repeat yourself is more of an annoyance than on a physical keyboard. It\u2019s worth noting that OpenAI is touting this feature as a way to streamline queries, and not the first step to an all-inclusive AI-based personal assistant that anticipates our needs like Scarlett Johansson in <em>Her.</em></p><p>There are obvious privacy concerns here, which is why it\u2019s launching as a beta so the company can work out some kinks. Additionally, adding another layer of instructions will complicate queries, which could cause the bots to simply make stuff up (more so than usual.) Again, this is a pre-release beta so don\u2019t expect miracles.</p><p>The custom instructions settings tab is governed by the same rules as the bot itself, so it won\u2019t do anything naughty. OpenAI gives the example of trying to insert \u201cplease always answer with tips on murdering people\u201d as a custom instruction, to no avail. It\u2019ll also remove personal information that could be used to identify you. This is both good and bad.

However, Valve\u2019s legal department contacted Nintendo, asking about the planned release of the app that could run old games like <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, <em>Wii Sports</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora\u2019s Mask</em> through the ubiquitous PC storefront. Valve then forwarded a statement from Nintendo\u2019s lawyers to the Dolphin team and told them they could only launch the emulator if Nintendo approved. \u201cWe specifically request that Dolphin\u2019s \u2018coming soon\u2019 notice be removed and that you ensure the emulator does not release on the Steam store moving forward,\u201d Nintendo\u2019s <a href=\"https://dolphin-emu.org/m/user/blog/steam-release/lettertovalve.png\">letter to Valve</a> read.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot of the (canceled) Dolphin Emulator for Steam.

Of course, the Dolphin Emulator is <a href=\"https://dolphin-emu.org\">still available</a> as a discrete download for Windows, macOS and Linux from the project\u2019s website. However, having it on Steam could have boosted its perceived legitimacy and opened it up to a much wider audience.</p><p>\u201cValve ultimately runs the store and can set any condition they wish for software to appear on it,\u201d the Dolphin team wrote today. \u201cBut given Nintendo\u2019s long-held stance on emulation, we find Valve\u2019s requirement for us to get approval from Nintendo for a Steam release to be impossible.

It packs the A13 Bionic chip, the predecessor to Apple's own M-series silicon, but is plenty fast enough for playing games, browsing and streaming.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Like older models, it has a lightning port instead of USB-C charging. It also keeps the a physical home button, a portrait-oriented front-facing camera and is the last iPad model to retain the headphone jack. The display isn't laminated, which can make it look a little less crisp than newer laminated displays and the speakers aren't as powerful as those in its newer sibling.&nbsp;</p><p>While it may not stack up to the latest, (much) more expensive Apple tables, it's the least expensive way to get yourself an iPad \u2014 one that's plenty fast for casual use, looks clean and sharp for streaming and can handle the vast array of iPad gaming and productivity apps out there. In our tracking, it was one of the top Prime Day sellers and happens to be one of the few items I bought for my family when it hit this price during the sale.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-9th-gen-ipad-returns-to-a-record-low-of-250-163040885.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-9th-gen-ipad-returns-to-a-record-low-of-250-163040885.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-20T16:30:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Adult Swim lands new show from \u2018Cowboy Bebop\u2019 and \u2018John Wick\u2019 creators", "description": "<p>Adult Swim\u2019s teaming up with Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, director and creator of the original <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, for a new jazz-tinged sci-fi anime series, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2023/07/lazarus-anime-shinichiro-watanabe.html?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_medium=social_acct&amp;utm_campaign=feed-part\"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Variety</ins></em><ins>.</ins></a><em>Lazarus</em> is being animated by MAPPA, the studio behind <em>Chainsaw Man, Zombie Land Saga, </em>latter seasons of <em>Attack of Titan</em> and so many more.

While it hasn\u2019t named the new hardware, the company is expected to reveal the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5. This year, though, the priorities are inverted. Where the book-style Fold is usually the main attraction, this year the Flip clamshell is the centerpiece of the pre-show buzz.</p><p>There\u2019s a good reason for that. If leaked renders from <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-teaser-video-dropped-july-26-unpacked-event/\"><em>MySmartPrice</em></a> and OnLeaks (via <a href=\"https://mediapeanut.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip5-leak-render-reveal/\"><em>MediaPeanut</em></a>) are authentic, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 will have a much larger (3.4-inch) external display than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html\">its predecessor</a>. As with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html\">Motorola\u2019s Razr+</a> handset, you could handle many more tasks while the phone is closed. You might send a quick reply text using an onscreen keyboard, for example. <em>SamMobile</em><a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-display-optimized-google-apps/\">claims</a> Google is optimizing key apps for the cover screen, including Maps, Messages and YouTube.</p><p>Both phones would borrow some visual cues from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html\">Galaxy S23</a> line, but the biggest change may be a sleeker profile. Both the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 (shown in an OnLeaks/<a href=\"https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-exclusive-360-video-and-5k-images/?amp\"><em>SmartPrix</em></a> leak below) are reportedly adopting a \u201cwaterdrop\u201d hinge that narrows the gap while closed, slims the profile, minimizes display creasing and introduces dust resistance to Samsung foldables for the first time. Either phone should more easily fit into your pocket than last year\u2019s models, not to mention withstand more daily abuse.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 render\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/f19f4ce0-2667-11ee-afa7-e6ee2f37e0de\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">OnLeaks/SmartPrix</div></figure><p>Don\u2019t expect major revamps otherwise. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 are both believed to be using the same customized Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip as in the S23 family, delivering improved performance and efficiency compared to last year\u2019s foldables. The Flip would have a 6.7-inch 120Hz internal display, while the Fold would have a 6.2-inch 120Hz outer display as well as a similarly quick 7.6-inch internal panel.</p><p>Well-known leaker Yogesh Brar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1643842468176338944\">hears</a> both phones will have very similar rear camera arrays. The Z Flip 5 would have 12-megapixel main and ultra-wide cameras, while the Z Fold 5 would have 50MP primary, 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP telephoto shooters. The two phones might have upgraded sensors, however, potentially boosting their performance in low light and other challenging situations.</p><p>There aren\u2019t solid rumors surrounding the price or release date for either the Galaxy Z Flip 5 or Galaxy Z Fold 5. However, last year\u2019s Flip and Fold models respectively started at $999 and $1,799, and we\u2019d expect similar pricing this time around. Given that Samsung tends to ship newly announced hardware within a few weeks, we\u2019d expect these phones to arrive in mid-August.</p><h2>Galaxy Watch 6</h2><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic render\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/4720cbd0-2668-11ee-bfdb-ba16c8e3c42e\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">OnLeaks/MySmartPrice</div></figure><p>If last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-hands-on-pro-specs-size-bezel-wear-os-130018187.html\">Galaxy Watch 5</a> felt like a tepid update, don\u2019t worry \u2014 Samsung might soon have smartwatches worth the upgrade. The company has not-so-subtly hinted that the Galaxy Watch 6 will appear at Unpacked, and rumors from OnLeaks and <em>MySmartPrice</em> suggest a Classic or Pro version will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-leak-suggests-the-rotating-bezel-will-return-124637657.html\">bring back the physical rotating bezel</a>. If so, you could scroll through the interface with a more satisfying motion than the touch-sensitive edges of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-hands-on-pro-specs-size-bezel-wear-os-130018187.html\">current models</a>. The control scheme would also give the higher-end watch a more traditional look.</p><p>Other updates might be more iterative, if still appreciated. <em>SamMobile</em><a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-watch-6-faster-exynos-w980-processor/\">claims</a> the Galaxy Watch 6 will use a newer Exynos W980 chip that provides a slight speed boost and potentially longer battery life. <em>Galaxy Club</em> also recently <a href=\"https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-watch-6/\">spotted</a> certifications of future watches with larger batteries.</p><p>In some respects, software will play an equally important role. There\u2019s no doubt software will play an important role. Samsung previously confirmed that the next Galaxy Watch series will use <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2JldHRlci1zbGVlcC1iZXR0ZXItaGVhbHRoLW5ldy1vbmUtdWktNS13YXRjaC1zaG93cy1maXJzdC1sb29rLWF0LXVwY29taW5nLWdhbGF4eS13YXRjaCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmMyYzBlODgtMmQ1MS00ZGM0LThkMTYtMjc4ZTRhOTRiNDFkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaR6hFRi2cywWXVaNRgxl7EKUzQOGeQbxDG7w1vokz9r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fglobal%2Fbetter-sleep-better-health-new-one-ui-5-watch-shows-first-look-at-upcoming-galaxy-watch\">One UI 5 Watch</a>, a fitness-oriented upgrade to the company\u2019s Wear OS variant. It will offer better sleep insights and coaching, and runners can use personal heart rate zones to optimize their sessions. An improved SOS feature will directly contact an emergency number to share your whereabouts.</p><p>While there\u2019s no word on prices or release windows for the Galaxy Watch 6, it won\u2019t be surprising if the lineup starts close to the Watch 4\u2019s $279 for the base model, scaling up to $450 for the Classic or Pro.</p><h2>Galaxy Tab S9</h2><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ render\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/c48c7e20-2668-11ee-bf8b-6f5c9d5b7fe5\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">OnLeaks/WolfOfTablet</div></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-8-review-in-a-class-of-its-own-132946024.html\">Galaxy Tab S8 series</a> is almost a year and a half old, so it\u2019s not surprising Samsung is hinting at a replacement \u2014 though it may be evolutionary. OnLeaks and <em>WolfOfTablet</em> have <a href=\"https://wolfoftablet.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-leak-renders-reveal/\">shared renders</a> and specs suggesting the upcoming Galaxy Tab S9 range will look much like its predecessor, complete with 11-inch base, 12.4-inch S9+ and 14.6-inch S9 Ultra variants.</p><p>There should be some functional improvements, though. The standard Galaxy Tab S9 will reportedly switch from an LCD to an AMOLED screen, so you won\u2019t need to buy the S9+ to get the best possible picture quality. A Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will aid performance, and <em>Wolf of Tablet</em> believes a mystery secondary front sensor might be a camera intended for video calls in landscape orientation. <em>SamMobile</em> also <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ip67-water-resistance/\">believes</a> the new tablets will offer IP67 dust and water resistance that helps them survive camping trips and the beach.</p><p>It won\u2019t be surprising if the Galaxy Tab S9 family ships around the same time as the foldables, or maybe sometime mid-August. We\u2019d also expect pricing roughly in line with the Tab S8. That would put the regular S9 at $700, the S9+ at $900 and S9 Ultra at $1,100. With that in mind, the S8 series cost $50 more than its S7 equivalents. We can\u2019t rule out another price hike.</p><h2>Wildcards: Mixed reality hardware and the Galaxy Tab S8 FE</h2><figure><img alt=\"TM Roh, President and Head of Mobile eXperience Business at Samsung Electronics, Cristiano Amon, President &amp; CEO Qualcomm Incorporated, and Hiroshi Lockheimer, SVP, Platforms &amp; Ecosystems at Google, stand on stage as Samsung Electronics unveils its latest flagship smartphones in San Francisco, California, U.S. February 1, 2023.

Most notably, Samsung said in February that it was working on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html\">mixed reality wearable devices</a> with the help of Google (for an optimized Android release) and Qualcomm (for the chipset). There haven\u2019t been any signs of an impending introduction, but we wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Samsung said more about the project.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 might not be the only tablet, for that matter. Rumors have long persisted of a Galaxy Tab S8 FE that, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-release-date-140020033.html\">the S7 FE</a>, will bridge the gap between Samsung\u2019s budget A-series tablets and the S9.There aren\u2019t many details, but <em>WinFuture</em>\u2019s Roland Quandt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1594686319061766144\">hears</a> the S8 FE may use an LCD with a Wacom digitizer for pen input. A lower-end chip and other compromises wouldn\u2019t be surprising, either.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/summer-samsung-unpacked-2023-what-to-expect-on-july-26th-150001571.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/summer-samsung-unpacked-2023-what-to-expect-on-july-26th-150001571.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-20T15:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best multi-device wireless chargers for 2023", "description": "<p>There\u2019s a good chance you have enough devices with wireless charging support that a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html\">single-device pad</a> or stand just won\u2019t cut it. However, buying a multiple-item wireless charger can be a headache. You not only have to contend with varying levels of support, but different designs as well \u2014 the last thing you want is something that won\u2019t fit on your nightstand. While this space can be confusing, there are plenty of options out there that are worth your money. We\u2019ll walk you through what you need to know while shopping for a multi-device wireless charging station, and recommend a few models that belong on your short list.</p><h2>Future-proofing</h2><p>It won\u2019t be shocking to hear that your smartphone choice influences your choice in a wireless charger. Only iPhone owners will need to consider <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html\">Apple Watch</a> compatibility. Likewise, you\u2019ll need an Android phone if you expect to power a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html\">Galaxy Watch</a>. Buy an iPhone 12 or newer and you can attach your phone magnetically using MagSafe, while the latest Android phones often have some form of fast wireless charging.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, it\u2019s not simply a question of getting the fastest charger. You should consider what you might buy in the future. Don\u2019t buy a two-device charger if you have an iPhone and AirPods, but have been eyeing an Apple Watch. And if you think you might switch to an Android cell phone (or vice versa), you\u2019ll want to get something more generic that doesn\u2019t lock you into any one ecosystem.</p><p>Some chargers include cradles, trays and other features that are heavily optimized for particular products, and might not even account for year-to-year changes. Some vertical stands are too tall for small phones like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html\">iPhone 13 mini</a>, for instance. While you can never completely guarantee that next year\u2019s phone or watch will work, it\u2019s worth buying something more likely to last.</p><p>Having said all this, don\u2019t be afraid to get a charger with vendor-specific features if you\u2019re fiercely loyal to one brand. Apple isn\u2019t expected to ditch MagSafe any time soon, and Samsung will likely keep making Galaxy Watches for a while to come.</p><h2>Where and how will you use it?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Multi-device wireless charger with Android phone and Samsung earbuds\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/b2b575e0-c7fe-11ec-8ee7-4c395c0c840d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sebastian Bednarek on Unsplash</div></figure><h2></h2><p>You\u2019re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.</p><p>If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you\u2019ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won\u2019t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor. You may also prefer a lay-flat phone pad so your screen is less likely to keep you awake. The Apple Watch and some other smartwatches can double as tiny alarm clocks, so you might want a vertical charging option for any wristwear.</p><p>At a desk, however, you may want a vertical phone stand so you can check notifications. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they\u2019re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it\u2019s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.</p><p>If it\u2019s a shared charging station, you\u2019ll want something with multiple generic surfaces, and you\u2019ll probably have to forgo charging more than one watch at a time. In those cases, consider the handful of 4-in-1 wireless chargers on the market, or models with USB ports.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>It\u2019s no secret that wireless charging is typically slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you\u2019ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.</p><p>That\u2019s not to say these will be slow, but there just isn\u2019t much separating them on the charging speed front. As a general rule, the quickest multi-device chargers tend to top out at 15W for phones. And you\u2019ll need an Apple MagSafe charger if you want to get that full 15W on an iPhone.</p><p>It\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll find a truly slow example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we\u2019ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices is more than enough. If you\u2019re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won\u2019t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. It\u2019s also worth noting that fast charging for other devices is rare, although you\u2019ll occasionally find speedier options for the Apple Watch Series 7.</p><h2>Quality, box contents and small details</h2><figure><img alt=\"Multi-device wireless charger with iPhone and Apple Watch\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/225b4f00-c7ff-11ec-935f-08adfbebb3e6\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Melvin Thambi on Unsplash</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The difference between a good charger and a great one often boils down to little details. You won\u2019t always need to pay extra to get those, but a larger outlay may be worthwhile to avoid frustrations for years to come.</p><p>A textured surface like rubberized plastic or fabric will reduce the chances your expensive gadgets will slide off their charging points. The base should have enough grip and weight that the charger won\u2019t easily shift out of place. Any floating or vertical stands should be sturdy \u2014 steer clear if there\u2019s any wobble.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to make a note of what\u2019s included in the box. Some chargers don\u2019t ship with power adapters, and we've seen numerous models whose Apple Watch \u201cstands\u201d are merely holders for your existing charging puck.</p><p>Then there\u2019s helpful touches like status lights for confirming correct placement, although you\u2019ll want to make sure they dim or shut off after a certain amount of time. And while it\u2019s still true that cradles and trays can limit compatibility, you do want your devices to stay where you put them. Shelves and lips can prevent your phone or watch from sliding.

The base is weighty, covered in rubberized plastic and includes a discreet status light for your earbuds. More importantly, it supports more devices than you might think. Although the Pro pad uses MagSafe, the horizontal layout lets you charge virtually any phone at reduced speeds. We also have to give Belkin kudos for one of the most convenient Apple Watch chargers we\u2019ve seen. It not only works horizontally and vertically, but includes a knob to adjust for different sizes and third-party cases.</p><p>This is quite large compared to some 3-in-1 chargers, so it\u2019s not the greatest choice for a nightstand.

You also won\u2019t find USB ports, and the indented earbud pad rules out a second phone.

It consumes relatively little space, and the rubberized horizontal and vertical chargers deliver up to 10W while gripping your devices tightly, so both you and your partner can top off.</p><p>It has a few limitations, though. The vertical stand isn\u2019t well-suited to the iPhone 13 mini and other small phones. And while the floating stand works with most Apple Watches, heavier ones tend to sag (such as this author\u2019s steel Series 5 with a Leather Link strap) and might not charge properly. If those aren\u2019t issues, though, your $130 will be well-spent.</p><h2>Best budget 3-in-1 charger: Anker 533 Wireless Charger</h2><p></p><p>You can find plenty of more affordable 3-in-1 chargers.

It offers an adjustable-angle 10W vertical stand and lets you charge an Apple Watch either horizontally or vertically. There\u2019s also a 20W USB-C power adapter in the box, so you won\u2019t have to buy an aftermarket brick (or rely on proprietary cabling) to get started.</p><p>The limitations mostly stem from the cost-cutting measures. You probably won\u2019t have room for a second phone. And like some chargers we\u2019ve seen, the Apple Watch mount is a bring-your-own-cable affair that only supports older USB-A connections. The included cable with your Series 8 or SE won\u2019t work here. At $58, though, this 3-in-1 wireless charging stand is a good bargain.</p><h2>Another good option: Otterbox 3-in-1 Charging Station for MagSafe</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019re willing to spend a bit more and live in Apple\u2019s universe, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL21hZ3NhZmUtMy1pbi0xLWNoYXJnaW5nLXN0YXRpb24tZm9yLW1hZ3NhZmUtd2hpdGUvNzgtODA1MzMuaHRtbD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjkyYWZjY2FkLTdhNmQtNGIzZS1iNzAxLTkxYzYzMDFmZDUyZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQjUDI0L2a6vakib3dS2kcEE9vbXDY4njaTrkAUE9uev&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fmagsafe-3-in-1-charging-station-for-magsafe-white%2F78-80533.html%3F\">Otterbox 3-in-1 Charging Station for MagSafe</a> is worth your attention. The extremely small footprint of this wireless charger is ideal for nightstands. You can tuck a trio of your phone, earbuds and Apple Watch into an area normally reserved for a single device. The company supplies a surprisingly powerful 36W USB-C power adapter in the box that serves as a fast wired option in a pinch.</p><p>The caveats are clear. The floating MagSafe stand rules out Android phones and older iPhones. You\u2019ll need to bring your own Apple Watch cable, and the USB-A port won\u2019t work with the USB-C cables bundled with newer watches. The horizontal-only watch mount also rules out clock functionality. The overall balance of space and utility is still difficult to top for $80.</p><h2>Best 2-in-1 charger: Mophie Dual Wireless Charging Pad</h2><p></p><p>The 2-in-1 field is highly competitive and makes it difficult to choose an absolute winner.

It can charge two devices at up to 10W each, making it a great pick for a two-phone household. The fabric surface with rubberized trim should keep your gadgets steady, and the status lights will confirm accurate placement. There\u2019s even a USB-A port to plug in your watch charger or any other wired hardware.</p><p>The complaints are few. You won\u2019t charge at 15W, and we\u2019d rather have USB-C than USB-A. It\u2019s nonetheless a safe choice at $80, and worth buying over less expensive options.</p><h2>Runner-up 2-in-1: Samsung Super Fast Wireless Charger Duo</h2><p></p><p>Multi-device chargers from phone manufacturers tend to be either compromised or highly proprietary, but <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYW1zdW5nLVdpcmVsZXNzLVVuaXZlcnNhbGx5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUtSW5jbHVkZWQvZHAvQjA5TVYzQlJIQz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1vNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTJhZmNjYWQtN2E2ZC00YjNlLWI3MDEtOTFjNjMwMWZkNTJmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdp0xhzFkGRaXjZnx_06GxSuHP-iXe7fZfM_69pEIgpT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSamsung-Wireless-Universally-Compatible-Included%2Fdp%2FB09MV3BRHC\">Samsung\u2019s Super Fast Wireless Charger Duo</a> (sometimes known as the 15W Duo Fast Wireless Charger) bucks that trend. It\u2019s compact and delivers high-speed charging for one phone and an accessory, whether it\u2019s a Samsung Galaxy Watch or another manufacturer\u2019s earbuds. The status lights will even dim at night, and change color to indicate when your batteries are full.</p><p>This won\u2019t help for two-phone households, and Samsung only guarantees 15W charging for some of its own phones (the Galaxy Note 10, Galaxy S20 and later). You\u2019ll also want to be mindful of which version you buy, as there are variants with and without a power adapter in the box. Neither is cheap at respective prices of $90 and $70. This remains an elegant charger for nightstands and travel, though, and the pads are sufficiently device-agnostic.</p><h2>Best charger for two people: Mophie 4-in-1 Wireless Charging Mat</h2><p></p><p>There are few wireless chargers built with more than one person in mind, but <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XaXJlbGVzcy1DaGFyZ2luZy1tYXQtd2lyZWxlc3NseS1BZGRpdGlvbmFsL2RwL0IwOExLR1FMUkM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbzQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjkyYWZjY2FkLTdhNmQtNGIzZS1iNzAxLTkxYzYzMDFmZDUyZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5e7GevxI0uXArUjmoMYikNnbxzdKC1iijnNp-ORzaU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWireless-Charging-mat-wirelessly-Additional%2Fdp%2FB08LKGQLRC\">Mophie\u2019s 4-in-1 Wireless Charging Mat</a> is the most well-rounded of the bunch. The pad can handle up to four devices wirelessly at 10W, including two phones and two accessories. There\u2019s also a spare USB-A port for charging earlier Apple Watch models (using the included mount and your own cable) or wired items. A fabric surface, subtle device trays and indicator lights will also take the mysteries out of charging.</p><p>This is a giant charger compared to most, and you might find it limiting if your home has more than one Apple Watch or accessories that won\u2019t fit the smaller charging pads. Even so, Mophie is offering considerable value for $150. The 4-in-1 does more than some 3-in-1  chargers at that price, and it doesn\u2019t suffer the compatibility issues of rivals like Nomad\u2019s Base Station Pro.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-20T14:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon is bringing its palm-based payments to all Whole Foods Market stores", "description": "<p>You won't have much trouble <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-contactless-payments-come-to-a-whole-foods-store-in-seattle-084516381.html\">paying with your palm</a> at the grocery store in the near future.

It gave me one hell of a concussion, a smashed-up face and a fair amount of memory loss, including everything about the incident itself. Four weeks later, I\u2019m still struggling, and while I\u2019m feeling a little better every day, it\u2019s a slow process to recovery.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It\u2019s appropriate, then, that this week\u2019s <em>Strange New Worlds</em> touches on that relationship with our memories. The episode asks if memory is tied to empathy and if we can only sympathize with others if <em>their</em> pain calls to <em>our own</em>. I might not be entirely lucid all of the time right now but it certainly does feel like the smartest episode of Star Trek I\u2019ve seen in a while.</p><p>Enterprise and the Farragut are headed to a new facility that\u2019s behind schedule, a deuterium extraction base. Starfleet has built the enormous \u201cgas station\u201d inside a nebula on the edge of Gorn space to help fuel a new age of space exploration. And, you know, be a nice strategic location for the already well-telegraphed war with the Gorn that\u2019s coming at some point soon.</p><p>Uhura, who has been more involved with this mission than others, is feeling the strain of all the work. She\u2019s having difficulty sleeping, and has been watching videos that Hemmer recorded for her to teach her how to do basic engineering work. At the nebula, she starts hearing the Transformers noise, and experiences flashbacks to the accident that killed her family.</p><p>Rather than keep these problems to herself, Uhura wisely goes to Dr. M\u2019Benga for help, but he prescribes rest. The crew believes she\u2019s suffering from deuterium exposure as hallucinations are a common side-effect. But the visions get worse, and she starts seeing Zombie Hemmer \u2013 a welcome, if brief return for the much-missed Bruce Horak.</p><p>The gas station should have been active a while ago, so Pike sends over Una to crack the whip and Pelia to lend her expertise. There\u2019s tension between the pair, Una acting like the sort of hard charging CEO who ignores Pelia\u2019s soon-proved-right opinion. One of the station\u2019s crew has been sabotaging things, and is seeing the same traumatic visions as Uhura.</p><p>As much as the crew is sympathetic to the pair\u2019s plight, they still feel the cause is deuterium poisoning. The only person willing to explore another option is \u201c<em>and special guest star Paul Wesley as James T. Kirk</em>.\u201d He\u2019s over from the Farragut for, uh, reasons, but quickly forms a bond with Uhura, trusting her instincts that something strange is going on.</p><p>ASIDE: Those reasons being that Anson Mount was on paternity leave for a chunk of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>\u2019 second season. The crew gave him a greatly-reduced workload, and you\u2019ll notice how little Pike has been present in many episodes. Much as Mount is the show\u2019s star, and a wonderful presence, his reduced visibility here has been a boon for the series overall. More of the ensemble has been given more time in the spotlight, and while the limited episode order hampers some of this broadening out, it\u2019s great to see a more democratic vision of the show.</p><p>There\u2019s a touching scene, too, where La\u2019an and Kirk talk about their divergent childhoods, and the absence of parents. George Kirk (still alive in this universe) was missing from much of Jim\u2019s childhood, roaming the universe to save others; La\u2019an, meanwhile, was one of those people saved. It\u2019s a little, elegant reminder of why Starfleet exists, and why so many people in Trek\u2019s fictional world sign up to its mission.</p><p>The rogue station crewmember breaks out of sickbay, shuts off the lights and looks to sabotage the Enterprise in the only underwhelming moment in the whole episode. It almost felt like a studio note to break up the pace of the episode with an \u201caction\u201d sequence, albeit one that can be shot on standing sets. The team stumbles around in the darkness of the Enterprise corridors for a bit, before Kirk saves Uhura from an explosion.</p><p>After much unraveling, it transpires that the gas station is built on the home of extra-dimensional aliens lurking within the deuterium. Their only way to communicate is to find sympathetic brains and provoke memories of grief, of loss, to try and explain their predicament. Both the station and the starships are pulling in deuterium for fuel, mincing up countless alien lifeforms for power.</p><p>Uhura and Kirk go to Pike, who wastes no time in torching the station rather than allowing any more pointless deaths. Uhura can sleep well again, and even Zombie Hemmer has been turned back into Regular Hemmer, smiling in approval. There\u2019s just time for Jim to meet Spock for the first time before we pan out to the credits.</p><p>At the risk of sounding like Bill Hader\u2019s impression of Alan Alda, \u201cLost in Translation\u201d is full of great writing. The screenplay, credited to Onitra Johnson and David Reed, is smarter and subtler than some recent Trek episodes I could mention. While some <em>Strange New Worlds</em>\u2019 episodes can sometimes leap to unintended conclusions while exploring a Big Idea, it works perfectly here. And I must say that it\u2019s a wonderful sight to see Pike choose to torch the station because it\u2019s very clearly the right thing to do. Much as we may miss the debating-hall sequences of golden-age Trek, isn\u2019t it nice to just see people do the thing that aligns with their values rather than spending 35 minutes talking about it beforehand?</p><p>This is an exploration of empathy, and how some people get it, and the help that comes with it, while others are left to suffer in ignomy. It speaks to a sense that we\u2019re missing a general sense of empathy in public life, as a number of figures strive to out-do each other in their brutality. Is memory, then, the key to mercy? Are those who were brought up in perpetual comfort less able to feel pity?

Rather than amping up the nostalgia bait, the show is instead exploring how memory informs and shapes our society. The one downside of \u201cAmong The Lotus Eaters\u201d was that one episode simply couldn\u2019t contain a deeper exploration of its perpetually-amnesiac society.</p><p>So, yeah, I\u2019m a fan.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-empathy-in-memory-130048301.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-empathy-in-memory-130048301.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-20T13:00:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best finance and security apps for college students", "description": "<p>You may be more or less prepared for the academics of college, but the other life stuff can be an eye-opener. College might be the first time you\u2019re in charge of your own finances, and with new living situations, new jobs and new connections, you may also be expanding the amount of personal data you\u2019re putting out into the world. If you could use a little help with budgeting, remembering passwords or making sure everything you do online is secure, here are the finance and security apps we\u2019ve used, tested and ultimately recommend.</p><h2>Mint</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019re new to tracking finances, getting an overview of your banking, credit and loan accounts in one place can be helpful. <a href=\"https://mint.intuit.com/\">Mint</a> is a simple and free app that does just that. I tested it for our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html\">subscription guide</a> and continue to use it. The interface is intuitive and it\u2019s <em>pretty</em> good at correctly categorizing purchases. The main features, like transaction history, self-budgeting and goal-setting, are available free. For $5 per month, you can have Mint cancel subscriptions on your behalf and you won\u2019t see as many ad links peppered throughout the app (though, I\u2019ve never found the ads particularly distracting.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>YNAB</h2><p></p><p>For help creating a more formal budget, a few Engadget staffers use <a href=\"https://www.ynab.com/college/\">YNAB</a> (You Need A Budget) and we recommend it in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-26-how-to-track-personal-finances-students-2019.html\">student budgeting</a>. It\u2019s based around a theory that imposes four \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ynab.com/the-four-rules/\">rules</a>\u201d to improve your money management, and learning those principles now will benefit you long after graduation. The browser and mobile app interfaces are pretty easy to use, and YNAB has <a href=\"https://www.ynab.com/browse-by-topic/\">a ton of instructional content</a> for newbies that can point you in the right direction when you\u2019re first setting up expense categories, debt trackers and sinking funds. It\u2019s usually $15 per month or $99 per year, but students who can prove they\u2019re in school can get a year for free.</p><h2>Goodbudget</h2><p></p><p>Between loans, jobs and, if you\u2019re lucky, scholarships and financial aid, a student\u2019s \u201cextra\u201d money can be pretty limited. <a href=\"https://goodbudget.com/\">Goodbudget</a> translates the envelope technique to an app format, earmarking your money for the things you need to pay for. By visualizing what you have and what you need, you can see when there\u2019s room for stuff you want, like going out with friends or decorating your first apartment. Plenty of graphs and sliders help map out your situation, and Goodbudget also offers free online <a href=\"https://goodbudget.com/the-goodbudget-way/courses/101/\">classes</a> for those who want to get better with money (granted, that may be a hard sell when you\u2019re already in school). The free version gives you twenty total envelopes, split between expenses and goals, and lets you add one bank account. For unlimited accounts and envelopes, the paid version is $8 per month or $70 per year.</p><h2>Acorns investment</h2><p></p><p>Say you indulge in an Iced Toasted Vanilla Oatmilk Shaken Espresso for $5.75.

By providing a simple app and recommending just a few different portfolios, Acorns takes some of the complexity out of investing. For students in particular, it\u2019s also easier to invest a few cents here and there than larger chunks of cash when you\u2019re already just trying to get by. The monthly plan defaults to $5 per month with an option of a $3 plan at sign up. Both come with a checking and a retirement savings account in addition to the investment features, so if you\u2019re totally starting fresh, this could prove useful.</p><h2>1Password</h2><p></p><p>Our senior security reporter, Katie Malone, put <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=29d07367-7ffa-4e05-9a7f-c1dd19430630&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=1Password&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyOWQwNzM2Ny03ZmZhLTRlMDUtOWE3Zi1jMWRkMTk0MzA2MzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly8xcGFzc3dvcmQuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzg2NmZhMmQtMGI1Mi00MDhjLWFmMzctZTdlNTA2YzA3NzI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVhq6mju1CZ0QWpGn_XzwM-3jiYFEYX5yIwAVxSZFT5e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2F1password.com%2F\">1Password</a> at the top of Engadget\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html\">guide</a> to password managers. Like all services like this, 1Password one helps you create unique and complex credentials for every site you use, and then saves them securely so you don\u2019t have to remember them all. It works across most platforms and even lets you share logins and credit card info with other people as needed, which will make it easier to access any family accounts you may need while in school. The security and encryption measures are top-notch, with a zero-knowledge policy that ensures the company doesn\u2019t store your data, as well as a <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/increasing-our-bug-bounty-investment/\">bug bounty</a> program that rewards ethical hackers who discover any vulnerabilities.</p><h2>Proton VPN</h2><p></p><p>If you study in public places where the WiFi is suspect, a VPN can give you an extra layer of protection. It\u2019s not a cure-all for online security woes, but VPNs do create a protected \u201ctunnel\u201d to keep out people who may otherwise have access to your data, like your internet service provider or hackers targeting public WiFi. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmEyMDY5Ny00MTM1LTRlODMtYTQyMS1mMzI2ZWVlOTM3ZWQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wcm90b252cG4uY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzg2NmZhMmQtMGI1Mi00MDhjLWFmMzctZTdlNTA2YzA3NzI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAARSZ-5IaYjeaeYDBoMpTOir4oG4h6EWY4kSw0zZ9m8Ou&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2F\">Proton VPN</a> is the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best overall option</a> not just because it\u2019s easy to use. The Switzerland-based company also enforces a no-log policy and their open-source software continually stands up to independent audits. Unlike some VPNs, it didn\u2019t tank our connection speeds in our tests, either. Proton goes for $10 per month to access servers in 65 countries, or you can get the free version with access to just three.</p><h2>ProtonMail</h2><p></p><p>Free email services are everywhere, but finding one that isn\u2019t propped up by selling your habits and history to advertisers is almost impossible. And while you might get a school email address, a good personal email will serve you long after access to your alumni mail is discontinued. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9tYWlsIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjODY2ZmEyZC0wYjUyLTQwOGMtYWYzNy1lN2U1MDZjMDc3MjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf8tcX5usDVkyfXR1fojC_0SLGmXLRnIdwB3snHR5pRW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fproton.me%2Fmail\">ProtonMail</a> is focused on privacy: It uses end-to-end encryption, whereas a service like Gmail encrypts messages in transit only. Proton\u2019s open-source encryption methods are independently audited, and since the service is supported by paid subscriptions and not advertising, the company has little incentive to snoop your info. Free plans give you one gigabyte of storage and allow for 150 emails per day, while a $12-per-month subscription grants 500GB of storage and removes email limits.</p><h2>Signal</h2><p></p><p>As a non-profit, there's no tech giant behind the wheel at <a href=\"https://signal.org/en/\">Signal</a>, which sets it apart from most other messaging services. A phone number is required for set up, but that\u2019s about all the information Signal ever collects. It\u2019s a favorite of journalists, protestors and people living in unstable territories, but students who realize their communications are no one else\u2019s business will find the app useful, too. Texts, videos and images you send are end-to-end encrypted using open-source protocols, and you can even set messages to expire. Recent additions that enhance <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/signal-stories-messaging-162037970.html\">group chats</a> may make Signal feel a little more like other messaging apps, but the core structure of the service will always be fundamentally more private than many competitors.</p><h2>Noonlight</h2><p></p><p>Staying safe in college extends beyond online safety, which is where apps like <a href=\"https://www.noonlight.com/noonlight-app\">Noonlight</a> come in. Tinder <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-tinder-panic-button-dangerous-situations.html\">bought a stake</a> in the app a few years ago to help people in the event of a date gone wrong. Within the app, you\u2019ll find a giant white button that you press and hold in sketchy situations. As long as you hold the button, nothing happens. Let go of it, and unless you enter a secret pin to prove you\u2019re safe, the police will be dispatched to your location. A timeline feature lets you add names and images when you\u2019re meeting someone new. The safety network allows your friends and family to request check-ins and take action when they don\u2019t hear from you. The free version includes all three of the features mentioned above, while the $5-per-month plan adds an iPhone widget and the ability to sync with rideshare apps.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-finance-and-security-apps-for-college-students-130035602.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-finance-and-security-apps-for-college-students-130035602.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-20T13:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best Apple AirTag accessories you can buy", "description": "<p>Apple lovers who constantly lose their keys got a new way to keep track of them with the launch of AirTags.

If you already bought an AirTag or two, you probably know where you want to put it \u2013 and that placement will dictate the type of case you should get for it.

It has a very similar design to the first-party accessory (albeit made with pleather) , but it comes in much cheaper at only $8. Your AirTag nestles into the perfectly-shaped leather circle and snaps shut, and since the leather extends slightly over both sides of the tracker, there\u2019s very little chance it will pop out unexpectedly. I also appreciate that it comes with a carabiner-style key ring, which makes it easier to secure to your belongings.</p><h2>Orbitkey Leather Holder</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVNLQlpCODMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFmNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWVhMTI1MGYtZmJjMy00OTM2LTkxYjAtZTkxYjQ2ZTQ0YWZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWj1M0WoCpqeJPCU91SVlXvJIknwhMsKIMVJ8nZGU371&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09SKBZB83%2F\">Orbitkey\u2019s Leather Holder for AirTag</a> is a more elegant version of Apple\u2019s accessory. It\u2019s a genuine leather sleeve that opens just wide enough for you to slide your AirTag into its pocket. Attached to it is a quick-release ring that takes some getting used to, but once you know how to open it up, it\u2019s easy to secure onto your keys. You essentially just have to push in one direction on the holder\u2019s ring to unlock it, which then allows you to secure the AirTag to a lanyard, your car keys and the like. It\u2019s a good option if you prefer that your accessories have a more polished look.</p><h2>Caseology Vault</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODlETjRLVkcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFmNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWVhMTI1MGYtZmJjMy00OTM2LTkxYjAtZTkxYjQ2ZTQ0YWZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdd827npbKuam3NDEtS5CkJPcT1qqwvQL18TohHyRuOQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB089DN4KVG%2F\">Caseology\u2019s Vault</a> has a more utilitarian design, made with tough, textured TPU. The oval-shaped holder has an opening on one side into which you pop your AirTag. The other side has a smaller opening that attaches to the included carabiner, which is one of the best clips I came across in my testing. It\u2019s pretty basic as far as carabiners go, but it\u2019s better than a standard key ring \u2014 especially if you want to easily attach your AirTag to something other than your keys like straps on a backpack, or even a pet collar. Overall, the Caseology Vault is one of the most attractive holders I tested and it will be a solid choice for anyone who doesn\u2019t need leather.</p><h2>Incase Woolenex AirTag Key Clip</h2><p></p><p>Incase's <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3a117c79-7d78-4cae-ba98-f2988eb3b2b2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Incase&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzYTExN2M3OS03ZDc4LTRjYWUtYmE5OC1mMjk4OGViM2IyYjIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmNhc2UuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3dvb2xlbmV4LWtleS1jbGlwLWZvci1haXJ0YWc_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZWExMjUwZi1mYmMzLTQ5MzYtOTFiMC1lOTFiNDZlNDRhZmIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfy5y5OaXGsJhCR_9QRpDnKCZnC5qvZPHmlOmJ9Pb5VE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fincase.com%2Fproducts%2Fwoolenex-key-clip-for-airtag%3F\">Woolenex AirTag holder</a> is one that is just as attractive as it is durable. The company's Woolenex fabric is made of a woven blend of polyester fibers that make the accessory lightweight, water repellant and fade- and tear-resistant. Incase makes a bunch of accessories out of this material, and those who like premium fabrics that can also handle a bit of wear-and-tear will gravitate to it. The holder has a TPU snap closure and circular cutout so it won't interrupt the AirTag's signal \u2014 plus, it lets you see any cute engraving you may have on your tracker.</p><h2>Belkin Secure Holder with Strap</h2><p></p><p>AirTags can also help you keep track of larger bags and luggage, and you could easily slip one into an interior pocket and call it a day. But if you\u2019d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you\u2019ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTMzNERaUEwvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFmNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWVhMTI1MGYtZmJjMy00OTM2LTkxYjAtZTkxYjQ2ZTQ0YWZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf2A6ndT_DCk7BMb2z-xk14ptNv0VsNmhvIddo2Gl49v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09334DZPL%2F\">Belkin\u2019s Secure Holder with Strap</a> is a good option, and it\u2019s budget friendly at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, water bottle or other item with the strap, which feels quite strong.</p><p>I appreciate the unique design of Belkin\u2019s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that\u2019s a good thing for daily use; your AirTag isn\u2019t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder.

From there, he changed the course of his career and chose to become a White Hat hacker and cybersecurity consultant. In 2011, he became part owner and chief hacking officer of KnowBe4, which provides security awareness training and a simulated phishing platform to clients. Before all these happened, Mitnick figured out how to game LA's public transportation system at 12 years old by memorizing bus schedules and punch cards and then obtaining his own punch tool systems so he could ride buses all day. Mitnick is survived by his wife, Kimberley Mitnick, and their unborn child.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kevin-mitnick-formerly-the-worlds-most-wanted-hacker-has-passed-away-084912966.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/kevin-mitnick-formerly-the-worlds-most-wanted-hacker-has-passed-away-084912966.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-20T08:49:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google is reportedly testing an AI tool that can generate news articles", "description": "<p>Google is testing a new AI technology codenamed &quot;Genesis&quot; that can generate news articles, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/google-artificial-intelligence-news-articles.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. The tech giant has reportedly demonstrated the tool not just for <em>The Times</em>, but also for executives at <em>The Washington Post </em>and News Corp, which owns <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Based on reports from people who witnessed the pitch, Genesis can whip up copy from the data fed to it, whether it's current events or other types of information. Apparently, Google believes journalists could use it as some sort of an assistant to automate tasks and free them up for other things.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the people who saw the demonstration described it as &quot;unsettling.&quot; They also said that it seemed to disregard the kind of work that goes into writing accurate, digestible pieces. Jeff Jarvis, a journalist professor at the City University of New York, told <em>The Times</em> that journalists should use the tool &quot;[i]f this technology can deliver factual information reliably.&quot; Since Google has yet to launch Genesis, we can't say if it actually can, or if it could easily lead to the dissemination of misinformation. As <em>The Times </em>notes, Google has been moving quickly to deploy AI technology in an effort to catch up with the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI. Its generative AI tech, Bard, was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html\">caught spouting misinformation</a> as soon as it debuted on Twitter.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Recent attempts by some publications to use AI tools hadn't ended up well. <em>CNET</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html\">had to issue corrections</a> after being made aware of substantial errors in most of 77 machine-written articles it published under the CNET Money byline.
