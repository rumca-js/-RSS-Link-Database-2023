I live in a highly competitive sports town where my niece is the star pitcher. Believe me when I say I understand sometimes your emotion gets the better of you. And anyone who has ever sat in little league stands knows they can do the job better than the umpire. However, if you find yourself so angry at "Blue" that you are going to charge the mound, you might want to stretch first. Someone's dad found out the hard way when he collapsed after pulling his ACL, MCL, AEW, FJB, and every other ligament in his knee.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>I don't mean to be laughing hysterically as I write each word after watching this video seventeen times. But also, in my defense, I'm not a good person. Plus the fact the guy had to sit all the way up top leads me to believe he's been spoken to about this and is "that" dad. One embarrassing outburst too many and you get sent to the Bob Ueker seats.</p><p>That's an oldhead reference, youngbloods. Google it.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Aaaaaaaaand down he goes. Suddenly, he can't remember if it was a ball or a strike. Or a fowl. Or if the runner was safe. Or where he is right now.

<p>The main lesson I want you to come away with is don't be this parent. I can guarantee you that every other parent is on the group text making fun of him and hoping he doesn't show up for 4-6 weeks. I can guarantee you that because I'm the guy who keeps sending .gifs of people falling down with emojis. As I said... I'm not a good person.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Ana Navarro admits Ron DeSantis has so broken her brain, he makes her act like a dog

<p>I get that "The View" is the Most Trusted Name in Derp for Low-Information Suburbanites, but I'm still shocked they are trying to make "Don't Say Gay" happen. If the polls showing that Floridians in every demographic supported the "Parental Rights in Information Act," <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-dave-rubin" target="_blank">gay influencer Dave Rubin screamed "GAY" right in DeSantis's face</a>. No arrests were made.</p><p>Everyone else has moved on to a noun and a verb and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gavin-newsom-banned-book-store" target="_blank">BOOK BANNINGGGGGGGG</a>! Or as Ana's colleague calls it, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/the-view-book-banning" target="_blank">a literal paper genocide</a>.</p><p>It is remarkable that someone who works in media would have such little idea how the internet works. Navarro meant this as a joke. This is a woman who lashed out at DeSantis because he thinks it's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ana-navarro-rants-ron-desantis" target="_blank">wrong for half-naked men to dance with little children</a>. It wouldn't surprise me if she did stick her head out of the window and barks at humans. Not to mention drink out of the toilet, eat out of the kitchen garbage, and dig a hole into the carpet.</p><p>There was still sarcasm in her voice and she got a tepid chuckle from the studio audience... while video of her claiming Ron DeSantis turns her into a canine remained on the internet for our mockery and amusement. The purest of self owns.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

	If I ask you to name the most powerful companies in the world, some names probably spring to mind. Pfizer, Black Rock, Berkshire Hathaway or even the Umbrella Corporation. Now what if I were to tell you that there’s another company just as powerful, large and even more nefarious. One with which my very own team was lucky enough to spend a little… personal time.
</p><p>
	Enter… McKinsey & Company.
</p><p>
<span></span>Who are they and what do they do? The fact that most of us have to ask that question, means that we are behind the eight ball, in understanding the MASSIVELY destructive impact that McKinsey and Company has inflicted upon the American people.

<p>What grabs me most about this is when the father mentioned they've been seeing a pediatrician for as long as their kids have been alive. That means for some reason, there was a policy change at this "doctor's'" office. Either someone in the DOCTOR'S office made the conscious decision to ignore science and biology if this is a private practice. Or if this is within the New York medical network, the words "New" and "York" tell you all you need to know. </p><p>Either way, if your doctor does not know if your son is a boy, you need to find one who believes in science and basic biology.,</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Beach Boys legend issues "warning" before singing gender-specific hit... in case the FBI or Bud Light was there

Shout out to Beach Boys founder Mike Love who is still on the road performing in his 70s. The singer took time out of a recent show to opine on current news and cultural events, before singing the classic "Surfer Girl." It was a return to the "girls and cars" period in pop music. Before globalists started to have cars outlawed, and the surfer girl came in second place behind the surfer used to be a boy.</p><p>It's unclear where or when this clip is from.

<p>This one <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTaijiNews/status/1678247281022365697" target="_blank">is in response to a tweet</a> from the one-hit wonder 90s band Eve 6. They are trying to reinvent themselves as progressive edgelords. Their tweet has been deleted. I'm guessing when it comes to who is more relevant -- a founder of the beach boys or the band that sang "Inside to the Night" -- the band began to feel inadequate.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>"Surfer Girl" was released in 1963, and was the first song another Beach Boys founder, Brian Wilson, ever wrote. Then Wilson started to go insane and brother Dennis Wilson got involved with Charles Manson. Love remained all about the chicks.</p><p>The song harkens back to the good ol' days.

The n-word was used. And when a reporter cried to UFC President Dana White about it -- or, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2023/07/ufc-290-las-vegas-video-israel-adesanya-vs-dricus-du-plessis-racially-charged-faceoff-south-africa-nigeria" target="_blank">when a reporter "reported" that randos on the internet were crying about it</a> -- White could not give less of a f*ck.</p><p>Here is the face-off in question. Middleweight champion Israel Adesanya and #1 contender Dricus Du Plessis. They are both African. Israel is the one dropping the soft-g.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This is the fight game. Not unlike the great <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ufc-colby-covington-tyson-woodley" target="_blank">MAGA vs Black Lives Matter fight</a>, the two fighters are using what they have available to them to <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/israel-adesanya/israel-adesanya-responds-to-backlash-over-dricus-du-plessis-confrontation-at-ufc-290-if-you-aint-my-brother-you-aint-african/" target="_blank">talk you into buying the PPV</a>. It is also not the first time a reporter <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ufc289-dana-white-speech" target="_blank">cried to Dana about fighters being mean when they talk about their opponents</a>. The sports executive with the most colorful vocabulary in the industry was not having it. ESPECIALLY after he found out it was losers chirping away on the internet.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote>I could care less. This is the fight business. Israel Adesanya can say whatever he wants to say. Who gives a sh*t? Why are people bitching about that? Too f*cking bad.</blockquote><p>And then when the use of the n-word came up, Dana pointed out to the reporter, in case he hadn't noticed, that Israel Adesanya is like, you know, black. The funny thing? This is not the first time <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/israel-adesanya-joe-rogan-ufc" target="_blank">the middleweight champion's skin color has come up in defense of using the n-word</a>.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>A date has not been set for Israel Adesanya vs. Dricus Du Plessis. The next event, UFC 291, features Dustin Poirier vs. Justin Gaethje. Though the more important card is UFC 292, featuring UFC Champion Aljamain Sterling and a returning Chris Weidman both putting on for Long Island.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
