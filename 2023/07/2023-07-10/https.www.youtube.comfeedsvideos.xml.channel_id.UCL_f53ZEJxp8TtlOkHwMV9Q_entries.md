Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Eric Edmeades discuss his early experiences with homelessness, the extent and detriment of alcoholism, the changes you can make to restructure your physiological responses, the relationship between trust and sales, and the world of possibility that opens when you embrace the unknown, the potentially dangerous, and above all that which calls to you. 

Eric Edmeades, a globally recognized keynote speaker, prolific entrepreneur, and recognized authority in health, practical psychology, and behavioral transformation, has made significant strides in the health and wellness industry. His revolutionary program, WILDFIT®, has positively transformed the lives of over a hundred thousand individuals across more than 130 countries, underscoring his innovative and impactful approach to health. Edmeades is in the process of releasing his forthcoming book, "The Evolution Gap: A Survival Guide for Modern Civilization". This enlightening work explores the growing disconnect between our slow-moving biological evolution and our remarkable ability to innovate at a breakneck pace. Edmeades suggests that this gap is the root cause of much of today's pain, suffering, and disease, and he provides practical strategies to bridge this divide and enhance our collective wellbeing.
