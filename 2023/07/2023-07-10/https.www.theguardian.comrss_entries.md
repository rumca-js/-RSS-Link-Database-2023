<p>The number of prosecutions has risen, but the overall situation is concerning, with a record-high level of sex offences recorded</p><p>Rape and other serious sexual offences devastate the lives of victims, who carry scars with them through their lives. Prosecutions and convictions for these crimes remain too rare. In the year to September 2022, there were <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2022" title="">70,633 rapes</a> reported by police in England and Wales; in 2022, there were <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-review-progress-report-two-years-on" title="">459 convictions</a>. Such an enormous gap is nothing new and has led campaigners to argue that the crime of rape has effectively been decriminalised, with only a tiny minority of perpetrators caught and punished.</p><p>Given this backdrop, any improvement in the way that allegations are dealt with must be welcomed. So must meaningful development in the wider criminal justice policy environment overseen by the government. But Monday’s announcement by the Ministry of Justice about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/10/campaigners-say-ministers-too-quick-to-celebrate-increased-convictions" title="">progress made over the past two years</a> should be treated cautiously.

<p>Barack Obama was ‘proud’ of his fellow Hawaiian, who saw off the challenge of England’s Charley Hull to win her first major</p><p>When Barack Obama is leading the tributes, it is impossible not to realise the scale of success. Allisen Corpuz prevailed over Charley Hull at the US Women’s Open at Pebble Beach on Sunday and Obama was immediate in his praise towards his fellow Hawaiian. “You make us all proud,” said the 44th president of the United States on social media. “He has done a lot in his career,” Corpuz responded with more than a hint of understatement. “That is really special.”</p><p>The nature of Corpuz’s triumph was similarly striking. The 25-year-old had been trending in the right direction in majors – she was tied fourth at the Chevron Championship and shared 15th at the PGA championship – but missed three cuts in four previous US Open appearances. Corpuz had never won a mainstream tour event before; the weight of expectation at Pebble Beach played a part in her deliberate approach and she was warned she could be penalised for slow play during round four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/allisen-corpuz-gets-presidential-approval-after-us-womens-open-win-golf">Continue reading...</a>

Some nights, the chattiest thing in the house was whatever crustacea they still had alive in the fridge. Some days, the only words I could understand were the names of meals, which I could have guessed from the time.

Gold candlesticks and fake flames are everywhere. Women strut past in huge corset dresses, while bored extras dressed as serfs wait in the shadows and scroll on their phones.

## A deer: famous for their antlers but why not their tails? | Helen Sullivan

<p>In Celtic mythology they’re known as “fairy cattle”</p><p>The word deer comes from <em>dēor</em> and <em>der, </em>which in old and middle English meant, simply, “animal”. The Dutch word “dier” still means this. The sense of a deer as an animal, as opposed to a human – it has been found to have referred to ants, fish and foxes – may come from “<a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=deer">wilddēornes</a>”, the origin of wilderness or wild-animal-ness.</p><p>Deer still seem to embody this mysterious animal-ness: four-legged wildness, dainty and strong, mysterious and controlled. You may say it is all in the antlers: I say it is all in the tail. I saw a small herd of fallow deer in London’s Clissold park recently. A doe walked up to the fence as I walked past, then turned away and flicked her white tail: a flash of white, like a shooting star you’re not sure you’ve seen, like the tap of a fluffy wand, like a cute cursor blinking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/jul/11/a-deer-famous-for-their-antlers-but-why-not-their-tails">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From rear-flattering fits to choosing the hardest-wearing fabric, menswear experts share their secrets for good jeans</p><p>Invented in 1873, denim jeans have remained pretty consistently in style ever since.

It’s true plenty are concerned that Ange Postecoglou has never worked in the Premier League, but the no-nonsense Aussie has been a huge success at home, in Japan and up the road at Celtic, and has almost certainly earned his crack at a club where proven, big-name, elite-level managers such as Antonio Conte and José Mourinho have recently failed. In the time since Spurs last won a competition and the silverware that goes with it, north London’s new larrikin has masterminded various teams, including the flamin’ Socceroos, to victory in nine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/10/football-daily-tottenham-postecoglou-kane">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From headless robodogs to drone pilots who can outclass any human, watching the mesmerising military tech on show here is to watch a terrible beauty being born – one that could annihilate us all</p><p>As someone who is filled with an unholy terror every time Alexa or Siri speaks and who wishes to run screaming for the hills – where my fully stocked bunker awaits – whenever I see kids playing with toy drones instead of kites in the park, Netflix’s Unknown: Killer Robots is … a challenging watch.</p><p>“It’s a cliche but I 100% believe that ‘Freedom is not free’” says Brandon Tseng, former US Navy Seal and co-founder of Shield AI. His company is now joined in the battle for military supremacy via artificial intelligence. The race is on throughout the US and doubtless Russia and China too to develop autonomous drones and other technology that can allow soldiers to avoid such perilous work as clearing buildings of armed personnel, explosive devices and so on, or which can track subjects over inhospitable terrains and vast areas – oh, and kill people when the need arises. The enemy, obviously. Which they will be able to identify reliably, always acting within the rules of engagement. I mean, there may be tricky moments along the way. Paul Scharre, former US army Ranger and author of Army of None, remembers the unspoken agreement among his men not to shoot when insurgents sent an eight-year-old girl out ahead of them to scout for danger. A robot would have seen her as a legal and legitimate target, but I’m sure these kinks will get worked out in time.

She became a member of the court of Louis XIV in her teens, and maintained her royal connections after her marriage, continuing to compose as well as teach. Her output includes keyboard music and sets of secular and biblical cantatas.</p><p>Three of the biblical pieces, Susanne and the Elders, Jacob and Rachel, and Judith, each centre on a woman who is the victim of male discrimination and repression; none have been previously performed in the UK.

<p>Boots Riley’s show about a 13ft teen is so boundlessly, brilliantly radical it could not just kill off the superhero genre – but help bring down the entire capitalist system</p><p>It may focus on a 13ft-tall black man, but make no mistake, I’m a Virgo is a giantkiller. Compared to most big-budget streaming series, Boots Riley’s surreal, absurd, ramshackle yet sincere new show is clearly made on a shoestring, but it knocks its bloated rivals into a cocked hat with its boundless imagination and originality. The specific Goliath that I’m a Virgo threatens to slay is superhero movies, but really it’s a show that aims to bring down the entire capitalist system. Despite being on Amazon, it is as radical and revolutionary as any mainstream entertainment in recent memory.</p><p>For the uninitiated (and watch the show first to avoid spoilers from hereon in), I’m a Virgo’s central premise is beautifully simple: Cootie (Jharrel Jerome) is born twice the size of a normal human. His aunt and uncle keep him confined to their Oakland, California home for his own safety, building him a giant-sized cabin in the yard, where he spends his time watching TV and reading superhero comics (which look like little flick-books in his giant hands). His comic-book hero is a character named … The Hero. Played by Walton Goggins, he’s a billionaire businessman in a Tony Stark/Elon Musk/Bruce Wayne vein, who fights crime in a superpowered suit in the show’s “real” world, as well as marketing himself through comics and TV shows.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/10/take-that-marvel-im-a-virgo-is-ingenious-tv-that-slays-every-superhero-movie">Continue reading...</a>

This is true of family. But it’s also true of our peers, which for me, are those obsessed with trying to fix climate change. Step into the murky waters of Twitter and you’ll often find activists spending more time going after one another than battling climate falsehoods.</p><p>These might seem like small squabbles, but they have a real impact. They slow our progress and play into the hands of the deniers, the oil companies, the anti-climate lobbyists. These groups push on while our heads are turned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/10/the-big-idea-why-climate-tribalism-only-helps-the-deniers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new box set explores how the American singer – now beloved of Kylie and more – was embraced by swinging London. Those who knew her recall a star who gently trod her own path</p><p>With a name akin to a character from Roald Dahl’s stories and an equally naive singing voice some labelled as childish, Blossom Dearie hardly exuded star quality. “She was definitely not an entertainer,” admits Arlene Corwin, a friend and jazz singing contemporary of Dearie’s in mid-century nightclubs. “But her piano was great, her songs so beautifully polished and jazzy. And, of course, that little voice – pitch perfect, modest, unembellished.”</p><p>Now, 14 years after her death aged 84, the maverick New Yorker’s music is being re-evaluated: Kylie Minogue and Feist are self-professed fans, R&amp;B star Ravyn Lenae has namechecked her, Jack White’s label is reissuing her work, Fugees and De La Soul have sampled her and Dearie songs can be heard everywhere from Call the Midwife to Starbucks playlists. “It was the whole combination,” says mod icon Georgie Fame of his one-time friend and mentor. “The unique sound of her voice, her way of playing and accompanying herself, her choice of unusual material. It’s the presentation of all those things.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/10/blossom-dearie-jazz-singer-with-the-little-voice-and-vast-talent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No corner of the planet is free from minuscule fragments of plastic packaging, textiles or utensils. We ask scientists what this means for our health – and what we should do to protect it</p><p>Invisible specks of eroded plastic from long-forgotten toothbrushes, sweet wrappers and stocking-filler toys are everywhere. They live in our laundry bins, the Mariana trench and the human bloodstream. Microplastic particles can be small enough to infiltrate biological barriers such as the gut, skin and placental tissue. We are all now partially plastic – but how worried should we be, and is there any way to minimise our exposure?</p><p>At the moment, says Stephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College, London, a lack of epidemiological and in-human data means we don’t yet know the harmful effects of microplastics, but “I would say reducing particle exposure in general (including microplastic) is likely to be beneficial”. But avoiding the stuff is a tall order, considering it’s in the “air, drinking water, dust and food”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/10/air-drinking-water-dust-food-how-to-reduce-exposure-microplastics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two classmates navigate their relationship – along with a magical tunnel where time gets dilated – in Tomohisa Taguchi’s elegant animation</p><p>The Planet of the Apes and the waterworld in Interstellar aren’t the only places in cinema where the time dilation phenomenon can be observed. A few metres down the railway track from a smalltown station in Tomohisa Taguchi’s anime romance, downtrodden hero Kaoru (Oji Suzuka) slips down a bank to find a cleft in a rockface; it gives on to the Urashima tunnel, a magical passageway capable of granting your greatest wish. But mere seconds spent in this molten-canopied alley chasing after your heart’s desire equate to hours on the outside; minutes mean years.</p><p>Kaoru wants to bring his younger sister, Karen, back to life; his alcoholic father blames him for her death. And he finds an unexpected ally in Anzu (Marie Iitoyo), the new girl in his high-school class to whom he lends an umbrella one morning at the station. As they investigate the tunnel, and try to pin down its properties, Kaoru is drawn increasingly closer to this soft-spoken but hard-nosed free spirit – and troubled by her egotism in wanting to forge on inside to acquire the talent to become a superlative manga artist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/10/the-tunnel-to-summer-exit-of-goodbyes-review-anime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fresh laurel leaves wreathe this simplest of sauces in pungent glory</p><p>A group of young people, two of them wearing laurel wreaths to mark their graduation, arrived in the piazza at 6pm. They joined the mass of kids recently released into a three-month summer holiday, as well as all the locals, visitors, drinks, dripping ice-creams, balls, bikes and dogs that fill the square.</p><p>The use of laurel wreaths for the newly graduated traces back to ancient Greece, and the variously told and interpreted myth of <a href="https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/myths/apollo-and-daphne/">Daphne and Apollo</a>. In short, the nymph Daphne is pursued by the god Apollo, intoxicated by Cupid’s arrow. To avoid him, she turns herself/is turned into a laurel tree, at which point he marks the tree into a sacred symbol (one of his many god roles was to make mortals aware of their own guilt and purify them of it). As well as being a creep, Apollo was an archer and athlete, and was also associated with music and poetry. This is why a laurel crown twisted from<em> </em>his<em> </em>sacred symbol became associated with and used to crown victorious athletes, heroes and appointed poets, and then, later, great minds and <em>laureate/</em>graduates. And why we are reminded not to rest on our laurels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/10/tomato-and-bay-leaf-sauce-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

No stars.</p><p>I see from searching for the dread phrase “Love to hear from you” that the dentist who hasn’t answered my plaintive queries about my broken tooth also wants feedback, as does the chain hotel where I left my favourite skirt, leading to multiple unanswered phone calls and them eventually denying all knowledge of it.

Areas of Spain and Portugal have recorded daily maximum temperatures in the high 30s celsius for more than a week, exceeding 40C in parts of southern Spain on Sunday. Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux region also reached the low-to-mid 30s celsius in places at the weekend.</p><p>The heat is caused by a large area of high pressure that is stagnating over Europe and preventing the usual pattern of low pressure systems moving eastwards into Europe from the Atlantic. This is known as a blocking high and results in very dry and stable conditions, as the fronts associated with more dynamic weather patterns are forced away by the high pressure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/10/weather-tracker-heat-dome-temperatures-spain-portugal-forecast">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I didn’t live up to my dad’s expectations’: artist Corbin Shaw on how masculinity inspires his work

<p>After collaborations with Martin Parr and queer party Homobloc, the 24-year old reflects on how Sheffield’s football terraces, boxing gyms and pubs influenced him</p><p>‘I desperately wanted to be liked at school,” recalls Corbin Shaw. “I was always trying to fit in with this group of boys, which is where a lot of my work stems from.” Explorations of what is expected of young men permeate much of the 24-year-old’s work. Utilising textiles, flags and slogans, masculinity runs through its core. Take the selection of reimagined St George’s flags: “Soften Up Hard Lad” reads one; “I’m Never Going to Be One of the Lads” reads another; the Burberry check backdrop of one has the words “Sweet and Tender Hooligan” hand-stitched on to it.</p><p>Shaw’s upbringing on the outskirts of Sheffield, and his exposure to football terraces, boxing gyms and pubs, informs much of his work. His dad encouraged him to be a footballer or a boxer but neither took. “I just wanted to be creative,” he reflects. “I didn’t match up to the expectations of what he wanted me to be as a man. There’s a lot of things I’ve never said to my dad that come out in the work.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/10/i-didnt-live-up-to-my-dads-expectations-artist-corbin-shaw-on-how-masculinity-inspires-his-work">Continue reading...</a>

I don’t know precisely what was said and at what time, but certainly you would expect allegations of that nature to be dealt with very robustly and promptly.</p><p>And it may be that, in the fullness of time, there will need to be an investigation about how this allegation was handled.

<p>From the terrible parking to the awful mural of Charles and Camilla, the Northampton Complaints Choir puts it all in song. Our man joins to<strong> </strong>vent his frustrations – and gets a surprise</p><p>The audience in an upstairs room of Northampton Central Library thought they were going to spend Sunday afternoon listening to the debut gig of the Northampton Complaints Choir.</p><p>But choirmaster Joseph Kohlmaier has a surprise. The audience are going to be the choir. They will join with those of us who have been rehearsing a libretto for a song cycle created over research workshops during the weekend. “We have a-choired you,” says the twinkly eyed Austrian director of <a href="https://www.musarc.org/">MusArc</a>, an experimental choir collective invited to the town as part of Northampton Contemporary Art’s <a href="https://nncontemporaryart.org/ed_engagement/sensing_place/">Sensing Place</a> festival.

## Brad Pitt stops F1 traffic but Lando Norris is Silverstone’s future darling | Nick Ames

<p>Finishing second at the British GP, the home driver showcases his superstar potential with Hollywood royalty watching on</p><p>For the boy in the luminous bucket hat, an achievement straight from the bucket list. This may not have been an afternoon of high sporting cinema, even if the presence of Brad Pitt and his phalanx of film crew members ramped up the glamour, but Lando Norris had the ending he wanted. Second place, with a stylish drive to boot, was some way to reaffirm his place in the Silverstone crowd’s affections and heighten the sense that he is almost ready to be this venue’s darling for the next decade or more. The wins will surely follow; this time, a revelatory weekend’s work from Norris and a buoyant McLaren did not feel too far short.</p><p>In the context of what, for the rest of this season at least, is inevitable domination from Max Verstappen this was a wider triumph for British racing too. Two local drivers had not stood together on the podium since 1999, when David Coulthard and Eddie Irvine formed a one-two. Norris was joined by his idol, Lewis Hamilton: a tantalising battle between the pair around lap 40 briefly offered the kind of neck-and-neck tussle, not to mention narrative, for which record numbers had flocked expectantly to the circuit since Thursday. Netflix may have cornered the market for soap opera, but Silverstone can still deliver the racing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/10/brad-pitt-f1-lando-norris-silverstone-british-grand-prix">Continue reading...</a>

As he puts it, ‘I let my hair down’</p><p>When Greg Ross flew home to Australia following his beloved uncle’s funeral in Auckland in 2008, he looked out of the aeroplane window at the clouds, and by the time he landed in Perth, he had reached a decision: “I thought, I’m going to quit.”</p><p>He had realised on the flight that he was burnt out – in his job as acting CEO of a theatre company, and after decades as a marketing executive for prestigious cars. The delayed acknowledgment of burnout, he thinks, “is probably very specific to my age group, the baby boomer thing.

<p>This insightful memoir sheds light on the author’s life as a disabled gay man who is often rendered invisible</p><p>The title of this engaging memoir exploring Emmett de Monterey’s life growing up gay and disabled (he has cerebral palsy) in 1980s London comes from James Baldwin: “You have to go the way your blood beats. If you don’t live the only life you have, you won’t live some other life, you won’t live any life at all…”</p><p>What follows across 26 chronological and self-contained stories of the self is how hard this proclamation is to obey in an ableist and homophobic society. Much of the book’s emotional weight comes from the way in which the world built in the family home, or with friends and peers, is constantly thrown up against reductive and violent language from outside institutions: the medical establishment, the education system, the church, members of the public who stare or infantilise. He comes out to his mum, who is sweetly welcoming and comforting, just after his GCSE year at school. For him, as so often for people discovering their sexuality (me included), the first words you hear connected to it are insults from peers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/10/go-the-way-your-blood-beats-by-emmett-de-monterey-review-vivid-account-of-a-world-of-difference">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A trek on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps is dazzling, but also a stark example of the damage caused by global warming</p><p>Seven of us are roped in a line, with hiking poles in our hands and crampons on our boots. Led by our guide, David, we take it in turns to step from rock into the marbled grey ice beyond. I hesitate before taking my step; the act feels oddly disrespectful. It takes a few minutes to trust that the spikes will hold their grip, but I get used to the crunching rhythm and the occasional tug of the rope. The summer sunshine is warm but a coldness radiates from below. It is a six-hour hike to the hut we will sleep in tonight.</p><p>This is the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps. It is 15 miles long and up to 800 metres deep, the largest and longest glacier in the Alps. From above, its mass looked uniform, but up close it is creased and contorted, speckled with browns, blacks and greys, and glimpses into its deep crevasses reveal a startling turquoise. Two gritty parallel lines follow its long curve downhill, moraines that act as conveyor belts bearing rocks and rubble. As David reminds us, the ice is not static but a dynamic system, a frozen river in a constant state of (very slow) motion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/10/i-walked-the-alps-largest-glacier-it-felt-like-last-chance-tourism-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Susana Nobre’s docufiction follows the life of Joaquim Calçada, who spent two decades in the US as an undocumented immigrant</p><p>With his high pompadour and a penchant for boxy leather jackets and bold patterned shirts, Joaquim Calçada looks like he has wandered straight out of a 1970s movie. His face, though not conventionally handsome, has a kind of cinematic quality that could have promised a fruitful career as a tough-guy character actor in a bygone era before Instagramified prettiness took over film casting. Perhaps inspired by Calçada’s distinctive looks, Susana Nobre’s intriguing docufiction brings a playful dose of smoke and mirrors to a life story that is far from glamorous.</p><p>In fact, Calçada is an unemployed Portuguese man nearing retirement age, who earlier in his life spent two decades in the US as an undocumented immigrant. Now he is caught in a cruel predicament where he can only claim unemployment benefits by first proving that he has unsuccessfully applied for jobs elsewhere. This means visiting random places of business and manually collecting stamps from employers who confirm that he is unfit for work. Aside from this undignifying paper trail, the red tape merry-go-round sends Calçada back on a wistful journey to the past. Here is where reality and artifice magically fuse. Seated behind the steering wheel, he fondly recalls his time in New York, where he worked as a cabbie and a limo chauffeur. The camera then gradually pulls back to reveal a film set and the rear projection screen behind Calçada’s stationary car.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/10/jacks-ride-review-docudrama-susana-nobre-unemployment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The term has exploded in recent years online, as people try everything from chewable balls to cosmetic surgery to achieve the look</p><p>Five months ago, Natalie, a 27-year-old from Canada, paid C$4,000 for chin liposuction. She had always had a small double chin, she says, but in the past year she had gained weight, and it had grown bigger. The more she fixated on her chin, the more she fixated on the chins of others. “You see people in the media, on Instagram. They have an ideal image,” Natalie (not her real name) says. “You want to achieve that look. And sometimes it can only be done through surgery.”</p><p>The procedure went smoothly. Immediately afterwards, “it looked perfect. It was snatched.” “Snatched”, she explains, means “a straight chin underneath. It’s usually used for thin, pretty people.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/10/snatched-jawline-cosmetic-plastic-surgery">Continue reading...</a>

## She performed an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim. The right vilified her | Moira Donegan

<p>Caitlin Bernard deserves a statue for her service. Instead, she’s been harassed and persecuted</p><p>If the United States was a country that valued women and girls, or that understood the moral gravity of misogyny, then there would be statues to people like Caitlin Bernard. The Indiana doctor has long been a champion of reproductive rights; she joined a 2019 lawsuit challenging her state’s Roe-era ban on dilation and evacuation abortions, or D&amp;E procedures; she’s long been outspoken, in her very red state, about her faith that women and girls are worthy of control over their own bodies. So maybe Indiana Republicans, like the attorney general Todd Rokita, already thought of her as an enemy in July 2022, when, just days after the supreme court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe and threw an anti-abortion trigger ban into effect in neighboring Ohio, Bernard performed an abortion on a patient who had had to travel to Indiana to get her procedure: a 10-year-old girl, the victim of rape.</p><p>This act alone – Bernard’s gesture of compassion and respect to an abused child, one that spared the young girl the danger and torture of an underage, rape-produced pregnancy and helped to end the suffering and indignity that followed her assault, is itself a solemn kind of service. Bernard’s work brought her into the darkest realities of what men do to women – raping and impregnating them as children, making laws that will keep them pregnant against their will, as children, unless they can flee – and to face that darkness with integrity and courage. Few of us would have the capacity to do what Bernard did in treating that child; few of us would be able to face that truth about our world.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/10/indiana-abortion-doctor-10-year-old-child-rape">Continue reading...</a>

From a sleeping beauty to an extinct bird, famous fans pick their most treasured object</p><p>It’s been a difficult few years for Britain’s museums. Forced to close their doors because of Covid-19, they then had to adjust to a new landscape, all while the arts and culture budget was slashed at like a piñata by the government. It makes the Art Fund Museum of the Year<strong> </strong>prize feel like a chance to take a breather and reflect.</p><p>This year’s winner will take home £120,000 and be announced in a ceremony at the British Museum on 12 July, with the four runners-up each receiving £15,000. The nominees are: Scapa Flow, a remote body of water in Orkney, Scotland, which once housed Vikings and, during both world wars, the British naval fleet, and which has been transformed into a museum to document the human stories that unfurled there; Glasgow’s Burrell Collection, which reopened this spring after a six-year, £68.25m refurbishment; the Natural History Museum, filled with precious wonders of the natural world, and a rite of passage for schoolchildren on trips; Belfast’s Mac, a theatre and exhibition venue that has given space for a new generation of Northern Irish artists to find their voice; and Leighton House in London, once the opulent abode of legendary painter Frederic Leighton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/10/such-a-beautiful-creature-chris-packham-dan-snow-and-more-on-their-favourite-museum-exhibit">Continue reading...</a>

In fact, Rachel’s grandma’s health was damaged by working with the glue used in laces.” There is one caveat. “Unfortunately, the factory her grandparents worked at doesn’t do visits, but we can take you to a nearby factory.”</p><p>There is a second part to the original colour. “Rachel’s grandparents were Salvationists.” Blimey, that sounds exciting, I say – what are those? “They were in the Salvation Army.

<p>Since May 2020, there have been hundreds of reports of orcas interacting with boats in the strait of Gibraltar. Philip Hoare reports</p><p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, rarely interfere with boats. But since May 2020, some of these highly intelligent and social mammals have changed their behaviour. There has been an increase in incidents of orcas breaking rudders and even sinking yachts in the strait of Gibraltar. This behaviour seems to be spreading. In June, orcas rammed into a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland, about 2,000 miles away from the initial incidents.</p><p><strong>Philip Hoare</strong>, a journalist and author of Albert and the Whale, tells <strong>Michael Safi</strong> about the theories scientists have for why this might be happening. He explains how our relationship with the orca has changed over time and what we need to do to protect this species.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/10/payback-or-play-the-orcas-sinking-yachts-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
