<p>Comedian and writer Sarah Silverman has filed copyright infringement lawsuits against the makers of<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3682143/chatgpt-finally-an-ai-chatbot-worth-talking-to.html"> ChatGPT</a> as well as Facebook parent company Meta, saying that their AI system's use of her copyright works for training violates her intellectual property rights.</p><p>The suits, filed last week in federal district court in San Francisco, argued that Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Meta didn’t have permission to use copyright works by Silverman and two other authors, Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey, when it used them to train ChatGPT and Meta's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI). It asks for injunctions against the companies to prevent them from continuing similar practices, as well as unspecified monetary damages. (Both suits also ask the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702392/sarah-silverman-sues-openai-meta-over-copyright-infringement-in-ai-training.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>UK communications regulator Ofcom has published an interim report that proposes the cloud infrastructure market be referred to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) due to concerns around a decline in competition.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0029/256457/cloud-services-market-study-interim-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">report </a>said that existing cloud customers in the UK are paying more than they should be for their cloud infrastructure or having to settle for low-quality services, and that the regulator had heard concerns from some customers about their ability to switch or use multiple providers.</p><p>As a result, Ofcom said it was referring the cloud infrastructure market to the CMA for a market investigation that would allow the regulator to further examine if there are interventions that could address the barriers identified in the report and improve the market for customers.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702388/uk-regulator-refers-cloud-infrastructure-market-for-investigation.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Let’s get something out of the way right at the beginning: We already know <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3698690/with-vision-pro-apple-shows-computings-future-but-whos-it-for.html">Apple’s Vision Pro device</a> consists of a bundle of bleeding-edge technologies competitors can’t easily emulate.</p><p>How do we know this? Because supply chain reports claim the lenses used in these devices are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6f06bde-17b0-4886-b465-b561212c96a9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hard to source</a>. Ergo, they are hard to manufacture. This particular production bottleneck is also a competitive advantage for Apple — it means its solution is hard to imitate. So how can devices only expected to see a few hundred thousand units form the future of computing?</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702389/apples-cutting-edge-vision-pro-doesnt-need-iphone-sales-to-succeed.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
