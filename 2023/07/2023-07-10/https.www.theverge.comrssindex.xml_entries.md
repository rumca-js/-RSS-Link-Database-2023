  <p id="8CKU0p">Mark Lucovsky, the former head of operating systems on Google’s augmented reality team, has left the company. <a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1678465552988381185">In a tweet on Monday</a>, Lucovsky says “changes in AR leadership and Google’s unstable commitment and vision” contributed to his decision.</p>
<p id="wAtEdd">Lucovsky’s departure adds to the numerous challenges Google’s AR team has faced in recent months, including a round of layoffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor">resignation of Google’s former head of VR, Clay Bavor</a>.

<p id="qUfd1j">“I think that memo was real.

## Twisted Metal fires off lots of bullets and even more jokes in new trailer

  <p id="SFCUG0">The bullets fly in the latest trailer for <em>Twisted Metal</em> — and so do the jokes. Our previous look at Peacock’s adaptation of the PlayStation vehicular mayhem series <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23702273/twisted-metal-tv-show-trailer-peacock-release-date">didn’t show much</a> other than how Will Arnett and Samoa Joe were joining forces to play the murderous clown Sweet Tooth. But the latest clip gives a much better idea of what viewers can expect when the series starts streaming later this month.</p>
<p id="Xpvp4p">Unlike the video games, which follow a tournament that’s sort of like a cross between a destruction derby and a fight to the death, the show takes place in a postapocalyptic version of the US where cities are walled off from the lawlessness outside. That means courier drivers — like the lead character, played by Anthony Mackie — are both...</p>

  <p id="7eOBkc">After years of Fox’s live-action <em>X-Men </em>movie franchise (RIP) being violently allergic to the idea of letting Marvel’s mutants be seen wearing anything but boring black getups vaguely inspired by Frank Quitely’s <em>New X-Men </em>designs, <em>Deadpool 3</em> seems ready to switch things up.</p>

  <p id="evFnod">Last week, Meta debuted its Twitter competitor, Threads. The app gained more than 100 million users in the US, UK, and hundreds of other countries in less than a week — but you won’t be able to download it in the European Union anytime soon. The app has been held up by what Meta spokesperson Christine Pai described to <em>The Verge</em> as “upcoming regulatory uncertainty,” widely assumed to refer to the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p id="8GmoxK">Tech companies and regulatory skeptics have long claimed that laws like the DMA hold back innovation by requiring onerous user protections, but the looming competition law doesn’t stop Meta from introducing new products — and Meta hasn’t indicated it will forgo a European launch. If anything, the DMA adds friction...</p>

  <p id="ZrYWdJ">Instagram’s new Threads app has already surpassed 100 million users, meaning it reached the milestone dramatically faster than even ChatGPT. OpenAI’s chatbot passed the mark <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">after two months</a>, but Threads, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784263/instagram-threads-app-download-iphone-android">only launched on Wednesday</a>, got there in a matter of days.</p>
<p id="RE9RHS">Threads proved to be an early hit almost immediately. In the first two hours, it <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVjWxcJ22Z/">hit 2 million users</a> and steadily climbed from there to <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVxMmvLNsG">5 million</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuWOMBzgnto">10 million</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuXCjGVrd6R">30 million</a>, and then <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuZsgfWLyiI">70 million</a>. The launch has been “way beyond our expectations,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday.</p>
<p id="85D56R">Users aren’t just signing up: they’re posting, too. As of Thursday, my colleague Alex Heath reported that there have already been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23786108/threads-internal-activity-data-exclusive-instagram-meta">more than 95 million posts</a> and 190 million likes shared on the app.</p>
