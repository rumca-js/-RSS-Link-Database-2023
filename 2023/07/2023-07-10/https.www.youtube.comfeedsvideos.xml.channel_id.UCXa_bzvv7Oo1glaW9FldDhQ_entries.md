Almost every game has bosses that demand something from you, like your rapt attention from investment in the story-telling or some skill due to the challenge involved. Boss fights are often the high points in a game and stay with you long after.

2023 is only half over, and there have already been some excellent boss fights that deserve attention. It could have been a Final Fantasy 16 highlight reel, but fortunately, other titles like Street Fighter 6, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and more have plenty to offer.

Check out the best boss fights of the year (so far) and what makes them so exceptional. Even with so many other games coming, these fights will remain memorable.

2015 was a bumper year for video games, not just for developers harnessing ever more powerful tech to craft increasingly widespread and immersive worlds, but in their ability to create graphically impressive titles – some of which made on outdated technology that’d be decidedly primitive when compared to what’s available today. 

The games on this rundown all feature due to their graphical impressiveness; all exhibit something exemplary in their graphical presentation, whether it’s in a glowing art style, portrayal of bleak, beautiful landscapes, superbly lifelike character models or textured, weathered surfaces which really sell the believability of an environment. Above all else, there’s a certain timelessness these titles exhibit, most of which wouldn’t look dramatically out of place if released in the past few years, or maybe even in 2023.
