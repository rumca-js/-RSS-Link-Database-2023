The company is planning a major revamp of its platform that will bring algorithmic recommendations to users\u2019 feeds, according to <a href=\"https://staff.tumblr.com/post/722477242948747264/tumblrs-core-product-strategy\"><ins>a memo</ins></a> published on the Tumblr Staff blog.</p><p>The memo is notably frank about the reasons for the upcoming changes and what it describes as Tumblr\u2019s current shortcomings. \u201cThe underlying problem is that Tumblr is not easy to use,\u201d the company writes. \u201cBeing a 15-year-old brand is tough because the brand carries the baggage of a person\u2019s preconceived impressions of Tumblr.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While Tumblr doesn\u2019t provide exact details about new features, it offers some pretty big hints about what\u2019s to come. The company says that one of its primary goals will be to \u201cdeliver great content each time the app is opened\u201d and refers to its current \u201cfollowing\u201d feed as \u201coutdated.\u201d</p><p>To address this, the Automattic-owned platform says it\u2019s working to \u201cimprove our algorithmic ranking capabilities across all feeds\u201d and \u201cmake it easier for users to understand where the vibrant communities on Tumblr are.\u201d The company also notes that building more creator-friendly features, including improvements to the way replies and reblogs work, will also be key to attracting new users.</p><p>\u201cBeing a new creator on Tumblr can be intimidating, with a high likelihood of leaving or disappointment upon sharing creations without receiving engagement or feedback,\u201d the company writes. \u201cThe lack of feedback stems from the outdated decision to only show content from followed blogs on the main dashboard feed (\u201cFollowing\u201d), perpetuating a cycle where popular blogs continue to gain more visibility at the expense of helping new creators.\u201d</p><p>Taken together, the changes Tumblr is describing sound a lot like TikTok (or even Instagram): algorithmic recommendations in users\u2019 primary feeds, creator-friendly features that encourage sharing, and more streamlined commenting and conversation tools. As a strategy, that all may sound pretty straightforward in 2023, when users increasingly expect these kinds of features from social platforms anyway. But considering Tumblr\u2019s core interface hasn\u2019t changed that much in its decade and a half of existence, the new direction could bring significant changes to the overall dynamics of the platform.</p><p>The coming redesign isn\u2019t the only way Automatic has tried to breathe new life into the platform it acquired <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-12-verizon-to-sell-tumblr-to-automattic.html\"><ins>in 2019.</ins></a> The company has also experimented with subscriptions and other paid features, introducing Post+ <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-post-plus-expansion-140056311.html\"><ins>in 2021</ins></a>, though there was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/\"><ins>some backlash</ins></a> against the feature from longtime users.

We gave it a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html\">score of 90</a> in our review of the most recent edition: It has the same elegant and comfortable design language as the iPad Pro while costing less, with a bright, sharp and accurate 10.9-inch display surrounded by thin bezels and flat edges. It comes with a USB-C port, similar to what you\u2019d find on a MacBook and many other non-iPhone devices, and while it\u2019s not a Thunderbolt connection as on the iPad Pro, simply being able to charge the Air with the same cable you use with your other gadgets is a plus.</p><p>Apple refreshed the Air in 2022 with its M1 system-on-a-chip, which is the same silicon found in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\">entry-level MacBook Air</a>.

Starting at $329 for a 64GB model \u2014 and regularly available for less than $300 \u2014 it\u2019s by far the most wallet-friendly way into iPadOS. While its hardware is an obvious step down from the models above, it\u2019s still more than capable for the essentials.</p><p>We gave the 9th-gen iPad model a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html\">review score of 86</a> in 2021. This is the only \u201ccurrent\u201d iPad to follow Apple\u2019s older design language: It\u2019s just a tiny bit thicker and heavier than the 10th-gen iPad and iPad Air, but its wider bezels mean there\u2019s only enough room for a 10.2-inch display. Like the 10th-gen iPad, that screen isn't laminated and more susceptible to glare, though it\u2019s just as sharp. There\u2019s a Home button located on the bottom bezel that also houses a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, and the device charges via Lightning port rather than USB-C. Its speakers don\u2019t sound as nice, either, but it\u2019s the only iPad to still have a headphone jack, and its 12MP front camera is fine (though, it\u2019s not landscape-oriented as on the 10th-gen iPad).</p><p>The 9th-gen iPad runs on Apple\u2019s A13 Bionic, which is the same SoC used in 2019\u2019s iPhone 11 series. It won\u2019t be as fluid or futureproof as the M1, but it\u2019s plenty quick for casual tasks. In terms of first-party accessories, the tablet supports <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1TbWFydC1LZXlib2FyZC1pUGFkLUdlbmVyYXRpb24vZHAvQjA4NjNGNUtDVD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1hei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiM2E4MTgtNjZiMy00NmJmLTk4ZTMtMTY2MzlhZDg2OThhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXYw8oQvVKFZ4NI8LRX28wkGGjVEq-uvhPHZoGnigrs_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smart-Keyboard-iPad-Generation%2Fdp%2FB0863F5KCT&amp;uuid=YRhJFhoALb3cQiJH20692\">Apple's Smart Keyboard</a> and first-gen Pencil stylus. Those are less convenient than the company\u2019s newer options, but they\u2019re at least <em>there.</em></p><p>In the end, it\u2019s all about the price. The 9th-gen iPad is the most affordable model in Apple\u2019s lineup, and those savings go a long way toward papering over its issues.</p><h2>Best for one-handed use: iPad mini&nbsp;</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLUFwcGxlLWlQYWQtTWluaS1XaS1GaS9kcC9CMDlHOTFMWEZQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWF6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdw4RzvX7d2QJshPEUWn7FkKluiQopCLiGCCJZqJnnjs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB09G91LXFP&amp;uuid=VDrsyRnewXRjTDHd24694\">iPad mini</a> is exactly what it sounds like: the small iPad. It\u2019s easily the shortest (7.69x5.3x0.25 inches) and lightest (0.65 pounds for the WiFi model) of every current iPad, with an 8.3-inch display that\u2019s more comfortable to operate with one hand.</p><p>We gave the iPad mini a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html\">review score of 89</a> in 2021. Its design follows closely after that of the iPad Air: squared-off edges, thin bezels, no Home button, a Touch ID sensor in the power button, stereo speakers, solid cameras and a USB-C port. Its display is technically sharper, but otherwise gives you the same max brightness, lamination, anti-reflective coating and wide color gamut. It doesn\u2019t have a \u201c<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjA1MjM3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZJrmEU1Ew2Q4Yf7pctBPKR0nB5xo2y4vLm9Er86j1CF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT205237&amp;uuid=y4C7I3OYjVGkr5to25694\">Smart Connector</a>\u201d to hook up Apple-made keyboards, but it does support the second-gen Apple Pencil.</p><p>The mini runs on Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic SoC, the same as the one in 2021\u2019s iPhone 13 phones. This is technically faster than the chip inside the 10th-gen iPad model and, again, more than powerful enough for most tasks, though it\u2019s a step behind the laptop-grade M1 or M2 chip.</p><p>The mini has an MSRP of $499 for the 64GB model and $649 for the 256GB model. That\u2019s a lot, though in recent months we\u2019ve seen both SKUs available online for up to $100 less. If you specifically want a smaller tablet \u2014 whether it\u2019s to easily stuff in a bag, use with one hand or treat like a high-end e-reader \u2014 this is the only option Apple sells, and the best tablet in its size range, period.</p><h2>Best for power users: iPad Pro 12.9-inch</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTEQ0U1dEP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWF6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZf6OnX7q5Hkdkk4akb4J3R6MKGZAwO_B1S1Fpo178o5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLD4SWD&amp;uuid=5ibR0YjjyqUL2z0o29695\">12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> exists in something of its own realm within the Apple tablet lineup. It starts at $1,099 for 128GB of storage, which is $100 more than the M1 MacBook Air. That\u2019s well beyond what anyone needs to pay to do the vast majority of iPad things, and quite a chunk of change for a platform that still has issues with laptop-style productivity. But the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the best pure piece of tablet hardware that Apple makes.</p><p>We gave the latest iPad Pro a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377-140026181.html\">review score of 87</a> in November. The display here can get brighter than the Air\u2019s, and it has a 120 Hz refresh rate (the Air is limited to 60 Hz). The 12.9-inch Pro\u2019s Liquid Retina display is <em>more</em> of an upgrade than the 11-inch model, though, as it\u2019s the only iPad to use mini-LED backlighting, which can deliver higher peak brightness, improved contrast and a generally more realistic image. Beyond that, the Pro runs on Apple\u2019s new M2 SoC, which isn\u2019t a huge upgrade over the M1 in real-world use but offers <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-preview-m2-chip-130006105.html\">more performance</a> overhead going forward. The iPad Pro has the same 12MP rear camera as the Air, but adds a 10MP ultrawide lens and an LED flash (plus a LIDAR scanner for AR apps). The 12MP front cameras, meanwhile, can take shots in <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2d1aWRlL2lwYWQvdGFrZS1waG90b3MtaXBhZDk5YjUzYTcxL2lwYWRvcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiM2E4MTgtNjZiMy00NmJmLTk4ZTMtMTY2MzlhZDg2OThhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf6P3GFlywey4fq_3umppCvBsAimYmAlZ8UMwV1-sIPW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fguide%2Fipad%2Ftake-photos-ipad99b53a71%2Fipados&amp;uuid=m3Mu5VsXxnk4rKyK30695\">portrait mode</a>.</p><p>Beyond that, the Pro has a faster Thunderbolt USB-C port, more robust speakers and Face ID support. With its latest refresh, it can now recognize when an Apple Pencil is hovering above the display and preview would-be inputs. There are more storage options, going all the way up to 2TB, with the 1TB and 2TB models doubling the RAM from 8GB to 16GB (at a super high cost). And it works with all of Apple\u2019s best accessories.</p><p>It\u2019s a powerhouse, and if you <em>do</em> want to use an iPad more heavily for work, the roomier display on the 12.9-inch Pro should make it the most amenable option for all-day, laptop-style use. You\u2019ll want to add a keyboard to get the most out of that, but if you\u2019re spending this much on an iPad to begin with, that may not be as big of a deal.</p><p>Like the iPad mini, this is very much a niche device. It\u2019s prohibitively expensive, and its hulking size makes it less portable than other iPads. Certain creatives have made it work as a laptop replacement, but for most, iPadOS still makes multitasking and other computer-y tasks more convoluted than they\u2019d be on a similarly priced MacBook. It\u2019s only a minor upgrade over the prior model, too. Still, as a <em>tablet</em>, the 12.9-inch Pro is ultra powerful.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-10T18:16:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sarah Silverman sues OpenAI and Meta over copyright infringement", "description": "<p>Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI.

But you also probably know that these can be pretty expensive gadgets \u2013 it\u2019s not unheard of to drop close to $1,000 on a high-end robot vacuum cleaner. Just a few years ago, there weren\u2019t a ton of solid yet affordable robot vacuums out there. But now, there have never been more budget robot vacuum options to choose from. At Engadget, we consider anything under $300 to be cheap in this space and you may be surprised to see how many there are at that price point. And if you\u2019re new to the world of robot vacuums, you may find that one of these budget gadgets does everything you expected and more, without sacrificing cleaning performance.</p><h2>Are robot vacuums worth it?</h2><p>Friends and family often ask me if new gadgets are \u201cworth it,\u201d and when it comes to robot vacuums the answer is yes. The most important thing they have going for them is autonomy: Just turn it on, walk away. If you\u2019re someone who wants to spend as little time as possible cleaning your home \u2014 or just someone who detests vacuuming \u2014 a semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let\u2019s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. And while robo-vacs are cord-free, that means they are slaves to their batteries and will require docking at a charging base.</p><p>When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places.</p><h2>What to look for in a budget robot vacuum</h2><p>When looking for the best budget robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with more suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don\u2019t rely on Pa levels and simply say their robots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums.</p><p>So how can you ensure you\u2019re getting the best robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a \u201cmax\u201d mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors.</p><p>Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot\u2019s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won\u2019t be able to clean under a couch (unless it\u2019s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot\u2019s dustbin \u2014 the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it.</p><p>You should also double check the WiFi capabilities of the robo-vac you\u2019re eyeing. While you may think that\u2019s a given on all smart home devices, it\u2019s not. Some of the most affordable models don\u2019t have the option to connect to your home WiFi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won\u2019t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that\u2019s typically reserved for WiFi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules.</p><p>But WiFi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you\u2019re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your WiFi network is the best option.</p><p>Object detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes.</p><h2>Best robot vacuums on a budget for 2023</h2><h2>Best overall: iRobot Roomba 694</h2><p></p><p>Both iRobot and Shark impressed with their affordable robo-vacs. But we think <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9pUm9ib3QtVmFjdXVtLVdpLUZpLUNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS1DYXJwZXRzLVNlbGYtQ2hhcmdpbmcvZHAvQjA4U1A1R1lKUD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1oMC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmVmZTcwMDMtMGYwNi00OWRkLWJmNzUtNjUwZmI4MWMyMjJjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWmkyT8QBnVCfAy1zQ1baZR2uIQmkutnivtDw7mzDOdJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FiRobot-Vacuum-Wi-Fi-Connectivity-Carpets-Self-Charging%2Fdp%2FB08SP5GYJP\">iRobot\u2019s Roomba 694</a> will be the best cheap robot vacuum cleaner for most people thanks to its good cleaning power and easy-to-use mobile app. The Roomba 694 replaced the Roomba 675 last year but, aside from an updated exterior, it\u2019s fundamentally the same vacuum. It looks much sleeker now with its new all-black design, giving it an aesthetic similar to some of the more expensive Roomba models. It has three physical buttons on it \u2014 start, dock and spot \u2014 and  it connects to WiFi so you can control it via the iRobot app. Unfortunately, your $274 gets you the vacuum and its necessary parts only so you\u2019ll have to pay up immediately when you need a replacement filter or brushes.</p><p>Setting up this powerful robot vacuum is straightforward: Open the companion app and follow the instructions. Once it\u2019s connected to your home WiFi network, you\u2019re able to use the app to control the vacuum whenever you don\u2019t feel like using the physical buttons. However, the spot-clean function is only available as a button, which is a bit of a bummer.</p><p>iRobot\u2019s app is one of the biggest selling points for any Roomba. It\u2019s so easy to use that even someone with no prior experience will be able to quickly master the robot\u2019s basic functions. iRobot\u2019s app puts most pertinent controls on the homepage, so you rarely (if ever) need to navigate through its menu to do things like set a cleaning schedule.</p><p>We recommend setting cleaning schedules to really get the most out of the device. After all, these are semi-autonomous robots, so why not make it so you rarely have to interact with them? Doing so will ensure the Roomba runs through your home on a regular basis, so you\u2019re always left with clean floors. The Roomba 694 in particular did a good job sucking up dirt and debris on my carpets as well as the tile flooring in my kitchen and bathrooms. The only thing I try to do before a cleaning job is get charging cables off of the floor \u2013 the Roomba will stop if it sucks something like that up and it\u2019s relatively easy to extract a cable from the machine\u2019s brushes, but I\u2019d rather not have to do so if I can avoid it.</p><p>When it comes to battery life, the Roomba 694 ran for around 45 minutes before needing to dock and recharge. iRobot says run times will vary based on floor surfaces, but the 694 is estimated to have a 90-minute battery life when cleaning hardwood floors. While 45 minutes may be enough time for the robot to scuttle around most rooms in my apartment, those with larger homes may have to wait for it to recharge in order to clean everywhere.</p><p>iRobot has made a name for itself in the autonomous vacuum market for good reason. Its machines are polished, dead simple to use and the accompanying app is excellent. That ease of use (and the reputation of the iRobot name) comes with a slightly higher asking price, which many will be willing to pay. But there are plenty of solid options now that didn\u2019t exist even just three years ago.</p><h2>Runner up: Shark Ion RV765</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=827d7835-78d6-4491-ae04-c042cab1d6e7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Target&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4MjdkNzgzNS03OGQ2LTQ0OTEtYWUwNC1jMDQyY2FiMWQ2ZTciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFyZ2V0LmNvbS9wL3NoYXJrLWlvbi13aS1maS1jb25uZWN0ZWQtcm9ib3QtdmFjdXVtLXJ2NzY1Ly0vQS04MjcxNDI5NSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmVmZTcwMDMtMGYwNi00OWRkLWJmNzUtNjUwZmI4MWMyMjJjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAalT6PmkzfsZfxJzDiO3qGHiaF94FNgs5y2_UDgpu8az&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fshark-ion-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-rv765%2F-%2FA-82714295\">Shark RV765</a> is the updated version of the RV761 that we previously recommended. Like the Roomba 694, the Shark RV765 has a slightly different design and a longer run time than the RV761, but otherwise they\u2019re the same vacuum. You can still find the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9zaGFyay1pb24tcm9ib3QtcnY3NjEtd2ktZmktY29ubmVjdGVkLXJvYm90LXZhY3V1bS13aXRoLW11bHRpLXN1cmZhY2UtY2xlYW5pbmctYmxhY2stbmF2eS1ibHVlLzYzNTkyNzIucD9za3VJZD02MzU5MjcyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWZlNzAwMy0wZjA2LTQ5ZGQtYmY3NS02NTBmYjgxYzIyMmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQOmTHM7KlGZG6FKQlq7s0wn20-dW6aJcXubfsCzzZzw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fshark-ion-robot-rv761-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-with-multi-surface-cleaning-black-navy-blue%2F6359272.p%3FskuId%3D6359272\">RV761</a>, but it\u2019s a little difficult to do so now that the latest model is available. Although we haven\u2019t tested the RV765, we feel comfortable recommending it since we found the previous version to be a great affordable robot vacuum.</p><p>One thing that the RV765 fixes about the previous version is the latter\u2019s ugly bowling-shirt design. The new model nixes that and opts for a sleeker, all-black look with three buttons for docking, cleaning and max mode. You could rely just on the buttons, but it also connects to WiFi so you can use the Shark Clean app. As for the longer run time, that\u2019s just a bonus. The RV761 ran for about 90 minutes before needing to recharge, which was plenty of time for it to clean my two-bedroom apartment. The additional 30 minutes of battery life on the RV765 should allow it to clean larger spaces more efficiently.</p><p>Some other things we liked about the RV761 include its spot-clean feature; adjustable wheels, which raise and lower automatically depending on the \u201cterrain\u201d and the obstacles in its path; and its intuitive companion app that allows you to start and stop cleaning jobs, set schedules and more.</p><h2>Best bang for your buck: Anker Eufy RoboVac 11S</h2><p></p><p>Anker\u2019s <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldWZ5LUJvb3N0SVEtU3VwZXItVGhpbi1TZWxmLUNoYXJnaW5nLU1lZGl1bS1QaWxlL2RwL0IwNzlRWVlHRjE_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1oMC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmVmZTcwMDMtMGYwNi00OWRkLWJmNzUtNjUwZmI4MWMyMjJjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcsc9HY-mZgLEN9t4_mh9inhjSM7JeTzjuXJj7Gw_naz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-BoostIQ-Super-Thin-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile%2Fdp%2FB079QYYGF1%3Fth%3D1\">$230 Eufy RoboVac 11S</a> was one of the cheapest vacuums I tested but it also proved to be one of the most versatile. First thing to note: This robot vacuum doesn\u2019t have WiFi, but it does come with a remote that gives you most of the functions and smart features you\u2019d find in an app (including a schedule feature). Eufy also includes additional brushes and filters in the box.</p><p>The \u201cS\u201d in this robot\u2019s name stands for slim, and it\u2019s roughly half an inch thinner than all of the other vacuums I tested. Not only does this make the 11S lighter, but it was the only one that could clean under my entryway table. The 11S has a physical on-off toggle on its underside plus one button on its top that you can press to start a cleaning. It always begins in auto mode, which optimizes the cleaning process as it putters around your home, but you can use the remote to select a specific cleaning mode like spot and edge clean.</p><p>The 11S has three power modes \u2014 Standard, BoostIQ and Max \u2014 and I kept mine on BoostIQ most of the time. It provided enough suction to adequately clean my carpeted floors, missing only a few crumbs or pieces of debris in corners or tight spaces around furniture. The cleaning session lasted for roughly one hour and 15 minutes when in BoostIQ mode and it has remarkable collision avoidance. Sure, it bumped into walls and some large pieces of furniture, but it was the only budget vac I tried that consistently avoided my cat\u2019s play tunnel that lives in the middle of our living room floor.</p><p>As far as noise levels go, you can definitely hear the difference between BoostIQ and Max, but none of the three settings is offensively loud. In fact, I could barely hear the 11S when it was on the opposite end of my apartment running in BoostIQ mode. Thankfully, error alert beeps were loud enough to let me know when something went awry, like the 11S accidentally getting tripped up by a rogue charging cable (which only happened a couple of times and neither robot nor cable were harmed in the process).</p><p>Overall, the Eufy RoboVac 11S impressed me with its smarts, despite its lack of WiFi. The lack of wireless connectivity is arguably the worst thing about the robot and that\u2019s saying a lot. It\u2019s worth mentioning that this model is rated for up to 1300Pa suction, but you can grab the next model up, the RoboVac 11S Max, which gives you 2000Pa suction (just know that it\u2019ll likely be louder as a result). But you can\u2019t argue with the value of the $230 11S \u2014 especially when you can often find it on sale for $160 or less.</p><p>At this point, though, the 11S is a few years old, so you could grab either the Robovac G20 or G30 if you want something comparable but a bit newer.

Most game controllers use analog joysticks with <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/48944/heres-why-ps5-joysticks-drift-and-why-theyll-only-get-worse\">potentiometers</a>, little electromechanical components that measure the stick\u2019s position by sliding a contact arm (or \u201cwiper\u201d) against a sensor to read its resistance. This is generally precise, but because the wiper has to make repeated physical contact with the resistor, the mechanism will eventually wear down, increasing the likelihood of unreliable readings. Hall effect setups, meanwhile, use magnets and an electrical conductor that don\u2019t physically touch. As the former moves in relation to the latter, the resulting change in voltage generated by the magnetic field is converted to positional data for the joystick.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/60702/sega-solved-the-drift-issue-almost-30-years-ago-heres-how\">tech isn\u2019t new</a>, and Hall effect sticks still aren\u2019t totally immune to drift. Everything breaks down eventually, and it\u2019s always possible to get a defective unit. If made right, though, Hall effect joysticks should last for several years. They also won\u2019t be as vulnerable to dust and grime.</p><figure><img alt=\"A black video game controller, 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, rests on a wooden table alongside a Nintendo Switch, a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, a Valve Steam Deck, and a Logitech gaming mouse.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/529ef9b0-0c63-11ee-957a-276f3c58457f\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>How does all of this feel in practice with 8BitDo\u2019s controller?

Adapter</a> for a few years prior to picking up the Ultimate Controller and have had no troubles with reliability.</p><p>The Hall effect sticks are the Ultimate Bluetooth Controller\u2019s major selling point, but most of its other aspects are commendable as well. I\u2019ve always found asymmetrical joysticks more natural than a side-by-side layout, so I appreciate that the general design is shaped like an Xbox controller. The whole thing is a little smaller than a Series X/S controller, but not to the point of discomfort for my relatively large hands. The face buttons are crisp and well-spaced (albeit not quite as large as the Switch Pro Controller), the bumpers are ample-sized and the analog triggers have a pleasing amount of travel.</p><p>On the back are two paddles that sit almost flush against the grips, right where my fingers naturally rest. As a racing game aficionado, I appreciate having back buttons when I\u2019m too lazy to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/thrustmaster-t300rs-gt-edition-racing-wheel-irl-153532886.html\">hook up my wheel</a>: in <em>F1 23</em>, for instance, being able to manually shift gears without taking my thumb off the steering input gives me better control over the car. The d-pad, while on the stiffer side, has been consistently accurate for rapidly moving pieces during my semi-regular <em>Tetris </em>(or <a href=\"https://tetr.io/\">TETR.IO</a>) binges, too.</p><figure><img alt=\"Four video game controllers rest on a wooden tabletop, one above the other. From the top: the Sony DualSense PlayStation 5 Controller, the Microsoft Xbox Series X/S Controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a2cccb10-0c63-11ee-9fad-b12c671b321a\" style=\"height: 1314px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>I also appreciate that the controller is so customizable. 8BitDo\u2019s Ultimate Software app lets me remap just about any button, assign macros, and create up to three settings profiles, which save to the pad itself. It\u2019s also possible to adjust the sensitivity of the vibration, joysticks and triggers. Do I constantly use all of these tweaks? No, because the default experience is pretty good. But if something ever does feel off, I can more easily address it. I have a profile for shooters like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, for example, that raises the sensitivity of the triggers so my shots register faster.</p><p>The Ultimate Bluetooth Controller costs $70, the same as a Switch Pro Controller or a DualSense. Here, though, you also get a slick-looking charging dock, which powers up via USB-C and stores the included USB wireless dongle. On the whole, the pad can connect over the dongle, Bluetooth or a USB-C cable. A switch on the back swaps between Bluetooth or WiFi, but confusingly, the former only works on Switch. I almost always use a 2.4GHz connection anyway since Bluetooth can add latency, but if I lost the dongle, I\u2019d have to use a wire on PC. Pairing is simple, though; you just have to turn on the Switch's \u201cPro Controller Wired Communication\u201d setting before using the dongle with that system's dock.</p><p>There are other minor issues. The 20-ish hours of battery life isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s well short of the 40+ hours of the Switch Pro Controller. The Switch-style face button layout is inverted on PC, so B is usually \u201cA.\u201d Like most third-party Switch controllers, the 8BitDo pad doesn\u2019t work with the console\u2019s \u201cHD Rumble\u201d feature, nor does it have an NFC reader for scanning <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/\">Amiibos</a> (if you\u2019re into that). It <em>is </em>one of the few non-Nintendo pads that can wake the Switch from sleep mode \u2014 but you have to awkwardly shake the controller to do so, and the feature only works over Bluetooth. And while the gyro controls work fine most of the time, they can be thrown off when the controller vibrates.</p><p>Those aren't dealbreakers, though. I immediately turn off most forms of motion control anyway and I\u2019m not starting an Amiibo collection anytime soon.

Gaming laptops are now cheaper <em>and </em>more powerful than ever, and many wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a classroom. If you\u2019re aiming to do some serious multimedia work alongside online play, it\u2019s worth taking a look at a dedicated gaming system. You can find general advice on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html\">choosing a gaming notebook in our guide</a>. But if you want a few models that will be perfect for school and play, you\u2019ve come to the right place.</p><h2><strong>Are gaming laptops good for school?</strong></h2><p>As we\u2019ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to games. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMvbmV3LXhwcy0xNS1sYXB0b3Avc3BkL3hwcy0xNS05NTIwLWxhcHRvcC94bjk1MjBjdG8wNDBzPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzQ0ZTNhNzMtMTc1OC0zZTI5LTgyMTItYmY2Y2Y5MDQ1YTQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAc520nFTqXJDYBVas7stlzTOAoAaD_drZ2WF60GfUMmV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-15-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9520-laptop%2Fxn9520cto040s%3F\"> Dell's XPS 15</a>, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it\u2019s worth investing what you can up front.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we'd recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today's gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won't be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you\u2019re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you're not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).</p><h2><strong>Best midrange for most people: ASUS Zephyrus G14</strong></h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-series/\">Zephyrus G14</a> is a bit more expensive than when it launched a few years ago, but it remains a fantastic 14-inch gaming laptop. This year, it\u2019s toting AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7000 CPUs and NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 4060 GPU. That\u2019s enough power to play just about any modern game in 1,440p, and they should perform smoothly on the 120Hz or 144Hz QHD screens. Unlike the first G14 model, there\u2019s also a built-in webcam with Windows Hello login support. What\u2019s most impressive is that the G14 is still pretty portable for a gaming laptop, weighing in between 3.6 and 3.8 pounds.</p><h2><strong>Best high-end option: Razer Blade 15</strong></h2><p></p><p>For years, Razer has built a reputation for making gaming laptops that look as good as MacBooks.

And, true to its name, it has <em>two</em> screens: a gorgeous 16-inch main display (with optional Mini-LED backlighting), and a very wide 14-inch secondary panel right below. That opens up a near desktop-level of multitasking, since you can have windows spread across both screens. It could help you, say, follow an online lecture while fitting in a <em>Halo Infinite</em> match on your main screen.

As six research teams showed at NYU Media Lab\u2019s <a href=\"https://knightfoundation.org/articles/ai-for-local-news-advancing-business-sustainability-in-newsrooms/\">AI &amp; Local News Initiative</a> demo day in late June, the technology may also be the key to foundationally transforming the way local news is gathered and produced.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Now in its second year, the initiative is tasked with helping local news organizations to \u201c<a href=\"https://knightfoundation.org/articles/ai-for-local-news-advancing-business-sustainability-in-newsrooms/\">harness the power of artificial intelligence to drive success</a>.\u201d It\u2019s backed as part of a larger $3 million grant from the Knight Foundation which is funding four such programs in total in partnership with the <em>Associated Press</em>, Brown Institute\u2019s Local News Lab, NYC Media Lab and the Partnership on AI.</p><p>This year\u2019s cohort included a mix of teams from academia and private industry, coming together over the course of the 12-week development course to build \u201cAI applications for local news to empower journalists, support the sustainability of news organizations and provide quality information for local news audiences,\u201d <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nyu-tandon-supports-innovators-using-ai-boost-journalism\">NYU Tandon\u2019s news service reported</a>.</p><p>\u201cThere's value in being able to bring together people who are working on these problems from a lot of different angles,\u201d Matt Macvey, Community and Project Lead for the initiative, told Engadget, \u201cand that that's what we've tried to facilitate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt also creates an opportunity because \u2026 if these news organizations that are out there doing good work are able to keep communicating their value and maintain trust with their readers,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think we could get an information ecosystem where a trusted news source becomes even more valued when it becomes easier [for anyone] to make low-quality [AI generated] content.\u201d</p><p>The six teams include Bangla AI, which is developing a web platform that surfaces and translates relevant news stories into the Bengali language for journalists and New York City\u2019s sizable Bangladeshi immigrant community.</p><p>\u201cMore than 200,000 legal Bangladeshi immigrants live in the United States, half of them in New York City,\u201d Bangla team member, MD Ashraful Goni, told reporters during the demo day. \u201cOnly half of the population are fluent in English,\u201d depriving the other half of easy access to the day\u2019s news through mainstream media outlets like the <em>New York Times</em> or the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p><p>\u201cBangla AI will search for information relevant to the people of the Bengali community that has been published in mainstream media \u2026 then it will translate for them. So when journalists use Bangla AI, they will see the information in Bengali rather than in English.\u201d The system will also generate summaries of mainstream media posts both in English and Bengali, freeing up local journalists to cover more important news than rewriting wire copy.</p><p>Similarly, the team from <a href=\"https://factchequeado.com/\">Chequeado</a>, a non-profit organization fighting disinformation in the public discourse showed off the latest developments of its Chequeabot platform, Monitorio. It leverages AI and natural language processing capabilities to streamline fact-checking efforts in Spanish-language media. Its dashboard continually monitors social media in search of trending misinformation and alerts fact checkers so they can blunt the piece\u2019s virality.</p><p>\u201cOne of the greatest promises of things like this and Bangla AI,\u201d  Chequeado team member Marcos Barroso said during the demo, \u201cis the ability for this kind of technology to go to an under-resourced newsroom and improve their capacity, and allow them to be more efficient.\u201d</p><p>The Newsroom AI team from Cornell University hope that their writing assistant platform will help do for journalists <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/natural-language-programming-ais-are-taking-the-drudgery-out-of-coding-140015594.html\">what Copilot did for coders</a> \u2013 eliminate drudge work. Newsroom can automate a number of common tasks including transcription and information organization, image and headline generation, and SEO implementation. The system will reportedly even write articles in a journalist\u2019s personal style if fed enough training examples.</p><p>On the audio side, <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/\">New York public radio WNYC\u2019s team</a> spent its time developing and prototyping a speech-to-text model that will generate real-time captioning and transcription for its live broadcasts. WNYC is the largest public media station in New York, reaching 2 million visitors monthly through its news website.</p><p>\u201cOur live broadcast doesn't have a meaningful entry point right now for deaf or hard of hearing audiences,\u201d WNYC team member, Sam Guzik, said during the demo. \u201cSo, we really want to think about as we're looking to the future is, \u2018how can we make our audio more accessible to those folks who can't hear?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Utilizing AI to perform the speech-to-text transformation alleviates one of the biggest sticking points of modern closed-captioning: that it\u2019s expensive and resource-intensive to turn around quickly when you have humans do it. \u201cSpeech-to-text models are relatively low cost,\u201d Guzik continued. \u201cThey can operate at scale and they support an API driven architecture that would tie into our experiences.\u201d</p><p>The result is a proof-of-concept audio player for the WNYC website that generates accurate closed captioning of whatever clip is currently being played. The system can go a step further by summarizing the contents of that clip in a few bullet points, simply by clicking a button on the audio player.</p><p>\u201cThis is a meaningful improvement, both for folks who can't hear,\u201d Guznik said. \u201cBut also for folks who are just not in the space where they can listen, and this is a really great tool if you're in a place where you don't have headphones and you want to follow along with what\u2019s being said.\u201c</p><p>On the back end, <a href=\"https://www.wearenobl.com/\">NOBL Media</a> has developed an ad tech product that, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ai-local-news-challenge-demo-day-tickets-653122546117?keep_tld=1\">allows programmatic advertisers to reach publishers' content</a> in service of smaller audiences that can be targeted by geography or demography,\u201d while the <a href=\"https://www.grahammedia.com/\">Graham Media Group</a> created an automated natural language text prompter to nudge the comments sections of local news articles closer towards civility.</p><p>\u201cThe comment-bot posts the first comment on stories to guide conversations and hopefully grow participation and drive users deeper into our engagement funnels,\u201d GMG team member Dustin Block said during the demo. This solves two significant challenges that human comment moderation faces: preventing the loudest voices from dominating the discussion and providing form and structure to the conversation, he explained.</p><p>\u201dThe bot scans and understands news articles using the GPT 3.5 Turbo API. It generates thought-provoking starters and then it encourages discussions,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt's crafted to be friendly.\u201d</p><p>Whether the AI revolution remains friendly to the journalists it\u2019s presumably augmenting remains to be seen, though Macvey isn\u2019t worried. \u201cMost news organizations, especially local news organizations, are so tight on resources and staff that there's more happening out there than they can cover,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think tools like AI and [the automations seen during the demo day] enable the journalists and editorial staff more bandwidth.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-ai-could-help-local-newsrooms-remain-afloat-in-a-sea-of-misinformation-130023064.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-ai-could-help-local-newsrooms-remain-afloat-in-a-sea-of-misinformation-130023064.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-10T13:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best smart scales for 2023", "description": "<p>Data is a useful tool in any battle, especially if you\u2019re opting to wage war against your waistline in an attempt to be healthier. Back in 2007, I bought a dirt-cheap scale and drew my own graph sheets in order to chart my weight\u2019s downward progress after a rough year at university. I think that while 2007 me wouldn\u2019t be pleased with my own fitness journey, he would love the fact that the process is entirely automated, and affordable. Consequently, allow me to take you (and him) on a journey to pick the best smart scale to help you on your own journey toward behavior change and improving your overall health.</p><h2>Safety</h2><p>There are valid reasons to weigh yourself, but your self-worth shouldn\u2019t be defined by the number that shows up between your feet. If you\u2019re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down, since muscle weighs more than fat. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of public health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said that \u201cweighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day, rather than the overall trend over time.\u201d Swift added that \u201cit\u2019s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>(A meta-analysis from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742706/\">2016</a> found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.138.suppl_1.10962\">2018 study</a>, however, said that there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield, and I\u2019d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember that success won\u2019t happen overnight.)</p><h2>What to look for in a smart scale</h2><h3>Weight</h3><p>A weighing scale that weighs you is probably the top requirement, right? One thing to bear in mind is that, with all these measurements, the figures won\u2019t be as accurate as a calibrated, clinical scale. Consequently, it\u2019s better to focus on the overall full body weight trend up or down over time, rather than the figures in isolation.</p><h3>Connectivity</h3><p>Most scales will either connect to your phone over Bluetooth, or to your home\u2019s WiFi network, and you should work out your regular weighing routine ahead of time. A lot of lower-end, Bluetooth-only scales will only record your weight when your phone is present and don\u2019t keep local records. That means if you routinely leave your phone outside the bathroom, you could lose that day\u2019s stats. WiFi scales, on the other hand, post your stats to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. But you need to be mindful that there\u2019s a small risk to your privacy should that information be compromised.</p><h3>Bone density</h3><p>The stronger your bones, the less you\u2019re at risk from breaks and osteoporosis, which you should keep in mind as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays but higher-end scales can offer an approximation from your own bathroom. These bone mass tests pass a small current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, and your scale can identify the difference.</p><h3>Body fat percentage and muscle mass</h3><p>Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but an excessive amount of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a scale can identify both your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists the electrical signal passing through your body. (It\u2019s a rough rule of thumb that you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.)</p><h3>BMI</h3><p>A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it\u2019s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/\">overly simplistic</a> and often <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/august/obesitymortality-paradox-demon\">greatly misleading</a>. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also one of the most common clinical metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.</p><h3>Pulse Wave Velocity</h3><p>French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period of time. It\u2019s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and also other health conditions. I\u2019ve had anecdotal reports that PWV scales have sent people to the doctor, where they\u2019ve found they were close to a cardiac event. It\u2019s worth saying, as with all of these technologies, that there is limited, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32168728/\">albeit positive</a>, research into how accurate these systems are.</p><h3>Display</h3><p>Less a specification and more a note that smart scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day\u2019s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you\u2019ve found your glasses / contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.</p><h3>App and subscriptions</h3><p>You\u2019ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion app, and it\u2019s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don\u2019t need to buy anything before trying the app, it\u2019s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it.</p><p>Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features \u2013 including insights and coaching \u2013 to go along with your hardware. Fitbit and Withings both offer these services, which you may feel is worth the extra investment each month.</p><h3>Data portability</h3><p>Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you\u2019ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is, or should be, your right to take that data to another provider when you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.</p><p>All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLWdiL2d1aWRlL2lwaG9uZS9pcGg1ZWRlNThjM2QvaW9zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmFmMmE1Ni1kZTk5LTRhNDMtOGJkOS1kNWU1NzY4MjVlODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZCtZe_M4AKLG6lYTWvN8T0ow_5B8_ackKhQ43NQGnWK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-gb%2Fguide%2Fiphone%2Fiph5ede58c3d%2Fios\">output all of your health data</a> in a .XML file.)</p><h3>Power</h3><p>It\u2019s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Sadly, all of our crop of smart scales use batteries, adding an environmental and financial cost to your scale life. That\u2019s just about forgivable for scales that cost under $100, but this stretches even to the highest-end models. When you\u2019re spending more than that on a device, the lack of a rechargeable cell feels very, very cheap indeed.</p><h2>The smart scales we tested</h2><p>For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:</p><h3><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9YaWFvbWktQ29tcG9zaXRpb24tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLVN0YXRpc3RpY3MtU21hcnRwaG9uZS9kcC9CMDdYTkhXMkpIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmFmMmE1Ni1kZTk5LTRhNDMtOGJkOS1kNWU1NzY4MjVlODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ_n5jXiqBRDOptIAu84EmySDSs5Qwbio4LWHd3rYib8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXiaomi-Composition-Bluetooth-Statistics-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB07XNHW2JH\">Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2</a> ($29.99)</h3><figure><img alt=\"Stock image of Xiaomi's Body Comp Scale\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/5682ca60-7704-11ed-b7ef-e04eaf660ec8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi\u2019s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows.

For your money, however, you\u2019ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin\u2019s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware\u2019s overall sleek look. If there\u2019s a downside, it\u2019s that they ditched the rechargeable battery found in the Withings Body Cardio (its former flagship, and an excellent scale I\u2019d recommend if it were within the parameters of this guide) in favor of AAA batteries.

Fitbit\u2019s scale has far fewer features, but has better build quality, is faster and more reliable than its cheaper rival. Crucially, it also leverages the Fitbit app, which is refined and easy-to-use, offering clean, easy-to understand visualizations.</p><p>Xiaomi, meanwhile, offers weight and some basic body composition checks, although this extra data is only visualized inside the app. From a data perspective, the Xiaomi has the edge, but its companion app \u2013 formerly Mi Fit, now branded as Zepp Life \u2013 is terrible. The lag time for each weigh-in, too, leaves a lot to be desired with the Xiaomi, although I had no qualms about its accuracy.</p><p>When I was a kid, and complained about something, my nan would say \u201clook, you can either have a first class walk or a third class ride.\u201d And Fitbit\u2019s scale here is the very definition of a first class ride \u2013 polished, snappy and with a world-class app by its side. The Xiaomi, meanwhile, offers more for your money, and charges less, but both hardware and software lack any sort of polish. It\u2019s therefore up to you if you\u2019d rather the first class walk or the third class ride.</p><h2>The best scale for people who want features (and aren\u2019t fussed about security): Eufy\u2019s P2 Pro</h2><p></p><p>Well, this is awkward. Not long before this guide was published, it was revealed that <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldWZ5LUJhdGhyb29tLUJsdWV0b290aC1NZWFzdXJlbWVudHMtSW5jbHVkaW5nL2RwL0IwOU5IUjROWDcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmFmMmE1Ni1kZTk5LTRhNDMtOGJkOS1kNWU1NzY4MjVlODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkVA5ofcfXgBHkGUcOOXsKMlPTtBM0pu-dOKiWpfQM9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\">Eufy</a> is in the midst of a massive security issue. Researchers found that its security cameras, which were promised to be secure, allowed internet users to access the stream using VLC player. Consequently the high praise for Eufy\u2019s P2 Pro I have as a scale will need to be moderated by the fact that we don\u2019t yet know how deep the company\u2019s promises around privacy and security really run.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate, as the scale does leap head-and-shoulders above the competition at this level, and it surpassed my expectations by quite a bit. The ease of use was one thing, but the depth of metric data made available in the app, and the way it presents that information, is fantastic. While I don\u2019t think the Eufy Life app is better than, say, Withings\u2019 class-leading Health Mate, it offers exactly what a would-be weight-watcher would need.</p><p>The fact you can get plenty of your vital statistics graphed by hitting two buttons helps you visualize your progress, but the stat dashboard laying out everything, including your BMR, is so useful. If you\u2019re going all Quantified Self, you could theoretically calculate your daily calorie intake to the finest of fine margins looking at this thing every morning.</p><h2>The best scale for athletes: Garmin Index S2</h2><p></p><p>I\u2019m very partial to <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HYXJtaW4tV2lyZWxlc3MtQ29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LU1lYXN1cmUtTXVzY2xlL2RwL0IwOEpRUFJOVlg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tY3ItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyYWYyYTU2LWRlOTktNGE0My04YmQ5LWQ1ZTU3NjgyNWU4MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZHC0N0m24_KjtwpGTvy7iEUBJ4c3t1O5sr-aJEhmGpA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGarmin-Wireless-Connectivity-Measure-Muscle%2Fdp%2FB08JQPRNVX\">Garmin\u2019s Index S2</a>, but I also think it\u2019s the sort of scale that needs to be used by people who know what they\u2019re doing. Almost everything about the hardware is spot-on, and the only fly in its ointment is the low refresh rate on its color screen. I can\u2019t say how upsetting it was to see the display refresh in such a laggy, unpolished manner, especially when you\u2019re spending this much money. But that\u2019s my only complaint, and the rest of the hardware (and software) is otherwise pitch-perfect. If you\u2019re looking to set goals to alter your body shape, this probably isn\u2019t the scale for you \u2013 it\u2019s the scale you buy once you already calculate your BMR on a daily basis.</p><h2>The best scale for the worried well: Withings Body Comp</h2><p></p><p>Naturally, if you\u2019re looking for a machine that\u2019ll cater to your every whim and hypochondriac urge, then <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d3b3fb13-488a-4810-a40f-ee84ae8f2918&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Withings&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkM2IzZmIxMy00ODhhLTQ4MTAtYTQwZi1lZTg0YWU4ZjI5MTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2l0aGluZ3MuY29tL3VzL2VuL2JvZHktY29tcCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAc8X9rt-aX4wH02_myPQh5OPGfGfhGCp4LvKeEkxPEmJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.withings.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fbody-comp\">Withings\u2019 Body Comp</a> is the way forward.

Apart from the batteries, which I\u2019ve already said is a cheap and nasty way to save money given that you\u2019re dropping this much money on a product.</p><p>The group of people who think it\u2019s reasonable to spend $200 on a scale is, especially with food and energy prices spiking, a fairly small one. But if you\u2019re the sort who already spends hand over fist to keep your body in check, this is probably justifiable as an \u201cinvestment.\u201d Knowing all of the extras about your nerve health and arteries is a bonus, but let\u2019s be clear and say this isn\u2019t the top pick for everybody.

It's based on the company's PaLM 2 large language model (LLM) that underpins Bard, Google's ChatGPT rival \u2014 and was launched <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-its-multilingual-code-generating-palm-2-language-model-180805304.html\">just months ago at Google I/O</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the base model, Med-PaLM-2 has been trained on questions and answer from medical licensing exams, along with a curated set of medical expert demonstrations. That gives it expertise in answering health-related questions, and it can also do labor-intensive tasks like summarizing documents and organizing research data, according to the report.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During I/O, Google released a paper detailing its work on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09617.pdf\">Med-PaLM2</a>. On the positive side, it demonstrated features like \"alignment with medical consensus,\" reasoning ability, and even the ability to generate answers that were preferred by respondents over physician-generated responses. More negatively, it showed the same accuracy problems we've seen on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html\">other Chat AI models</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft is also developing medical AI chat tech based on OpenAI's ChatGPT, having teamed up with the healthcare software company Epic.

Both companies have promised to keep patient information confidential, saying they don't train their models on patient data. Last month, Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/health/doctors-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html\">expressed alarm</a> about its ChatGPT technology being used by doctors to improve communications with patients.&nbsp;</p><p>In an internal email seen by the <em>WSJ</em>, Google said it believes the updated model could \"be of tremendous value in countries that have more limited access to doctors.\" Still, Google has admitted that the technology is still in its early stages. \"I don\u2019t feel that this kind of technology is yet at a place where I would want it in my family\u2019s healthcare journey,\" said Google senior research director Greg Corrado. However, he added that the tech \"takes the places in healthcare where AI can be beneficial and expands them by 10-fold.\"&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-testing-its-medical-ai-chatbot-at-the-mayo-clinic-102055669.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-is-testing-its-medical-ai-chatbot-at-the-mayo-clinic-102055669.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-10T10:20:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Elgato's Stream Deck+ gets its first discount at Amazon", "description": "<p>If you're looking to up your streaming game this summer, now might be the time to do it. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTDhTSjU5Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xbzAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI2NTQ2OWIwLTQ1MTYtNDhjNC05YWVhLTc1MmRkMGUwOGQzYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATOUidxkkxP_0zsrIKj4wZEg8nkb2dNgup5jq_8FzkLe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJL8SJ59%2F\">Elgato's Stream Deck +</a> is down from $200 to $180 \u2014 a ten percent discount.
