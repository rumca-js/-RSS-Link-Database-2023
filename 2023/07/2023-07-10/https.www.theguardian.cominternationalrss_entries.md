<p>Cookery hasn’t been this sexy since since Nigella wore silk robes to lick chocolate from a spoon</p><p>He leans over a sizzling saucepan, wearing a well-fitting T-shirt that shows off his tattooed arms. To protect his T-shirt (ones that make your arms look that good don’t come cheap), he is wearing an apron – dark denim, or maybe even leather, but definitely some kind of masculine fabric, a bit blacksmith-adjacent. He rakes back his hair from an aesthetically sweat-beaded brow and frowns in concentration as he adjusts the seasoning. Mmmm, delicious. Is this making you hungry? Or is it making you … “thirsty”, as the kids say?</p><p>The hot chef, lust-object <em>de nos jours</em>, is about to get even hotter. The second series of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/05/the-bear-review-should-you-watch-this-genius-kitchen-drama-immediately-yes-chef">The Bear</a>, already streaming in the US and available in the UK from 19 July, brings grouchy-yet-inexplicably-adorable chef “Carmy” Berzatto, played by Jeremy Allen White, back to our screens just as summer hits its peak. Oh, and if you have a sweet tooth, you may be interested to hear about the new guest star – pastry chef Luca, played by 30-year-old British actor Will Poulter, who told Variety magazine he “<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/will-poulter-the-bear-luca-hot-chef-1235657992/">literally begged</a> to be in the show” to realise “a dream of playing a chef on TV” and that he has an “immense amount of respect” for people in the food and service industry. To prepare for the role, Poulter spent time in the kitchen at the London restaurants St John, Black Axe Mangal (now F.K.A.B.A.M.), and Trullo. He described one particular shift in the Black Axe Mangal kitchen as “maybe the most satisfying day of work I’ve ever had in my life”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/10/the-bears-back-beckhams-at-the-aga-theres-a-pastry-chef-with-his-top-off-its-hot-chef-summer">Continue reading...</a>

Speaking to CNN, the US president said Nato needed to “lay out a rational path” for Kyiv to follow in order to join the bloc, but that it would take time before the country met “all the qualifications, from democratisation to a whole range of other issues”.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was hoping for “the best possible result” from the summit</strong>, following talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy has said he does not expect Ukraine to actually join Nato until after the war but that he hopes the summit will give a “clear signal” on the intention to bring Ukraine into the alliance.</p><p><strong>Biden has arrived in London ahead of the Nato summit</strong> and is set to discuss Ukraine with the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak.</p><p><strong>The US president spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, by phone on Sunday and “conveyed his desire to welcome Sweden into Nato as soon as possible”</strong>, the White House said. Washington <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/06/biden-ratchets-up-efforts-to-secure-swedens-nato-membership-ahead-of-key-summit">has been increasing pressure on Ankara</a> to drop its opposition to Sweden’s all-but-cleared Nato membership bid ahead of the Vilnius summit.</p><p>Erdogan’s office said separately that<strong> the Turkish leader had reaffirmed to Biden his longstanding position that Sweden still needed to crack down harder on suspected Kurdish militants</strong> to win Turkey’s support. It said the two presidents would meet on the sidelines of the summit.</p><p><strong>The Nato meeting comes as members of Biden’s own Democratic party, rights groups and the UN raised questions about the US decision to send cluster bombs</strong>, which have been banned by more than 100 countries, to Ukraine. US senator Tim Kaine told Fox News he had “some real qualms” about the move because it “could give a green light to other nations to do something different as well”.</p><p><strong>Germany’s president has said the country should not “block” the US from sending cluster bombs to Ukraine</strong>, while maintaining its opposition to the use of the weapon. “Germany’s position against the use of cluster munitions is as justified as ever. But we cannot, in the current situation, block the United States,” President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told German broadcaster ZDF on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Russian air defence systems shot down four missiles on Sunday</strong>, Russian officials said, one over the annexed Crimean peninsula and three over Russia’s Rostov and Bryansk regions that border Ukraine. Several buildings were damaged in Rostov and Bryansk but no casualties were reported. No casualties or damage were reported in Crimea.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian forces are “making progress” around the eastern city of Bakhmut</strong>, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, has said. Russian forces captured Bakhmut in May after months of heavy fighting but are thought to be struggling to maintain control of it.</p><p><strong>South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said next month’s Brics summit, which Vladimir Putin has been invited to attend, will be held in-person</strong> despite an arrest warrant on the Russian leader. “The Brics summit is going ahead and we are finalising our discussions on the format,” Ramaphosa told South African journalists on Sunday on the sidelines of a conference by the ruling ANC, adding it would be a “physical” meeting.</p><p><em>With Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-502-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
