His company is now joined in the battle for military supremacy via artificial intelligence.

The enemy, obviously. Which they will be able to identify reliably, always acting within the rules of engagement. I mean, there may be tricky moments along the way. Paul Scharre, former US army Ranger and author of Army of None, remembers the unspoken agreement among his men not to shoot when insurgents sent an eight-year-old girl out ahead of them to scout for danger.

SEMA runs courses in both music production and DJing, and the focus is placed on creating community and culture as much as it is on technical skills. Students learn how to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZmOnfGaErk\">ethically interact</a> with traditional music, and are encouraged to engage with topics around identity, class and gender. Out of the 150 students that have been trained by SEMA over the past two years, 55% have been non-male, with the balance tipping even further in recent courses.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/10/kenya-dj-programme-promoting-community-inclusivity-santuri-electronic-music-academy\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/10/kenya-dj-programme-promoting-community-inclusivity-santuri-electronic-music-academy", "date_published": "2023-07-10T07:22:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Can you repurpose old eyeshadow as nail polish? | Anita Bhagwandas on beauty trends", "description": "<p>If you enjoy doing your nails, perhaps give this a go.

Forced to close their doors because of Covid-19, they then had to adjust to a new landscape, all while the arts and culture budget was slashed at like a pi\u00f1ata by the government. It makes the Art Fund Museum of the Year<strong> </strong>prize feel like a chance to take a breather and reflect.</p><p>This year\u2019s winner will take home \u00a3120,000 and be announced in a ceremony at the British Museum on 12 July, with the four runners-up each receiving \u00a315,000. The nominees are: Scapa Flow, a remote body of water in Orkney, Scotland, which once housed Vikings and, during both world wars, the British naval fleet, and which has been transformed into a museum to document the human stories that unfurled there; Glasgow\u2019s Burrell Collection, which reopened this spring after a six-year, \u00a368.25m refurbishment; the Natural History Museum, filled with precious wonders of the natural world, and a rite of passage for schoolchildren on trips; Belfast\u2019s Mac, a theatre and exhibition venue that has given space for a new generation of Northern Irish artists to find their voice; and Leighton House in London, once the opulent abode of legendary painter Frederic Leighton.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/10/such-a-beautiful-creature-chris-packham-dan-snow-and-more-on-their-favourite-museum-exhibit\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/10/such-a-beautiful-creature-chris-packham-dan-snow-and-more-on-their-favourite-museum-exhibit", "date_published": "2023-07-10T04:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Years of trauma came out\u2019: surgery victim on interrupting Humza Yousaf", "description": "<p>Theresa Mallett spoke out during first minister\u2019s speech to call for public inquiry into Sam Eljamel</p><p>When Theresa Mallett walked into Caird Hall in Dundee a little more than a fortnight ago, it was not her intention to bring Humza Yousaf\u2019s keynote address to a standstill.</p><p>Mallett, a committed nationalist, was attending the independence convention as an SNP member, but had hoped that she might tell her story to a party worker or journalist at the event.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/10/theresa-mallett-snp-humza-yousaf-public-inquiry\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/10/theresa-mallett-snp-humza-yousaf-public-inquiry", "date_published": "2023-07-10T04:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018If you want cartwheels, I\u2019m not your person\u2019: Rachel Reeves on charisma, U-turns and rescuing the economy", "description": "<p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor is proud of her background, sure of her ability \u2013 and miserable about the choices she might face after a general election</p><p>A member of Rachel Reeves\u2019 team asks if I can meet the shadow chancellor in Kettering, Northamptonshire, because she wants to provide the Guardian with \u201coriginal colour\u201d.
