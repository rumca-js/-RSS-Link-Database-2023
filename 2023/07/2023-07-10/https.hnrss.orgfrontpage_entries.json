It\u2019s about people, community, communication and truth.<p>Throw is the new space for asking and answering questions anonymously. We believe that in today\u2019s world (both online and offline) content in communication exchanges is strongly influenced by the personas, profiles and fa\u00e7ades people maintain/upkeep/safeguard socially, ideologically and on relationships.<p>From the way people post on Instagram the life they want others to believe they have, or the way people behave on thanksgiving with family, or at work, or with friends; on every social setting and interaction to some degree acting and behaving according to that setting and the people they interact with. These dynamics influence the content itself, as people don\u2019t just respond to a question like computers do. What ends up happening is that the responder comes up with the answer by blending the possibly objective answer with feelings, setting, desires, commitments, ideologies, fears, insecurities, etc (social pressure or social agenda).<p>Something is missing between social media and the traditional Q&amp;A\u2026<p>Throw addresses this by creating a space free from this social agenda. Thus focusing strictly on the content exchanged and providing a safe, comfortable and unbiased space where people can ask and answer anything freely with no bias, fears or strings attached.<p>We've put key components of social media, Q&amp;A and surveying industries into one platform.<p>Not only may Throw be used for personal and private questions and answers. But the power of crowdsourcing allows for a great variety of use cases like market research, validation of content and ideas, trivia, and much more. Serious matters and also just for fun\u2026<p>It\u2019s a query marketplace which means that \u201cthrowers\u201d (people who ask questions) pay a fee proportional to the answers they need and in turn \u201ccatchers\u201d (who catch them and respond) get compensated. This way we guarantee every user gets as many responses as he/she needs.<p>As for dealing with anonymity, we have built a sophisticated moderation protocol to neutralize and quickly ban people that contribute negatively as it is a priority people feel safe and comfortable in this community.<p>We have worked very hard to create a delightful product and are basically launching today!<p>If this is something that may be of your interest or you\u2019d like to be one of the first to test it out download our app and play around with it.\n<a href=\"https://www.trythrow.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.trythrow.com</a><p>Also, if you have questions there is additional information in the FAQs section on our web page that could be of help.<p>Finally, we really appreciate any feedback we can get (of any kind). So if there's anything you like, don't like, or any other thought about Throw, we'd love to hear about it! You may post a comment below or through the contact section on the web page.<p>Be curious and dare to know!<p>Thank you!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36673280\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36673280</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>", "link": "https://www.trythrow.com", "date_published": "2023-07-10T21:34:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Self-hosted photo and video backup solution directly from your mobile phone", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/immich-app/immich\">https://github.com/immich-app/immich</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36673224\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36673224</a></p>\n<p>Points: 52</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "link": "https://github.com/immich-app/immich", "date_published": "2023-07-10T21:28:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: A hash array-mapped trie implementation in C", "description": "<p>Long-simmering side project that is finally ready to see the light.

How can I leverage my new location to skill up in dev?", "description": "<p>Against the trend, just moved to SF from a mid size hub-of-nothing city of the East Coast. My GF got an internship in biotech and I work remote so here we are at least until January.<p>I'm self taught, have a technical high school degree in electronics and computers, and an AA that I meant to use to start a CS degree back in the east coast before we moved.<p>My work is a mix of App support with light software dev. I mostly support and update old apps written using ASP.NET (of which I know almost nothing), Nintex workflows that should've never been, make little scripts for ServiceNow virtual agent, and we have a series of low code apps that I also support, modify, etc. I replaced a guy who was also self taught and had no best-practices checks.<p>I'm solo in this endeavor since my product owner is not a developer and my other peer mostly deals with the red tape and administrative stuff like dealing with InfoSec's recurring paperwork and vendor licenses. Happy to have him, but I can't skill up in my field.<p>I'm now much closer to all the tech brain power of the country, and I'm trying to figure how to leverage my stay to improve my skills. I work 5AM to 1:30PM and so I have the whole evening open to feed my brain.<p>Are there any groups, meetups, schools, apprenticeships, or whatever else I could use to become a better dev? I know I could enroll in a CS degree and I do want that, but I already know of that answer.<p>I'd love to work on tools for people outside of the field that maybe boosts their productivity or makes their lives easier.\nA few months ago I worked with my GF to make an app that helps her identify cyanobacteria automating a process they used to do in MS Word and it was super satisfying, but I know it can be much better if I had someone to work with.<p>Anyway, any idea will be very appreciated, even if you are in the same position I'm in and you'd like to meet to work on something.<p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661845\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661845</a></p>\n<p>Points: 27</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661845", "date_published": "2023-07-10T03:50:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Car rental throwing away money?", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://games.greggman.com/game/stupid-car-rental/\">https://games.greggman.com/game/stupid-car-rental/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661478\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661478</a></p>\n<p>Points: 36</p>\n<p># Comments: 35</p>", "link": "https://games.greggman.com/game/stupid-car-rental/", "date_published": "2023-07-10T02:49:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: React95 \u2013 a React components library recreating the look of Windows 95", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/React95/React95\">https://github.com/React95/React95</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661070\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36661070</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://github.com/React95/React95", "date_published": "2023-07-10T01:49:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Methods for increasing efficiency of solar cells with silicon and perovskite", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2023-07-methods-efficiency-solar-cells-silicon.html\">https://techxplore.com/news/2023-07-methods-efficiency-solar-cells-silicon.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36660995\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36660995</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-07-methods-efficiency-solar-cells-silicon.html", "date_published": "2023-07-10T01:37:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: (How much) do you get paid for being on call?", "description": "<p>Do you get extra comp for being on call?
