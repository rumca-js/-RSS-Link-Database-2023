<p>Lots of people are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/10/tech/twitter-threads-future/index.html">joining Threads</a>, and that includes Shang-Chi star and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/simu-liu-reacts-to-shang-chis-huge-opening-weekend/1100-6495964/"> former stock photo model</a> Simu Liu, who posted on his account requesting that fans ask him anything. As you would expect, someone asked about the next Shang-Chi movie, and Liu offered up what he knows <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuXtotMyWUo/">in response</a>.</p><p>"[I] was told it would follow Avengers," Liu wrote. "But that keeps pushing back due to circumstances beyond my control. Hope to have more concrete news to share soon."</p><p>Liu didn't elaborate on those circumstances--lest he run afoul of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lokis-owen-wilson-says-marvel-studios-is-kind-of-uptight-about-spoilers/1100-6506648/">Marvel Studios' spoiler police</a>--but there are a few things to consider.

## Pokemon Sleep Knows Exactly What Will Get You Sleeping Better

<p>Some of my favorite things to do are to sleep and play video games, so when I heard about Select Button's new app Pokemon Sleep, I was immediately intrigued. Like Pokemon Go, Sleep will be free-to-play on mobile devices, but whereas Go was played while walking, your primary means of interaction here is done by sleeping. Rather than battling other Pokemon or trying to be the best trainer, Pokemon Sleep focuses on collecting as many Pokemon as possible by, as the name suggests, getting a healthy amount of sleep. I was able to test out the app for myself for a night, and I thought it was a great way to help those who struggle to sleep get a good night's rest. There's even a narrative reason for why you'll need to be sleeping.</p><p dir="ltr">In Pokemon Sleep, you'll be working alongside Professor Neroli, who's studying the habits of Pokemon with a specific interest in a group of Snorlax on a chain of islands. These Snorlax have a mysterious power that puts nearby Pokemon to sleep, so to help further his studies, Professor Neroli creates a device called Sleep Synchronizer, which syncs the affected Pokemon's sleep with yours. After waking up from a night of sleep, you'll be greeted with a few Pokemon that can join your party to help grow the Snorlax to help further understand why these Pokemon are falling asleep. Each week, you'll visit a different island with a new Snorlax that will have their own favorite berries and dishes you can feed them, boosting their ability to put more Pokemon to sleep.</p><figure style="width: 1080px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4163624-pokemonsleepscreenshot10.png"><img alt="The Snorlax is just like me." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1746/17463818/4163624-pokemonsleepscreenshot10.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The Snorlax is just like me.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you're ready to sleep, you press a button and place your phone next to you in bed with the screen facing down, and it will begin to track your sleep via your breathing. For the app to work, your phone must be on a bed or pillow because if it is placed on a hard surface, it won't work. You're actively encouraged to sleep more because when you wake up, you'll receive a "Sleep Score." The closer you get to a full eight and a half hours of sleep, the more points you'll receive. But if you're someone who likes to take multiple naps throughout the day, you sadly can't use shorter naps to make any progress. Though the game allows players to log up to two sleep sessions a day, the app only tracks those lasting longer than 90 minutes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sleep-knows-exactly-what-will-get-you-sleeping-better/1100-6515823/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Barbie and Oppenheimer may not sound like an obvious pairing on paper.

## Hearthstone "Titans" Card Reveal: Ignis, The Eternal Flame Lets You Craft Custom Weaponry

<p>Hearthstone is preparing to introduce the most powerful characters in Warcraft lore with the upcoming Titans expansion. As the name suggests, it centers around the god-like Titans, introducing new and powerful minions and spells to the long-running card game. Every good pantheon of the gods needs a blacksmith, and so GameSpot can exclusively reveal the Titan forge-master: the neutral legendary <strong>Ignis, the Eternal Flame</strong>.</p><p>Ignis relies on the new Titans expansion keyword, <strong>Forge</strong>. If a card has the Forge keyword, you can drag it to the forge (your deck) to hammer out an extra ability at the cost of two mana. Ignis' special ability will trigger if you've used a Forge ability at any point over the course of the game--and it's a powerful payoff for packing some Forge cards in your deck.</p><p>Ignis lets you build your own customized weapon by selecting options from three phases. First, you choose your weapon cost, which grants its attack and durability stats. Next, you select from one of five traits, like Poisonous or Windfury. Finally, you'll select from one of five special abilities, like drawing cards or dealing direct damage. Those special abilities are determined by the strength of your weapon, so for example, if you chose a higher-tier weapon, you'll draw more cards.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-titans-card-reveal-ignis-the-eternal-flame-lets-you-craft-custom-weaponry/1100-6515786/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Indie Developer Makes SkiFree, But You're The Yeti For Game Jam

<p>If you're a gamer of a certain age, you probably have fond memories of SkiFree, an early PC game that put you in the role of a skier competing in slalom, freestyle, or tree slalom. However, SkiFree is perhaps best known for its version of the abominable snowman, who eats you after you complete a run. Now, an indie developer named Robert Shenton has created a version of the game where you play as the hungry yeti that eats hapless skiers.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">For <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMTKJam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#GMTKJam</a> I made SkiFree, but you're the yeti <a href="https://t.co/lUOOjgPNhT">pic.twitter.com/lUOOjgPNhT</a></p>  — Robert Shenton (@miltage) <a href="https://twitter.com/miltage/status/1678082509374889988?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 9, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Created as part of Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2023, the little game is called <a href="https://miltage.itch.io/yeti-upsetti">Yeti Upsetti</a>, and it's exactly what it sounds like. You control the yeti from SkiFree as they run around and try to eat as many skiers as possible before you "die of hunger." It's playable in your browser, and it works with most controllers. Personally, I recommend sticking to the trees, as it seems that skiers tend to run into them a lot.</p><p dir="ltr">Shenton said on Twitter that the game has gotten a lot more traction than he expected. If you have nostalgia for SkiFree, it's a fun little experience that's worth a few tries. Unlike what your childhood friend may have told you, it's actually impossible by design to avoid the yeti's chase after a SkiFree round, though some <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/2637/is-it-possible-to-escape-the-yeti-in-skifree">online sources</a> say you can avoid him by pressing the F key and going directly to the left or right.

You can relive Indiana Jones' iconic brush with death in a Temple of the Golden Idol set that comes with an ancient treasure, spherical death-traps, and a tiny fedora for the famed archeologist. For a few small gift ideas under $10, Best Buy has the Lego City Fire Helicopter and a race car project for just $8 each. On the Star Wars side of this sale, there's a detailed TIE Bomber for $56. Avatar fans can build a cinematic showdown, and anyone wanting to visit Joey can put together the apartments from Friends.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4163524-lego-prime-2.jpg"><img alt="No Lego snakes included, much to Indy's delight." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4163524-lego-prime-2.jpg" /></a><figcaption>No Lego snakes included, much to Indy's delight.</figcaption></figure><p>For something more technical, there's a few Technic sets available as well.

## WoW: Dragonflight Is Flying High, But Can Blizzard Keep The Wind Beneath Its Wings?

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> is currently the best it's been in a long, long time. Reviews for Dragonflight, the game's latest expansion released in November 2022, were positive. Player reception to the expansion seems to be, too. Content updates, even the smaller ones, have been substantial and frequent, with developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-will-receive-two-major-content-updates-in-2023-alongside-four-minor-ones/1100-6510225/">Blizzard so far delivering on its 2023 content roadmap promises</a>. Add the fact that Blizzard seems more open and responsive to fan feedback than ever before, and WoW feels like it's in a great place.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a place that Blizzard has been before. Fans will likely think back to the game's 2016 Legion expansion as the last time that Blizzard's long-running MMORPG felt like it was firing on all cylinders. Legion received multiple major content patches and was well-loved by players. But Legion's success in many ways came at the cost of updates for its preceding Warlords of Draenor expansion (viewed by many as one of the game's lowest points) and the launch content for its subsequent expansion, Battle for Azeroth. Both expansions were heavily criticized and unpopular, but 2020's Shadowlands expansion (despite strong initial sales) in many ways would encapsulate the worst aspects of both Warlords of Draenor and Battle for Azeroth. Too many mandatory "borrowed power" systems and huge amounts of time between disappointing updates meant that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-wow-next-expansion-blizzard-must-learn-from-shadowlands-mistakes/1100-6501490/">Shadowlands came to represent an all-time low in the history of WoW</a>.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Blizzard isn't looking to repeat those same mistakes with Dragonflight and whatever comes next. In an interview with GameSpot, WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas said the expansion of the WoW team in recent years and how it's handling development in 2023 is built around the idea of keeping up with player demand for updates while also making sure the more frequent update schedule is sustainable.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-is-flying-high-but-can-blizzard-keep-the-wind-beneath-its-wings/1100-6515812/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The study found that the selection of games currently available for official purchase (digital or physical) represent only 13% of video game history, with the rest either being unavailable entirely or requiring the use of unofficial downloads, emulators, and/or fan remakes to play.</p><p>"For accessing <em>nearly 9 in 10 </em>classic games, there are few options: Seek out and maintain vintage collectible games and hardware, travel across the country to visit a library, or… piracy," the VGHF stated in the report it released alongside the data. "None of those options are desirable, which means that most video games are inaccessible to all but the most diehard and dedicated fans. That’s pretty grim!"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/87-of-classic-videos-games-are-endangered-according-to-new-study/1100-6515806/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's no secret that Diablo IV can be a pretty compelling game thanks to its fantastic gameplay loop and well-crafted loot system. However, the game's developers have some advice for those who are done with its content: maybe try playing something else.</p><p dir="ltr">Associate game director Joseph Piepiora offered words of wisdom to this effect during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ih-nvMvxV8">livestream</a> promoting Diablo IV's upcoming seasonal update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-diablo-4s-season-of-the-malignant-story-what-to-expect-in-the-future/1100-6515768/">Season of the Malignant</a>. Here's the full quote: "When you’ve reached all the goals and done the things you think are important, take a break." He also said that the people behind the game "do the same" in order to fully enjoy the game, and that a new season launch is the perfect time to check out what you've missed in Diablo IV over the intervening months.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo IV released to positive reviews from both critics and fans alike, but not all of the feedback has been positive. Some players expressed surprise with Blizzard's decision to require you to create new characters in order to participate in each season. Series general manager Rod Fergusson defended the rule, stating that the developers want each season to be "a fresh start for everybody" and that players have "a starting point together" regardless of total playtime.

<p>Mario Strikers: Battle League is discounted to only $40 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09SP2RMDG?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop-links.co/1813549152441369037?u1=subid_value">Best Buy</a> for Prime Day 2023. Battle League rarely goes on sale, so this deal is worth scooping up. If you want to buy from Amazon, we'd recommend ordering soon--Amazon's Nintendo Switch deals tend to sell out quickly.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09SP2RMDG?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1813549152441369037?u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div><p>After a 15-year hiatus, Mario and his pals finally returned to the soccer field. Developed by Next Level Games, Battle League features 5v5 soccer contests that, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-strikers-battle-league-puts-a-badass-spin-on-soccer/1100-6503917/">lean more into action and chaos</a> than rigorous simulation gameplay. You can expect to see the usual suspects tagging along with Mario, including Luigi, Bowser, Wario, Waluigi, Princess Peach, and Yoshi.</p><p>Battle League injects some familiar competitive Mario trappings into the mix such as green shells for attacks. You even have the opportunity to add two goals to the scoreboard at once by using a high-powered Hyper Strike. As it's a "battle," players wear some war-ready gear that alters stats.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-strikers-battle-league-gets-big-discount-for-prime-day/1100-6504127/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Amazon Prime Day deals are upon us, but the online retail giant isn't the only store offering some nice discounts this week on gaming products and more. Best Buy has a number of deals happening now, too, one of which is a pretty nice discount on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p><p>The store is selling the game now for $40, which is $20 off its normal price. Yes, the game launched in 2017, but Nintendo games are rarely discounted, so this is pretty notable. Not only that, but Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a fantastic game that can be recommended to pretty much everyone.</p><p>What's more, the game continues to get new updates and DLC. On July 12, Nintendo will launch Wave 5 of the game's Booster Course Pass, adding eight more courses and four characters, including Birdo and Petey Piranha.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-mario-kart-8-deluxe-for-a-sweet-discount-during-prime-day/1100-6515801/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We've known that the next soccer game from EA isn't called FIFA for a while now, and now the entry titled EA Sports FC 24 has received a reveal trailer to get you pumped for the pitch. The trailer promises a "closer" experience than previous entries in the recently renamed series, and also that a full gameplay reveal is coming on July 13.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Welcome to the club.

However, it seems that Italian soccer legend (and current coach) Andrea Pirlo has seen some real nasty stuff, at least judging by the thousand-yard stare he's sporting. Perhaps he's spotted Cthulhu on the pitch.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The stars of The World’s Game are in the club.<br />Presenting the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FC24?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#FC24</a> Ultimate Edition Cover <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EASPORTSFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#EASPORTSFC</a> <a href="https://t.co/zEzGWdbHwa">pic.twitter.com/zEzGWdbHwa</a></p>  — EA SPORTS FC (@EASPORTSFC) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSFC/status/1678403705794859008?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">A rumor from earlier this month claimed that the game's standard edition will have 22-year-old Manchester City striker Erling Halland <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fc-24-cover-star-reportedly-leaks-and-its-a-huge-name/1100-6515702/">as its cover star</a>, and it's not clear if this is the case yet. However, given that the same rumor correctly predicted that the Ultimate Edition would have many stars on its cover, it seems to have some level of credence.

## New Assassin's Creed Mirage Trailer Details Basim's Journey And Deadly Arsenal

<p dir="ltr">It's not exactly rags to riches for Basim in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Instead, it's more like mugger to master assassin. That's because a new video for the upcoming game highlights how his journey begins as a young thief before joining The Hidden Ones.</p><p dir="ltr">But his partner in crime at the beginning, Nehal, isn't happy with Basim's desire to become an assassin. Ubisoft detailed this and more with a behind-the-scenes look at Assassin's Creed Mirage, seen below. For instance, Basim also has visions and nightmares haunting him early on in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Mirage will see Basim fighting to free Baghad of oppression (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-will-have-a-history-of-baghdad-educational-mode/1100-6515689/">there's even a History of Baghdad educational mode included</a>). There is no XP progression like Odyssey and Valhalla, as instead everything is tied to moving the story forward. On top of that, Basim's primary weapons are a sword and dagger in combat, a callback to Altair in the original Assassin's Creed. Which, by the way, isn't the first time that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-extended-gameplay-demonstration-shows-back-to-roots-focus/1100-6514882/">Assassin's Creed Mirage has been teased as having a back-to-roots focus</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-assassins-creed-mirage-trailer-details-basims-journey-and-deadly-arsenal/1100-6515798/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Based on the post-apocalyptic demolition-derby-style combat video game franchise Twisted Metal, Peacock is bringing vehicular mayhem to a brand-new TV adaptation. The series stars Anthony Mackie (Captain America: Brave New World) as cargo driver John Doe, Will Arnett and AEW star Samoa Joe helm the voice and body of diabolical clown Sweet Tooth, Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) as the mysterious Quiet, and Oscar nominee Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man: No Way Home) as Agent Stone.</p><p>We've only seen some of the world at large, but Peacock dropped a new rated-R trailer today that finally gives context to the story and what fans of the Twisted Metal games can expect. Check out metal and mayhem below.</p><div>          </div><p>Mackie's John is a delivery driver that takes cargo from territory to territory, trying to survive this new chaotic world. We don't know much about Beatriz's Quiet except for her taste for violence and profanity-riddled vernacular.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-twisted-metal-trailer-hits-the-highway-to-hell/1100-6515799/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's a new era for Star Wars games, as more publishers and developers are getting a chance to spin tales in that iconic galaxy after years of EA exclusivity. One of these projects is Star Wars Outlaws, an ambitious open-world game set in numerous hives of scum and villainy that don't typically make the cut for a big-budget Star Wars game.</p><p>With Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora studio Massive Entertainment leading development duties on this new Star Wars experience, players will get the chance to play as a new character looking to escape the iron-fisted grip of the Empire and walk away from the galactic civil war with a major payday.</p><p>Unlike other high-profile Star Wars games, Outlaws puts you in the boots of an opportunist who doesn't have Force powers to call upon when she finds herself outgunned in speeder shoot-outs and interstellar combat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-characters-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515795/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Baldur's Gate 3 has been in the works for a long time at Larian, but the game's official release date (and early access exit) of August 2023 is fast approaching. At <a href="https://panelfromhell.baldursgate3.game/">a recent panel</a> showing off the game in Belgium, its lead writer noted that it includes many romance options, including a "tender, consensual romance" with a grizzly bear.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Audience SCREAMS for Baldur’s Gate 3 showcase to choose: “I LIKE IT.” <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@larianstudios</a> <br /><br />You can get it on with a Druid in bear form. <br /><br />Happy Friday, gamers. <a href="https://t.co/HLTq8sLjeh">pic.twitter.com/HLTq8sLjeh</a></p>  — Fran Mirabella III (FM3) (@franmirabella) <a href="https://twitter.com/franmirabella/status/1677482917818429440?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Now, if you're wondering about the ethical implications of this, it is worth stating that this grizzly bear is actually a man who has been temporarily transformed into an animal. In the D&amp;D universe that Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in, most druids have the ability to "wild shape" into animal form a certain number of times per day, so this situation isn't as unusual as you might think.</p><p dir="ltr">The panel also revealed how deep Baldur's Gate 3's character creation tools will be at launch, complete with options like heterochromia, tattoo designs, piercings, and vitiligo.

<p>After more than a decade, Bleach is finally getting a new game for console. Just in time for the start of the second part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bleach-thousand-year-blood-war-anime-to-stream-on-hulu-disney-plus/1100-6507975/">Thousand-Year Blood War anime series</a> that has begun airing, Bleach: Soul Resonance is an action-RPG that features a "low-latency combat experience with weapons and swords," according to publisher Nuverse. So far, no release date or platforms for the game have been officially announced.</p><p>The brief gameplay trailer that was uploaded--and is currently unavailable--showed off several scenes from early arcs of the manga and anime, including protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki's iconic battles with Soul Society captains Kenpachi Zaraki and Byakuya Kuchiki. Interestingly, Nuverse says that players can wield unique Zanpakutos such as Sodenoshirayuki, Senbonzakura, and Kyokasuigetsu in addition to Ichigo's signature Zangetsu. Usually, these swords are tied to a single character, but the game description mentions that each one of these weapons will function like their source material counterparts in battle.</p><p>"The unique gameplay design revolves around the synergies and bonds between characters, enhancing battles' strategic experience in many different ways. Fight side by side with familiar faces on a battlefield full of blades," Nuverse's synopsis for the game reads.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bleach-is-finally-getting-a-new-action-game-after-more-than-a-decade/1100-6515792/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>This year's Call of Duty game was recently shown off, but not publicly. According to reports, Activision showed the game to NBA players at the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas that started this past weekend.</p><p>Some of the people in attendance posted videos and images from the event, though Activision had things on lockdown, social media posts spotted by CharlieIntel suggest. As such, nothing particularly revealing has made its way online as of yet. In any event, this is a pretty normal thing for Activision, as the company is known to begin the hype cycle for the year's new COD game by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfl-players-leak-apparent-confirmation-of-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2s-dmz-mode/1100-6506119/">showing it off to celebrities and athletes first. </a></p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">NEW: Activision is showing Call of Duty 2023 to NBA players at the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas this weekend. <br />Few have posted they have seen the new Call of Duty game. <a href="https://t.co/cJZ9gn5Tg6">pic.twitter.com/cJZ9gn5Tg6</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1677837424221732865?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 9, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Here’s an image — they’re being shown a demo of COD 2023, but only playing Warzone <a href="https://t.co/DU9WcZR2dp">pic.twitter.com/DU9WcZR2dp</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1677844066183020545?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">July 9, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Historically, Activision would announce new Call of Duty games in May, show them off in June during E3, and then launch them in the fall.

Whether or not that will be how 2023's Call of Duty game gets revealed remains to be seen, though.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-2023-game-has-been-revealed-to-basketball-players/1100-6515785/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Aside from every feature found on the H7, you’ll also get some great noise-canceling technology and an upgraded design that, as mentioned, features the same leatherette found on Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5 headphones.<span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-inzone-h9-wireless-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-white/6510363.p">Best Buy</a> </span></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/sony-inzone-h9-wireless-noise-cancelling-gaming-headset-for-playstation-5-pc/-/A-87146226#lnk=sametab">See at Target</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sony Inzone H3 Wired Gaming Headset</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4056447-h3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$50 ($<del>100</del>)</strong></p><p>Few headsets in the sub-$100 range offer the features found on the H3.
