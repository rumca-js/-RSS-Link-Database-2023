## Show HN: Throw – A space for asking and answering questions anonymously

<p>Hello HN community,<p>For the past two years we’ve been working on this disruptive new thing. It’s about people, community, communication and truth.<p>Throw is the new space for asking and answering questions anonymously. We believe that in today’s world (both online and offline) content in communication exchanges is strongly influenced by the personas, profiles and façades people maintain/upkeep/safeguard socially, ideologically and on relationships.<p>From the way people post on Instagram the life they want others to believe they have, or the way people behave on thanksgiving with family, or at work, or with friends; on every social setting and interaction to some degree acting and behaving according to that setting and the people they interact with. These dynamics influence the content itself, as people don’t just respond to a question like computers do. What ends up happening is that the responder comes up with the answer by blending the possibly objective answer with feelings, setting, desires, commitments, ideologies, fears, insecurities, etc (social pressure or social agenda).<p>Something is missing between social media and the traditional Q&amp;A…<p>Throw addresses this by creating a space free from this social agenda. Thus focusing strictly on the content exchanged and providing a safe, comfortable and unbiased space where people can ask and answer anything freely with no bias, fears or strings attached.<p>We've put key components of social media, Q&amp;A and surveying industries into one platform.<p>Not only may Throw be used for personal and private questions and answers. But the power of crowdsourcing allows for a great variety of use cases like market research, validation of content and ideas, trivia, and much more. Serious matters and also just for fun…<p>It’s a query marketplace which means that “throwers” (people who ask questions) pay a fee proportional to the answers they need and in turn “catchers” (who catch them and respond) get compensated. This way we guarantee every user gets as many responses as he/she needs.<p>As for dealing with anonymity, we have built a sophisticated moderation protocol to neutralize and quickly ban people that contribute negatively as it is a priority people feel safe and comfortable in this community.<p>We have worked very hard to create a delightful product and are basically launching today!<p>If this is something that may be of your interest or you’d like to be one of the first to test it out download our app and play around with it.
<a href="https://www.trythrow.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.trythrow.com</a><p>Also, if you have questions there is additional information in the FAQs section on our web page that could be of help.<p>Finally, we really appreciate any feedback we can get (of any kind). So if there's anything you like, don't like, or any other thought about Throw, we'd love to hear about it! You may post a comment below or through the contact section on the web page.<p>Be curious and dare to know!<p>Thank you!</p>

## Show HN: A hash array-mapped trie implementation in C

<p>Long-simmering side project that is finally ready to see the light. HAMTs are a cool persistent data structure and implementing one has been a lot of fun. Beyond the code, there is likely some value in the extensive and largely complete implementation docs; basic benchmarks are linked in the README, too.<p>Kind of aiming to be "the libavl for HAMTs". That is obviously a high and aspirational bar but a distinct possibility if it stirs up a little interest and/or contribution.<p>Anyways, it's time for this to go out, collect feedback and maybe even some use outside of toy projects. Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>I always enjoy reading posts about indie game development and looking at the source code of games other people have built. So for any game I release I naturally I want to do the same.<p>https://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam<p>Hockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.<p>I detailed the creation of the game in it's own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license. You can still find the making of here: https://hockeyslam.com/makingof<p>I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.</p>

<p>My friend and I have been feeling frustrated at how inefficient it is to find information at work. There are so many tools (Slack, Confluence, GitHub, Jira, Google Drive, etc.) and they provide different (often not great) ways to find information. We thought maybe LLMs could help, so over the last couple months we've been spending a bit of time on the side to build Danswer.<p>It is an open source, self-hosted search tool that allows you to ask questions and get answers across common workspace apps AND your personal documents (via file upload / web scraping)! Full demo here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNzY1nbCnU&amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNzY1nbCnU&amp;t=2s</a>.<p>The code (<a href="https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer">https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer</a>) is open source and permissively licensed (MIT). If you want to try it out, you can set it up locally with just a couple of commands (more details in our docs - <a href="https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.danswer.dev/introduction</a>). We hope that someone out there finds this useful<p>We’d love to hear from you in our Slack (<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-VGh1idW19R8oiNRiKBYv2w" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-...</a>)  or Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X</a>).

## Ask HN: Just moved to SF. How can I leverage my new location to skill up in dev?

<p>Against the trend, just moved to SF from a mid size hub-of-nothing city of the East Coast. My GF got an internship in biotech and I work remote so here we are at least until January.<p>I'm self taught, have a technical high school degree in electronics and computers, and an AA that I meant to use to start a CS degree back in the east coast before we moved.<p>My work is a mix of App support with light software dev. I mostly support and update old apps written using ASP.NET (of which I know almost nothing), Nintex workflows that should've never been, make little scripts for ServiceNow virtual agent, and we have a series of low code apps that I also support, modify, etc. I replaced a guy who was also self taught and had no best-practices checks.<p>I'm solo in this endeavor since my product owner is not a developer and my other peer mostly deals with the red tape and administrative stuff like dealing with InfoSec's recurring paperwork and vendor licenses. Happy to have him, but I can't skill up in my field.<p>I'm now much closer to all the tech brain power of the country, and I'm trying to figure how to leverage my stay to improve my skills. I work 5AM to 1:30PM and so I have the whole evening open to feed my brain.<p>Are there any groups, meetups, schools, apprenticeships, or whatever else I could use to become a better dev? I know I could enroll in a CS degree and I do want that, but I already know of that answer.<p>I'd love to work on tools for people outside of the field that maybe boosts their productivity or makes their lives easier.
A few months ago I worked with my GF to make an app that helps her identify cyanobacteria automating a process they used to do in MS Word and it was super satisfying, but I know it can be much better if I had someone to work with.<p>Anyway, any idea will be very appreciated, even if you are in the same position I'm in and you'd like to meet to work on something.<p>Thanks!</p>

## Ask HN: (How much) do you get paid for being on call?

<p>Do you get extra comp for being on call? Do you get extra for responding to incidents out of hours?<p>Or is it baked into your base comp?<p>Reason for asking; management is about to start asking folks to be on call. I'm not sure what to ask for or if its normal to not get anything extra.</p>
