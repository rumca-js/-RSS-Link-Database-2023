Writer-director Christopher Nolan attended the Trinity Anniversary Screening event for his new film Oppenheimer, marking the anniversary of the Manhattan Project’s Trinity Test, which detonated the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945.

During the event, Nolan participated in a Q&amp;A panel following a screening of the film. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd moderated the panel, which also featured Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird, the author of American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Dr. Thom Mason, Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the event’s honorary chairmen: Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist Dr. Kip Thorne, who served as a consultant on the film, and world-renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Carlo Rovelli, the New York Times best-selling author of The Order of Time, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics and Anaximander and the Birth of Science.

During the panel, Nolan was asked what message he hoped members of the U.S. Congress would take away from the film. This clip features his response to that question and more.

Viewfinder reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5.

"What Viewfinder lacks in story substance and compelling characters it more than makes up for via the pure, mind-boggling exhilaration of its perspective-warping puzzle solving. Its superb, photo-based environmental deformation doesn’t just break ground – it bends and stretches it into entirely new shapes and forms in the wake of each puzzle completed, while also introducing regular game-changing parameters that forced me to continually think outside the frame of my shots. The ability to transport yourself into paintings and screenshots makes for a journey that consistently captivates in between each carefully considered camera capture, and the rapid rewind function emboldens you to get creative with puzzle solutions without fear of retribution. Spellbindingly surreal and stimulating to the end, Viewfinder is the freakiest form of photo mode in which every snap is a happy one."
