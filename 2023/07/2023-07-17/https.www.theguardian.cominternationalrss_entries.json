Exhausted by the city and the seething anxiety from which she has suffered ever since she was a girl, she longs for the awkward embrace of her somewhat complicated family: her divorcee father, now lonely enough to be on the dating apps; her mother, an amateur artist with bohemian leanings who has recently taken yet another younger lover; her older sister, Marylou, who though in possession of both a husband and two small children, is also having a one-day-a-week affair with a man who works in a fancy dress shop (he comes to her for joyful afternoon sex in her greenhouse, disguised as a bear, or a wolf, or a ghost).</p><p>From here, Jourdy spins out an exquisite soap opera of a graphic novel, a story she tells in both traditional strips \u2013 if you\u2019re a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/27/posy-simmonds-cassandra-darke-graphic-novel-interview\">Posy Simmonds</a>, you\u2019ll fall instantly in love with these \u2013 and in a series of extraordinarily beautiful, Matisse-inspired watercolours of the town where the action takes place (it\u2019s never named, but Jourdy spent her childhood in Dole, near the Jura mountains: think red roofs, geranium-filled window boxes and old-fashioned, slightly louche bars). What follows is often plangent; by the time Juliette returns to Paris, more than one heart will have been broken. But Jourdy also has a gift for farce, and her book is at moments richly comical. The scene in which Marylou\u2019s lover, wearing one of his ridiculous costumes, is discovered hiding under her son\u2019s desk is masterly.</p><p><em>Juliette</em> by Camille Jourdy (translated by Aleshia Jensen) is published by Drawn and Quarterly (\u00a323).

Here, she writes about the intrusion she suffered after the trial</p><p>Over the last decade, many people have told me they are aware of what really happened to me while I was competing on the X Factor in 2012 \u2013 some very directly. A journalist from Sheffield sat me down in front of a camera in my dressing room before my show for a \u201crelaxed interview\u201d and in the middle of nonchalant questions about what it\u2019s like on the road, and what bands I\u2019m into at the moment, said, \u201cI heard you were raped and that is the reason you left the show.\u201d A man in a London bar once shook my hand and blurted out the exact same sentence, waiting for my response as if he\u2019d just asked me if I was having a good night. In those moments, the story was more important than the fact that I was a human being.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much the story of what had happened to me was worth in financial terms but it was sold, or leaked, to the papers \u2013 allegedly by someone within the Metropolitan police \u2013 within hours of it happening. Reddit, Digital Spy, Twitter and all of the gossip websites started to flood with rumours of what had taken place, of which hotel it had been in \u2013 details that should never have been public. In the UK, victims of sexual offences have a legal right to anonymity, for as long as they choose to do so. By deciding to speak about what happened to me now, I am waiving my right to anonymity, but back in 2012 countless privacy specialists and cyber experts were hired to remove any leaked information about me from the internet. As the speculation on discussion forum webpages went up, they were pulled down. Tweets containing my name and allegations of what happened to me disappeared. It was quite amazing, really; I had no idea that this kind of thing could be done.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/17/lucy-spraggan-on-reality-tv-and-redemption-x-factor\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/17/lucy-spraggan-on-reality-tv-and-redemption-x-factor", "date_published": "2023-07-17T04:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "The underground Crimean Tatar group taking up arms against Russia", "description": "<p>The Atesh guerrilla group is active behind Russian lines, and leaders of the Indigenous movement say there are ready if they can get the weapons</p><p>A Crimean Tatar-led underground movement is already active behind Russian lines and hundreds of young Tatar men are ready to take up arms to liberate the occupied peninsula, a veteran community leader has said.</p><p>Mustafa Dzemilev, widely seen as the godfather of the Crimean Tatar rights movement, pointed to operations by the Atesh guerrilla group, comprising Crimean Tatars, Ukrainians and Russians, in Crimea and other occupied Ukrainian regions.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/the-underground-crimean-tatar-group-taking-up-arms-against-russia\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/the-underground-crimean-tatar-group-taking-up-arms-against-russia", "date_published": "2023-07-17T04:00:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Fame makes you paranoid\u2019: Michael Cera on Barbie, drunk fans \u2013 and not owning a smartphone", "description": "<p>In 2007, the success of Superbad and Juno made Cera a celebrity, and it was such a shock that he almost gave up acting altogether.
