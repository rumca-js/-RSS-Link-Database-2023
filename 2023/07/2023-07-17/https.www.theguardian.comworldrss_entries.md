<p>Shopkeepers complain the number of thefts from stores is soaring. Is the cost of living crisis to blame or organised gangs?</p><p>It could be laundry tablets, lipstick or even baby milk. According to shopkeepers in the UK the number of thefts is rising. The <a href="https://www.brc.org.uk/">British Retail Consortium</a> said there were 8m instances of theft from shops last year, which cost businesses nearly £1bn. The Office for National Statistics reports a 22% rise.</p><p>For shop assistants and managers it is a daily struggle, which can be costly and infuriating – but what’s behind it? The Guardian’s North of England editor, <strong>Helen Pidd</strong>, spoke to shopkeepers on one Manchester street to see how they were coping, and spent the day in a magistrates court to find out what happens when a shoplifter is caught. She explains how organised crime may be a factor behind the rise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jul/17/has-britain-become-a-country-of-shoplifters-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
