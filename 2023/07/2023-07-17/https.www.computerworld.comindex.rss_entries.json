In addition to its steady releases of <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3199077/windows-10-a-guide-to-the-updates.html\">major and minor updates to the current version of Windows 10</a>, the company frequently rolls out public preview builds to members of its <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3220429/how-to-choose-the-right-windows-10-preview-and-update-channels.html\">Windows Insider Program</a>, allowing them to test out \u2014 and even help shape \u2014 upcoming features.</p><p>Windows Insiders can choose to receive preview builds in one of three channels. The Dev Channel is where new features are introduced for initial testing, regardless of which Windows release they\u2019ll eventually end up in. The Beta Channel lets you test more polished features that will be deployed in the next major Windows release. Insiders in the Dev and Beta Channels are now testing Windows 11 builds.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3118132/windows-10-insider-previews-a-guide-to-the-builds.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3118132/windows-10-insider-previews-a-guide-to-the-builds.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-07-17T19:09:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/07/87327025-100363785-small.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Apple Silicon isn't waiting for the PC world to catch up", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple appears to be widening its lead over rival PC makers with yet another M-series chip iteration for Apple Silicon.</p><p class=\"p1\">Just one look at StatCounter\u2019s current macOS data shows the extent to which the company\u2019s move to develop its own Mac processors is invigorating the platform.

I still remember when noted tech consultant <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-minasi-4a957b14\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Minasi</a> used to joke that Microsoft wrote software for the Fortune 499 \u2014 every major Fortune 500 company <em>except</em>Apple \u2014 which meant that for many years consumer and home users were just along for the ride with Microsoft\u2019s big-enterprise goals.</p><p>This is true more than ever with Windows 11. From its security mandates to its enhanced hardware requirements, Windows 11 has been a hard sell. The hardware mandates appear arbitrary and seem intended to push sales of new computers. But they do serve a purpose: to put in place building blocks for additional security protections involving credentials. The problem is that many small businesses and home users can\u2019t take advantage of these security features for various reasons. Or they don\u2019t see value in using biometrics, Windows Hello, or other more robust authentication techniques when they just want to use their computer without needing even a password to log in.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702869/for-tech-users-change-is-good.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702869/for-tech-users-change-is-good.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-07-17T15:57:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2022/02/16/10/neon-sign_change_change-management_career_promotion_shift_start_begin_by-ross-findon-via-unsplash-100763785-small-100919317-small.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Q&A: HPE global talent exec credits AI, chatbots for bolstering hiring", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Over the past year, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) human resources group has been using artificial intelligence (AI) and a chatbot to improve its talent acquisition and retention.
