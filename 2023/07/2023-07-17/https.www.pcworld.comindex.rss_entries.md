## Your Twitter settings may be blocking direct messages

<p>If you keep your direct messages open on Twitter, you may have noticed an unnatural quietness in your notifications lately. But it&rsquo;s not related to rate limiting. Instead, Twitter began rolling out a settings tweak last week&mdash;and made it the new default.</p>



<p>Previously, Twitter&rsquo;s direct message settings offered these three choices: <em>Allow message requests from everyone</em> (aka open DMs), <em>Allow message requests only from people you follow</em> (aka closed DMs), and <em>Allow message requests only from Verified users</em> (which also allowed messages from people you follow). All of these messages went straight to your inbox.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1679529814212894723&amp;xcust=2-2-1997389-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">as announced last Thursday</a> by the Twitter Support account, the verified users option has now changed to <em>Allow message requests from Verified users and people you follow only</em>. Though it may sound at first like a mere difference in wording, choosing this method of screening will filter your incoming messages into separate inboxes. Those from users you follow will go to a primary inbox, while DMs from Twitter Blue subscribers will go to a message request inbox. And as part of this update, all users who previously had their DMs open got migrated to this new third setting.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="New Twitter DM settings" class="wp-image-1997397" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/twitter-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Twitter / PCWorld</p></div>



<p>While this change is explained as designed to help reduce the amount of spam received in DMs, it also blocks messages from users who do not subscribe to Twitter Blue. Fortunately, you can easily undo this new (and likely unwanted) default. Head to <em>Settings &gt; Privacy and Safety &gt; Direct Messages</em>, then re-select the option for <em>Allow Message Requests from everyone</em>.</p>



<p>With recent reports of Twitter&rsquo;s revenue being down by 50 percent, this move appears to be a way to enhance the perceived appeal of Twitter Blue for potential subscribers. If a user with previously open DMs doesn&rsquo;t know to change their settings, getting verified through Twitter Blue would be the only way to get their attention via DM. Judging by the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/search?q=verified%20dm&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top&amp;xcust=2-2-1997389-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">comments from users</a> on Twitter, the move is not a popular one, however&mdash;which could possibly enhance the appeal of rivals like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1981658/meta-threads-how-to-get-started.html">Meta&rsquo;s newly launched Threads</a>.</p>

## Windows 11â€™s July update could fix your pesky gaming stutters

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more aggravating than a stuttering high DPI mouse, especially when you&rsquo;re in the middle of an intense match where precise movements and fast response time are everything. Fortunately, Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/july-11-2023-kb5028185-os-build-22621-1992-605fa18f-bd49-41d8-80b1-245080e26c3d&amp;xcust=2-1-1996584-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">July 2023 update to Windows 11</a> aims to fix this problem. (This update also includes changes to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1996440/windows-11-this-new-taskbar-function-breaks-with-old-windows-tradition.html">Window 11 clock</a>, which can now display seconds.) </p>



<p>Apparently, the stuttering problem originates from the demands of high DPI mice on the Windows input stack. If you&rsquo;re a gamer, you&rsquo;re probably working with some powerful hardware. But if you&rsquo;re plugging in a bunch of devices at once (as gamers are apt to do), you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of background processes running. Your system basically spends a big chunk of time processing input, which negatively impacts gameplay, causing your high DPI (dots-per-inch) mouse to stutter. Your PC is too busy keeping tabs on other inputs such as controllers, voice chat, and so on. That&rsquo;s why Windows has a difficult time keeping up with it all.</p>



<p>Microsoft intends to remedy this issue by optimizing the processing time for input requests. According to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/07/16/windows-11-july-2023-update-delivers-big-gaming-boost-with-reduced-stutter/&amp;xcust=2-1-1996584-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Latest</a> blog, the company has &ldquo;improved the performance by throttling and coalescing background raw mouse listeners and capping their message rate.&rdquo; The idea is to offer gamers fluid gameplay even with many background processes happening at once. If you&rsquo;re dealing with in-game stuttering, a Windows update might be the quick fix you&rsquo;ve been looking for. The update (aka <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=HlvbvYZP82I&amp;mid=42411&amp;u1=pcg-us-6806180186316049000&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-au%2Ftopic%2Fjuly-11-2023-kb5028185-os-build-22621-1992-605fa18f-bd49-41d8-80b1-245080e26c3d" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Windows 11 KB5028185</a>) should be available on the Windows Update screen now.</p>

## Windows Update will fix your broken install with minimal headache

<p>The latest Canary build of Windows 11, the bleeding-edge developer version delivered to Windows Insider program participants, has a little surprise waiting inside. A new &ldquo;Fix problems using Windows Update&rdquo; option has appeared in the System &gt; Recovery menu, giving users a less harrowing option for fixing everyday issues like drivers causing startup conflicts. It&rsquo;s essentially a way of soft reinstalling Windows without touching the programs and files you have on your current system. </p>



<p>The tool installs a &ldquo;repair version&rdquo; of Windows 11, after which it will apply default settings to the operating system and attempt to reboot without touching any of your personal programs or storage. This less traumatic alternative to the Windows reset tool (or a full-on OS wipe) is being introduced in Preview Build 25905, but as always, it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess as to when or if it will roll out to the general Windows userbase. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/07/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25905/&amp;xcust=2-1-1996686-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Insider Blog</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-repair-windows-update&amp;xcust=2-1-1996686-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>), the new option is meant to keep the device secure and up to date, and can fix smaller issues at the same time as applying the latest patches via Windows Update. For my money, I&rsquo;m having a hard time differentiating between the generic &ldquo;fix problems without resetting your PC,&rdquo; the now-standard reset option, and this somewhat middle ground. But then, having a bunch of unclear options for solving a specific issue is practically Windows tradition at this point. </p>



<p>The build also includes the usual bug fixes and tweaks, dropped support for Arm32 apps (Arm64 still works fine), updated emoji art, and&hellip;support for Zune drivers. Yes, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYhvJG30iE&amp;xcust=2-1-1996686-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the Zune is back</a>, apparently as a<em> Guardians of the Galaxy </em>promotion. But you still can&rsquo;t buy one, at least without going on an Ebay hunt. </p>

<p>With its affordable price point, decent performance, and robust build, the Acer Aspire 5 is a good budget option for most people. While the color scheme is a little boring to look at, the build is surprisingly rugged. Our tester was surprised by its &ldquo;solid, durable feel.&rdquo; The keyboard is nice, too. It has a spacious layout, which is perfect for longer typing sessions. Performance is fast enough for general use tasks like writing emails and browsing the web, but that&rsquo;s about it. If you&rsquo;re shopping around for a solid everyday laptop that won&rsquo;t break the bank, the Aspire 5 is definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>The Dell XPS is not only an excellent ultraportable, but it comes with leading-edge performance and a stunning OLED panel. The 14-core Intel Core i7-1280P CPU means it&rsquo;s no slouch in processing performance either. It&rsquo;s not only great for general-use, but it can easily handle photo editing tasks as well. This device also comes equipped with Intel Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. </p>

<p>Despite being only 13.4 inches, the OLED touchscreen is absolutely gorgeous. With a resolution of 3456&times;2160, the picture is sharp and vibrant. Unfortunately, since the design is so compact, it lacks some connectivity and the battery life is only mediocre. If you can forgive those limitations, then the Dell XPS 13 Plus is a good option for most people who need a laptop to travel with.</p>

<p>Want the attractive design, high efficiency, and strong performance of a MacBook Pro but in a Windows device? Then you should definitely consider the HP Dragonfly Pro. It comes about as close as possible to Apple&rsquo;s line of premium laptops. HP partnered with AMD to trick out this laptop with a next-gen Ryzen 7 processor with eight high-performance cores and a Radeon 680M graphic card, making it much more powerful than its slim 0.7-inch thick figure would make you believe. </p>

<p>It impresses with an attractive design and high-quality feel made from aluminum and polycarbonate. You&rsquo;ll even find that HP took a cue from the MacBook&rsquo;s minimalist approach to ports as there are only two USB 4 Type-C ports and one USB-C 3.2 port. This makes for a clean look, but it may not appeal to users since it makes plugging in a lot of accessories a bit tricky. And while the display is good enough, it unfortunately can&rsquo;t live up to Apple&rsquo;s best. Still, for a laptop that is significantly cheaper than the current line of MacBook Pro models, this Dragonfly Pro laptop from HP is a more than worthy competitor&mdash;plus you have the flexibility of Windows and the ability to play games during your downtime.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Yoga laptops have always been excellent 2-in-1s, but the latest Gen 8 version has outdone itself. Lenovo&rsquo;s new Yoga 9i not only remains one of our favorite convertibles, but manages to surpass the high bar set by previous versions. Under the hood, it comes loaded with solid performance features like a 13th-gen Intel Core i7 processor, Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Yoga 9i also has a svelte design that measures just over half an inch thick and weighs about 3 pounds. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, it comes with some great extras too, such as the 1080p webcam and a superb 2880x1880p OLED touchscreen display.</p>

<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s a bit more expensive than its previous Yoga versions, but its performance and features make it good value for the money. If you&rsquo;re looking to get a 2-in-1, the Yoga 9i should be at the top of your list.</p>

<p>The Razer Blade 17 (2022) is a gamer&rsquo;s ultimate dream. It&rsquo;s a robust laptop with a stunning 240Hz display and a wide array of ports, including two Thunderbolt 4. Plus, you can expect awesome gaming performance thanks to the Intel 12-gen i7 CPU and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. That&rsquo;s some serious power. However, you&rsquo;re going to pay out the nose for it, as it costs thousands of dollars. If you&rsquo;re willing to shell out the big bucks, then the Blade 17 is phenomenal option. If your budget is more limited, check out the ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 OLED below, which is our best budget gaming laptop pick.</p>

<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V is the ultimate gaming laptop in terms of pure performance. It has just about everything you could ever dream of in a gaming rig including the latest gen Core i9 processor, a monster RTX 4090 graphics card, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB PCIe Gen5 M.2 SSD. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, it also has a gorgeous industry leading 4K IPS Mini-LED display capable of a 144Hz refresh rate. There&rsquo;s plenty of connectivity options as well and a fantastic Steelseries mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches built-in. If we were to nitpick, we&rsquo;d say that the only downsides are a mediocre 720p webcam and a short battery life (if run during power hungry 3D gaming or intense workloads). </p>

<p>All of that high end hardware comes with a price though and you&rsquo;ll need to pay a premium for MSI&rsquo;s best. With such a steep price tag, this laptop isn&rsquo;t a practical choice for most people. But if you want the best in performance and have a lot of money to burn, there currently nothing that can rival the MSI Titan.</p>

<p>The ROG Zephyrus G14 is both lightweight and powerful&mdash;a very rare combination. It weighs just a little over three pounds, which makes it a capable traveling laptop. Between the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS processor and AMD Radeon RX6800S GPU, you can expect strong performance as well. The only weakness is the keyboard. It feels a little mushy and the backlighting is rather unimpressive. That said, if you&rsquo;re in the market for a portable laptop that delivers zippy performance, the Zephyrus G14 is a great pick. </p>

<p>Looking for a reliable budget gaming laptop? The ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 OLED is a fantastic option. According to our tester, this laptop is great for &ldquo;gaming, streaming, and day-to-day productivity.&rdquo; Thanks to the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) GPU, we were able to hit 60 frames-per-second at 1080p on high graphics during the&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>&nbsp;benchmark. Plus, the OLED display is absolutely beautiful and battery life is surprisingly good. There are a few minor shortcomings, however. </p>

<p>The overall design is a little plain and the port selection is limited, and you&rsquo;ll need to drop down to Medium or High graphics in strenuous modern AAA games on the RTX 3050. Nitpicks aside, if you&rsquo;re looking for reliable performance on a gorgeous OLED screen, the VivoBook Pro 15 is where the party&rsquo;s at. If you don&rsquo;t mind giving up those luscious OLED visuals for a bit more graphics firepower, you should take a look at the Acer Swift X, which is our next entry.</p>

<p>Want a giant 18-inch screen on your laptop? How about if that giant screen is a QHD+ display with a refresh rate of 240Hz? Well, you already had us at 18-inch screen. The Asus ROG Strix G18 is about as close to a true desktop replacement as you can get. This laptop is absolutely loaded with great performance features that include a Core i9-13980HX processor, an RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. But that&rsquo;s not even the best part&mdash;the ROG Strix G18 comes with a mouth-watering 18-inch QHD+ (2560&times;1600) ROG Nebula panel with 100% DCI-P3 and sRGB coverage and an outstanding 240Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>At first glance, the price of the Asus ROG Strix G18 might turn some people away, but it can be found for a lot cheaper than some competitors&rsquo; models such as Razer and MSI with the same configuration. The size can either be an upside or downside depending on what you&rsquo;re looking for from a laptop, but if you want a desktop replacement complete with an outstanding display then there are currently none better than the Asus ROG Strix G18.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a great convertible laptop, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 will surely fit the bill. You can either prop it up like a tent or fold the screen all the way back and use it like a tablet. We were also impressed with its vibrant display, all-day battery life, and diverse selection of ports. The design is a little utilitarian, but this is the kind of machine that favors function over aesthetics. The build is robust and there was hardly any flex in the keyboard tray. There are a couple of downsides like the loud fan noise and the lack of a physical privacy shutter on the webcam, but these issues are relatively minor. Overall, the Spin 713 is a solid convertible laptop that performs well. </p>

<p>Dell&rsquo;s updated XPS 17 boasts a huge 17-inch screen, 11th-gen Intel Core i7-13700H CPU, and a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU. Not only is that enough performance to breeze through all of your content projects, but it also brings a 1TB SSD giving you plenty of storage for all of them as well. By packing its 4K, touch screen panel into such a compact laptop, and loading the notebook itself with every feature professionals ask for (hello, SD card reader and abundant Thunderbolt 4 ports), the XPS 17 is the poster child for what a content creation workhorse laptop should be. </p>

<p>The one real downside is that the XPS 17 weighs just under five and a half pounds, so it&rsquo;s a real beast. The webcam is only 720p, as well, which may be a downside if you have to do any online classes or video-conferencing. Buy if you can live with those minor shortcomings, the latest XPS 17 is a phenomenal choice for all content creators. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a big screen on a modest budget, the Acer Swift 3 is a fantastic option. It features an attractive 16-inch 1080p display, a solid chassis, and an enjoyable keyboard and touchpad. However, battery life is subpar, so you&rsquo;ll want to keep the charger on hand. This is unfortunate, as the Swift 3&rsquo;s slim profile makes it a good laptop for travel. If you don&rsquo;t mind the battery life, this is a great laptop for watching movies and streaming shows.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface tablets were already atop our list of best 2-in-1 laptops, but Microsoft reworked the Surface Pro 8 in numerous ways by adding a larger, higher-resolution, faster screen, a pair of Thunderbolt ports that replace the legacy Surface Connector, and a new inking experience, among other features.</p>

<p>While this generation of the Surface Pro tablet forgoes an always-connected LTE option as well as the choice of a cheap Core i3, performance still soared to the top of the heap. Benefits like how the increased display refresh rate improves inking are subtle improvements that matter, too. It&rsquo;s the most dramatic revamp of a Surface in years and it&rsquo;s all for the better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li>



<li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li>



<li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li>



<li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li>



<li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life. </li>



<li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li>



<li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. </li>



<li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. </li>



<li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="laptop-faq">Laptop FAQ</h2>



<p>Ah, here we are at the billion dollar question. Do you spring for a basic Chromebook or go for a Windows laptop with more features? Well, it really depends on your personal lifestyle and what you plan on using your laptop for. For example, Chromebooks are a great low cost option for those who just want the basics. I use a Chromebook as my primary work laptop, as it has everything I need for both editing and writing. If you travel a bunch for work, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to invest in a laptop with solid battery life. If you&rsquo;re still unsure, don&rsquo;t sweat it. I&rsquo;ve put together a list of quick tips below. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-type-of-laptop-should-i-get">What type of laptop should I get?</h3>



<p>The first question you should ask yourself is what kind of laptop you&rsquo;re looking for. There&rsquo;s traditional clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, Chromebooks, and much more. The displays on convertible laptops (aka 2-in-1&rsquo;s), for example, can swing around 360 degrees. This allows you to use the laptop like a tablet. They can also be propped up like a tent for viewing movies or participating in video calls. Chromebooks, on the other hand, exclusively run Google&rsquo;s web-focused Chrome OS and are generally used for everyday tasks. All you need is a Gmail account and boom, you&rsquo;re in. There are pros and cons to each of them. Chromebooks are affordable and generally have good battery life whereas convertibles are normally lightweight and portable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-much-processing-power-will-i-need">How much processing power will I need?</h3>



<p>If it&rsquo;s CPU power you&rsquo;re looking for, look for processors with higher numerical names. A Core i7 is more suited to gaming and more intense work than everyday tasks. Intel processors are available in Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. The higher the number, the more powerful the CPU. If you don&rsquo;t need a ton of power, Intel Core i5 processors are your best bet, as they offer good performance at a decent price. Basic office and web work gets along just fine on a Core i3. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. If you need more power, the Ryzen 7 chip is well suited for content creation like video editing. Finally, if you&rsquo;re dealing with 4K video, spring for a Ryzen 9. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="whats-the-difference-between-discrete-graphics-and-integrated-graphics">What&rsquo;s the difference between discrete graphics and integrated graphics?</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;ll want a discrete graphics card for hardcore gaming or editing videos. It&rsquo;s separate from the processor, so you can expect higher performance out of it. Integrated graphics, on the other hand, are attached to the CPU and uses less power as a result. This is perfectly fine for everyday tasks, especially if you&rsquo;re not doing anything that&rsquo;s graphics-intensive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-memory">What about memory?</h3>



<p>8GB of RAM is zippy enough for general use. If you&rsquo;ve got a gaming laptop, 16GB of RAM is the way to go, and content creators will want even more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-big-should-my-display-be">How big should my display be?</h3>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a video editor or someone who does a lot of multimedia work, you&rsquo;ll want a display that&rsquo;s anywhere from 15- to 17-inches. The sweet spot is really anywhere from 13- to 14-inches, though. The bigger the display, the heavier your laptop is going to be. A 13- or 14-inch display is the best in terms of portability and value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-long-should-my-laptop-last-on-a-single-charge">How long should my laptop last on a single charge?</h3>



<p>If you plan on taking your laptop anywhere with you, aim for something that can last 10 to 12 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s more than a full work day, so it should theoretically get you through long flights or a day of classes. Obviously, more is always better. Just know that the bigger the battery, the heavier the laptop. Read our round-up of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915376/best-laptop-usb-c-pd-chargers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">best laptop chargers</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-much-should-i-spend">How much should I spend?</h3>



<p><strong>T</strong>he price really depends on your budget. If you&rsquo;re strapped for cash (been there, trust me), go for a Chromebook or an entry-level business laptop. These laptops are good choices for students or young professionals. If you can afford to spend more, the versatility of a 2-in-1 laptop is really worth it. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-connectivity">What about connectivity?</h3>



<p>A wide array of ports is always a plus in my book, as it eliminates the need for an adapter. I&rsquo;d recommend a laptop that has both USB-C and USB-A. An HDMI port is good, too. This is especially useful for when you want to hook up to an external monitor.</p>

## Stable Doodle AI tool can turn your scribbles into â€˜realâ€™ art

<p>One of the biggest issues with the new crop of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; tools is that of attribution: No matter what output you&rsquo;re looking for, the text and images that generate it has to come from somewhere, generally writers and artists that go unattributed. At least a small part of that problem might be solved with Stability AI&rsquo;s latest product. Stable Doodle, based on the popular Stable Diffusion AI system, generates fully-rendered artistic works, but uses your own drawings as a baseline. </p>



<p>The results are impressive. A quick and sloppy doodle on my iPad resulted in the above set of rendered AI images, at least one of which wouldn&rsquo;t get a second glance as a bit of corporate art in an office or slapped on a greeting card. Stability AI says that &ldquo;anyone with basic drawing skills and online access can generate high-quality original images in seconds.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve seen similar tools before, like Nvidia&rsquo;s Canvas, but nothing quite so fast or dramatic. </p>



<p>Stability&rsquo;s claim seems to hold true, but the tool isn&rsquo;t as wide-open as it initially seems. In addition to a base image, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://clipdrop.co/stable-doodle&amp;xcust=2-1-1996404-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stable Doodle</a> asks for a text prompt to generate images, a sort of hint for the AI system if it can&rsquo;t tell your Picasso scribble is supposed to be Don Quixote. Deliberately skipping the text prompt made my &ldquo;doggy&rdquo; look like the kind of slightly unsettling mishmash you might associate with AI art from two or three years ago. It also seems to be leaning a lot more on the text than the image if it&rsquo;s unsure of things. Replacing my doggy image with a slapdash spaceship, but keeping the &ldquo;doggy&rdquo; text promp, resulted in&hellip;more dogs. Dogs which were notably lacking in spaceshipy features. One of them even had an AI-generated &ldquo;signature.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Stable doodle spaceship doggy" class="wp-image-1996610" height="1156" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/doggy-spaceship.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>&ldquo;Look pal, you put &ldquo;doggy&rdquo; in the text box, and by god you&rsquo;re gonna get some doggies, no matter how many spaceships you draw.&rdquo;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>For further guidance, users can choose among a handful of pre-selected styles, from digital art to photorealistic images to the rather on-the-nose &ldquo;origami.&rdquo; Presumably all of these styles are based on specific sets of trained images, so the issue of attribution (or lack thereof) rears its ugly head once again. Sometimes the output seems to be wholly generating its own images, with little to no guidance from the doodle. </p>



<p>Even so, it&rsquo;s fast and high-quality, so it might find a set of eager users. Once low-resolution preview images have been generated, you can select one to download in HD quality. Stability AI imagines Stable Doodle as a way for laymen to quickly create high-quality images for &ldquo;presentations decks and websites, or even create logos,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/13/stability-ai-releases-stable-doodle-a-sketch-to-image-tool/&amp;xcust=2-1-1996404-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a representative told TechCrunch</a>. You can try the service out now, though you&rsquo;ll need to create a free account to get more than one set of image previews. </p>

## Bethesdaâ€™s Starfield PC system requirements: An SSD is mandatory
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1996675/starfield-these-are-the-system-requirements-ssd-is-mandatory.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1996675/starfield-these-are-the-system-requirements-ssd-is-mandatory.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Starfield is the next big game (and the first new IP in a <em>long</em> time) from Bethesda Game Studios, the iconic developer behind the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series. The release is eagerly anticipated, and many gamers can hardly wait to discover the vast universe of Starfield.</p>



<p>But that wish might not come true for all PC gamers: Bethesda <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/STARFIELD/&amp;xcust=2-1-1996675-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">published the system requirements for Starfield on Steam a</a> few weeks ago and they show that even for low graphics settings, a reasonably high-performance gaming PC is required. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="starfield-system-requirements-on-steam">Starfield &ndash; System requirements on Steam</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Minimum requirements</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Windows 10 version 22H2 (10.0.19045)</td><td>Windows 10/11 with updates</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K</td><td>AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics</td><td>AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti</td><td>AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080</td></tr><tr><td>DirectX</td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>125GB available memory</td><td>125GB available memory</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>SSD required</td><td>SSD required</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In addition to a graphics card on the level of an AMD Radeon RX 5700 or Nvidia GeForce 1070 Ti, a RAM configuration of at least 16GB is required. That is also sufficient for the recommended requirements, however. You should also free up plenty of space on your SSD, because at least 125GB is required. And we deliberately wrote &ldquo;SSD&rdquo; and not &ldquo;hard drive,&rdquo; because Starfield is perhaps the first game that requires an SSD to play.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>These system requirements are still very vague so far and do not give us exact information about what resolutions and levels of detail they&rsquo;re designed for. Our guess is that the minimum requirements should apply to gaming in 1080p at low settings, while &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; probably applies to 1440p gaming at high settings. For 4K gaming, even the recommended components are unlikely to be sufficient. Bethesda is expected to announce more details as the launch gets even closer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bethesda-publishes-system-requirements-again-only-with-amd-components">Bethesda publishes system requirements again, only with AMD components</h2>



<p>Steam isn&rsquo;t the only place Bethesda released Starfield&rsquo;s system requirements, though.

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for an affordable content creation laptop, you better stick around, as we&rsquo;ve unearthed an awesome deal for you today. Newegg&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/safari-gold-acer-swift-x-sfx14-41g-r7yt-everyday-value/p/1TS-000X-03CU0&amp;xcust=2-1-1996460-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Acer Swift X Creator Laptop for just $579.99</a>, which is a savings of $370. That&rsquo;s no joke. This machine features an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU and a 14-inch 1080p display with 100 percent sRGB coverage. It&rsquo;s powerful enough for photo editing tasks and basic gaming as well as day-to-day use. Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>



<p>The Acer Swift X packs an AMD Ryzen 5 5600U CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of NVMe SSD storage. The 8GB of RAM is a little light, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem as long as you&rsquo;re not rendering super big files or playing games on Ultra settings (which the modest RTX 3050 probably couldn&rsquo;t handle well anyway). The 14-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 with 100 percent sRGB. That means it can produce a wider range of colors. It also weighs just a little over three pounds, making it a solid travel companion.</p>



<p>This is a great deal. However, it&rsquo;s so great that we don&rsquo;t expect it to last very long. Act now if you&rsquo;re interested!</p>

## Windows 11â€™s clock now displays seconds, a change opposed for decades

<p>Is the clock in the Windows taskbar able to show seconds? Not historically, but it&rsquo;s been a debate within Microsoft for many years &mdash; a debate that has now been put to rest with a recent update for Windows 11. Now, you can opt to show seconds in your taskbar&rsquo;s clock.</p>



<p>With this change, Windows 11 breaks with an old Windows tradition. But first things first. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-11s-taskbar-clock-now-shows-seconds">Windows 11&rsquo;s taskbar clock now shows seconds</h2>



<p>After long tests in the Insider versions of Windows 11, Microsoft has now activated the seconds display in the taskbar clock for all Windows 11 users with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/topic/11-juli-2023-kb5028185-betriebssystembuild-22621-1992-605fa18f-bd49-41d8-80b1-245080e26c3d&amp;xcust=2-1-1996440-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update KB5028185</a> last week. The option to turn it on can be found in your Windows settings under &ldquo;Personalization -&gt; Taskbar -&gt; Taskbar behaviors.&rdquo; Check the box that says &ldquo;Show seconds in the taskbar clock&rdquo; to activate it. When you do, Microsoft warns that the setting &ldquo;consumes more power.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windowseinstellungen f&uuml;r die Anzeige von Sekunden" class="wp-image-1995938" height="786" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows11UhrerhaltSekundenanzeige.webp?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An unfamiliar picture: The taskbar clock with seconds display.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Screenshot</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-the-taskbar-clock-in-windows-didnt-display-seconds-until-now">Why the taskbar clock in Windows didn&rsquo;t display seconds until now</h2>



<p>As early as 2003, Microsoft discussed whether it would be a good idea to have the taskbar clock display seconds in addition to hours and minutes. This function was integrated in beta versions of Windows on a trial basis, but did not make it into the final versions. The reason: Especially on weak computers with 4 megabytes of RAM, which was still common at that time, the performance of Windows deteriorated considerably when users had the seconds displayed on the clock. After all, an additional 4 kilobytes of valuable memory were consumed, plus the computing power needed to update the screen. In line with the developer principle &ldquo;The fastest code is the one that doesn&rsquo;t run,&rdquo; it was decided not to introduce the seconds feature in prior versions of Windows.</p>



<p>In Windows 10, the seconds display was finally added &mdash; but not as an option in Settings. Instead, users had to activate the seconds display via a registry key. This trick was removed in Windows 11.</p>



<p>In April 2022, Microsoft developer Raymond Chen published <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220411-00/?p=106456&amp;xcust=2-1-1996440-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a blog post </a>titled &ldquo;Now that computers have more than 4MB of memory, can we get seconds in the taskbar?&rdquo; Referencing potential impairment of the overall performance of Windows 11, Chen spoke out against the seconds display in his blog post, but it clearly didn&rsquo;t stop the feature from finally shipping this time around.</p>

<p>In the crowded field of economy laptops, there&rsquo;s no shortage of cheap and yet a dearth of quality. The Acer Aspire 3 shows up nicely in this category, sporting simple, low-profile styling, a full-size keyboard complete with a number pad, and a wide screen that&rsquo;s a pleasure to videoconference on. While there&rsquo;s no shortage of trade-offs for the low $400 price point, Acer has made judicious decisions to produce a machine that gives you plenty of bang for relatively few bucks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-specs-and-features">Acer Aspire 3: Specs and features</h2>



<p>Modestly spec&rsquo;d with a 2.4GHz AMD Ryzen CPU, 8BG of RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive, the Aspire 3 is no workhorse, but packs enough punch to get things done on a budget. You&rsquo;ll find an HDMI port for connecting to external displays and a single USB-C port for hooking up newer accessories and devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CPU: </strong>Quad-core 2.4GHz AMD Ryzen 7320U</li>



<li><strong>Memory: </strong>8GB</li>



<li><strong>Graphics/GPU: </strong>AMD Radeon<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>Display: </strong>15.8-inch LED-backlit LCD&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Storage: </strong>128GB</li>



<li><strong>Connectivity:&nbsp; </strong>1 HDMI Port, 2 USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, 1 USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port</li>



<li><strong>Networking: </strong>IEEE 802.11ax Wi-Fi</li>



<li><strong>Biometrics: </strong>None</li>



<li><strong>Battery capacity: </strong>40 watt-hour</li>



<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.74 inches x 14.3 inches x 9.4 inches</li>



<li><strong>Weight: </strong>3.97 pounds</li>
</ul>



<p>What&rsquo;s missing from these specs that you might miss? An SD card reader would be nice, as would a second USB-C port. Getting by with just one of those is going to be a drag from time to time, but you can always plug in an adapter to add more.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire 3 Front" class="wp-image-1989537" height="923" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Acer_Asipire3_front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Aspire 3&rsquo;s big keyboard with number pad is a joy to type on.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-design-and-build-quality">Acer Aspire 3: Design and build quality</h2>



<p>Weighing in at just under four pounds, the Aspire 3 isn&rsquo;t exactly lightweight, but in exchange for maybe an extra quarter-pound of carry weight, you get a wide 15.8-inch enough room for that full-width keyboard. As someone who lives and dies by the spreadsheet I&rsquo;m a sucker for a number pad on my keyboards, so getting one on such an affordable machine is pretty sweet. This keyboard feels fairly solid under the fingers, without too much flex or bounce in heavy typing. That matters, because budget machines often sacrifice chassis structure to cut costs, and the results can feel flimsy and even lead to bounce on the track pad, causing the mouse cursor to bounce around the screen. But no such worry on this Acer; it&rsquo;s actually a pleasure to type on.</p>



<p>In front of that wide keyboard, we find a relatively spacious 3-inch by 5-inch touchpad. Unlike those of other Acer laptops we&rsquo;ve tried, this trackpad feels firm and smooth to the touch, and responds with a decisive, but quiet, click. We found it tracks well with both single-digit and multi-touch gestures.</p>



<p>Though somewhat bulky at roughly 3/4 of an inch in thickness, the Aspire 3 makes room for a healthy array of ports. The entire laptop looks and feels substantially more solid than most other sub-$500 laptops we&rsquo;ve tested. It&rsquo;s a machine fit for a working adult, not a cheap, plastic kid&rsquo;s computer. Our only significant complaint with the build quality is that the screen wobbles a bit when we move it around while open, rather than sitting firm. This means the webcam image will wobble during use if you move the device, which we experienced in our testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-display-and-audio">Acer Aspire 3: Display and audio</h2>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s budget laptops, including the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/619606/acer-aspire-5-review-this-laptop-covers-the-basics-at-a-very-low-price.html">Aspire 5 we reviewed last year</a>, have long stood out for their 1080p displays. The Aspire 3 comes similarly equipped, though as the market advances the competition is bringing the same resolution to their budget lines as well, so it no longer stands out from the crowd on this front. That said, if you&rsquo;re buying a laptop in 2023, 1080p is the lowest resolution a buyer should accept, since 768p barely fits most modern web pages in their native resolution. Responsive web design is nice and all, but if your 15-inch laptop screen triggers a minimized layout with the browser window maximized, you might as well be browsing on an iPad Mini.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Aspire 3 puts you squarely in the acceptable resolution range for current devices, but as I said, that&rsquo;s the bare minimum we&rsquo;d want at this point. Overall, we liked the look of the Aspire 3&rsquo;s display for movies and video. Color quality was decent, though unremarkable, and bright enough for comfortable use in full sun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A pair of small, downward-pointing speakers kick out fairly loud audio that we found well tuned for video conferencing and YouTube videos, but just a little tinny for any music with much bass.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-webcam-and-microphone">Acer Aspire 3: Webcam and microphone</h2>



<p>In videoconferencing tests, the Aspire 3 blew away our expectations for an economy laptop. The HD webcam produced crisp, clean video and the mic picked up and filtered voices from the background noise quite well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Side by side with a Macbook Pro, we particularly liked the Aspire 3&rsquo;s low-light webcam performance. Equipped with Temporal Noise Reduction, the high-def cam cleans up otherwise grainy low-light video and increases the exposure levels to deliver a bright, crisp image that outperforms most of the other built-in webcams we&rsquo;ve tried, even on much pricier computers.</p>



<p>Similarly, the mic cleans up in-room audio with Acer PurifiedVoice software that filters out noise and sends clear, crisp sound to your recipient. For a computer in this price range, that&rsquo;s saying a lot. Overall, with its image and voice capture quality, we&rsquo;d rather jump on a Zoom with the Acer Aspire 3 than with some machines at quadruple the price.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire 3 left side" class="wp-image-1989536" height="538" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Acer_Aspire3_left.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>On its left side, the Aspire 3 has a DC power portm a USB-C port, a full-size HDMI port, and a USB-A port.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-connectivity">Acer Aspire 3: Connectivity</h2>



<p>One upside of a bigger laptop is the capacity for a lot of useful connectors. Along the left side you&rsquo;ll find the DC in, a single USB-C port, a full-size HDMI port, and a USB-A port. On the right, you get a Kensington lock port, another USB-A, and a headphone jack. What you don&rsquo;t get at this price is a second USB-C port, which is becoming common on better laptops these days, or a card reader slot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For most users, this complement of ports will be plenty and getting both a USB-C and a full HDMI port on a $400 laptop isn&rsquo;t bad. If you do need to read an SD card, you can always plug an adapter into one of the USB ports.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire 3 right side" class="wp-image-1989535" height="496" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Acer_Aspire3_right.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The right side of the Aspire 3 offers a Kensington lock port, a USB-A port, and a headphone jack.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-performance">Acer Aspire 3: Performance</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re spending $400 on a laptop, you should temper your performance expectations considerably. With its Quad-core 2.4GHz AMD Ryzen 7320U process and Radeon graphics, the Acer Aspire 3 is no exception, delivering decent performance in basic business tasks, but notably sub-par results for graphics and gaming.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire 3 PCMark 10 Score" class="wp-image-1989531" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Aspire3_PCMark10png.png" width="600" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>When it comes to business productivity performance, the Acer Aspire 3 is middle-of-the-pack for affordable laptops.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<p>Our PCMark 10 test measures the machine&rsquo;s performance in everyday office tasks ranging from word processing and spreadsheets to video conferencing. The Aspire 3 gave a middle-of-the-pack performance of 4,284 in a field of slightly pricier machines we&rsquo;ve tested in recent months, notably outperforming the 3,902 score of the Intel-equipped Aspire 5 we tested last year. This is a good thing because this machine is built to appeal to school and small-business users. If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable laptop for back-to-school in the fall or need to replace an aging work machine on a budget, this performance indicates a decent investment.</p>



<p>For movies and video playback, the Aspire 3 again outperforms other budget systems we&rsquo;ve tested. On our multi-thread Cinebench 15 test, the Aspire 3 came in at the top of the pack of economy laptops with a score of 1,925. On the single-thread Cinebench test, its score of 435 beat out the others we have a result for.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Cinebench R15 All Threads" class="wp-image-1989534" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Aspire3_CinebenchR15All.png" width="600" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Acer Aspire 3&rsquo;s video performance in our Cinebench test is significantly better than other budget laptops we&rsquo;ve tested.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<p>Where the Aspire 3 falls very short, even against other cheap laptops we&rsquo;ve tested, is its gaming graphics performance. In our 3DMark TimeSpy 1.2 test, this machine was downright pitiful with a score of 584, less than half that of the Aspire 5. Whether this is acceptable or not depends on how you feel about gaming, of course. If you&rsquo;re buying this to write or surf the web, you won&rsquo;t care. But if this is a student laptop, let&rsquo;s just say you won&rsquo;t have to worry about games distracting you from study time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire 3 3DMark TimeSpy" class="wp-image-1989533" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Aspire3_TimeSpy.png" width="600" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Aspire 3 is no gaming laptop, with the lowest 3D score in any of our recent budget-laptop tests.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-battery-life">Acer Aspire 3: Battery life</h2>



<p>Battery life was one more positive performance for the Aspire 3. In our tests playing back a movie on repeat until the battery died, it averaged about eight hours of life consistently. That&rsquo;s just about a full work day and if you&rsquo;re not playing video constantly and maybe take a lunch break, it should be more than enough to get you through the day. If you need to charge up, the Aspire 3&rsquo;s tiny charging brick is one of the most compact around, so it slips into your bag without taking up too much space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-aspire-3-should-you-buy-it">Acer Aspire 3: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>In a world where budget constraints force compromises, the Acer Aspire 3 represents a smart set of trade-offs. It&rsquo;s easily one of the best-built laptops we&rsquo;ve tested for under $500, with sturdy construction and a spacious keyboard and trackpad. While it won&rsquo;t give gamers much joy, it&rsquo;s a plenty competent work machine that&rsquo;ll make you look and sound good on Zoom calls. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a basic business laptop or back-to-school computer, you&rsquo;ll want to take a closer look.</p>

<p>Hard disk drives may seem outdated and useless, now that solid state drives keep plummeting in price. But even with how relatively cheap SSDs are currently, buying a hard disk drive instead of an SSD can still make sense&mdash;it just depends on what you&rsquo;re using it for and what your PC setup is like.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s when you should consider a spinning-platter drive instead of an SSD.</p>

<p>If you only have one drive in your PC, then yes, an SSD is a better choice. Your boot times will be faster, your games and other files will load quicker, and your computer will feel more responsive. Swapping a HDD boot drive for an SSD is the first suggestion I make to people looking to breathe new life into their PC.</p>



<p>But if you need more storage, a hard disk drive usually works just fine, unless you&rsquo;ll be reading and writing to the disk often or if speed is a priority. You don&rsquo;t have to have space in your PC for an HDD to take advantage of the cost and capacity benefits, either&mdash;external HDDs are a fine option. The speed of the actual drive matters more than how it connects to your PC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="you-dont-want-to-spend-a-lot-on-a-drive">You don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot on a drive</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Price history for Samsung 980 Pro 1TB (as of 7/12/23)" class="wp-image-1992332" height="602" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/samsung-980-pro-pirce-history.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>SSD prices have tumbled a lot in the last half year (even when you ignore Amazon Prime Day sale pricing).</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Right now, a 1TB SSD costs as little $55&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not on sale. It&rsquo;s astonishingly low, given that the price was double less than a year ago.</p>



<p>But for the same price, you can get a 2TB HDD, which gives you much more space for videos, photos, and other files. That price benefit only improves as capacity increases. A 4TB SSD will run you about $200 (or roughly the cost of a 14TB HDD); meanwhile, a 4TB hard disk drive will only set you back about $75. Hard disk drives offer more storage for less money.</p>



<p>Not only are they good for storing files you don&rsquo;t access as often, but they&rsquo;re a cheaper way to get enough backup storage, too. The rule of 3-2-1 says you need at least three copies of your files, two different storage devices (or services if you involve the cloud), and at least one copy off-site. Cloud storage is convenient, but if you have a lot of files, a backup drive (or drives, to ensure one copy is kept in a different physical location) is cheaper over the long haul.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="you-need-a-lot-of-storage">You need a LOT of storage</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="WD Red Pro 22TB NAS drive" class="wp-image-1992335" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/61hjIwjTQmL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">You can&rsquo;t beat hard -disk drives on storage capacity.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Western Digital</p></div>



<p>For all their strengths, SSDs are hampered by one thing&mdash;capacity. Unlike HDDs, they&rsquo;ve expanded more slowly to include larger capacities. If you want tons of storage, a HDD more readily fits the bill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now consumer SSDs max out at 8TB, while consumer HDDs top out around 22TB. (And as covered above, there&rsquo;s a big cost difference between similar capacities as a result.) A single hard disk drive purchase can much more meaningfully expand your available space, especially if you&rsquo;re looking to build a NAS unit or a home server. In fact, with your cost savings, you can probably pay for the NAS unit or home server hardware.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="however-an-ssd-is-never-a-bad-choice">However! An SSD is never a bad choice</h2>



<p>As useful as HDDs can still be, not having one in your PC (even if it&rsquo;s the better match) isn&rsquo;t a mistake. Sure, a PC with nothing but SSDs might be overkill or a little small in size for your situation, but your system will run fast and smooth. When SSDs eventually become available in large capacities (above 10TB) at the same prices of today&rsquo;s HDDs, they&rsquo;ll become the default.</p>



<p>But until then, a hard-disk drive isn&rsquo;t an antiquated piece of technology. It still has plenty of usefulness in the right PC setup and also can save you a lot of cash.</p>

## I used Windows Dictation to write this article with my voice

<p>I&rsquo;ve touted Windows&rsquo; ability to type with just your voice for years, so I finally decided to put my money where my mouth is: I used Windows&rsquo; Voice Access and Windows Dictation to &ldquo;type&rdquo; this entire story. It was easier than I thought&hellip; and, weirdly, harder. </p>



<p>Windows 11 contains two methods to control a PC with your voice: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/558293/new-windows-11-build-tests-voice-access-spotlight-backgrounds-feature.html">Voice Access</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407392/how-windows-10-dictation-works.html">Windows Dictation</a>, whose original version debuted in Windows 10. Voice Access allows you to navigate within your PC using just your voice, while Windows Dictation allows you to dictate text into a document. While they were both designed for accessibility, they might&mdash;potentially?&mdash;improve productivity for people used to keyboard and mouse inputs. </p>



<p>The big problem, I found? Simply getting used to the controls.</p>



<p>Yes, writing within Windows using just my voice was a challenge in itself. But navigating within an application, using just my voice, sometimes felt nearly impossible. This underscores that we have a long way to go in improving accessibility within the Windows environment, and reveals the challenges faced by those who depend on these features. I discovered that a person who&rsquo;s used to dictating their thoughts can increase productivity dramatically, but obstacles in navigating within that text can undercut any of the potential gains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-use-voice-access-and-windows-dictation">How to use Voice Access and Windows Dictation</h2>



<p>Voice access can be found within the Windows 11 accessibility menu. Open the Settings menu, then <em>Accessibility &gt; Speech</em>. You&rsquo;ll need to toggle on <em>Voice access</em> but you shouldn&rsquo;t need to specifically select voice typing. After you toggle on voice access you&rsquo;ll have an option to go ahead and view a short tutorial on how to use it, demonstrating how you can use your voice to select highlighted elements and interact with them. (You can also put voice access in sleep mode, a good idea if you&rsquo;re going to be watching a YouTube video.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Settings Voice Access" class="wp-image-1981616" height="815" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-Settings-voice-access.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">You can enable Voice Access within the Settings menu. You don&rsquo;t need to manually turn on Windows Speech Recognition, a legacy app.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>My first tip: Make sure you either use a headset or a good laptop with noise-cancelling microphones. You&rsquo;ll want to minimize as many mistakes as you can, and a good mic is equivalent to a good keyboard in this regard.</p>



<p>My problems, though, began immediately. Windows is smart enough to understand when you want to click a highlighted button, but I couldn&rsquo;t even do that! The first thing I learned is that being a left-hander is not conducive to dictation. Every time I tried to use voice access in the tutorial I found that my &ldquo;click&rdquo; command was interpreted as a right click and would not work. Switching my default mouse settings back to a right-handed configuration solved that problem, even as it ticked me off as a lefty. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Voice Access setup" class="wp-image-1981615" height="720" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voice-access-guide.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Microsoft includes a short tutorial to get you used to using voice commands. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s when you want to interact with a non-obvious screen element, like a button, that things get complicated. If the button is highlighted, saying &ldquo;click OK&rdquo; will click the button on your screen marked &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the easy part. But if you want to click on something somewhat random, it can get tricky.</p>



<p>Voice access also uses a grid system to allow you to hunt down and select an element on the page. Windows paints an overlay with a grid with the numbers one to nine, and then allows you to select an individual number to zoom in further. Saying &ldquo;click seven&rdquo; moves the cursor to click whatever is in the numbered area, hopefully. But zooming in takes time, and it&rsquo;s not always perfectly accurate.  </p>



<p>Windows 11 also includes some basic controls to interact with Windows itself. For example, to switch between apps, you can say the command &ldquo;show task switcher.&rdquo; That brings up the <strong>Alt+Tab </strong>tab menu and allows you to switch between apps. Doing so, though, takes a little effort: You&rsquo;ll need to either use a manual scroll command, or use the grid system to narrow down your choice.  </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Voice Access grid" class="wp-image-1981617" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voice-access-grid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Trying to navigate between visual elements using Voice Access requires progressively narrowing down a grid. In this case, saying &ldquo;click subject&rdquo; should take your cursor to the subject line, but it doesn&rsquo;t work.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>You can also switch directly to an app like Edge via the &ldquo;switch to&rdquo; command. Though that has some unexpected wrinkles, too. For one thing, if you have more than one Edge window open, it&rsquo;s not really obvious how to switch from one to the other with just your voice. I used the navigation grid. </p>



<p>Opening File Explorer was easy enough, but trying to select the Documents folder was seemingly impossible with just my voice. Again, I had to use the grid system. It&rsquo;s certainly possible that there was a shortcut that would have solved my problem, but even reviewing Microsoft&rsquo;s help documents didn&rsquo;t immediately indicate what I needed to do. Orally switching to Word brought up a list of recent documents. But I couldn&rsquo;t select one with my voice? I was lost.</p>



<p>Still, navigating through Windows was a cakewalk compared to actually using a text editor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Voice Access numbers" class="wp-image-1981639" height="719" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Windows-11-Voice-Access-numbers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alternatively, you can navigate via a &ldquo;show numbers&rdquo; command. This attaches numbers to fields you can interact with, but gets visually cluttered, fast.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="editing-with-voice-commands-is-a-nightmare">Editing with voice commands is a nightmare</h2>



<p>Using Windows 11&rsquo;s voice access, dictation happens automatically if the cursor is in a text box. This is easy enough, and Windows does a good job transcribing what you say. (Just be careful if you talk to yourself.)</p>



<p>But Windows gets confused when you use words that can be interpreted both as words and as actions, or as punctuation.</p>



<p>For this, there are three options: <em>Default mode</em>, <em>Dictation mode</em>, and <em>Command mode</em>. Dictation mode allows you to type naturally with your voice, allowing Windows to interject punctuation where it thinks it&rsquo;s needed, or by your command via words like &ldquo;comma.&rdquo; Command mode can be used for controlling Windows. Default is a hybrid of the two.</p>



<p>The problem is that certain editing features work only in command mode and certain editing features work only in dictation mode. So if you want to &ldquo;delete the entire line,&rdquo; you have to issue that command in either the command or default mode. If you&rsquo;re in dictation mode, that command doesn&rsquo;t work. On the other hand, dictation mode is sometimes the only option for dictating words that could be interpreted as commands, like in this article. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Voice Access Commands" class="wp-image-1981628" height="1026" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voice-access-commands.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Microsoft includes a helpful guide for  Voice Access, with commands you can issue to your PC.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Fortunately, if you click the small &ldquo;?&rdquo; icon in the upper right-hand corner of the voice access window, you can see a list of available commands. I ended up putting those on a second monitor to use as a reference guide.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s still an <em>enormous</em> hassle to edit using only your voice. Some things are easy enough; italicizing &ldquo;enormous&rdquo; is as easy as literally saying &ldquo;italicize enormous.&rdquo; But trying to eliminate an extra character or swap a homophone for the correct word can require a bunch of trial and error if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. Instead of moving a mouse to correct a word, you might have to tell Windows to move up a paragraph, then highlight the correct word, then make whatever editing changes are necessary. (Windows isn&rsquo;t always recognized as a noun, though you can say &ldquo;capitalize Windows&rdquo; to fix this.)</p>



<p>Still, it&rsquo;s easy enough to select a word with your voice. But navigating inside of a UI can be a real pain. (So is trying to tell Windows to put &ldquo;UI&rdquo; in all caps.) We use WordPress as a text editor, and you quickly realize that it has so many little bits and pieces that you need to click on accurately to make everything work properly. Drop-down menus, right-click options, graphics, selecting and adding categories &mdash; I did it all manually. The quickest way to gain appreciation for assistive technologies is to try using them yourself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-hybrid-approach-works-best">A hybrid approach works best</h2>



<p>So did I do <em>everything</em> in this article entirely by voice? No. While it was relatively painless to dictate via my voice, editing was just too much. Some people essentially write almost in dictation mode by default. I tend to stop, start, correct myself, and then move on. If you pause too much, however, Windows interprets it as a period and begins a new sentence. That&rsquo;s a pain to correct, too.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s hope, though. When I was in what I would call &ldquo;flow,&rdquo; typing via voice was just as fast as typing with my hands, and even faster. And I assume this will improve further. Microsoft is applying AI to virtually every facet of Windows. I would expect that this will happen in assistive technologies as well. Over time, what I would hope to happen is some fusion of my writing, Microsoft&rsquo;s interpretation of my writing, and possibly automatic transcription of an interview or presentation &mdash; a hybrid of dictation, typing, and transcription. </p>



<p>What I was left with, though, was a deep appreciation of assistive technologies, and the challenges faced by those users who have to use them every day. Windows Dictation and Voice Access are simple enough &mdash; it&rsquo;s just that last 5 to 10 percent of effort required to make your output professional that&rsquo;s the real challenge.</p>
