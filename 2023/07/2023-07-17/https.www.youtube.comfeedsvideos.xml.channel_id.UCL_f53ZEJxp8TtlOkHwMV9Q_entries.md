In episode one, Jordan and his roundtable explore the themes of freedom against tyranny, Godâ€™s allowance of evil, and faith as an adventure within the first three chapters of Exodus. They seek to answer the question of whether one should take the easy path even if it is wrong or do what is right despite it being hard.
