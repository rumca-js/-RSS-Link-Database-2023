They've also been startled by its mainstream success. But the truth is that the conspiratorial right and the Hollywood default aren't that different \u2014 which is why, perhaps, our polity has had such difficulty rejecting QAnon, Trump and fascism.\"\n</p><p>\n\tIndependent reporter Andy Ngo and YouTuber Shoe found some interesting things from Berlatsky's background that may or may not give insight into WHY he doesn't like such a movie as \"The Sound of Freedom.\" It starts with Berlatsky being the spokesperson for a M.A.P. advocacy group.

The good news is that there is no evidence of this being shown to children in a school setting (yet). The bad news is Coco has been around since 2016, has over 260,000 followers and three million likes on TikTok, and the videos are tagged \"kids songs.\"</p><p>I know Sweeden is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sweden-drag-storytime-library\" target=\"_blank\">from a weird part of the world</a>.

It is disturbing enough to know it would be <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kindergarten-outrage-homework-assignment\" target=\"_blank\">acceptable to teachers' union employees in this country</a>.</p><p>And I guess if I had to choose one thing to find the most offensive, it's that the songs act like an anthem for your kid's kindergarten teacher to indoctrinate them behind your back. Coco's father has the old-timey belief that boys have ding-dong and girls have a butterfly. It is the role of the KINDERGARTEN TEACHER to tell Coco to ignore his parents. Hence us adding \"yet\" to the qualifier there were no stories of this being shown in an educational setting.</p><p>I would be the happiest right-wing sonuvabitch blogger in the world for anyone to tell me I fell for a crude joke or that I'm hallucinating right now.
