<p>The UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal has conditionally agreed to pause Microsoft's appeal of the UK's Competition And Markets Authority's (CMA) prior decision to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Both Microsoft and the UK's Competition And Markets Authority requested more time to negotiate, just before the CMA's decision deadline. For the appeal to be halted, though, certain evidence still needs to be provided by by Thursday, July 20. Further time for negotiation could mean a brief delay in Microsoft's acquisition.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23797823/microsoft-and-cma-get-more-time-to-negotiate">The Verge</a>, the CMA has extended the date for its final order from July 18 to August 29. Therefore, it's possible that the deal will only resolve after July 18, though exactly when is unknown. However, if the deal extends beyond July 18, Microsoft will need to apply for an extension or pay Activision a $3 billion fee. Between Microsoft's defeat of the FTC and Activision's removal from the NASDAQ stock exchange, it was possible the acquisition would be finished in the next 24 hours. Now, it looks as though it may take a little longer.</p><p>Back in April, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uk-blocked-the-microsoft-activision-merger-so-what-happens-next/1100-6513589/">CMA blocked the acquisition over concerns about a cloud gaming monopoly</a>. Microsoft appealed soon after. Recently, negotiations between the CMA and Microsoft broke new ground after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wins-court-case-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/1100-6515704/">the company stopped the Federal Trade Commission's temporary injunction in court</a>. Prior reports indicated that Microsoft was willing to offer a "small divestment," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-offers-small-divestiture-to-help-activision-deal-close-in-uk-report/1100-6515922/">likely something to do with cloud gaming in the UK</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-activision-blizzard-acquisition-may-not-have-a-resolution-by-tuesday-after-all/1100-6516039/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Former Naughty Dog Boss Points Out Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning's Similarity To Uncharted 2

<p>Former Naughty Dog boss Bruce Straley has reacted to how the newest Mission Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning: Part One, features a scene reminiscent of a sequence from Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Straley shared images from the movie and from Uncharted 2, with the caption, "... the sincerest form of flattery!" with a winky-face emoji (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-naughty-dog-bruce-straley-on-mission-impossible-dead-reckonings-similarity-to-uncharted-2">via IGN</a>).</p><p>He's playfully suggesting that Dead Reckoning took some inspiration from Uncharted 2's epic opening train sequence where Drake must climb upwards through a train car that is suspended off a cliff. Something sort of similar happens in Dead Reckoning, and with the images stacked up side-by-side like in Straley's tweet, it's pretty easy to notice the similarities.</p><p>For what it's worth, Uncharted and the Nathan Drake character are inspired by the Indiana Jones series and action movies in general.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-naughty-dog-boss-points-out-mission-impossible-dead-reckonings-similarity-to-uncharted-2/1100-6516037/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's finally time for a new year in Madden, and ratings week has kicked off the start of the 2023-2024 campaign. After initially revealing Justin Jefferson as the first member of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-best-players-revealed/1100-6516008/">Madden 24 99 Club</a>, the official Madden Twitter account unveiled all of the OVR ratings for each wide receiver in the game.</p><p>Of course, it's the top ten receivers that have garnered the most attention. Compared to last year, there are certainly familiar faces in the top ten, but there are also a few surprises that come as a result of some stellar play during the 2022-23 season. As always, these ratings are subject to change throughout the course of the next year, so fans shouldn't get too attached to where each receiver stands. For now, though, fans can view the top ten wide receivers to begin the year in Madden 24.</p><h2>Top 10 WRs in Madden 24</h2><p>There is almost always at least one wide receiver in the 99 Club of Madden, and this year the distinction belongs to Minnesota Vikings star Justin Jefferson. Jefferson dazzled fans and opponents in his junior season and managed to dethrone Davante Adams as the 99 Club's only wide receiver. Time will tell if Jefferson can keep his hold on the spot, as there are some incredible receivers lurking just behind him in the ratings.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-madden-24-wrs-top-wide-receivers-by-ovr-rating/1100-6516036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Michael Cera has revealed he questioned whether or not he should keep acting after after quickly becoming a famous teenager from his roles in the movies Juno and Superbad.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/fame-makes-you-paranoid-michael-cera-on-barbie-drunk-fans-and-not-owning-a-smartphone">The Guardian</a> that the quick fame he achieved after those films was "sort of overwhelming." He said he didn't know how to handle simply walking down the street over concerns about how people might act around him. "Fame makes you very uncomfortable in your own skin, and makes you paranoid and weird. There were lots of great things about it, and I met a lot of amazing people, but there's a lot of bad energies, too, ones that I was not equipped to handle," he said.</p><p>Cera said drunk people in particular who recognized him created a "toxic" environment with their actions around him."When you're a kid, people also feel they can kind of grab you--they're not that respectful of you or your physical space," he said. "I didn't know how to respectfully establish my own boundaries."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-cera-on-why-he-nearly-quit-acting-after-superbad-and-juno/1100-6516030/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Gameloft has revealed patch notes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>'s new DreamSnaps Update, detailing everything players can expect to change when the update goes live this Wednesday, July 19. Major changes include multiplayer photography challenges, a new character, and a wide variety of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest part of the update is the titular DreamSnaps mechanic, which will task players with taking photos and entering weekly challenges to earn Moonstones, furniture, and cosmetic items. Exactly how the challenges will play out are yet to be seen, but it marks the first type of multiplayer functionality in the game and should give us a hint as to how Gameloft intends to leverage its online features in the future.</p><p>For those who aren't feeling as creative, the addition of Vanellope may be the most exciting element of the update. This popular Wreck-It Ralph character is speeding into the valley with her own house and a set of quests that are sure to reward plenty of cool new items.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-patch-notes-detail-what-to-expect-in-this-weeks-dreamsnaps-update/1100-6516031/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> will introduce a big change to item level requirements alongside the game's first season, associate game director Joe Piepiora has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with the German site <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/diablo-4-season-1-loot-aenderungen,3397512.html">GameStar</a> and later clarified on <a href="https://twitter.com/JPiepiora/status/1680963567959568385?s=20">Twitter</a>, Piepiora revealed that Diablo IV's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-prepare-for-season-1-season-of-the-malignant/1100-6515774/">Season of the Malignant</a> patch will cap the level requirements needed to wear Sacred and Ancestral items. Sacred items, which begin to drop in World Tier III, will have a max level requirement of 60. Ancestral items, which only drop in World Tier IV, will have a max level requirement of 80.</p><p dir="ltr">While a little confusing at first, this doesn't mean that characters who aren't level 60 suddenly can't equip Sacred items. Instead, the change means that gear found by a player on a high-level character will be more easily shareable with lower-level characters. Previously, players at level 100 would only find gear requiring a level 100 character to equip, meaning it couldn't be thrown in the stash and saved for another, lower-level character. Come Season 1, if a level 100 Barbarian player finds a great Sacred item for a Rogue, the Rogue will only need to be level 60 to equip it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-make-it-easier-to-gear-new-characters-with-season-1-update/1100-6516033/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Moving around in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> can be a bit of a slow affair without the extra energy provided by eating meals.

## Future Nintendo And PC Gaming Handhelds Could Be Required To Have A Replaceable Battery

<p>Future handheld consoles and gaming PCs will be required to have replaceable batteries from 2027 according to newly passed European Union regulation, which will have an impact on new hardware released beginning that year. According to the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/07/10/council-adopts-new-regulation-on-batteries-and-waste-batteries/">EU papers</a> (via <a href="https://overkill.wtf/eu-replaceable-battery-legislation-steam-deck-switch-handhelds/">Overkill</a>), the aim of this regulation is to provide consumers with easy access to their batteries, as well as strengthen "sustainability rules for batteries and waste batteries" that will regulate "the entire life cycle of batteries--from production to reuse and recycling--and ensure that they are safe, sustainable and competitive."</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/new-video-game-handhelds-may-need-to-have-a-replaceable-battery-from-2027/">VGC</a>, the documentation does leave some room for interpretation as it can't list every type of device that should be covered by the regulation, but an EU source reportedly explained to Overkill that gaming batteries are covered under the new regulation. The documentation also states that the battery needs to be "readily removable by the end-user" with commercially available tools and without requiring the use of specialized tools unless they are provided free of charge with the product.</p><p>For gaming devices, the new regulation won't force gaming manufacturers to instantly scrap the design of existing hardware once it comes into effect. But new Nintendo, Steam Deck, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-release-date-and-price-confirmed-steam-decks-big-competitor/1100-6514021/">ROG Ally</a> models may be obliged to allow users the right to repair, as opposed to the current hardware models that make it difficult to get to the internals of a device without specialized tools.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-nintendo-and-pc-gaming-handhelds-could-be-required-to-have-a-replaceable-battery/1100-6516028/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilIefxbSJT8">Hugo Decrypte</a> during a rapid-fire Q&amp;A segment of a wider interview, Nolan was asked if he would come back for another superhero movie after famously directing the Christian Bale Batman series years ago. He bluntly said, "No."</p><p>As for a Star Wars movie, Nolan took more time to consider his response before saying "pass" and declining to answer the question.</p><p>Would he make a TV show, like his brother Jonathan Nolan did with Westworld for HBO? "No," Nolan said. Does he see himself still making movies in 10 years? Yes, the director confirmed.

<p dir="ltr">For the second summer in a row, Tom Cruise has the top movie at the box office worldwide. This time, he set a franchise record with Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 as the action film earned $235 million over a five-day stretch since premiering July 12.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-box-office-opening-1235439165/">Deadline</a> reports Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning brought in $80 million domestically over those five days, with $155 million coming from international markets. For just the weekend, though, the blockbuster made $56.2 million domestically.

## The Long-Broken Matchmaking For Another Xbox 360 Game Has Suddenly Been Fixed, It Seems

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadowrun-working-title/">Shadowrun</a>, an online first-person shooter that originally launched for Xbox 360 in 2007, is now playable online again thanks to what seems like a matchmaking fix from Microsoft. Dedicated servers were shut down years ago, making it near-impossible to play the game online. Users previously had to rely on peer-to-peer networking to play with others.</p><p>Now, standard matchmaking is seemingly running again. This comes by way of a ResetEra thread from user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-has-re-resurrected-shadowrun-2007s-matchmaking-service.742734/">wwm0nkey</a> (as relayed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-seemingly-fixes-matchmaking-for-16-year-old-shadowrun/">VGC</a>), who said the Shadowrun matchmaking stopped working altogether after Microsoft seemingly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/older-cod-games-on-xbox-see-huge-player-growth-and-heres-why/1100-6516017/">fixed the servers</a> for older Call of Duty games on Xbox 360 last week. The user believes that whatever Microsoft did to fix those older Call of Duty games somehow completely broke the matchmaking for Shadowrun.</p><p>However, the user said they reached out to Microsoft, and shortly thereafter, Shadowrun was not only fixed, but running better than ever. "It actually works better than it has ever worked in the history of the game being up," the ResetEra user said. They went on to explain that before the servers went down, it would take around 30 seconds to find a match, whereas now, it takes only three seconds.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-long-broken-matchmaking-for-another-xbox-360-game-has-suddenly-been-fixed-it-seems/1100-6516021/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Viewfinder Review - One Perfect Shot

<p dir="ltr">Some of the most well-designed puzzle games are also some of the easiest to understand at a glance. Portal, for all its devious experiment rooms and conundrums within, is simple to break down and explain to new players, letting its depth reveal itself as you use its mechanics in increasingly complex ways. Baba is You is equally straightforward but can get wildly chaotic when you start truly experimenting with how far you can stretch its word-based combinations. Viewfinder neatly fits into their company. It's a short but engrossing puzzle game with a distinct and captivating central mechanic that is satisfyingly explored across a range of challenging puzzles, each of which left a grin on my face upon arriving at a solution.</p><p dir="ltr">Viewfinder's core concept lets you take static, 2D images and project them into 3D space in the world around you. For example, a Polaroid shot of an otherwise unassuming staircase can be used to construct a new path to a higher platform once projected into the world, carving out space for itself and destroying anything that might have been there beforehand. The more you play around with it, the more you start understanding different facets of how this power can be used to manipulate the serene and delightfully colorful environments around you. For example, while a picture of a plain wall might only show you what was captured in two dimensions, the effect it has once you apply it to the world is much more, sometimes throwing out whole rooms and important objects from behind it. By the same token, where you place your projections is equally important, too, as large structures that you conjure ahead of you can inadvertently shear the environment in such a way that makes reaching your objective more challenging.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166555-viewfinder_02.jpg"><img alt="Viewfinder" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/123/1239113/4166555-viewfinder_02.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Viewfinder</figcaption></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166556-viewfinder_01.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166556-viewfinder_01.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166557-viewfinder_03.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166557-viewfinder_03.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166558-viewfinder_04.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166558-viewfinder_04.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166559-viewfinder_05.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166559-viewfinder_05.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166560-viewfinder_06.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166560-viewfinder_06.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166561-viewfinder_07.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166561-viewfinder_07.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166562-viewfinder_08.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 7" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166562-viewfinder_08.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166563-viewfinder_11.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 8" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166563-viewfinder_11.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166564-viewfinder_12.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 9" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166564-viewfinder_12.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166565-viewfinder_13.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 10" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166565-viewfinder_13.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166566-viewfinder_14.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 11" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166566-viewfinder_14.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4166567-viewfinder_15.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 12" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4166567-viewfinder_15.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p dir="ltr">Viewfinder starts slowly by only offering you predefined photos that you can find around stages, easing you into the mindset that will be required by later challenges. However, it's not long before it truly lets loose by giving you a camera of your own, letting you capture stills from any angle in a stage and use them to devise your own solutions. This moment feels empowering and liberating, akin to finally being able to fire both portal types in Portal after being forced to solve puzzles with only one. It also comes at just the right time, where the complexity presented by puzzles that give you the exact tools you need to solve them is beginning to wear thin. Without the safety net of being given the pieces you need for a solution and challenging you to find them yourself, Viewfinder entrusts you to create your own solutions that can be as straightforward or wholly unique to the way you deconstruct a problem.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/viewfinder-review-one-perfect-shot/1900-6418089/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Players have recently flocked to older Call of Duty games on Xbox 360, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/">Black Ops 2</a>. Despite these games being over a decade old, the communities are still thriving thanks to a recent change to the matchmaking.</p><p>On July 12, players reported that the matchmaking--which previously disallowed users from joining matches--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-cod-games-matchmaking-might-have-been-fixed/1100-6515926/">was suddenly fixed</a>. Players then shared videos of them finally joining matches across older Call of Duty games. Prior to the fix, these older games were practically unplayable online due to the matchmaking issues.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.charlieintel.com/call-of-duty/cod-players-flock-to-classic-games-like-black-ops-2-mw3-following-xbox-server-fixes-261283/">CharlieIntel</a>, Black Ops 2 had over 10,000 players on Xbox 360 this weekend, following the matchmaking fix. Likewise, Modern Warfare 3 had over 7,000 active players on Xbox 360. While these numbers might not sound like much, it's noteworthy considering the age of the platform.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/older-cod-games-on-xbox-see-huge-player-growth-and-heres-why/1100-6516017/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last Of Us Season 2 Isn't Delayed Yet, But Could Be Soon

<p>Writing is paused on The Last of Us Season 2 for HBO, but showrunner Craig Mazin is hopeful that the new season won't be delayed due to ongoing Hollywood strikes. Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/the-last-of-us-craig-mazin-season-2-status-update-season-3-plans-spoilers-clickers-qa-1235437723/">Deadline</a>, Mazin said the production timeline hasn't been shifted enough yet to cause a delay, but "we're getting pretty close."</p><p>"We had a little more flexibility I think than normally just because we had to wait a little bit longer anyway to line up production with the weather. A lot of what we do is outside, and so we had a schedule that weirdly hasnâ€™t been immediately impacted. But we're getting pretty close; wÐµ can't keep our original start dates forever obviously," he said.</p><p>The big Hollywood writers' union, WGA, went on strike on May and there is no end in sight as of yet. The actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, began its strike on July 13. Writers and actors are striking for better pay and residuals, and protections against the rise of artificial intelligence, among other things. It is expected that a number of film and TV projects will be delayed due to the strikes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-isnt-delayed-yet-but-could-be-soon/1100-6516015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Planets In Star Wars Outlaws Are Similar In Size To Two Assassin's Creed Odyssey Zones

<p>The first open-world Star Wars game is on the way from Ubisoft, but just how open are those worlds? According to developer Massive Entertainment, Star Wars Outlaws will feature several "hand-crafted" planets to explore, each one being roughly the size of two "zones" in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey.</p><p>"It's a crude analogy, but the size of one planet might be about [equivalent to] two of the zones in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, for example," creative director Julian Gerighty said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/">Edge magazine</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-wont-procedurally-generate-planets-unlike-starfield">Eurogamer</a>). "It could be two to three zones. But it's not, you know, this sort of epic 'the whole of England recreated' approach."</p><p>It's not clear yet as to just how many planets will be available to explore in Star Wars Outlaws, but Gerighty added that Massive is looking to emphasize open-ended gameplay inside of each planetary zone. "We're really focusing on what 'open world' means to the player, which is full freedom of approach," Gerighty said. Players will also be able to explore some of the space around each planet, but as Gerighty put it, don't expect to see entire planets procedurally generated in Star Wars Outlaws, as Massive Entertainment is creating something that is more "manageable" in size.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/planets-in-star-wars-outlaws-are-similar-in-size-to-two-assassins-creed-odyssey-zones/1100-6516014/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It might be the twilight of the Switch after almost seven years of action, but it looks like the console is going out with a bang if Super Mario Bros.
