<p>This grand, wise nature epic reveals the fiery terror of prehistoric global warming – plus how Packham has evolved so much that the BBC need no longer rely on Attenborough</p><p>No natural history programme can, or should, be made these days without the climate crisis as a looming subtext at the very least. Chris Packham’s confidently grand new series Earth, a guide to “five pivotal moments” in the planet’s history, might look like an exception, since its first episode is set 252 million years ago. But unfathomably distant as that is, it is painfully relevant because of what happened at the close of the Permian period: Earth grew warmer, ending life as it existed then. <br /></p><p>A volcanic eruption, a thousand times greater than any ever seen by humans, covered one percent of Earth’s only land mass, Pangea, with liquid fire and released four million cubic metres of lava, greenhouse gas and ash. Mass extinction followed: Packham, squatting nimbly by a cliff face, demonstrates it by hammering a lump out of a thin seam of coal, left there when a lot of organic matter died suddenly. Then he chips at the rock above, finding it to be smooth and featureless, a relic of a time when nothing died because not much had survived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/17/earth-review-chris-packham-steps-confidently-into-david-attenboroughs-shoes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The new set may resemble something from the Flintstones cartoon, but Rajan clearly takes this quiz gig seriously. If only he looked more comfortable in the chair</p><p>It felt fitting that one of the colleges competing in the first episode of series 53 of University Challenge was Cambridge’s Trinity. Most long-running shows – Match of the Day, Woman’s Hour, Newsnight – have had multiple presenters but Amol Rajan, taking over as poser, completes a trinity spanning 61 years of University Challenge, following Bamber Gascoigne and Jeremy Paxman, who retired in May.</p><p>Having reached newspaper editorships and the Today studios at precocious ages, Rajan is used to being celebrated for his youth but, of the hosting trio, he has only the second shortest age gap to undergraduates. He has four years on Paxman at his debut in 1994 but Gascoigne, remarkably, was 27 when he began the franchise in 1962.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/17/university-challenge-review-amol-rajan-is-lighter-kinder-and-more-passionate-than-paxman">Continue reading...</a>

It’s very emblematic of what Bruce Weber does for Banana Republic, or advertising agencies for Abercromie &amp; Fitch, or Calvin Klein underwear ads. That’s the modern-day interpretation of Leyendecker.”</p><p>Curator Donald Albrecht is telling me about the new exhibit at the New-York Historical Society that he guest-curated: Under Cover, which centers around the (not so) subtly homoerotic advertising images created by commercial artist JC Leyendecker. The show collects 19 of the artist’s original oil paintings. Rarely seen and fabulously intriguing, these works are delightful and provocative, a glimpse into both a flourishing, pre-Stonewall gay culture and the manic energy of 1920s high society New York.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/17/jc-leyendecker-lgbtq-advertising-new-york-museum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Proposals to cap course numbers according to economic outcomes are inegalitarian and misguided</p><p>The Conservative philosopher Michael Oakeshott <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/_media/teaching/gen1113/scn_20090202113046_001.pdf" title="">described</a> one of the boons of student life as the opportunity “to look for some meaning in the things that have greatly moved mankind”. Higher education, he wrote, should be an interval during which the undergraduate will have “learned something to help him lead a more significant life”.</p><p>On that basis, one suspects that Oakeshott would have given short shrift to the dispiriting assumptions underlying Rishi Sunak’s proposed new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/14/rishi-sunak-force-english-universities-cap-low-value-degrees" title="">crackdown</a> on “low-value degrees” – a status to be defined principally by reference to earnings after graduation. Endorsing language that is gratuitously insulting to academics, Mr Sunak has pledged to cap numbers on what his government describes as “rip-off” university degrees that don’t lead to a well-paid, highly skilled job. This is a dismally narrow and instrumental view of higher education. It casually disregards the myriad benefits that a degree course can offer a young person, beyond a job at the end of it. From an enhanced capacity to think critically, to the widening of social horizons and the pleasures of independent study, attending university offers far more than a mere route to the workplace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/17/the-guardian-view-on-rip-off-degrees-another-low-value-government-intervention">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A generational talent ended Djokovic’s Wimbledon success story and could give the Serb new motivation to compete for more grand slams</p><p>It was not too long ago that the pressure of facing Novak Djokovic in a significant match was far too overwhelming for Carlos Alcaraz, as he cramped up in the middle of their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/09/novak-djokovic-outlasts-cramping-alcaraz-to-race-into-french-open-final" title="">French Open semi-final</a> and fell away. A week later, Alcaraz arrived at the Queen’s Club in London still trying to figure his life out on grass. He struggled with his movement as he was nearly beaten by a lucky loser, Arthur Rinderknech. “Honestly, my expectations in this tournament are not too high,” he said.</p><p>Within a few weeks, both issues were remarkably fully resolved.

<p>Of course Keir Starmer is cautious in the runup to an election – Labour can’t change Britain from the opposition benches</p><p></p><p>As they fail on every front, the Tories play the best card they have in their hand: managing expectations. Take this week’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66125581">three byelections</a>: every Tory MP you meet says, with a glum face, it’s a wipeout, game over.

But if Labour fails to overturn a 20,000 Tory majority, watch the narrative turn to “Starmer’s weakness”.</p><p>Time for some perspective. Even the prospect of winning a rock-solid Tory seat should remind doubters of what has been an epic climb by Labour from the despair of its 2019 near-death experience. Labour’s leader had a strategy mapped out from day one, and nothing has distracted him from it: two years to fix the party, ruthlessly expunging any who damage it; a set of <a href="https://labour.org.uk/missions/">five cast-iron missions</a>; and fiscal discipline, avoiding all spending traps ahead of the manifesto. And the result is an astounding <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/uk-opinion-polls">20-point lead</a>. Are Labour people satisfied? Of course not. We see glum faces among the left-leaning commentators, who say Labour will only win as the result of the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss catastrophes. They want to know a Labour government will be transformational, exhilarating, brave, inspired: instead they complain of extreme caution and affronts to Labour values.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/17/labour-critics-record-keir-starmer-election-britain">Continue reading...</a>

## There’s no point to Labour as a party if it won’t pay to pull children out of poverty | Owen Jones

<p>Families punished by the inhumane two-child benefit cap are being betrayed in the rush to have breakfast with business donors</p><p>Do children deserve to be driven into poverty? While a Conservative politician is unlikely to answer such a question with an affirmative, their deeds say otherwise. When George Osborne limited child tax credit and universal credit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/george-osborne-two-child-benefit-cap-britain-poorest-children">to two children</a>, he was punishing young people with hardship because of something entirely outside their control: being the third or fourth child instead of the first or second.</p><p>For Labour, the answer should be obvious: scrap the policy, because no child should be punished with poverty. Whatever New Labour’s failings, it succeeded in scooping <a href="https://cpag.org.uk/news-blogs/news-listings/back-20th-century-our-child-poverty-disaster#:~:text=Whether%20that%20last%20year%20is,2019%2F20%20to%203.2%20million">a million children</a> out of poverty. Since then, the two-child benefit cap has driven <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/06/more-than-1m-children-growing-up-in-poverty-under-two-child-benefits-limit">250,000 children into poverty</a>, and another 850,000 deeper below the breadline. Crucially, it has failed on its own stated terms of encouraging parents to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/01/two-child-limit-on-uk-welfare-benefits-has-failed-to-push-parents-into-jobs">take up more hours or find work</a>. It hammers working households – the children of care workers, checkout assistants, cleaners – and those out of work alike. <a href="https://largerfamilies.study/publications/needs-and-entitlements/">An exemption</a> exists in theory for cases of rape or coercion, but the process of informing the government is onerous and potentially traumatic: most of those eligible, therefore, do not do so. As <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2023/research/two-child-limit-and-benefit-cap-fail-to-meet-aims/">a new report</a> by academics at York University underlines, people’s circumstances change, whether due to job losses or relationship breakdown.

## ‘Music lets us be the real versions of ourselves’: Indonesian Muslim metalheads Voice of Baceprot

<p>With sturdy riffs and Rage Against the Machine-style funk bass, the young female trio have accrued millions of listeners – and are devoted to calling out violence against women</p><p>When the members of all-female Indonesian metal trio Voice of Baceprot finished middle school in their teens, they were at a crossroads. Their parents wanted them to fall in line: the pressure was on to enter an arranged marriage and live traditional lives. “It was really hard to just say no to our parents when they told us to get married,” the band’s singer/guitarist Marsya (full name Firda Marsya Kurnia) remembers today. “But we are happy because of music. It lets us be the real versions of ourselves. Heavy metal gave us the courage to say: ‘No! I will play metal until I can’t any more!’”</p><p>Almost a decade later, that’s become the greatest decision of their lives: Voice of Baceprot (pronounced “bah-che-prot”) are one of metal’s biggest buzz bands. Although their debut album Retas doesn’t drop until July, they’ve already accrued viral fame, performances on national TV and slots at major metal festivals since forming as schoolgirls in 2014. Singles like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPVo_QyS0Hw">God Allow Me (Please) to Play Music</a> indulge 90s alt-metal nostalgia with their sturdy riffing and obviously Rage Against the Machine-inspired funk bass; Marsya’s lyrics about feminism, sexual assault and climate change give the songs an acute social conscience. Their success has won their parents over, and RATM guitarist Tom Morello is an outspoken fan, as he once told the band on a Zoom call. “He was great!” Marsya beams. “He was very, very humble and we talked like we were friends.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/17/indonesian-muslim-women-metalheads-voice-of-baceprot">Continue reading...</a>

But while tinned sweetcorn is a store-cupboard staple, and delicious in these scones and salad, fresh corn on the cob is reaching its peak right now, so it’s worth getting your hands on some, if you can. Chargrilling fresh corn in a pan or, better still, on a barbecue is the ideal cooking method. Don’t be afraid to char it really well; the smoky flavour is heavenly when combined with the kernels’ natural sweetness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/17/charred-sweetcorn-salad-cheese-scones-recipes-jordan-bourke">Continue reading...</a>

<p>High prices make too many areas unaffordable. Does the past offer a solution?</p><p>We had an adder in the kitchen once. My mum caught it in a biscuit tin and let it go out by the beck. Outside our front door there was a vast boggy field filled with sheep, and in the autumn, deer rutting in the copse next to it. Windermere lay hidden in a dip some way off, the mountains behind it. When the wind blew we could hear the beat of the music on the tourist boats. It was idyllic, it looked perfect – but it wasn’t ours. The countryside rarely is.</p><p>I grew up in a tied house, which meant it came with my dad’s job as a forester. Rural industries have been providing accommodation alongside work for centuries. Pit owners built rows of cottages for their miners, foresters lived in cabins on the edge of the woods, slate quarriers lived in houses made with the slate they blasted and reservoir builders stayed deep in the moors for years in tin huts. Whole communities were created as the workers brought their families with them. Schools, hospitals, football teams, even orchestras sprang up. People living in these communities wouldn’t have felt isolated. But if you lost your job, if your husband had an accident, if the men went on strike, or if by some luck you managed to make it to retirement age, your house was snapped back up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/17/the-big-idea-how-can-we-solve-the-problem-of-rural-housing">Continue reading...</a>

But the comedy was an inconvenience to their evening. The gig started at 9pm, they’d been there for four hours. It was so bad that the comics just did the gig to each other.

<ul><li>Winger ready to sign one-year deal despite Forest offer</li><li>Callum Hudson-Odoi wants to leave Chelsea</li></ul><p>Willian has turned down an offer from Nottingham Forest and re-sign for Fulham, who are considering whether to make an improved bid for Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi. Fulham have been pushing to reach an agreement with Willian since his previous contract expired at the end of June but other teams have been trying to hijack the deal.</p><p>Forest were willing to give the Brazilian a two-year deal and there was also interest in the winger from clubs in Saudi Arabia. However, Fulham made a breakthrough in talks with Willian over the weekend and the deal is at an advanced stage. The 34-year-old, a key player for Marco Silva last season, is happy in London and is poised to end the speculation over his future by signing a one-year deal to stay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/17/fulham-willian-stay-callum-hudson-odoi-nottingham-forest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pom Klementieff’s assassin Paris is largely mute throughout the latest instalment of the franchise, flying in the face of more enlightened recent film roles</p><p>There are many things wrong with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One: its ridiculous storyline about AI, its bloated runtime, the plot holes as wide as Tom Cruise’s gleaming megawatt smile, but the most jarring of all? How Pom Klementieff’s supporting role as Paris, a savage assassin, is transformed into the tired stereotype of the silent Asian, who is largely mute throughout the film.</p><p>Paris is part of villain Gabriel’s (Esai Morales) crew. She’s on screen for many of the fights and action sequences including a thrilling car chase through the streets of Rome. All kamikaze glee and thigh-crushing aggression, she’s more than capable of giving Cruise’s Impossible Mission Force agent, Ethan Hunt, a run for his money. But the French actor, who is half Korean, barely utters a word throughout the whole thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/latest-mission-impossible-shows-the-silent-asian-stereotype-is-alive-and-well">Continue reading...</a>

## Punching up: why British comedy has never been kinder, more inclusive

<p> As British politics has got crueller, our comedy has gone in the opposite direction, becoming a haven of decency and diversity. In this extract from his new book, Different Times, David Stubbs asks if these gentler comics are the new cutting edge</p><p>There was once a pub called the Mucky Pup, my favourite in London. I drank there, did quizzes there, DJ-ed there, danced there, ate vegetarian roasts there. The Mucky Pup is no more; it changed hands. In January 2020, it went under the name the Bill Murray, a comedy club. I was there to see the comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/18/bethany-black-funniest-things" title="">Bethany Black</a> perform a set to a small but packed house. The melancholy I felt at being on the site of so many memories, now restructured and repurposed beyond recognition, was quickly extinguished by her act. An experienced standup, she was engaging, easily confident; her accent, fast and fluent style and timing triggering associations ranging from Victoria Wood to Ken Dodd and Les Dawson, her tendency to digress reminiscent of Ronnie Corbett. Her set was traditional in other respects: predicaments, tricky situations, the comedy of embarrassment, rude bits, very British fare.</p><p>As she casually disclosed, Black is trans, lesbian, autistic, as well as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. All these multiple streams flowed into the river of her comedy. “The walk from the car to the venue is the scariest part of my day, this bit’s dead easy,” she said. Her act included the story of a man who refused to wipe his arse because he thought it was “gay” to do so, a nervous dialogue with her own brain wondering if she was a racist, a routine about finding a pillow in a hotel covered in spunk, and another that culminated in the line, “It’s going to look like you’ve been eaten out by Hitler,” the context of which I leave to your imagination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/17/different-times-history-of-british-comedy-david-stubbs-extract">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An inventive savoury bake in which layers of softened courgette are squashed firmly between two types of cheese and tomatoes</p><p><strong><br /></strong>While the selection is best between midday and 2pm, I prefer going to the canteen-like <a href="https://www.feliceatestaccio.com/">Felice</a> just under our flat at about 3.30pm, because, after the rush of lunch, even the chairs seem to sit back and sigh with relief. And because there is less to choose from, which is great, because I am busy, hungry and don’t want to think; the counter tells me. Also, by mid-afternoon, the last of the vegetable dishes they do so well – the several-inches-deep aubergine parmigiana, the mashed potato cake, the flat green beans stewed in tomato, and little cubes of roast potato with rosemary – have been sitting a while, resting, soaking. And now that hot days are here again, the resting is even better for vegetable dishes long out of the oven but far from cold, and their flavours are the better for it.</p><p>Four o’clock, however, was too late, and I watched the last slice of parmigiana go home in an aluminium box with a man in a Guns N’ Roses cap with a guitar strapped to his back. Which, of course, made me resent him and his parmigiana more. So, after a rice ball and a potato croquette with a bit of cheese in the middle, I bought basil, tomatoes and mozzarella, which I pulled out of its plastic bag of cloudy liquid and put on a plate in the fridge, so it would drain overnight, ready for the next day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/17/parmigiana-recipe-courgette-mozzarella-parmesan-layered-bake-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

## The pet I’ll never forget: Lizzy comforted me through cancer. She died five years ago - and I struggled to say goodbye

<p>Our maine coon would wait for me in the front window, then sit by my side as I recovered from radiotherapy, my tears spilling out. I wasn’t ready to lose her<br /></p><p>There is a quote I keep coming back to: “Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never ever the same.” In my case, those prints come from paws – and they belong to one particular cat.<br /><br />We didn’t even want her. We had reserved her brother, a gorgeous silver maine coon named Ollie, who would join his older brother, Leo, who we had got a year earlier. But when we travelled the 150 miles to Doncaster to pick him up, the breeders offered us Lizzy as well – a sort of buy one, get one free. The runt of the litter, Lizzy had nearly died soon after she was born and was so small she had to be hand-fed every couple of hours. She and Ollie were inseparable and it seemed cruel to part them. She was a birdlike creature with a shock of cream fur, amber eyes, and a shy, sensitive nature.</p><p><br />All cats are special in their own way, and as she grew older it became clear that Lizzy’s particular gift was to know when you weren’t feeling great, and sit to share the moment with you. From headaches to hangovers, she would be there. In 2012, aged 45, I was reassured by my GP that the pain in my breast wasn’t a sign of cancer, but to go for a mammogram to be on the safe side. There wasn’t any cancer where the pain was, but, totally coincidentally, there was in my other breast.<br />I tried not to make a big deal out of it; the cancer could be treated and my kids were 13 and 15, so they had enough going on being teenagers. But it was Lizzy whose presence gave me comfort, a shadow following me around, a silent support when I felt the tears of uncertainty welling up. After surgery, I came home to find her at the front window, looking out for me. Later, exhausted and in pain from radiotherapy, I would lie down and she would instantly be there, just wanting to sit beside me and purr. Often my tears spilled on her.<br /><br />Cats can’t really know what you’re feeling or thinking, but it felt as if Lizzy did – and this helped me get through some dark days. Pets don’t judge, they don’t offer advice, their loyalty is never doubted. When I recovered, she was always there for me: running to greet me at the door after a day at the office, crawling on to the bed in the middle of the night trying to sleep with her paws on my pillow, standing guard by my keyboard as I worked from home, patiently hoping for head rubs.<br /><br />It was kidney disease that took her from us, very suddenly and very cruelly in 2018. I wasn’t ready for it. Who is? Her ashes are still in our garage, neatly boxed with her name on the front. Since then there have been times when we have thought about burying her, next to her brothers – a proper ceremony with her human family all present. But the truth is I haven’t been ready to say goodbye, even five years on. Now I realise it’s time. The ashes can be buried; Lizzy’s pawprints will be with me for ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/the-pet-ill-never-forget-lizzy-comforted-me-through-cancer-she-died-five-years-ago-and-i-struggled-to-say-goodbye">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m a chef and I forgot how to bake a cake’: why trauma often leads to brain fog and amnesia

<p>Shock, stress and grief can have a devastating effect on memory – but there are ways to bring it back</p><p>In early 2016, Juliet Owen-Nuttall decided to bake a cake. It was something she – a trained chef and former wedding cake decorator – had done hundreds of times before. Except, this time, her mind was blank. “I had forgotten how to do it,” Owen-Nuttall says. “I know it sounds really strange but after the trauma of the last few months, it was like suddenly I no longer had access to any of the knowledge I’d built up over the years.”</p><p>Owen-Nuttall, 48, wanted to bake to help her decompress after the most stressful period of her life. A dream adventure – relocating to Costa Rica to look after horses on some of the world’s most beautiful beaches – had turned out to be a vicious scam, costing Owen-Nuttall and her husband, Daniel, 41, their life savings and forcing them to live in a small tent on the beach “in squalor”. The pain and shock caused her brain to “shut down entirely”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/dissociative-amnesia-trauma-brain-fog-memory-loss">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While streaming services rake in hundreds of millions of dollars, many TV stars can’t even afford heating – or are somehow paid in negative figures. No wonder they’re on strike</p><p>The strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/television">Television</a> and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) inconveniences a lot of people. It effectively shuts down production on hundreds of films and TV shows, which means that thousands of crew members will be out of work. The lack of stars willing to promote their work mean that the festival circuit is functionally kaput. Worst of all, it means that new original scripted content will soon dry up, and I will be forced to write about all sorts of worthless true crime documentaries. This, I’m sure you will agree, is the real tragedy here.</p><p>Nevertheless, as inconvenient as it may be, the strike feels vital for the future of the acting industry.

<p>From an intimate take on Harry Potter to a moving monument to Marilyn, our writers celebrate culture that plays the fame game</p><p>The special effects are dodgy, the fans zealous, and Alan Rickman is in devastatingly droll form in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,214815,00.html">Galaxy Quest</a>, an adventure caper that both satirises sci-fi fandom while heeding the joy and heart of these communities at their best. Rickman, Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver play actors who used to be leads in a cult Star Trek-like television series, and now spend their days making appearances at fan conventions and lamenting the yesteryears of serious acting. (Rickman staring morosely into the mirror in alien-makeup: “I played Richard the Third.”) When they’re approached by a group of kooky beings who ask them for help, and lead them to a recreation of their famed starship, the actors don’t think much of it. It’s probably a group of hardcore fans. But up to the skies they boldly go, and they discover too late that their alien fans are all-too real. The days of make-believe are over. <em>Rebecca Liu</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/17/cultural-prescription-super-fandom">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I have mourned her for decades’: why first loves can shape our lives for ever

<p>In our early romantic relationships, there is often a mismatch between the strength of our feelings and the stark reality. So why do they linger in our memories?</p><p>Do you remember your first love? Mine had soulful eyes, a shy smile, and I thought he was beautiful. I spent months trying to put myself in Brad’s way. He was in the same tutorial class at secondary school as me, so I enjoyed at least one daily encounter, and others could be manufactured if I walked a certain way to the lunch hall or chose my PE options wisely. I would note our meetings in my diary, where I gave Brad (not his real name) the codename “Gregory”, which I considered uncrackable and lush, probably because my mother admired Gregory Peck. (I later learned, when she asked me if I knew a boy called Gregory, that my mother had found my diary, but that’s another story.) Brad was shy and he never went out with girls. I tormented myself with challenging metaphysical questions, such as, “How well do I know Brad?” and, “Do I <em>really</em> love him or is this an infatuation?” It stumped me how Brad did not see that he and I were perfect life partners. After two years of Brad remaining steadfastly unobtainable, I decided to go off him. My love ended as abruptly as it started.</p><p>The following week, Brad caught me up on the path to maths. “Will you go out with me?” he said. It seemed implausible to my 15-year-old self that the fates would work this way. Besides, being shy, I tended to underinterpret signals. <em>“</em>Do you mean it?” I asked. “No shit,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/why-first-loves-shape-our-lives-for-ever-relationships-memories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From dresses sewn using forbidden colours to the needlework of political prisoners, a new exhibition threads together rural life in Gaza and today’s modern art</p><p>With its faded fabric and darned-up holes, the first Palestinian dress on display at Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge might initially seem unremarkable. Unlike the opulent <a href="https://houseofthobes.co.uk/">thobes</a> elsewhere in the gallery, it’s a thoroughly worn garment created for everyday wear. But it’s also a fascinating window into the life of a rural woman from the Gaza region in the 1930s: the knee patches replace fabric worn away from field and domestic work, while the gaps by the chest panel show alterations made for breastfeeding. The embroidered patterns are likely samples from past dresses or hand-me-downs from relatives. As with all of the embroidered clothes and items currently on view, it’s an expression of class, gender and sociopolitical change.</p><p>“Embroidery is a practice that in itself feels so humble: the repetitive binding of thread to fabric,” says curator Rachel Dedman. “And yet, when you start to look at the garments, the people who make them, you start to understand the big picture events in history.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/17/rebellious-robes-and-stitches-from-the-civil-war-the-radical-story-of-palestinian-embroidery">Continue reading...</a>

A long, leisurely meal with friends and family or a more intimate affair for just two. Either is a fine way to celebrate a glorious summer afternoon.

This time, a platter of roast tomatoes with za’atar and dark red aleppo pepper, the fruits atop a soft mound of creamed chickpeas and a tahini-scented dressing.</p><p>There will be something to start, just a light, seasonal plate of melting white cheese, perhaps – mozzarella or burrata – cheered up with pickles (I used cherries this time) and tiny sweet-sour gherkins. The cherries can be kept in a jar to accompany cheese – they have a delightful affinity with a milky caerphilly – or maybe dot them through a salad with cucumber and lamb’s lettuce. Their juice is a useful addition to any salad dressing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/17/stir-fried-cabbage-prawns-and-lime-and-gooseberry-yoghurt-cake-nigel-slaters-high-summer-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Testimonies that reveal misogyny, racism and sexism should jolt every sporting body into listening to excluded voices</p><p>While the relative merits of Bazball continue to be debated, focus has swung away from arguably the most critical challenge that the sport faces: the findings from the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (Icec), published at the end of June.

Numerous Olympic and Paralympic sports have had such reviews and been heavily criticised over the past decade. Anne Whyte, a KC, spent two years reviewing the mistreatment of gymnasts, revealing appalling stories of abuse. You’d think by now that sports leaders would be experts, alert to the traps and mistakes of the past. The Icec report reminds us that’s not the case, uncomfortably pointing out that similar issues had already surfaced in the 1999 “Clean Bowl Racism” report yet never been addressed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/17/cricket-report-a-shocking-wake-up-call-this-is-how-all-sports-can-do-better">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On race days outside the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, boisterous children and adults sell racecards emblazoned with BOL, ‘best of luck’. This jocular anachronism sets the tone for the afternoon</p><p>After you pay your £2 entrance fee and heave yourself through a creaking turnstile, it feels like entering another time. Victorian, Edwardian or Nehru-era India: it’s hard to pin down, but it doesn’t feel like the present. Looking across the vast area of the course, you can see the marble Victoria memorial shimmering on the smoggy horizon. Lest we forget.</p><p>Kolkata, comfortable in the ruin and grandeur of its imperial buildings, seems immune to a new India. Its residents are more concerned with conversation and intellectual matters than following the country’s other metropolises into corporate modernity, or joining the disturbing march towards Hindu nationalism. The racetrack is a time warp befitting the city, with its own ghosts and remnants of the Raj but which thrives as a uniquely Indian phenomenon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/day-at-kolkata-races-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

I thought that the concept of London living rent would be the perfect thing for me, until I read that I cannot qualify for a one-bedroom apartment that is part of the scheme locally with a monthly rent of £987.74 (which I know I can afford) because my salary of £30,000 is less than the £36,000 minimum household income requirement. I find it tragic how I am deemed unsuitable even for London living rent, not even talking about ever getting a mortgage. What is a person like me supposed to do? My only option is to keep on paying even higher rent to a private landlord and thus crushing any hopes of ever making any savings: I cannot understand why poor people are excluded from qualifying for cheaper rents.<br /><strong>AS</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/17/i-dont-qualify-for-london-living-rent-so-pay-more-to-a-private-landlord-what-are-my-options">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In her 60s, Barbara Earth’s ears ‘closed for the last time’. She felt like she was floating; nothing was firm. But sign language and her deaf colleagues took her on an unexpected path</p><p>When she was four, Barbara Earth injured herself in the basement of the family home. Imprinted on her memory, along with the hurt, is the understanding that she had to scream really loudly “because my mother wouldn’t hear”. Her mother’s hearing loss took place over many years, and Earth grew up knowing that the same might happen to her. “I saw my mother’s experience,” she says. “So much loss and pain. And I decided: <em>I am not doing that</em>.”</p><p>In a sense, Earth, an academic, has prepared all her life for her own possible future deafness. She was 27 when a screening identified hearing loss, but the loss was gradual, so “it’s not easy to define when I stopped being able to hear,” she says. Her work and travels have taken her to 33 countries. In her 50s, she taught at a college in Thailand, but hearing students’ questions had become “impossible”. Life was “an increasing struggle”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/a-new-start-after-60-i-lost-my-hearing-found-a-community-and-began-an-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

## The Country of the Blind review – a penetrating study of the loss of sight

<p>Andrew Leland’s thoughtful, beautifully expressed memoir about losing his eyesight invites us to rethink ideas about identity and independence</p><p>Medics thrive on feeling useful: testing abnormalities, forming a differential diagnosis, providing treatment and tracking improvement. But for many conditions, the story is one of uncertainty, setback and management rather than cure. While clinicians busy themselves with visible and measurable signs of disease, the patient’s hopes, despair and wavering sense of self may go untended, leaving them with the feeling that they are descending into darkness alone.</p><p>This is particularly true when the patient is going blind. Andrew Leland’s memoir about this process articulates beautifully, with energy and honesty, how being held between seeing and blindness has changed him and his views on our ableist world. He is a journalist and podcaster who has written for the <em>New Yorker</em> and is now a contributing editor to American magazine the <em>Believer</em>, and his sensitivity to storytelling, history and literature is everywhere evident when reporting on his own eyesight. As<strong> </strong>a teenager he started to realise he couldn’t see properly at night, compounded by experimentation with cannabis and psychedelics. The tunnel vision worsened. A diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) was finally made. It is a hereditary condition that slowly kills the rod cells of the retina, which are responsible for seeing peripheral objects, particularly in low light. At some time in middle age the eyes will fail completely. Ophthalmologists, who have “a low sense of the lived experience of the visual impairments they diagnose”, review Leland’s “bad peepers” every couple of years. All the same, there’s no actual treatment, only the tantalising promise one day of gene therapy and CRISPR technology. The author now has 6% of his visual field left, which renders him legally blind but still able to read print.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/17/the-country-of-the-blind-review-andrew-leland-a-penetrating-study-of-the-loss-of-sight">Continue reading...</a>

He immediately understood why: “Everything felt so unpredictable, so out of control,” he says. “Just knowing that something was going to happen, tomorrow, that people said was gonna happen, was reassuring.”</p><p>The next year Rickett, who lives in Austin, Texas, decided to stop using social media: “I didn’t like the control it had over my life,” he says. “But I still had the energy, the need to look at my phone, for some reason. So I got even more into weather.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/weather-apps-addiction-climate-crisis-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Fierce battles’ in eastern Ukraine as fighting intensifies, Kyiv says; Russia seizes control of shares in Danone and Carlsberg subsidiaries</p><p><strong>Fighting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/ukraine-says-only-a-few-hundred-wagner-troops-are-in-belarus">in eastern Ukraine has “somewhat intensified”</a> as Ukrainian and Russian forces clash in at least three areas</strong>, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. Russian forces had been attacking in the direction of Kupiansk in Kharkiv for two successive days, she said: “We are on the defensive,” Maliar wrote. “There are fierce battles.” Maliar also said the two armies were pummelling one another around the ruined city of Bakhmut but that Ukrainian forces were “gradually moving forward” along its southern flank.</p><p><strong>Russian president Vladimir Putin said the Ukrainian counteroffensive had been a failure in an interview broadcast on television</strong>. “All enemy attempts to break through our defences … they have not succeeded since the offensive began. The enemy is not successful,” Putin said.</p><p><strong>The president also said Russia had a “sufficient stockpile” of cluster bombs and that Moscow reserved the right to use them</strong> if such munitions were used against Russian forces in Ukraine. He added that Russia had not yet used the weapons although Russia was accused of using cluster munitions in last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/i-had-blood-all-over-me-kramatorsk-station-attack-survivors-face-long-road-to-recovery">deadly Kramatorsk railway station attack</a>.</p><p><strong>The Russian state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/russia-seizes-control-of-shares-in-danone-and-carlsberg-subsidiaries">has taken control</a> of French yoghurt maker Danone’s Russian subsidiary along with beer company Carlsberg’s stake in a local brewer</strong>, according to a decree signed by Putin. Danone said it was investigating the situation while Carlsberg said it had not been officially informed of the move.</p><p><strong>The UN-brokered deal under which Moscow allowed Ukraine to ship its grain across the Black Sea is due to expire late Monday</strong>. The Kremlin has threatened to pull out of the agreement and said at the weekend it still had concerns that obligations to remove “obstacles to the export of Russian food and fertilisers still remain unfulfilled”.</p><p><strong>Two people were killed on Sunday when Russia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/russians-bombard-centre-of-kharkiv-hours-after-earlier-fatal-attack">launched a series of missile and shelling attacks</a> on the city and region of Kharkiv</strong>, beginning in the early hours of the morning and continuing into the evening. Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov said a young man was killed in the city’s Osnovianskyi district and another civilian man was killed in a village in the Kupiansk area.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian forces shelled the Russian town of Shebekino near the Ukrainian border with Grad missiles on Sunday, killing a woman riding her bike</strong>, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region said. Vyacheslav Gladkov said the missiles had struck a market area, damaging a building and two cars.</p><p><strong>Only a “few hundred” fighters from Russia’s Wagner group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/ukraine-says-only-a-few-hundred-wagner-troops-are-in-belarus">have so far relocated to Belarus</a></strong>, a Ukrainian official said, leaving the eventual fate of the fighting force unclear. “There are some groups of mercenaries on the territory of Belarus, but we are not talking about any massive or large-scale deployment … we are talking about a few hundred,” Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s border guards, told Ukrainian television.</p><p><strong>A Chinese naval flotilla set off on Sunday to join Russian naval and air forces in the Sea of Japan in an exercise aimed at “safeguarding the security of strategic waterways”</strong>, according to China’s defence ministry. Codenamed “Northern/Interaction-2023”, the drill marks enhanced military cooperation between China and Russia since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and is taking place as Beijing continues to rebuff US calls to resume military communication.</p><p><strong>Former UK prime minister Tony Blair said it would be “completely disastrous” if the US rowed back support for Ukraine in the event of Donald Trump being re-elected as US president</strong>. He also told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that said Ukraine had done an “extraordinary” job in defending itself but when asked what the endgame looked like he said the path would be “extremely difficult”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-509-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
