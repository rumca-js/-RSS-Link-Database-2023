If you've been waiting for a new single-player focused first-person shooter, Ascendant Studios' Immortals of Aveum may be worth it. Set in Aveum, with two superpowers battling over magic, it sees Jak joining the Order of the Immortals against the forces of Rasharn.

Jak utilizes three different colors of magic - Red, Blue and Green - and can also hover and blink around the battlefield. He'll venture through 12 unique biomes while unlocking new Talents and gathering loot to strengthen his abilities. Of course, you can also admire the stunning vistas while you're busy magicking enemies into dust.

With a meaty story that requires 20 to 25 hours to complete and plenty of secrets, Immortals of Aveum looks like it has potential. Releasing on August 22nd for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC, here's everything you should know before buying it.
