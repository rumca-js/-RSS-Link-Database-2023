<p>Microsoft never sleeps. In addition to its steady releases of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3199077/windows-10-a-guide-to-the-updates.html">major and minor updates to the current version of Windows 10</a>, the company frequently rolls out public preview builds to members of its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3220429/how-to-choose-the-right-windows-10-preview-and-update-channels.html">Windows Insider Program</a>, allowing them to test out — and even help shape — upcoming features.</p><p>Windows Insiders can choose to receive preview builds in one of three channels. The Dev Channel is where new features are introduced for initial testing, regardless of which Windows release they’ll eventually end up in. The Beta Channel lets you test more polished features that will be deployed in the next major Windows release. Insiders in the Dev and Beta Channels are now testing Windows 11 builds.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3118132/windows-10-insider-previews-a-guide-to-the-builds.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>If you’re a small business or home user of Microsoft, you likely feel at times like a second-class citizen. I still remember when noted tech consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-minasi-4a957b14" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mark Minasi</a> used to joke that Microsoft wrote software for the Fortune 499 — every major Fortune 500 company <em>except</em>Apple — which meant that for many years consumer and home users were just along for the ride with Microsoft’s big-enterprise goals.</p><p>This is true more than ever with Windows 11. From its security mandates to its enhanced hardware requirements, Windows 11 has been a hard sell. The hardware mandates appear arbitrary and seem intended to push sales of new computers. But they do serve a purpose: to put in place building blocks for additional security protections involving credentials. The problem is that many small businesses and home users can’t take advantage of these security features for various reasons. Or they don’t see value in using biometrics, Windows Hello, or other more robust authentication techniques when they just want to use their computer without needing even a password to log in.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702869/for-tech-users-change-is-good.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Over the past year, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) human resources group has been using artificial intelligence (AI) and a chatbot to improve its talent acquisition and retention. And a company executive says the technology has turned things around dramatically.</p><p>Prior to rolling the AI-based chatbot technology, half of those who’d land on HPE’s career page looking for jobs would leave without ever applying. After the rollout in the first three months of 2023, HPE more than doubled the industry standard for visitors to its <a href="https://careers.hpe.com/us/en/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">career site</a>, reaching 950,000. The company is now able to convert 26% of “casual job seekers” into actual hires. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702655/qa-hpe-global-talent-exec-credits-ai-chatbots-for-bolstering-hiring.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
