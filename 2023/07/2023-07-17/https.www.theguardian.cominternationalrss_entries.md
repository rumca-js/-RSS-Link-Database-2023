## When Crack Was King: looking back on an epidemic that destroyed lives

<p>An illuminating new book looks back at the communities affected not just by a drug but by a government less interested in saving Black lives and more focused on demonising them</p><p>There were times when <a href="http://www.donovanxramsey.com/">Donovan X Ramsey</a> thought writing this book was going to kill him. As he struggled through each chapter, “the story fought back”, inflicting brain fog, insomnia, stomach pains, heart palpitations. “On more than one occasion I visited the ER, certain that I was dying,” the 35-year-old writes.</p><p>But he got it done: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/books/review/when-crack-was-king-donovan-ramsey.html">When Crack Was King</a> is a panoramic social and political history of the crack cocaine epidemic that destroyed countless Black lives in the 1980s and 90s. Ramsey came to realise that his illness was not due to “book jitters” or a mysterious medical condition. After visiting the 10 cities hardest hit by crack and interviewing hundreds of former addicts, crime victims, community activists, ex-prisoners, journalists, police officers and politicians, he was manifesting classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/17/when-crack-was-king-donovan-x-ramsey">Continue reading...</a>

You shouldn’t</p><p>A couple of imaginative flashes and some quirky talking creatures save this live action kids’ epic from total boredom.

Their bed careens Goonies-style down tunnels, landing in an underground world inhabited by an army of pangolins (a nice choice for military mammals, with their armour-like scales).

<p>This gorgeous graphic novel about a woman escaping the pressures of Paris for her home town, and the complications that follow, is a masterpiece</p><p>Camille Jourdy’s marvellous new comic book begins with a train journey: a young woman, Juliette, is leaving Paris, and heading for the small town where she grew up. Exhausted by the city and the seething anxiety from which she has suffered ever since she was a girl, she longs for the awkward embrace of her somewhat complicated family: her divorcee father, now lonely enough to be on the dating apps; her mother, an amateur artist with bohemian leanings who has recently taken yet another younger lover; her older sister, Marylou, who though in possession of both a husband and two small children, is also having a one-day-a-week affair with a man who works in a fancy dress shop (he comes to her for joyful afternoon sex in her greenhouse, disguised as a bear, or a wolf, or a ghost).</p><p>From here, Jourdy spins out an exquisite soap opera of a graphic novel, a story she tells in both traditional strips – if you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/27/posy-simmonds-cassandra-darke-graphic-novel-interview">Posy Simmonds</a>, you’ll fall instantly in love with these – and in a series of extraordinarily beautiful, Matisse-inspired watercolours of the town where the action takes place (it’s never named, but Jourdy spent her childhood in Dole, near the Jura mountains: think red roofs, geranium-filled window boxes and old-fashioned, slightly louche bars). What follows is often plangent; by the time Juliette returns to Paris, more than one heart will have been broken. But Jourdy also has a gift for farce, and her book is at moments richly comical. The scene in which Marylou’s lover, wearing one of his ridiculous costumes, is discovered hiding under her son’s desk is masterly.</p><p><em>Juliette</em> by Camille Jourdy (translated by Aleshia Jensen) is published by Drawn and Quarterly (£23).

Here, she writes about the intrusion she suffered after the trial</p><p>Over the last decade, many people have told me they are aware of what really happened to me while I was competing on the X Factor in 2012 – some very directly. A journalist from Sheffield sat me down in front of a camera in my dressing room before my show for a “relaxed interview” and in the middle of nonchalant questions about what it’s like on the road, and what bands I’m into at the moment, said, “I heard you were raped and that is the reason you left the show.” A man in a London bar once shook my hand and blurted out the exact same sentence, waiting for my response as if he’d just asked me if I was having a good night. In those moments, the story was more important than the fact that I was a human being.</p><p>I don’t know how much the story of what had happened to me was worth in financial terms but it was sold, or leaked, to the papers – allegedly by someone within the Metropolitan police – within hours of it happening. Reddit, Digital Spy, Twitter and all of the gossip websites started to flood with rumours of what had taken place, of which hotel it had been in – details that should never have been public. In the UK, victims of sexual offences have a legal right to anonymity, for as long as they choose to do so. By deciding to speak about what happened to me now, I am waiving my right to anonymity, but back in 2012 countless privacy specialists and cyber experts were hired to remove any leaked information about me from the internet. As the speculation on discussion forum webpages went up, they were pulled down. Tweets containing my name and allegations of what happened to me disappeared. It was quite amazing, really; I had no idea that this kind of thing could be done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/17/lucy-spraggan-on-reality-tv-and-redemption-x-factor">Continue reading...</a>

He discusses fatherhood, loneliness and the joy of Greta Gerwig</p><p>Some sympathy, please, for Allan, created in 1964 as a best friend to Barbie’s boyfriend, Ken, but discontinued the following year because he was so underwhelming.
