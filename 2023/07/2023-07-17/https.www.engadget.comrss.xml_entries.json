[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best webcams for 2023", "description": "<p>That tiny webcam on your laptop has probably gotten more use in the last few years than it ever has before. Even if you\u2019re going back into the office for meetings on occasion, chances are frequent video conference calls are a permanent part of your professional life. Once an afterthought, your computer\u2019s webcam has become one of its most important components \u2014 and the fact remains that most built-in cameras are not able to provide consistent, high-quality video chat experiences.</p><p>This is where external webcams come in. They can do wonders for people who spend most of their working hours on video conferences, and those who picked up a new hobby of streaming on Twitch or YouTube over the past couple of years. But as with most PC accessories, it can be tough to sort through the sea of options out there and find the best webcams for your needs. We get it, so we tested out a bunch of the latest webcams to see which are worth your money and which you can safely skip.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>What to look for in a webcam</h2><h3>Resolution and field of view</h3><p>While some newer computers have 1080p webcams, most built-in cameras have a resolution of 720p, so you\u2019ll want to look for an external webcam that\u2019s better than that. FHD webcams will give you a noticeable bump in video quality; ideally, you\u2019re looking for something that can handle 1080p at 60fps or 30fps. If you\u2019re considering a cheap 720p webcam, make sure to get one that supports at least 30fps (most will) or, even better, 60fps. However, if your primary concern is better picture quality during video calls, 1080p is the way to go.</p><p>Some webcams can shoot in 4K, but that\u2019s overkill for most people. Not to mention most video conferencing services like Zoom, Google Meet and Skype don\u2019t even support 4K video. When it comes to streaming, Twitch maxes out at 1080p video, but YouTube added <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/4k-live-streaming-live-has-never-looked/\">4K live streaming</a> back in 2016. Ultimately, with 4K webcam shots having such limited use, most people can get by with a solid 1080p camera.</p><p>Field of view (FOV) controls how much can fit in the frame when you\u2019re recording. Most webcams I tested had a default field of view of around 78 degrees, which  captured me and enough of my background to prove that I really need to organize my home office. On cheaper webcams you\u2019ll usually see narrower fields of view (around 60 degrees), and those aren\u2019t necessarily bad. They won\u2019t show as much of your background, but that also means you won\u2019t be able to squeeze as many friends or family members into frame when you\u2019re having Zoom birthday parties. On the flip side, more expensive webcams may let you adjust the field of view to be even wider than average.</p><figure><img alt=\"Logitech C920 HD Pro webcam clipped onto a computer monitor with cork boards hanging on the wall behind it.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/02284fb0-a11a-11eb-aafb-70e6f3b5aa36\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><h3>Autofocus and other \u201cauto\u201d features</h3><p>Webcams with autofocus will keep the image quality sharp without much work on your part. You should be able to move around, step back and forth, and remain in focus the whole time. Some standalone webcam models let you manually adjust focus, too, if you have specific needs. Devices with fixed focus are less convenient, but they tend to be more affordable.</p><p>In the same vein is auto framing, a feature that some high-end webcams now offer. Similarly to Apple\u2019s Center Stage feature, the camera automatically adjusts to keep you in the center of the frame even as you move around. This used to be a feature only available on the most premium webcams, but now you can find it on sub-$200 devices.</p><p>You\u2019ll also see other \u201cauto\u201d features listed in webcam specs, most notably auto light correction. This will adjust the camera\u2019s settings to make up for a dimly lit room. If you don\u2019t have bright lights, or often take calls in places where you can\u2019t control the lighting, this feature will be valuable.</p><h3>Microphones</h3><p>Most webcams have built-in microphones that, depending on your setup, might end up being closer to you than your computer\u2019s own mics. Check to see if the model you\u2019re considering has mono or stereo mics, as the latter is better. Some even use noise-reduction technology to keep your voice loud and clear. While audiophiles and streamers will want to invest in a standalone microphone, most others can get by using a webcam\u2019s built-in mic.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>There aren\u2019t a ton of fascinating breakthroughs when it comes to external webcam design. Most are round or rectangular devices that clip onto a monitor or your laptop screen. Some have the ability to swivel or screw onto a tripod stand and others can simply sit on your desk beside your computer. But unless you really like having people stare up your nose, the latter isn\u2019t ideal. We recommend clipping your webcam to your monitor and ensuring that it\u2019s at or slightly above eye level.</p><p>A few webcams go above and beyond by adding hardware extras like built-in lights and lens covers, too. The former can help you stand out in a dark room, while the latter makes it so hackers can\u2019t view you through your webcam without your knowledge.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Most external webcams that are just good enough to be a step up from your computer\u2019s built-in camera cost between $60 and $150. If the webcam has the same resolution as the internal one on your laptop, you should look out for other specs like auto light correction, a wider field of view or an extra-long connecting cable that can provide a step-up in quality or ease of use.</p><p>Spending $150 or more means you might get advanced features like 4K resolution, vertical and horizontal recording options, stereo mics, customizable video settings and more. But unless you\u2019re spending hours on video calls each day or streaming multiple times each week, you can settle on a budget webcam and safely skip most of those high-end options.</p><h2>Best overall: Logitech Brio 500</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Mb2dpdGVjaC1Db3JyZWN0aW9uLUF1dG8tRnJhbWluZy1SZWR1Y3Rpb24tTWljcm9zb2Z0L2RwL0IwOVFXVllLNlY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMjYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRiOWYzNjY2LWVmM2MtNDlhYy1hZWMxLTgxMjc5NWY0YjY3OCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS3z3OsfiF6-NB48y7kQ0IrUu9x1A-VD2WQCqTMQPp9k&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-Correction-Auto-Framing-Reduction-Microsoft%2Fdp%2FB09QWVYK6V\">Logitech Bio 500</a> is essentially an upgraded version of the beloved C920s HD Pro. It shoots the same quality of video \u2014 up to 1080p 30fps \u2014 but it has a wider field of view, an upgraded zoom, improved auto-light correction, a better mic array and a USB-C connecting cable. The biggest difference I noticed in testing the Bio 500 was the improved light correction. My home office can feel very cave-like when the blinds are shut or when it\u2019s raining, but you wouldn\u2019t know it when on a video call with me. Logitech\u2019s RightLight 4 technology does a great job of brightening the whole shot when you\u2019re in a dim or dark environment.</p><p>The Bio 500 works with the LogiTune software, which lets you customize camera settings like field of view, autofocus, contrast, brightness and more, plus lets you enable Show Mode and RightSight features. The former lets you present things on your desk just by tilting the camera down while the latter will automatically keep you in frame during calls even if you move around. RightSight works much like Apple\u2019s Center Stage feature does on iOS devices, and most people will likely get more use out of this feature than Show Mode. If you prefer to keep things more consistent (or control how much of your background is visible), you can choose from 90-, 78- or 65-degree field of views instead of enabling RightSight.</p><p>Logitech also updated the design of the Bio 500. It\u2019s made of recycled plastic and it comes in three different colors that you can match to other Logitech peripherals. The camera attaches magnetically to its base and it easily swivels from side to side when you need to adjust its position, plus it has a built-in lens cover for extra privacy when you\u2019re not using it. Overall, it has the best mix of essential features and handy extras of any webcam we tested.</p><p>But $130 might be a lot for some people to spend on a webcam. We think it\u2019s worth it if you\u2019re primarily a hybrid or remote worker, but there is a cheaper option for those with tight budgets.

However, you won\u2019t get HDR support, an adjustable field of view, Show Mode or omnidirectional mics (although it does have a noise-reducing microphone of its own). It\u2019s a pared-down version of the Bio 500 and it\u2019ll only cost you $70.</p><h2>Runner Up: Anker PowerConf C200</h2><p></p><p>Anker\u2019s cube-like <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1Qb3dlckNvbmYtTWljcm9waG9uZXMtQWRqdXN0YWJsZS1Db3JyZWN0aW9uL2RwL0IwOU1GTVRNUEQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMjYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRiOWYzNjY2LWVmM2MtNDlhYy1hZWMxLTgxMjc5NWY0YjY3OCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAa9CPgcC_rFBfWBkNxNzk-u45pl_baKpN4E8Kw7ihXic&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-PowerConf-Microphones-Adjustable-Correction%2Fdp%2FB09MFMTMPD\">PowerConf C200 webcam</a> has has a lot of the same perks as our top pick, along with a few extras. Setup is equally as easy \u2013 just plug it into your computer or docking station and start using it. You can download the AnkerWork software to edit things like brightness, sharpness and contrast ratio, but I just kept all the defaults.</p><p>You\u2019re also able to control the camera\u2019s resolution and field of view with this software, too. The C200 webcam defaults to a 2K resolution, but you can bring it down to 1080p, 720p or even 360p if you wish. Same goes for field of view: The default is 95 degrees, but I bumped mine down to 78 degrees to spare my colleagues a wider view of my messy home office.</p><p>I was immediately impressed with the C200\u2019s video quality: 2K is likely more than most people need (1080p should do just fine), but the extra sharpness and clarity is a nice touch. The webcam\u2019s autofocus is quite fast, and its larger f/2.0 aperture captures more light so you stay illuminated even in darker settings.</p><p>In addition to a built-in lens cover that you can slide closed for privacy, the C200 has dual stereo mics that actually do a good job of capturing your voice loud and clear. You can also choose directional or omnidirectional vocal pickup in the AnkerWork settings, with the latter being better if you have multiple people speaking on your end.</p><p>My biggest complaints about the C200 webcam are that it\u2019s a bit cumbersome to adjust its angle when it\u2019s perched on your screen. Unlike most webcams, Anker\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a short neck of sorts that connects the camera to its adjustable base \u2013 it\u2019s just one, chunky piece of plastic that I had to use both hands to adjust. Also, the C200 comes with a USB cable that\u2019s much shorter than others. This won\u2019t be a problem if you\u2019re connecting the webcam directly to your laptop, but it\u2019s not as flexible if you have a standing desk converter or a more complicated setup that requires long cables.</p><h2>Best webcam for streaming: Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra</h2><p></p><p>Razer built the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d043077a-4ba1-4321-a933-30b8701d8d31&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMDQzMDc3YS00YmExLTQzMjEtYTkzMy0zMGI4NzAxZDhkMzEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL3N0cmVhbWluZy1jYW1lcmFzL3JhemVyLWtpeW8tcHJvLXVsdHJhIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkYjlmMzY2Ni1lZjNjLTQ5YWMtYWVjMS04MTI3OTVmNGI2NzgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARiFDEx05Eo6wbd-RBDykk5GqWtHuwyWUDoOmPp2fbpq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fstreaming-cameras%2Frazer-kiyo-pro-ultra\">Kiyo Pro Ultra</a> for streaming and that\u2019s immediately apparent as soon as you take the webcam out of the box. It\u2019s <em>huge.</em> Its circular frame measures three inches in diameter and about two inches thick. It follows the design language of other Kiyo webcams, but it\u2019s definitely the biggest of the bunch and that\u2019s probably because Razer stuffed a lot into this peripheral. It has the biggest sensor of any Kiyo webcam (1/1.2 inches to be exact), and the company claims it\u2019s the largest in any webcam, period. The Pro Ultra has a F/1.7 aperture lens as well, which lets in a ton of light and results in a super crisp image. It certainly delivered the best quality image of all the webcams I tested, which isn\u2019t a surprise since it can capture raw 4k/30fps (or 1080p/60fps) footage.</p><p>Streamers will not only appreciate the high quality image coming from this cam, but also its HDR support, tasteful background blurring and face-tracking autofocus that swiftly transitions from zeroing-in on their face to whatever object they may be showing off to their viewers. It works with Razer\u2019s Synapse software, too, so you can customize your image to your liking, tweaking things like zoom, pan, tilt, ISO and shutter speed. Just know that Synapse only works on Windows devices, so you\u2019ll be stuck with default settings if you\u2019re on macOS or Linux.</p><p>The Kiyo Pro Ultra is compatible with Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) and XSplit, so most streamers will be able to unbox it and get right to producing content. We also appreciate that you can twist the camera\u2019s frame to physically shutter the lens, giving you more privacy when you need it. Undoubtedly, the Kiyo Pro Ultra is one of the most powerful webcams we tried out and it may even be overkill for streamers just starting out (our final pick might be better for those folks), but serious and professional content creators will love the quality video and customization options they get. If you want a similar level of quality and the ability to tweak settings on a Mac, <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/en/facecam-pro\">Elgato\u2019s Facecam Pro</a> is a good alternative. It costs the same as the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra, can record video at 4K/60fps and its Camera Hub software works on macOS and Windows.</p><h2>Runner up: Logitech Streamcam</h2><p></p><p>Of all the webcams I tested, I had the most fun using <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Mb2dpdGVjaC1TdHJlYW1jYW0tU3RyZWFtaW5nLVlvdVR1YmUtR3JhcGhpdGUvZHAvQjA3VFpUNFE4OT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0yNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGI5ZjM2NjYtZWYzYy00OWFjLWFlYzEtODEyNzk1ZjRiNjc4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX6C8UQXCg9P_VdKl0kHCFhUur7_VO5cNz4a40EclC5e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-Streamcam-Streaming-YouTube-Graphite%2Fdp%2FB07TZT4Q89\">Logitech\u2019s Streamcam</a>. While it\u2019s a bit weird to say I \u201chad fun\u201d with such an innocuous piece of tech, I found the Streamcam to be remarkable in many ways. First and foremost, the video quality is excellent, coming in at a sharp 1080p/60fps. Details in my clothing came through much better and, whether I liked it or not, so did some of the texture on my skin. The Streamcam was also one of the best webcams I tested when it came to color reproduction.</p><p>All of those perks remain the same even when you\u2019re shooting in low-light conditions. The Streamcam\u2019s auto-exposure feature made up for the darkness in my office on gloomy days. And it has the best kind of autofocus \u2014 the kind that you never notice in action.</p><p>The dual omnidirectional mics inside the Logitech Streamcam delivered my voice loud and clear during video calls. If you stream often and find yourself without an external mic, it\u2019s nice to know that you could get by with the Streamcam\u2019s built-in ones in a pinch. The microphones also have noise reduction to keep your voice font and center.</p><p>As far as design goes, the Streamcam is a bit larger than your standard cam. It\u2019s a chunky almost-square that can easily be positioned on a monitor or on a tripod, and a unique feature of its design is its ability to shoot either vertically or horizontally. I kept mine in the standard 16:9 format, but some content creators and streamers who post to social media often will like the 9:16 format that\u2019s best for Instagram and TikTok. Logitech also made sure the Streamcam was optimized for OBS, XSplit and Streamlabs, so you can use it directly out of the box for your next live session.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-webcams-123047068.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-webcams-123047068.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-17T20:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "An email typo has reportedly sent millions of US military messages to Mali", "description": "<p>A typo has reportedly routed millions of US military emails \u2014 some containing highly sensitive information \u2014 to Mali.

In a letter to the US in early July, Zuurbier wrote, \u201cThis risk is real and could be exploited by adversaries of the US.\u201d He says he has collected around 117,00 emails, and nearly 1,000 more arrived last Wednesday alone.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although Zuurbier says none of the messages were marked as classified, they still contain sensitive data about US military personnel, contractors and families.

The CMA, Microsoft and Activision all asked the CAT for more time and the tribunal has granted the request.</p><p>CMA lawyer David Bailey told the CAT that the FTC's court loss &quot;formed no part of the CMA's thinking&quot; in terms of its willingness to review a new proposal from Microsoft. &quot;Based upon the discussion to date, both sides \u2014 Microsoft and the CMA \u2014 have confidence that Microsoft notifying a restructured transaction is capable of addressing the concerns that the CMA has identified,&quot; he said.</p><p>It emerged during Monday's hearing that Microsoft has yet to submit an amended proposal to the CMA, even though the deadline for the merger is tomorrow, July 18th. It seems unlikely that everything will be resolved by then. If not, Microsoft and Activision will either have to agree to an extension of their current agreement (the most likely outcome given how eager they are to get the deal over the line) or renegotiate terms. Otherwise, Activision can walk away from the deal with a fat $3 billion breakup check from Microsoft in its pocket.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/microsoft-activision-weigh-sale-of-some-uk-cloud-gaming-rights?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><ins>Reports have suggested</ins></a> Microsoft may sell some cloud gaming rights in the UK to satisfy the CMA's concerns. Microsoft has signed deals with third-party cloud gaming companies to offer its games on their platforms, which was enough for the European Union to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-approves-microsofts-687-billion-activision-blizzard-takeover-160319415.html\"><ins>approve the merger</ins></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FTC is still slated to hold its own evidentiary hearing over the acquisition starting on August 2nd. The agency <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html\"><ins>sued to block the merger</ins></a> and it sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft and Activision Blizzard from closing the deal until it could bring the case to trial, but it was unsuccessful.</p><p>As such, Microsoft and Activision will surely be eager to seal things up by the beginning of August.

The market wasn't as saturated as it is today, and features were more limited. Today, the wearable world is filled with various high-quality options, and a few key players, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Fitbit Versa, have muscled their way to the front of the pack with their smart features. Chances are, if you\u2019re reading this guide, you\u2019ve probably already decided that it\u2019s time to upgrade whatever gadget\u2019s on your wrist - be it a standard timepiece or an aging smartwatch. Regardless of which category you fall into, the list of specs you\u2019ll want to consider before deciding which is the best smartwatch for you to buy is a long one, and we'll help you make sense of it.</p><h2>What to look for in a smartwatch</h2><figure><img alt=\"Google WearOS interface on a smartwatch.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/59a8ed60-7819-11ea-a2fe-460c6da1595e\" /><figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cherlynn Low</div></figcaption></figure><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you\u2019ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you\u2019ll have access to. Many of these aren\u2019t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often  include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, which budget devices generally don\u2019t.</p><p>Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we\u2019d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag-heuer-connected-calibre-e4-golf-edition-093031897.html\">TAG Heuer</a> and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn\u2019t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you\u2019re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials.</p><h3>Battery life</h3><p>Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there\u2019s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Snapdragon\u2019s next-gen Wear 4100 and 4100+ processors were announced in 2020, but only a handful of devices \u2013 some of which <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/razer-x-fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-gamers-160007878.html\">aren\u2019t even available yet</a> \u2013 are using them so far. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge.</p><p>A few smartwatches now support faster charging, too. For example, Apple promises the Series 7 can go from zero to 80 percent power in only 45 minutes, and get to full charge in 75 minutes. The OnePlus Watch is even speedier, powering up from zero to 43 percent in just 10 minutes. (Mind you that turned out to be one of the only good things about that device.)</p><h3>Communication</h3><p>Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They\u2019re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fitness tracking</h3><p>Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today\u2019s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well.</p><p>Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019.html\">more fitness focused</a> than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more.</p><p>Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of in-depth health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics  is important to you, you\u2019ll have to pay for the privilege.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch Active\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/2c3e5710-b8b0-11eb-ae7c-3c5baecf0395\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h3>Music</h3><p>Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you\u2019re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don\u2019t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn\u2019t required \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds.</p><h3>Always-on displays</h3><p>Most flagship smartwatches today have some an always-on display - some have it on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you\u2019ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device\u2019s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display\u2019s brightness so it\u2019s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won\u2019t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you\u2019ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again.</p><h3>NFC</h3><p>Many smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth.</p><p>Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjA0OTE2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT0rwaJ5r70d13bEq45AmZjeHIkXLUYaxQAHdothfWjt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT204916\">multiple banks and credit cards</a> in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It\u2019s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google\u2019s systems.</p><h2>Best overall: Apple Watch</h2><p></p><p>The Apple Watch has evolved into one of the best wearables on the market since its debut in 2015. It\u2019s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, and we wouldn\u2019t judge you for switching to an iPhone just to be able to use an Apple Watch. The latest model, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQkRITTQ5QkovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYX-bazWvFbQmYatuPBRrOQtXMae8GH2LTu7ifSAN24j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BDHM49BJ%2F\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, has solid fitness-tracking features that will satisfy the needs of beginners and serious athletes alike. It also detects if you\u2019ve been in a car crash, can carry out electrocardiogram (ECG) tests and measures blood oxygen levels. Plus, this Apple smartwatch offers NFC, onboard music storage and many useful apps, customizable features and ways to respond to messages.</p><p>There aren't a ton of differences between the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html\">Series 8</a> and the Series 7 that came before it. The Watch design is largely unchanged, and while the Series 8 runs on a newer S8 SiP, it didn't feel dramatically faster in our testing. It lasted a little bit longer, and we were impressed by the new low-power mode, which kept the watch going for an additional two hours after already being down to 20 percent battery life.</p><p>The Series 8 is the best Apple Watch for most people, but there are two other options now at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The new<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQkRKSzRHOUMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQBT5-cTP044Dyy6WeZt7bC3sRshEueEfwVKg4q1KI4e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BDJK4G9C%2F&amp;uuid=tBCD9FeYri1sDemh11140\"> Apple Watch Ultra</a> is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need.</p><p>The $250 <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQkRIVFFEUlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjdmNDM0ZTE2LWFhYmUtMzE0ZC04OGYwLWZhYzdkM2YyNmQ1MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQqfc4IgKPjlNvVsKO4isqGtt2yMpzPuyiayTUCb5oms&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BDHTQDRZ\">Apple Watch SE</a>, on the other hand, is less feature-rich than the Series 8, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. You\u2019ll get all the core Apple Watch features as well as things like fall and crash detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS, but you\u2019ll have to do without more advanced hardware perks like an always-on display, a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG monitor and a skin temperature sensor.</p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQkRKSzRHOUMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY0fiAzPqt8kgiaqHt808JPV45V3tqQgxd5IRhk-YrCd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BDJK4G9C%2F\" id=\"9694c5ea63ae49b8abf57588cc4a1111\">Buy Apple Watch Ultra at Amazon - $799</a><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQkRIVFFEUlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnotMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjdmNDM0ZTE2LWFhYmUtMzE0ZC04OGYwLWZhYzdkM2YyNmQ1MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWWFB8RHOFEIINRrnOxmEndozDmh7QVo1Qwk0PpR7f8K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BDHTQDRZ\" id=\"385dab946a8c44cbab484b9bbd0dc9d2\">Buy Apple Watch SE at Amazon - $249</a><h2>Best budget smartwatch: Fitbit Versa 2</h2><p></p><p>Dropping $400 on a smartwatch isn\u2019t feasible for everyone, which is why we recommend the<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXRiaXQtRml0bmVzcy1TbWFydHdhdGNoLVRyYWNraW5nLUluY2x1ZGVkL2RwL0IwN1RXRlZEV1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjdmNDM0ZTE2LWFhYmUtMzE0ZC04OGYwLWZhYzdkM2YyNmQ1MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdjIwL4nz10RAZhyq20mYj-zj8OgDvtY0-Nv5KxaasDe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-Fitness-Smartwatch-Tracking-Included%2Fdp%2FB07TWFVDWT&amp;uuid=oDcdK5T2cT3u2dud18142\"> Fitbit Versa 2</a> as the best sub-$200 option. It\u2019s our favorite budget watch because it offers a bunch of features at a great price. You get all of these essentials: Fitbit\u2019s solid exercise-tracking abilities (including auto-workout detection), sleep tracking, water resistance, connected GPS, blood oxygen (SpO2) tracking and a six-day battery life. It also supports Fitbit Pay using NFC and it has built-in Amazon Alexa as a voice assistant.. While the Versa 2 typically costs $150, we\u2019ve seen it for as low as $100.</p><h2>Best Android smartwatch: Samsung Galaxy Watch 5</h2><p></p><p>Samsung may not have brought many upgrades to the latest version of its popular Galaxy Watch, but that doesn't mean the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjJKNVRCM1EvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWOZQlepr_6LxjFR8weEI-UI2TCVydfSxav_0PEQZVMY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B2J5TB3Q%2F\">Watch 5</a> isn't still the best smartwatch for Android users. Improvements like a more durable touchscreen and refined curvature don't sound exciting, but they make the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review-battery-life-specs-durability-180052187.html\">Watch 5</a> more resilient and reliable. Plus, the Galaxy Watch offers the most comprehensive fitness and health tracking, including body composition analysis, on Wear OS, and the company added a sleep coaching feature this year that is meant to help guide you towards better rest.</p><p>If you don't mind oversized watches, consider the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjJIWEpaOTgvcmVmPWFzX2xpX3NzX3RsP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe7cpS_IzwFlqpB2UJZ_D1tL6iZrdomTC5QMF3040r9a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B2HXJZ98%2Fref%3Das_li_ss_tl\">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>. It's more expensive at $450, but comes with a larger 45mm titanium case, an extra durable touchscreen and a larger battery. Though Samsung markets this Android smartwatch as an outdoor-oriented device, you're better off thinking of it as a big timepiece that lasts longer than the standard model. It has all the same smartwatch features as the 40mm and 44mm versions, except it supports the GPX route format for workouts so you can get turn-by-turn directions while you hike and bike.</p><p>All three watches are also water-resistant so they can track swims or survive a sudden storm, and last more than a day (without the Always On Display enabled). They also run Wear OS 3.5, which is so similar to Samsung's previous Tizen OS that longtime wearers won't need to worry about adjusting to a new system.

Threads launched at a moment when many Twitter users were seeking alternatives, and its ties to Instagram made it extraordinarily easy for users to sign up and port over their existing social graph. At the same time, the app is missing a lot of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/all-the-questions-we-still-have-about-threads-153059430.html\"><ins>basic features</ins></a>, including a non-algorithmic feed not easily dominated by brands and influencers.</p><p>In a Threads post on Friday, Instagram\u2019s top exec, Adam Mosseri, suggested the company wasn\u2019t particularly focused on engagement metrics at this stage. \u201cOur focus right now is not engagement, which has been amazing, but getting past the initial peak and trough we see with every new product, and building new features, dialing in performance, and improving ranking,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CusMDHkrG3w\"><ins>wrote</ins></a>.</p><p>Whether or not Meta is able to fully take advantage of those conditions though will likely depend on how quickly it can add new features to keep its users coming back, as well as whether it\u2019s able to launch within the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-blocks-eu-users-from-accessing-threads-through-a-vpn-135306350.html\"><ins>European Union</ins></a>. The company is also dealing with issues around spam, according to Mosseri, who said Threads would be putting rate limits and other protections. \u201cSpam attacks have picked up so we're going to have to get tighter on things like rate limits, which is going to mean more unintentionally limiting active people (false positives),\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/Cuzo-AxtZ1o\"><ins>wrote</ins></a>.</p><p>While the declining engagement with Threads may seem like good news for Twitter, the company still has plenty of reasons <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html\"><ins>to worry</ins></a> about its latest competitor.

That\u2019s on top of big improvements in things like color accuracy, image quality, size and resolution.</p><p>That means you have a lot of choices when picking the best monitor for you, but that can be overwhelming since you\u2019ll have to sift through a lot of products, all with different feature sets. Buyers looking for computer monitors now have to consider things like HDR, brightness, color accuracy, type of display technology, input lag and more. And then there are the usual considerations like size, adjustability, inputs and so on.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To help you with all that, we\u2019ve researched the latest models for all kinds of markets, whether you\u2019re a business user, a content creator, a multitasker or into competitive gaming. Read our buying guide below to find out which is the best computer monitor for you and, especially, your budget.</p><h2>The basics</h2><h3>Panel type</h3><p>The cheapest monitors are still TN (twisted nematic), which are strictly for gaming or office use. VA (vertical alignment) monitors are also relatively cheap, while offering good brightness and a high contrast ratio. However, content creators will find that IPS (in-plane switching) LCD displays deliver better color accuracy, picture quality and viewing angles.</p><p>If maximum brightness is important, a quantum dot LCD display is the way to go \u2014 those are typically found in larger displays. OLED monitors are now available and offer the best blacks and color reproduction, but they lack the brightness of LED or quantum dot displays. Plus, they cost a lot. The latest type of OLED monitor, called QD-OLED from Samsung, just came out in 2022. The most notable advantage is that it can get a lot brighter, with monitors shown at CES 2022 hitting up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>MiniLEDs are now widely used in high-end displays. They\u2019re similar to quantum dot tech, but as the name suggests, it uses smaller LED diodes that are just 0.2mm in diameter. As such, manufacturers can pack in up to three times more LEDs with more local dimming zones, delivering deeper blacks and better contrast.</p><h3>Screen size, resolution and display format</h3><p>In this day and age, screen size rules. Where 24-inch displays used to be more or less standard (and can still be useful for basic computing), 27-, 32-, 34- and even 42-inch displays have become popular for entertainment, content creation and even gaming these days.</p><p>Nearly every monitor used to be 16:9, but it\u2019s now possible to find 16:10 and other more exotic display shapes. On the gaming and entertainment side, we\u2019re also seeing curved and ultrawide monitors with aspect ratios like 21:9. If you do decide to buy an ultrawide display, however, keep in mind that a 30-inch 21:9 model is the same height as a 24-inch monitor, so you might end up with a smaller display than you expected. As a rule of thumb, add 25 percent to the size of a 21:9 monitor to get the vertical height you\u2019d expect from a model with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>A 4K monitor is nearly a must for content creators, and some folks are even going for 5K or all the way up to 8K. Keep in mind, though, that you\u2019ll need a pretty powerful computer to drive all those pixels. And 4K resolution should be paired with a screen size of 27 inches and up, or you won\u2019t notice much difference between 1440p. At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t get a model larger than 27 inches unless it\u2019s 4K, as you\u2019ll start to see pixelation if you\u2019re working up close to the display.</p><p>One new category to consider is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-27-asus-240hz-portable-monitor-for-gamers-hands-on.html\">portable monitors</a> designed to be carried and used with laptops. Those typically come in 1080p resolutions and sizes from 13-15 inches. They usually have a lightweight kickstand-type support that folds up to keep things compact.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Smart Monitor M5\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/e19ecb10-fd3f-11ec-a77d-fca8b8a4ea1f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Samsung</div></figure><h3>HDR</h3><p>HDR is the buzzy monitor feature to have these days, as it adds vibrancy to entertainment and gaming \u2013 but be careful before jumping in. Some monitors that claim HDR on the marketing materials don\u2019t even conform to a base standard. To be sure that a display at least meets minimum HDR specs, you\u2019ll want to choose one with a DisplayHDR rating with each tier representing maximum brightness in nits.</p><p>However, the lowest DisplayHDR 400 and 500 tiers may disappoint you with a lack of brightness, washed out blacks and mediocre color reproduction. If you can afford it, the best monitor to choose is a model with DisplayHDR 600, 1000 or True Black 400, True Black 500 and True Black 600. The True Black settings are designed primarily for OLED models, with maximum black levels at .0005 nits.</p><p>Where televisions typically offer HDR10 and Dolby Vision or HDR10+, most PC monitors only support the HDR10 standard, other than a few (very expensive) models. That doesn\u2019t matter much for content creation or gaming, but HDR streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services won\u2019t look quite as punchy. In addition, most models supporting HDR600 (and up) are gaming monitors, rather than content creation monitors \u2013 with a few exceptions.&nbsp;</p><h3>Refresh rate</h3><p>Refresh rate is a key feature, particularly on gaming monitors. A bare minimum nowadays is 60Hz, and 80Hz and higher refresh rates are much easier on the eyes. However, most 4K displays top out at 60Hz with some rare exceptions and the HDMI 2.0 spec only supports 4K at 60Hz, so you\u2019d need at least DisplayPort 1.4 (4K at 120Hz) or HDMI 2.1. The latter is now available on a number of monitors, particularly gaming displays. However, it\u2019s only supported on the latest NVIDIA RTX 3000- and 4000-series, AMD RX 6000-series GPUs.</p><h3>Inputs</h3><p>There are essentially three types of modern display inputs: Thunderbolt, DisplayPort and HDMI. Most monitors built for PCs come with the latter two, while a select few (typically built for Macs) will use Thunderbolt. To add to the confusion, USB-C ports may be Thunderbolt 3 and by extension, DisplayPort compatible, so you may need a USB-C to Thunderbolt or DisplayPort cable adapter depending on your display.</p><h3>Color bit depth</h3><p>Serious content creators should consider a more costly 10-bit monitor that can display billions of colors. If budget is an issue, you can go for an 8-bit panel that can fake billions of colors via dithering (often spec\u2019d as \u201c8-bit + FRC\u201d). For entertainment or business purposes, a regular 8-bit monitor that can display millions of colors will be fine.</p><h3>Color gamut</h3><p>The other aspect of color is the gamut. That expresses the range of colors that can be reproduced and not just the number of colors. Most good monitors these days can cover the sRGB and Rec.709 gamuts (designed for photos and video respectively). For more demanding work, though, you\u2019ll want one that can reproduce more demanding modern gamuts like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and Rec.2020 gamuts, which encompass a wider range of colors. The latter two are often used for film projection and HDR, respectively.</p><h3>Console gaming</h3><p>Both the Xbox Series X and Sony\u2019s PS5 can handle 4K 120Hz HDR gaming, so if you\u2019re into resolution over pure speed, you\u2019ll want a monitor that can keep up. 4K resolution, HDR and at least 120Hz is the minimum starting point, but fortunately there are 27-inch displays with those specs starting at well under $1,000.</p><h3>Pricing and parts shortages</h3><p>Though the pandemic has eased, monitor supply is still a bit tighter than pre-pandemic levels due to supply and demand issues. To that end, you may have trouble finding monitors at Amazon, B&amp;H or elsewhere for the suggested retail price. For our guide below, we\u2019re basing our picks on the MSRP, as long as the street price doesn\u2019t exceed that by more than $25.</p><h2>Best monitors under $200</h2><h3>Samsung T35F</h3><p></p><p>The best budget monitor with a balance of size, refresh rate and color accuracy is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEZGM0pRMjg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZ2ktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAwN2Y5NmU3LTBlYzktM2E3OS1hNmFlLWQ1MjcxNjQzY2RiZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVcVzY4R9Rbo06z-D5LiuAwJXPA7apE1vO6D-sfqg9lc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08FF3JQ28\">Samsung\u2019s 27-inch 1080p T35F</a>. It\u2019s good for business or light gaming and content work, thanks to the IPS panel and 75Hz refresh rate. Plus, it\u2019s fairly attractive and modern looking. There are some things you don\u2019t get at that price, of course \u2013 it can only tilt and has an HDMI 1.4 connection.</p><h3>LG 24GL600F</h3><p></p><p>If you\u2019re fine with a smaller display and are more into gaming, another solid option is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN05IU0oxUkYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWdpLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMDdmOTZlNy0wZWM5LTNhNzktYTZhZS1kNTI3MTY0M2NkYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcumfQY74RiUebbsns5tjnEOsaBFnzc8_xAya0A0mlBr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07NHSJ1RF%2F\">LG\u2019s 24-inch 24GL600F</a>. It offers a high refresh rate of 144Hz with AMD FreeSync support, a 1ms response time and low input lag. You also get HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, but like the T35F, there\u2019s no height adjustment.</p><h2>Best monitors under $400</h2><h3>HP U28 4K HDR Monitor</h3><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEhWVjJUM0svP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWdpLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMDdmOTZlNy0wZWM5LTNhNzktYTZhZS1kNTI3MTY0M2NkYmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdN6Tai2dYq8lHcJXWASx_RQlSn1Yxf5jrkpAYimWLdp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08HVV2T3K%2F\">28-inch HP U28 4K HDR monitor</a> is a great all around choice, especially for content creators. The 60Hz IPS panel and factory calibration delivers excellent color accuracy and it\u2019s a nice size for creative or business work. It comes with DisplayPort, HDMI and three USB 3.0 ports, along with a USB-C port with 65W of charging for a laptop or tablet.

There are 12 pads that each respond to control methods like tapping, tilting, strumming, vibrato and more, via capacitive sensing technology and Midi Polyphonic Expression (MPE).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"5472deecba324c4e954f5030e28c6da6\"></div><p>There\u2019s also a new bridge section that allows non-musicians to automatically play chords, thus letting folks play along with their favorite songs. This bridge integrates with the built-in arpeggiator for changing the tempo and the key. The integrated looper lets you layer tracks as you see fit. Though there\u2019s not much by way of sound design on the device itself, you can access an affiliated app to access the inner workings of the sound engine.</p><p>As for connectivity, the Chorda can control any MIDI-based software and hardware instruments via USB-C or Bluetooth. The device also automatically integrates with most DAWs, including GarageBand, Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools, Cubase and FL Studio. It also supports any standard MIDI and MPE-compatible mobile app or hardware. The battery life isn't winning any awards, however, at four hours of use per charge.&nbsp;</p><p>The Artiphon Chorda is available for preorder via Kickstarter and is available in three colors: black, white and blue. The early bird pricing is locked in at around $200, but as the tiers sell out, the cost goes up.

Anime service Crunchyroll has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PBIrzmn0k\">announced</a><em>One Punch Man: World</em>, an online multiplayer action title headed to Android, iOS and PC.

Having said this, the creators face the same problem Bandai Namco did: how do you balance a game where the main hero, Saitama, can defeat anyone with a single hit? The answer seems to involve holding him back (a video on the official site shows Saitama using many punches to fell an enemy), but you'll likely have to wait for the finished product to know how powerful he really is.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-is-making-a-one-punch-man-online-game-for-pc-and-mobile-171733850.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-is-making-a-one-punch-man-online-game-for-pc-and-mobile-171733850.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-17T17:17:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Corsair expands its mechanical keyboards by acquiring Drop", "description": "<p>Corsair is hoping to stand out in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-60-percent-keyboards-160038272.html\">enthusiast keyboard space</a> by buying one of its more recognizable brands. The company is <a href=\"https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/empowering-enthusiasts-drop-joins-the-corsair-family\">acquiring</a> Drop (formerly Massdrop), best known for its customizable mechanical keyboards and key switches. The move will let Corsair \"significantly grow\" Drop's community-centric keyboard line while creating new products for its in-house brands, including Elgato.</p><p>Drop will stay a separate brand inside of Corsair, and it will handle all existing purchases and support.

Gamers and other hobbyists have increasingly delved into custom keyboards with personalized key caps, lighting and switches. You can get a unique keyboard that matches the look of your computer setup while delivering the typing feel you prefer. The Drop purchase gives Corsair a quick way to expand its presence in that market, sparing it the trouble of building up its own resources \u2014 or facing Drop as a competitor.</p><p>There's fierce rivalry in the category. In addition to Drop, established companies like Keychron, KBDFans and Mode have customizable options. That's not including stock keyboards that offer similar functionality, just without the flexibility. Corsair isn't certain to dominate, but this may help it thrive in a field where tech heavyweights like ASUS and NZXT are increasingly involved.</p><p>This could also help Corsair bring personalization to segments where it's still rare. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-game-streaming-gear-160012102.html\">Game streamers</a> and other creators thrive on elaborate setups, but their broadcasting equipment (such as control decks and microphones) rarely offer much in the way of customization.

That is, as long as you pick one from a reliable company and with the right specs. To help you as you shop, we put together this collection of things to look out for as well as a list of the best laptops for college.</p><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Apple has completed its transition to its own Silicon, so you\u2019ll no longer have the option of Intel-powered Macs. Nor should you want to, really, since the M2 and M1 MacBooks have proven to be reliable, speedy and long-lasting. With a new generation of chips likely on the horizon, older models with M1 processors should get cheaper while still offering excellent performance. This means you\u2019ll have more options to consider without having to stretch your budget.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, new PCs keep getting announced, with the latest models typically powered by 13th-gen Intel processors or the latest AMD Ryzen chips.Though the shift to ARM-based systems has been successful for Apple, the PC industry is still struggling to keep up, and Windows on ARM is basically dead in the water. Don\u2019t waste your time or money on an ARM-based PC; they\u2019re hard to find nowadays anyway.</p><p>Speaking of, laptops with top-of-the-line specs can cost you around $1,800 to $2,000 these days. For most college students, though, a midrange machine might be enough. Depending on your field of study, you could get by with an Intel Core i3 processor or equivalent, with at least 6GB of RAM. If you need to run specialized software for design or programming, consider upgrading to a beefier system with more memory. On the other hand, if you do most of your coursework online or in a browser, getting a Chromebook could save you a lot of money.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to pay attention to a device\u2019s weight, especially if you plan on lugging your laptop to classes in person. There are a lot of premium ultraportables in the 13-inch category, with chips like Intel\u2019s Core i3 or i5, that cost around $1,000. If that\u2019s too expensive, you\u2019ll still have respectable options in the $600 to $800 price range, but they might be heavier and use older, slower processors. I\u2019ve included our favorite budget laptop in this college-centric guide but we also have more affordable top picks that you can check out as well.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\"><strong>Best Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html\"><strong>Best Gaming Laptops</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html\"><strong>Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html\"><strong>Best Chromebooks</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html\"><strong>Best Cheap Windows Laptops for 2023</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>With some laptop makers deciding to get rid of headphone jacks, it\u2019s important to check specs lists when you\u2019re shopping for newer machines. If you don\u2019t have wireless headphones or use equipment that plugs into the 3.5mm jack, you\u2019ll want to steer clear of devices like Dell\u2019s XPS 13 Plus.</p><p>Finally, while most laptops in 2023 offer WiFi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, you may not have one of the compatible routers or other devices that would enable those faster connections yet. Chances are, your campus WiFi might still be stuck on an older setup, too, so it\u2019s not <em>crucial</em> that you get a system with the latest standards yet. Of course, it doesn\u2019t hurt to get a laptop that\u2019s future-proof, but just know that of all the things to look out for, WiFi 6E shouldn\u2019t be a dealbreaker in your decision-making process.</p><h2>The best laptops for college students</h2><h2>Best Apple: MacBook Air</h2><p></p><p>It's hard to beat Apple's MacBook Air if you want a powerful machine for college that won't weigh you down.

The M2 laptop earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\">score of 96</a> from us for its impressive performance, gorgeous 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and its refined design that's even thinner than the M1 version that came before it. Our biggest gripe with this laptop is its price \u2014 the M2 MacBook Air will set you back $200 more than the M1, so you're looking at spending at least $1,199 if you want the latest and greatest from Apple.</p><p>Even though it\u2019s older, the Apple M1 MacBook Air is a solid machine, outperforming many PCs while maintaining a fanless design. It\u2019s also $200 cheaper, starting at $1,000. You\u2019ll still get a great keyboard and long battery life, along with a nice Retina display. Of course, it uses a 720p webcam, while newer models have sharper 1080p cameras in. They\u2019re housed in notches because Apple shaved down the bezels for a more modern look, so if that bothers you, it might be best to grab an M1 model while you can. You\u2019ll have to live with having just two USB-C charging ports, since only the M2 machines have the additional MagSafe socket, but if you\u2019re already living a largely wireless life and don\u2019t mind a not-so-great camera, you might find the M1 MacBook Air is a solid deal.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the Apple MacBook Air M2</strong></a></p><h2>Best Windows: Dell XPS 13 Plus</h2><p></p><p>The best PC has long been Dell\u2019s well-rounded XPS 13 series and I still recommend it to anyone that doesn\u2019t want a Mac. Yes, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMveHBzLTEzLXBsdXMtbGFwdG9wL3NwZC94cHMtMTMtOTMyMC1sYXB0b3A_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMDMzZTJiNS02MTBlLTNmMTUtOWQ1Ni1hYTc0YjVkMzg4ZTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUX8XHAEwjau-62bVaFlPDBPdkUGpU08OVgl-J6jl2rX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-13-plus-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9320-laptop%3F&amp;uuid=MzA7qhYJoLvH8MKF20588\">XPS 13 Plus</a> lacks a headphone jack, and some of its buttons are hard to see and use. But the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-plus-review-beauty-usability-120015270.html\">XPS 13</a> is a well-rounded machine and reliable workhorse that will get you through classes and late-night writing sessions without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the XPS 13 Plus offers a lovely OLED screen with impressively thin bezels and packs a roomy, comfortable keyboard. It also features a new minimalist design that looks more modern and offers a performance boost over the standard model. The row of capacitive keys at the top in lieu of traditional function keys may irk some as they can be hard to see outdoors, but if you become familiar with where they are you might not need to see where they are to find the right ones. The invisible trackpad can also be tricky since its boundaries aren\u2019t clear.</p><p>If you don\u2019t like the changes Dell has made to the XPS 13, or if you definitely need a headphone jack, the older generations are still solid options. There\u2019s also the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-laptop-hands-on-nvidia-rtx-4070-180029774.html\">Samsung Galaxy Book series</a>, which feature beautiful OLED screens and sharper webcams in thin and light frames.

It\u2019s also nice to see USB-A and USB-C ports, a microSD card slot and eight-hour battery life. Weighing 3 pounds and measuring 0.66 inches thick, the Flex 5i is not the lightest or slimmest laptop around, but hey, at least your wallet won\u2019t also feel light as feathers after buying this.</p><p>Notably, the Flex 5i is supposed to receive software and security updates until June of 2029, so it will last you for years to come. That\u2019s nice to see, considering this laptop has been out for more than a year now, and we\u2019re expecting Lenovo to release a replacement soon. When that happens, or if another manufacturer launches a comparable option, we will update this list. The Lenovo Flex 5i is no longer available directly from Lenovo, but you can commonly find it on Amazon for about $400 (as of this writing, it is selling for about $350).

Just make sure you get an Intel processor rather than an ARM-based configuration, since app compatibility might be an issue on the latter.

The tech giant announced its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ces-monitors-8k-57-inch-ultra-wide-odyssey-150046205.html\">first 5K monitor at CES in January</a> and launched it this June in South Korea.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung designed the 27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K monitor for creatives, with HDR 600 support, a matte display to reduce glares and Eye Saver Mode for long days tolling away. The company's first 5K monitor also has a 5,120 x 2,880 resolution, 99 percent DCI-P3 and 221 pixels per inch. Plus, you can calibrate the ViewFinity S9 5K monitor through the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smartthings-energy-103514042.html\">SmartThings app </a>in either Basic mode, which adjusts gamma settings and white balance, or Professional mode, which controls luminance and color temperature or space. It includes a 4K camera and is compatible with either a PC or Mac.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Interestingly, the ViewFinity S9 5K monitor costs exactly the same as its competitor, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-studio-display-review-mac-monitor-154504997.html\">27-inch Apple Studio Display</a> \u2014 which first came out in early 2022. At the time, we gave the Studio Display an 80 rating due to features such as a so-so webcam, 60Hz refresh rate and single-zone backlighting. The ViewFinity S9 5K has the same refresh rate but offers a few better features than Apple's Studio Display (or at least includes them without any extra cost). Apple is charging another $400 to adjust your monitor's height and angle and a whopping $2,299 if you also want a nano-texture glass display. Plus, the S9 5K has a 4K webcam versus Apple's 12MP option. All in all, unless you're an Apple or nothing shopper, Samsung's ViewFinity S9 5K might be a better choice for the price. Check it out for yourself in stores this August.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-viewfinity-s9-5k-display-will-cost-1599-when-it-arrives-in-august-093926336.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-viewfinity-s9-5k-display-will-cost-1599-when-it-arrives-in-august-093926336.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-17T09:39:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
