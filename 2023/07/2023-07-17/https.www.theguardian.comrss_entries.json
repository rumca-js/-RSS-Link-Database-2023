I drank there, did quizzes there, DJ-ed there, danced there, ate vegetarian roasts there. The Mucky Pup is no more; it changed hands. In January 2020, it went under the name the Bill Murray, a comedy club. I was there to see the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/18/bethany-black-funniest-things\" title=\"\">Bethany Black</a> perform a set to a small but packed house. The melancholy I felt at being on the site of so many memories, now restructured and repurposed beyond recognition, was quickly extinguished by her act. An experienced standup, she was engaging, easily confident; her accent, fast and fluent style and timing triggering associations ranging from Victoria Wood to Ken Dodd and Les Dawson, her tendency to digress reminiscent of Ronnie Corbett. Her set was traditional in other respects: predicaments, tricky situations, the comedy of embarrassment, rude bits, very British fare.</p><p>As she casually disclosed, Black is trans, lesbian, autistic, as well as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. All these multiple streams flowed into the river of her comedy. \u201cThe walk from the car to the venue is the scariest part of my day, this bit\u2019s dead easy,\u201d she said. Her act included the story of a man who refused to wipe his arse because he thought it was \u201cgay\u201d to do so, a nervous dialogue with her own brain wondering if she was a racist, a routine about finding a pillow in a hotel covered in spunk, and another that culminated in the line, \u201cIt\u2019s going to look like you\u2019ve been eaten out by Hitler,\u201d the context of which I leave to your imagination.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/17/different-times-history-of-british-comedy-david-stubbs-extract\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/17/different-times-history-of-british-comedy-david-stubbs-extract", "date_published": "2023-07-17T10:00:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for courgette, mozzarella and parmesan layered bake | A kitchen in Rome", "description": "<p>An inventive savoury bake in which layers of softened courgette are squashed firmly between two types of cheese and tomatoes</p><p><strong><br /></strong>While the selection is best between midday and 2pm, I prefer going to the canteen-like <a href=\"https://www.feliceatestaccio.com/\">Felice</a> just under our flat at about 3.30pm, because, after the rush of lunch, even the chairs seem to sit back and sigh with relief.

Also, by mid-afternoon, the last of the vegetable dishes they do so well \u2013 the several-inches-deep aubergine parmigiana, the mashed potato cake, the flat green beans stewed in tomato, and little cubes of roast potato with rosemary \u2013 have been sitting a while, resting, soaking.

I wasn\u2019t ready to lose her<br /></p><p>There is a quote I keep coming back to: \u201cSome people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never ever the same.\u201d In my case, those prints come from paws \u2013 and they belong to one particular cat.<br /><br />We didn\u2019t even want her. We had reserved her brother, a gorgeous silver maine coon named Ollie, who would join his older brother, Leo, who we had got a year earlier. But when we travelled the 150 miles to Doncaster to pick him up, the breeders offered us Lizzy as well \u2013 a sort of buy one, get one free. The runt of the litter, Lizzy had nearly died soon after she was born and was so small she had to be hand-fed every couple of hours. She and Ollie were inseparable and it seemed cruel to part them. She was a birdlike creature with a shock of cream fur, amber eyes, and a shy, sensitive nature.</p><p><br />All cats are special in their own way, and as she grew older it became clear that Lizzy\u2019s particular gift was to know when you weren\u2019t feeling great, and sit to share the moment with you. From headaches to hangovers, she would be there. In 2012, aged 45, I was reassured by my GP that the pain in my breast wasn\u2019t a sign of cancer, but to go for a mammogram to be on the safe side. There wasn\u2019t any cancer where the pain was, but, totally coincidentally, there was in my other breast.<br />I tried not to make a big deal out of it; the cancer could be treated and my kids were 13 and 15, so they had enough going on being teenagers. But it was Lizzy whose presence gave me comfort, a shadow following me around, a silent support when I felt the tears of uncertainty welling up. After surgery, I came home to find her at the front window, looking out for me. Later, exhausted and in pain from radiotherapy, I would lie down and she would instantly be there, just wanting to sit beside me and purr. Often my tears spilled on her.<br /><br />Cats can\u2019t really know what you\u2019re feeling or thinking, but it felt as if Lizzy did \u2013 and this helped me get through some dark days. Pets don\u2019t judge, they don\u2019t offer advice, their loyalty is never doubted. When I recovered, she was always there for me: running to greet me at the door after a day at the office, crawling on to the bed in the middle of the night trying to sleep with her paws on my pillow, standing guard by my keyboard as I worked from home, patiently hoping for head rubs.<br /><br />It was kidney disease that took her from us, very suddenly and very cruelly in 2018. I wasn\u2019t ready for it. Who is? Her ashes are still in our garage, neatly boxed with her name on the front. Since then there have been times when we have thought about burying her, next to her brothers \u2013 a proper ceremony with her human family all present. But the truth is I haven\u2019t been ready to say goodbye, even five years on. Now I realise it\u2019s time. The ashes can be buried; Lizzy\u2019s pawprints will be with me for ever.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/the-pet-ill-never-forget-lizzy-comforted-me-through-cancer-she-died-five-years-ago-and-i-struggled-to-say-goodbye\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/the-pet-ill-never-forget-lizzy-comforted-me-through-cancer-she-died-five-years-ago-and-i-struggled-to-say-goodbye", "date_published": "2023-07-17T10:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m a chef and I forgot how to bake a cake\u2019: why trauma often leads to brain fog and amnesia", "description": "<p>Shock, stress and grief can have a devastating effect on memory \u2013 but there are ways to bring it back</p><p>In early 2016, Juliet Owen-Nuttall decided to bake a cake.

As<strong> </strong>a teenager he started to realise he couldn\u2019t see properly at night, compounded by experimentation with cannabis and psychedelics. The tunnel vision worsened. A diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) was finally made. It is a hereditary condition that slowly kills the rod cells of the retina, which are responsible for seeing peripheral objects, particularly in low light.
