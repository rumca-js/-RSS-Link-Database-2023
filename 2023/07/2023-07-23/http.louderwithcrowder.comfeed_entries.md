CMT (Country Music Television) is a brand that did not. Now since the NYC-based MTV-owned "country" "music" channel is starting to ban country music, Nashville restaurants are starting to ban CMT.</p><p>CMT was bullied into canceling the Jason Aldean video for "Try That in A Small Town." While fans viewed it as a pro-middle America and anti-progressive agenda anthem, left-wing political activists like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shannon-watts-jason-aldean" target="_blank">shrill gun control harpy Shannon Watts</a> called for CMT to ban the video. Odd flex, since most people watch videos on the internet these days. But hey, at least she's trying!</p><p>Now a Nashville restaurant is canceling CMT. Nashville’s E3 Chophouse (<a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/07/22/jason-aldean-luke-bryans-nashville-steakhouse-vows-to-ban-cmt-on-their-tvs/" target="_blank">owned by Aldean and fellow country star Luke Bryan</a>) announced: We stand with Jason! E3 supports the small town because that is who we are! We will not air CMT at any of our restaurants until a formal apology is made and Jason’s music video is reinstated.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Luke Bryan knows a little somthin' somethin' about leftists outrage himself. Random idiots on Twitter <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/luke-bryan-ron-desantis-responds" target="_blank">attacked him for inviting Ron DeSantis out on stage</a>... during a hurricane benefit in Florida. Yes, the same Florida that Ron DeSantis is governor of.</p><p>CMT is owned by MTV, which is owned by Paramount Global. Unclear is if anyone on the executive level knows anyone in middle America, listens to country music, or even remembers that they own a country music channel. </p><p>Also unclear is if the cats at Paramount Global are anything like the cats at Anheuser-Busch, where Anheuser-Busch's global CEO Michael Doukeris <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-bars-restaurants" target="_blank">said of the Bud Light boycotts that the company</a> was more concerned about the "company's global sales volume." </p><p>What IS clear is that the NYC-based MTV-owned CMT is about to learn what happens when you try that in a small town. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

But only when the super serious protesters catch some form of comeuppance, whether it be having cars barrel through or watching them get dragged across the pavement. Today, we have Eco Granny Meets Constable Wilson.</p><p>As you enjoy with you're morning coffee, let us know the exact time you had your first chuckle. Is seeing people get arrested intentionally funny? No. But I've also never claimed to be a good person.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote>I went onto the road and was arrested straight away without any warning.</blockquote><p>That's not how getting arrested works when you break the law.</p><blockquote>Constable Wilson arrested me after about half a dozen steps on the road. </blockquote><p>Shout out to Constable Wilson. Way too often police arrest the counter-protesters who remove the eco-zealots so that useful people can carry on with their useful lives.</p><blockquote>I've got my grandson coming tonight. He's staying for the next two nights with Grandma and Grandad, and he told me when he saw me last week, "Grandma, the fish in the pond are dying." He's 5. "The fish in the pond are dying because it's too hot for them and they can't breathe."</blockquote><p>My nephew is 4, and when he saw this video he said it sounded like bullsh*t to him. Then he asked me why I prefer DeSantis to Trump, what was wrong with Dylan Mulvaney, and if I had any thoughts on Elon Musk changing the name of Twitter. </p><p>Of course, none of that is true. He just ran around the park jumping off things while yelling "Parkour!" He is allowed to live an innocent life as a child because the adults around him don't suck at life.</p><blockquote>And now that I've been arrested. Illegally arrested...</blockquote><p>Not a thing.</p><blockquote>I don't know what I'm going to do because now he's home with nobody ... well, grand will be there.</blockquote><p>Oh, that guy! And if your grandson is coming to stay for the weekend... oh, I don't know... maybe stay with him? You can always block traffic with ineffective displays of performative slacktivism the next weekend. People will still be driving and need to get places. Watch <em>Bluey </em>or something with a biscuit today.</p><p>If you enjoy eco-wackadoodle content as much as we do, the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website invites you to check out "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/just-stop-oil-stag-party" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: &quot;We love you oil, yes we do&quot;: Watch as this eco-clown protest is no match for a drunken bachelor party">Watch as this eco-clown protest is no match for a drunken bachelor party</a>," "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tall-female-german-protestors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: Leggy blonde emerges to save the day, drags eco-lunatics by the hair to stop them blocking traffic">Leggy blonde emerges to save the day, drags eco-lunatics by the hair to stop them blocking traffic</a>," and "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/block-traffic-guy-drags-unit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: Mountain of a man chucks left-wing protesters blocking traffic like they're useless sacks of soy">Mountain of a man chucks left-wing protesters blocking traffic like they're useless sacks of soy</a>."</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

On God, I have no idea if he is trolling to not. Or, if Twitter is officially becoming "X" on Sunday. Another option is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-trainer-mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank">Georges St. Pierre hit him in the head too hard</a> sparring for the Zuckerberg fight.</p><p>While you were sleeping, Elon announced to the Twitterverse, "Oh by the way, stop calling it the bird app. It's not the bird app anymore." By the time you find your way to this blog post, Twitter could be something else. Or Elon forgot about it. We'll all find out together!</p><p>The way things stand right now, here's what Musk tweeted. Or...I guess he dropped X?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This isn't the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-x-new-ceo" target="_blank">first time Elon has dropped X</a>. Last May, when he announced the controversial hiring of Linda Yaccarino as Twitter's new CEO -- Linda is (or was) a top official at the World Economic Forum, the same WEF that opposes free speech -- Musk said he was "looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app." Side note: Elon still hasn't hosted the Twitter Spaces with Linda where users could address their concerns with her.</p><p>Though he did announce if you wow him with an X logo design, he'll make the change official.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>And then around two o'clock in the morning, Musk hopped onto a Twitter Spaces to confirm that he wasn't joking.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Some days that means <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-farts" target="_blank">fact-checking the force of Musk's flatulence</a>. Other times it means wondering why the company keeps f*cking around with Tweetdeck. Today, are we Twitter or are we X? And is X gonna give it to us? F*ck waiting to get it on our own, is Musk gon' deliver to us?</p><p>He can call it a ham sandwich as long as I have a functioning app to scroll while I'm bored. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
