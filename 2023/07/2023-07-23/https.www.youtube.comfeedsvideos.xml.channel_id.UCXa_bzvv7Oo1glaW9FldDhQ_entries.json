Now, another year on, it\u2019s also making its way over to PS5 and PS4, and will be hoping to grab a piece of the pie that\u2019s currently being dominated by other games in the genre. \n\nWith a fast and engaging combat system, a large open world to explore, and plenty of multiplayer and live service integration to keep players engaged, Tower of Fantasy is certainly an intriguing prospect. Here, ahead of its PlayStation launch, we\u2019ll be talking about a few key details you should know about it, and about what new additions you can expect to go along with its PlayStation debut.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyMM9Hg9Lww", "date_published": "2023-07-23T17:30:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wyMM9Hg9Lww/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "NEW BLACK PANTHER GAME - 9 Things We Want", "description": "From Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales to Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel has enjoyed its fair share of success in games in recent years, and looking ahead at the Marvel games that are lined up at a number of developers throughout the industry, it\u2019s safe to assume that there\u2019s plenty more of that on the horizon. \n\nRecently, another game was added to that ever-growing list of upcoming titles when EA and newly established studio Cliffhanger Games announced a single player action-adventure Black Panther game, and it\u2019s no surprise whatsoever that the announcement instantly turned more than a few heads. Naturally, there will be no shortage of people with wishlists in mind for the game, and so, to that end, here, we\u2019re going to talk about a few things we\u2019re hoping to see from Cliffhanger and EA\u2019s Black Panther title.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBDkQVqT4mg", "date_published": "2023-07-23T15:30:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oBDkQVqT4mg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "EXOPRIMAL - WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?", "description": "Exoprimal is the latest release from Capcom and a deviation from its other titles, embracing a live service model and a PvEvP structure. The premise of Exosuits taking on hordes of dinosaurs with time travel and other insanity sounded intriguing enough. \n\nUnfortunately, the result is far from ideal. What exactly happened to cause this? On top of repetitive objectives, meager content, an annoying interface, disjointed story-telling and the lack of true PvE, Exoprimal is one of the most uneven games from the publisher.\n\nEven if it finds a hardcore audience, its long-term future remains doubtful, especially given the nature of live service. Let's look at Exoprimal, its various failings and where it could go from here.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2JHtOYWSPE", "date_published": "2023-07-23T13:30:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/t2JHtOYWSPE/hqdefault.jpg"}]
