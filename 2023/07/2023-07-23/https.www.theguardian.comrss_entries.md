But who exactly is pleased for him? Certainly not the soaked crowd at Royal Liverpool on Sunday, who booed Harman on the first tee and didn’t give the American his dues until his even wetter walk down the 18th fairway.</p><p>Probably not the American television broadcasters, NBC, who set up a “Waggle Counter” to poke fun at the number of Harman’s practice swings, of which there were often a dozen or more. A sort of unofficial shot clock – a device more familiar in the NBA at the free-throw line – goading Harman to be quicker, more exciting and dynamic before an ad break. But no, the 36-year-old took his time, as is his right, and continued to stripe it down the middle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/23/unflustered-brian-harman-grinds-his-way-to-major-success">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest deal between the Treasury and the palace shows why the cosy system created by David Cameron should be scrapped</p><p>The size of the funding increase awarded to King Charles III by the government is unjustifiable, and all the more so at a time when millions of people are struggling with the painful effects of high food, housing and other costs. Teachers have had to fight very hard for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/16/opposition-grows-among-teachers-to-65-pay-offer-in-england" title="">below-inflation offer of 6.5%</a>, along with many other public servants, and the economic outlook is widely accepted to be bleak. It seems extraordinary, in such circumstances, that the government has seen fit to offer the new king a rise estimated to be 45% from 2025. The precise figure will depend on profits from the government property portfolio known as the crown estate. The projected increase of £38.5m, taking the sovereign grant from £86m to £125m, undermines King Charles’s often-cited commitment to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/02/princess-anne-slimmed-down-royal-family-doesnt-sound-like-a-good-idea" title="">“slim down” the monarchy</a>.</p><p>The decision, which was taken by a committee of three people – prime minister Rishi Sunak, the chancellor Jeremy Hunt, and the keeper of the privy purse, Sir Michael Stevens – is made far worse by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/20/king-charles-to-receive-huge-pay-rise-from-uk-taxpayers" title="">opaque way in which it was communicated</a>. By emphasising that the percentage of crown estate profits that the royal family receives is being reduced, from 25% to 12%, the Treasury presented the deal as if it were a pay cut. The truth is that estimated profits of £1bn from offshore windfarm leases mean that the crown estate’s income is expected to balloon, placing the royals in line for a huge increase. <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/13716/lord_turnbull#profile" title="">Lord Turnbull</a>, a former cabinet secretary, used unusually blunt language in criticising what he called “a deliberate attempt to obfuscate”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-kings-pay-rise-there-is-no-justification-for-handing-over-more-millions">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on road safety: recent deaths are tragic reminders of the risks | Editorial

<p>Fewer people are killed on Britain’s roads than used to be the case. But reckless driving still costs lives</p><p>Since the late 1960s, when almost 8,000 people were killed annually on Britain’s roads, the number of casualties has fallen dramatically. Given that over the same period, the number of cars rose from fewer than 8m to around 33m, there is no question that road safety policies – as well as huge improvements in medicine – have, over the long term, reduced the risk of being killed in a crash. The figure for last year was 1,695, which is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-great-britain-provisional-results-2022/reported-road-casualties-great-britain-provisional-results-2022#:~:text=In%20reported%20road%20collisions%20in,of%2011%25%20compared%20to%202019" title="">3% lower than in 2019</a>, before the pandemic.</p><p>Several recent incidents, however, are a reminder of the dangers. These include the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/09/second-child-dies-wimbledon-school-crash" title="">deaths of two eight‑year-old girls</a>, after a Land Rover crashed through a fence at their school in south London, and four deaths, including those of two children, in Birmingham within a month. The driver in the Wimbledon crash was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The Birmingham deaths led to protests by a campaign group, Better Streets for Birmingham, which wants the council to take stronger action against an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/outcry-in-birmingham-after-four-cyclists-and-pedestrians-die-in-a-month" title="">“epidemic of bad driving”</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/the-guardian-view-on-road-safety-recent-deaths-are-tragic-reminders-of-the-risks">Continue reading...</a>

The ever-increasing signs of climate collapse make for heart-thumping reading, while our daily dose of record-breaking temperatures, severe water shortages and crop failure only add to the litany of looming disaster. Yet we continue with the model of “business as usual” because those in whom power and money are entrenched wish to keep them so.</p><p>So, what can the majority of us, who continue to bear the brunt, actually do? Protest just invites a prison sentence, while getting the media to invest a few words in the subject is seemingly impossible. Our most effective, and indeed possibly our only, tool for effecting meaningful change is our freedom to vote – all the way from local authority to national government – but with time fast running out we need those in power to be making those changes without further prevarication.

It was all over my fingers when I washed it, wrapping around them, this big ball of hair that I had to look at and deal with. I couldn’t stand it.</p><p>I had been working in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/hair-loss" title="">hair loss</a> for five years; I owned a hair extension company and had developed a programme offering bonding extensions that cancer patients could safely use after chemotherapy. So I knew how emotional losing your hair was. Yet it was only at that point that I learned something that’s been central to the way I work ever since: hair loss isn’t about how you look – it’s about how you feel. I’ve got amazingly thick hair, so even though half of it fell out, people said they couldn’t tell. But I knew, and I was shocked by how much it affected my confidence and how I felt about myself. It made me feel like I had lost my identity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/23/the-trichologist-who-lost-her-hair-i-learned-it-isnt-about-how-you-look-its-about-how-you-feel">Continue reading...</a>

Kiran Sidhu always thought of herself as a Londoner. But after her mum died, she moved to rural Wales in search of a new way of life. There she learned that feeling lost was the first step to finding herself<p>It’s the time of year when the ewes are being separated from the lambs, when their cries and the guttural noise from their mothers can be heard across the valley, a natural amphitheatre for the soundtrack of their separation. Country sounds have become familiar to me; I swapped the city for the country four years ago. But this particular one, the separation of the lambs from their mothers, resonates more than any other. It is the sound of displacement. A sound that, one day, will belong to us all. I lost my 62-year-old mother to cancer in 2014; I’ve been drifting ever since.</p><p>The idea of being “found” holds so much importance. It seems our entire lives are dedicated to finding spaces we can nestle into until, ultimately, we find ourselves. A milieu that is familiar, a cave that reverberates our very own sound. Perhaps this is the natural way in life, to gravitate to the things we recognise: who wants to stand alone when there is safety in numbers? But I have discovered something. Standing alone and being lost is a place where many things can be found. Not enough is said about stumbling around in the dark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/23/whats-a-girl-like-me-doing-in-a-welsh-valley-kiran-sidhu-on-moving-to-the-country">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She is putting her house in order, so gives me jumpers, tools, an old sundial. In the process, I receive all her stories, memories and knowledge</p><p>‘Would you like this almost-full bottle of floor cleaner?” my mother asks. She waves it under my nose and I see it is for wooden floors. “I don’t have wooden floors, Mum.” “No, neither do I,” she says, rather disappointed. “Well, if you don’t want it, I shall put it in the bin.” This is a test, because she knows we both hate being wasteful. “OK, OK, I’ll take it and find someone with wooden floors.”</p><p>This cycle happens every time I go to see my parents. It starts almost the minute I arrive, with a pile of things my mother has been saving up. Last time, it was a stack of 90s cotton jumpers, and there is usually some old tool she has found in a drawer. As the visit goes on, the gift-giving is ramped up; every time she leaves the room, she returns with some new object. She has always been generous – no visitor has ever left without produce from the garden, fresh eggs, a bunch of flowers. But recently it has taken a different tack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/my-mother-is-death-cleaning-and-i-never-want-it-to-end">Continue reading...</a>

On one hand, the party – with the exception of a few hardcore climate crisis deniers – has never reached the total opposition to green causes that disfigures rightwing parties in other nations, in particular the US Republicans. On the other, it has generally failed to enact the kind of legislation that would allow the UK to take a global lead in the battle against global heating, as can be seen from the records of three recent Tory prime ministers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/23/green-crap-tory-mps-environment-labour-conservatives">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m monomaniacal, I get slightly obsessive’: actor Tobias Menzies on tennis, moon landings and people watching

<p>Tobias Menzies has always relished a challenge, whether it’s playing Prince Philip, or a New York therapist – or just keeping up with Brad Pitt</p><p>As a child, the British actor Tobias Menzies was a talented junior tennis player. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, he decided to see if he could get his game back. He joined his local club in north London and started hitting, mostly on his own with a machine firing balls at him, at least a couple of times a week: for the first six months, he only struck forehands; then he did a similar stint on his backhand. Two years on, Menzies has finally felt ready to contest matches, mainly against the club pro.</p><p>“When I started playing again, I thought, ‘OK, I’m going to do my 10,000 hours, I’m going to start again,’” says the 49-year-old Menzies, referring to the principle, popularised by the writer Malcolm Gladwell, that it takes that amount of time to achieve expertise in any field. “I’m monomaniacal, I get slightly obsessive. I don’t get bored by hitting forehands for six months, that’s just how my brain is.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/23/tobias-menzies-interview-you-hurt-my-feelings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Assorted pangolins and humans flounder in this lacklustre Australian drama with decent special effects</p><p>This Philip Pullman-inspired Australian fantasy adventure follows a brother and sister who discover that their creaky new home contains a portal to a netherworld inhabited by a population of armoured pangolins. What’s more, the arrival of Peter (Sam Everingham) and Verity (Alyla Browne) fulfils a prophecy that decrees that cautious, anxious Peter is the rightful king and saviour of the land. To realise the prophecy, he must solve a series of riddles and collect the pieces of a mysterious artefact.</p><p>The visual effects in <em>The Secret Kingdom</em> are decent – although pangolins, with their pink-rimmed eyes and crusty skin, are not the most appealing creatures. But this is mediocre at best as a piece of family entertainment. The performances – child, adult and pangolin alike – are painfully poor. And the stop-start pacing of the picture is a slog.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/23/the-secret-kingdom-review-woeful-fantasy-adventure-pangolins">Continue reading...</a>

## My Name Is Alfred Hitchcock review – Mark Cousins puts words in Hitch’s mouth

<p>On one level a revealing study of Hitchcock’s work, this documentary goes a step too far by imagining the director’s inner thoughts, as voiced by impressionist Alistair McGowan</p><p>Cineaste and essayist Mark Cousins turns his lens on to the work of Alfred Hitchcock in his latest illuminating exploration of cinema history. To a certain extent it’s a match made in movie heaven. Cousins is particularly insightful regarding the use of the camera, and few film-makers employed it as eloquently as Hitchcock. Rather than a chronological appreciation, the film is divided into thematic chapters (Escape, Desire, etc) – a suitably idiosyncratic approach that reflects Hitchcock’s unconventional tendencies.</p><p>One issue, however, is the decision to have the film narrated by Alistair McGowan, doing an uncanny (and unpleasantly phlegmy) impersonation of Hitchcock. While film theory, by its nature, comes with an assumption of the intentions of the director, there is usually an intermediary voice. Putting the words of Mark Cousins into the mouth of Hitchcock is an uncomfortable leap: it feels presumptive at best and disingenuous at worst.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/23/my-name-is-alfred-hitchcock-review-mark-cousins-alistair-mcgowan">Continue reading...</a>

The location may have changed, but the song’s grisly narrative remained constant:</p><p>She fell down on her bended knees,<br />For mercy she did cry,<br />“Oh Willy, dear, don’t kill me here,<br />I’m unprepared to die!”</p><p>Knoxville Girl, 2016.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/23/kristine-potter-photographer-dark-waters-darkly-imagined-american-south">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My journey into the world showed me that adventures are for me, too</p><p>When my mum handed me the notebook, I was excited. It was from a trip she’d taken in the 1970s, visiting her aunt in Omaha, Nebraska. I had just done the exact same trip – a flight to New York City, then a Greyhound bus across the Midwest. I had made this trip to research the ebb and flow of women’s rights over a generation, but also to understand my mother better, and to tell the story of both in a book. This, therefore, was primary source gold: her private thoughts of that moment in time, perfectly preserved from nearly half a century ago.</p><p>Or at least some of them were. Because when I took the thin yellow pad in my hands, the faded paper covered in her unmistakable scrawl, I began to notice something. Pages had been removed. Some had parts missing, neatly cut off, as if folded along the line of a ruler and defiantly torn away. It had been redacted by my mother, like a document of national security, and forced into the light by a freedom of information request, by me, her daughter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/23/i-travelled-across-america-to-discover-my-mothers-secrets-and-instead-found-i-have-my-own">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With time-stopping attention to detail, the Observer’s art critic searches for redemption in the rubble of the catastrophic Delft explosion of 1654 – to miraculous effect</p><p>For Laura Cumming, Dutch art is a placid paradise with the countdown to a cataclysm ticking away in the background. The immaculately swept streets and waxed floors in the paintings, the thin ice that supports a crowd of skaters in a frozen winter, the churches that are containers for mellow light and silence – all are instantly annihilated by the big bang of the book’s title. The Delft Thunderclap in 1654 was the detonation of 40 tonnes of gunpowder, stored for the city’s defence in the cellar of a former convent and probably set alight by a spark when a guard turned his key in a rusty lock or swung his lantern carelessly. Buildings imploded, and numberless people were crushed by the rubble. As if still reeling from an aftershock, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauracumming">Cumming</a> is left trying to balance the safety or sanctity of art against the accidental violence of life, both on that day in the 17th century and in her personal experience of rupture and irreparable loss.</p><p>Among those killed by the thunderclap was Carel Fabritius, the painter whose eerily calm <em><a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carel-fabritius-a-view-of-delft">A View of Delft</a></em> in the National Gallery steadied Cumming during her “volatile and confused” early days in London. The book begins with her declaration of love for the painting, which she remembers visiting almost daily before she drifted off to trysts with someone she admits she did not love. Her actual boyfriend paled before Fabritius’s “darkly handsome” musician, who lolls beside his lute and viol, and Cumming wished herself out of clamorous, chaotic London into serenely empty Delft. Dutch art still consoles her by holding out the hope of “a perfectible world”. During the nervy Covid lockdowns, she kept a reproduction of Vermeer’s <em><a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-2860">The Little Street</a></em> pinned to a wall beside her desk as a pacifier. The apertures in Vermeer’s gabled facade invited her into “a next-door microcosm for the mind and eye”, subduing her to a stillness like that of the figure in the painting who sits hunched over some needlework inside her house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/23/thunderclap-a-memoir-of-art-and-life-and-sudden-death-laura-cumming-review-delft-explosion-dutch-fabritius-vermeer">Continue reading...</a>

A group of students from the Biennale Dance College recreate some of her seminal works: <em>Huddle</em>, where dancers take turns to detach themselves from a sturdy group and climb over the limbs of their fellows; <em>Hangers</em><em>,</em> in which three people stand in great loops of rope while the others buffet them to and fro; and <em>Slant Board</em><em>,</em> which asks three dancers to grapple with knotted ropes, testing their weight as they move like climbers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/23/venice-dance-biennale-2023-review-simone-forti-golden-lion-rachid-ouramdane-variations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jeremy Paxman and five high-flying friends all have Parkinson’s. Tim Adams joins them in the pub as they record the second series of their unmissable podcast about living with the disease</p><p>In the back room of the Ladbroke Arms pub in west London, on a hot afternoon at the end of last month, two of the more combative – and lucrative - voices of our times were sparring, amiably. At one end of the table was Nicholas Mostyn, once the best-paid divorce barrister in England – “Mr Payout” – and for 13 years a high court judge. And at the other, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremy-paxman">Jeremy Paxman</a>, the former grand inquisitor of the BBC, scourge of spin doctors and secretaries of state.</p><p>Mostyn was telling an involved and amusing story about something that had been said after hours at a lawyerly dinner, and Paxman was punctuating this lively performance with trademark sneers. “Oh, Christ,” he muttered in despair, “is this a legal joke?” And then, when Mostyn was still giggling roundly at his own punchline, there was the growled rejoinder: “Oh, do fuck off, judge…”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/23/movers-and-shakers-podcast-series-two-parkinsons-disease-paxman">Continue reading...</a>

## Labour’s stumble in Uxbridge shows Keir Starmer how to put the party on a firmer footing | Andrew Rawnsley

The party is congratulating itself on its win in Selby but has critical lessons to learn from its failure in London<p>When Sir Keir Starmer recently shared a platform with Sir Tony Blair, the former prime minister congratulated the aspirant one for doing an “amazing job” by rescuing Labour from “the brink of extinction” and leading it to “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tony+Blair+in+conversation+with+Keir+Starmer&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm8dmQxJ2AAxWtV0EAHemJCpQQ0pQJegQIChAB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1201&amp;dpr=1#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:73561156,vid:3gh6WIA68to" title="">the brink of government</a>”. That compliment sounded all the more lavish to those who knew how agitated Sir Tony used to be about Labour’s prospects. Just two years ago, in the wake of Labour’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57019456" title="">morale-crushing defeat</a> in the Hartlepool byelection, some of the most ardent Blairites even discussed abandoning all hope in Labour by launching a new party to be led by Sir Tony. What sounds fantastical today was talked about quite seriously back then. It is a mark of the advances that Labour has made in the time since that Sir Tony now gives his benedictions and blessings to Sir Keir.</p><p>Most people assume he will win the general election, but we have just seen that the path to power is strewn with trip hazards and Labour stumbled over one of them in Uxbridge. Before I get to that, first the good news for Sir Keir’s party from the trio of byelections on Thursday. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/uk-byelection-results-labour-tories-selby-ainsty-uxbridge" title="">victory</a> in Selby and Ainsty was a stunner. The win in North Yorkshire was the biggest numerical Conservative majority overturned by Labour since 1945 and the second largest swing from the Tories to Labour in postwar history. It usually spells doom for the incumbents when they suffer a byelection defeat that colossal. This result was reminiscent of the stonking Labour byelection wins that the party clocked up in the 1990s when Sir Tony was leading the party towards his first landslide victory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/labour-stumble-uxbridge-shows-keir-starmer-how-to-put-party-on-firmer-footing">Continue reading...</a>

First, shape is everything: whether you choose to thread or wax, they should follow the line of your brow bone. A half moon suits no one. Second, don’t pluck. If in doubt just leave them alone to do what they do and seal with a decent brow gel. Finally, always remember, jet-black brows are never a good look.</p><p><strong>1.

Lounging by the pool is at best ill-advised, but for residents daily life has turned into an ordeal<p>I’ve had my fair share of messages from friends abroad recently asking if it really is as hot as “they say” in Greece. Hot, I usually retort, doesn’t say it all. “It’s mind-meltingly blistering, baking from morning to night.

<p>We’ve been ghoulish about it all since 1888. Maybe it’s time we looked away</p><p>When we first met, back in the soft crevices of history, my boyfriend worked in a pub that happened to be on a Jack the Ripper tour. Every evening a group of tourists would come in and order a glass of water each, and the manager would roll his eyes, and off they’d shuffle to look at another autopsy photograph in an alley. He and I lived in Whitechapel for 12 years after that, and I’d watch the serial killer tours walking slowly through our little streets with respectful bemusement.</p><p>The skyline changed behind the tour groups, sky-scrapers emerging like a sort of architectural knotweed, and the murder tours were eclipsed by street art tours, which changed the area in a different way. Yet both tours imposed an authoritative order on things that might have previously escaped it. A great episode of the <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/" title="">This American Life</a> podcast focused on ghost tours in Savannah, Georgia, and the stories guides told about enslaved people betraying or seducing their masters. “If you look at them as little moral fables,” noted reporter Chenjerai Kumanyika, “the message of these stories is that everything would be fine if everyone just stayed in their place.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/23/cashing-in-on-jack-the-ripper-diminishes-the-true-horror-of-his-crimes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After dark days and fears for the future, Wigan can see the light once more, says manager Shaun Maloney</p><p>It may seem amiss to ask Shaun Maloney about pre-season optimism. As manager of Wigan Athletic he has, after all, had to contend with relegation, players and staff going unpaid, a winding-up order, a transfer embargo and “a two-to-three-week period where each day there was a big concern we might not be here the following day”. He also faces the ominous challenge of starting in League One <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/wigan-will-start-league-one-on-minus-four-points-after-failing-to-pay-wages-football" title="">on minus eight points</a>. But one day in June changed the landscape vitally for Wigan and their determined manager. Optimism no longer feels such an inappropriate topic.</p><p>Maloney was alone in his office at Wigan’s training ground when he received confirmation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/wigan-athletic-football-takeover-mike-danson" title="">the club had been taken over</a>, and saved, by a company backed by the local billionaire Mike Danson. “A massive relief,” says the former Celtic, Aston Villa and Wigan winger. “I was extremely happy that 200 people’s jobs had been saved, basically. The players got paid that night, the taxman was paid and the companies around Wigan were also getting paid for the work they’ve done for us. I was also extremely grateful to Mr Danson and his team, because they had to get through a lot of work in a short period of time. I’ll never forget that day.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/23/back-from-the-brink-takeover-brings-optimism-back-to-ailing-wigan">Continue reading...</a>

Modern parenting is preoccupied by the idea of perfection, and that includes weight. Virginia Sole-Smith, author of a brave and radical new book, talks to Rebecca Seal about why our worth shouldn’t be measured by size<p>After reading the last page of <em>Fat Talk: Coming of Age in Diet Culture</em>, I cried. Virginia Sole-Smith’s book made me radically question my own beliefs about fatness, health and diet. If you have a child, were a child or know a child, and think even a little bit about what our culture tells us about “good” or “bad” bodies, then this book will turn everything you thought you knew about how to raise a “healthy” child upside down.</p><p>We are so convinced that it’s awful to be fat, and especially to be a fat child, that we don’t interrogate what that anti-fatness does to kids, large or small, nor whether we are correct in our convictions. As Sole-Smith writes: “It’s not their bodies causing these kids to have higher rates of anxiety, depression and disordered eating behaviours. The real danger to a child in a larger body is how we treat them for having that body.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/23/parenting-kids-weight-virginia-sole-smith">Continue reading...</a>

The PM nudges some young people towards apprenticeships, suggesting their minds need no expansion<p>What is university for? Is it there to enrich our lives – to round us out as human beings – or is it there, primarily, to get us better jobs? The consensus on this seems to swing rather wildly depending on precisely which group of potential students we happen to be talking about.</p><p>News that a traditional humanities subject is on the decline, for example, tends to prompt us towards the first sort of answer. University is not merely about acquiring skills for work, we say, it is about setting you up for a fuller sort of life. The humanities are spiritually and morally improving – three years spent reading and thinking are valuable in themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/why-should-only-wealthy-student-lives-be-enriched-by-university">Continue reading...</a>

And not only in terms of morale – many musicians have actually gone to the frontline</p><p>Men arrive on crutches, two in wheelchairs, through a wintry dusk at the monumental neo-Renaissance opera house in Lviv, western Ukraine. Some 100 seats tonight have been reserved for serving soldiers, who enter the lobby – a <em>fin-de-siècle </em>wonder – in military fatigues. They hand these in, so that the coat check looks like a barracks locker room. A contingent of 40 cadets from the city’s emergency firefighting department duly arrives, disarmingly young. For most, it’s a first night at the opera.</p><p>The occasion marks the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – a concert dedicated to the troops who have fallen during this first, monstrous year of war, and the innocent civilian lives lost. But also to “The Invincible”: a homage in music to Ukraine’s noble cause and just war. The programme is <em>Bucha. Lacrimosa</em><em> </em>by Victoria Polevá, composed in commemoration of the victims of atrocities in that town during the early weeks of the war, followed by Giuseppe Verdi’s epic <em>Messa da Requiem</em>. The stage is blackened, and on each flank red roses are arranged so that petals fall towards the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/23/ukraine-musicians-fighting-frontline-pop-classical-music-boombox">Continue reading...</a>

The International Wine Challenge pick of bottles from Tesco – and other winners<p><strong>Tesco Finest Puemo Carmenère, Cachapoal, Chile 2020 (£8, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>) </strong>Tesco isn’t one of those companies that people tend to love. For most of us, most of the time, it’s simply there, a place we use almost without thinking. But when it does arouse strong feelings, they tend to be negative: as the UK’s largest supermarket chain it is inevitably the focus for critiques of the efficiency, equitability, and environmental sustainability of the UK’s food system. But it’s also had a justified reputation for ruthlessness. When the company was caught up in an accounting scandal in the mid-2010s, the reaction from most quarters was rather like those that accompany the latest transgression from a Tory Minister: a shrugging “well, what did you expect from people like that?” Over the years, the company’s wine range has tended to fit right in with this tale of meh and occasional woe. More recently, however, it’s emerged as one of the more interesting and reliable of the big retailers, with wines such as this excellent, smoothly textured, subtly herbal Chilean red.</p><p><strong>Tesco Finest Western Australian Sauvignon Semillon, Western Australia, Australia 2022 (£8, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>) </strong>I’m not alone in having noticed the improvement in the Tesco wine aisle in the past five years. Earlier this month, the company earned a rare double at one of the big British wine competitions, the International Wine Challenge, where it was awarded both Supermarket of the Year and Own-Label Range of the Year. Does that mean that I (or the IWC judges) would prefer to do our wine shopping in Tesco rather than places with bigger vinous reputations, such as Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer? Not necessarily. I find the peaks at both rivals a little more exciting. But the double-prize does reflect the number of worthwhile and good value wines, notably those developed by its wine buying team for the Finest brand, on offer at Tesco these days. Among my favourites: a pair of racy whites from Western Australian producer Howard Park: the Sauvignon Semillon and Tingleup Riesling 2022 (£10); and two textbook Riojas from Baron de Ley: the richly fruited Tesco Finest Rioja Blanco 2022 and the mellow Tesco Finest Rioja Reserva (both £9)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/23/award-winning-wines-from-britains-biggest-supermarket-tesco-iwc">Continue reading...</a>

We don’t fret about the bad oyster at all. That’s a paranoia for oyster agnostics, for the ones who think they ought to like them, but will quietly admit they are suspicious of the proposition. Our hope is that we’ll encounter not just the good oyster, but the better oyster and perhaps even the very best, for not all oysters are made equal. Some deliver that invigorating hit of saline and briskness, but lack body. Others are more substantial, but a touch one-note.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/23/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-sharkbait-and-swim-london">Continue reading...</a>

The past 1,000 years show the rewards of technological progress go to those who own and control it, not society<p>History suggests that societies generally overestimate the short-term implications of new technologies while underestimating longer-term ones. Current experience with artificial intelligence – the technology enabled by machine-learning – suggests we are getting it the other way round this time. There’s too much talk about the putative “existential risk” to humanity posed by AI, and <a href="https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/talking-about-a-schism-is-ahistorical-3c454a77220f" title="">too little about our experience of it so far</a> and corporate plans for exploiting the technology.</p><p>Although AI has been hiding in plain sight for a decade, it took most people by surprise. The appearance of ChatGPT last November signalled that the world had stumbled upon a powerful new technology. Not for nothing is this new “generative AI” called “foundational”: it provides the base on which the next wave of digital innovation will be built.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/observer-view-ai-implementation-must-not-be-left-to-business">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A bureaucratic, peacetime approach to training and stockpiling among Zelenskiy’s allies is posing a threat to European security</p><p>For two months Ukrainian forces have been endeavouring to fight their way through densely fortified Russian positions to breach the so-called Surovikin line in an attempt to liberate their territory. Fighting has been exceedingly hard, with heavy losses of equipment and personnel on both sides. Irrespective of how much progress is made over the coming months, Ukraine’s international partners need to focus their assistance on preparing Ukrainian armed forces for the next fight.</p><p>It is important to understand the challenge the Ukrainians are trying to overcome. Russian troops are fighting from successive layers of concrete-hardened positions, each behind 120-500 metres of complex minefields. They are backed up by significant artillery and attack helicopter support and protected by dense electronic warfare and air defences. Although Ukrainian troops tend to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/03/ukrainian-troops-regain-more-territory-along-eastern-and-southern-fronts" title="">win when they get into close combat</a> with the Russians, getting there without taking unsustainable losses is not always possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/23/west-must-focus-on-preparing-ukraines-troops-or-we-will-all-pay-the-price">Continue reading...</a>

Responses to Murnane’s work often tend to extremes: many readers, like me, become obsessed, wanting to read everything he has written, while other readers remain bemused or puzzled or worse.</p><p>Murnane’s four final novels – Barley Patch, A History of Books, A Million Windows and Border Districts – are exemplary works of late style. The phrase was coined by Theodor Adorno, who notes that late style occurs when an artist’s “subjectivity” is so “ruthlessly proclaiming itself” that it “breaks through the roundedness of form for the sake of expression”. In this account, the artist eschews the formal perfections of their medium to explore, instead, idiosyncratic artistic desires.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/23/a-homemade-avant-garde-of-one-why-is-gerald-murnane-revered-abroad-but-divisive-in-australia">Continue reading...</a>
