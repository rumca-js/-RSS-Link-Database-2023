I love the Quest Pro. It has turned into one of my favorite VR headsets of all time. Over the past 9 months I have used it almost every single day. Here is my experience. 

The sad part about this is that the Quest Pro is about to reach the end of its life sooner than we could have all imagined. Maybe it couldn't compete with the Quest 2 or Index? Maybe people were waiting for the Quest 3. Or maybe there's something more going on here.
