<p>Hi everyone,<p>Great Books Homeschool has just released this free tool for generating high school transcripts using the standard American unweighted GPA system.  It's available to the public at no cost, and no account creation is required.<p>These are both resources that would have saved me time as a new homeschooling parent, and I hope they are helpful to others.<p>Comments and feedback are welcome!</p>

## Show HN: I made a MailChimp alternative that connects to your database
 - [https://cc.dev](https://cc.dev)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-07-23T16:03:31+00:00

<p>Hi all! Excited to share cc.dev after months of work and refinement.<p>The idea for this product came from trying to do email marketing for my side project, CubeDesk, a site where Rubik's Cube enthusiasts can time themselves, race with one another, train algorithms — it's a fun niche!<p>With over 40k users, sending even a single campaign was becoming expensive with MailChimp. I knew AWS SES would be much cheaper, but it’s just an API with none of the other necessities you need for a robust email marketing platform.<p>Beyond cost, I was also frustrated with having to make sure my database was always in sync with MailChimp and the audience schema they enforced. If I wanted to email every user who had completed 10 solves, that would be a whole ordeal and eat up hours of my day.<p>So, I started (and am now launching):<p><a href="https://cc.dev" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://cc.dev</a><p>cc.dev connects directly to your database and lets you write SQL queries to target your audience. It's backed by AWS SES, so the cost to send emails is significantly less than what you're used to seeing. Combined with a template builder, media management, and campaign monitoring, cc.dev is meant to be your final destination whenever you need to send marketing emails to your users.<p>Would love to hear your feedback on this! If you're interested in trying out cc.dev as your email marketing platform, shoot me an email and let's have a chat: kash at cc.dev</p>

<p>To their credit, Microsoft puts the cursor in the text field ready for me to type in my authenticator code. Most web sites I've found, do not. So I look up with my shiny new code, ready to start typing, realize I need to move my hand to the mouse, place the cursor into the field then there's a 50% change I've forgotten the code and have to look back at my phone.</p>

<p>Pretty new around here. Is launching a waitlist for an upcoming product a good idea? If yes, how much context-sharing is too much or too little?</p>

## Show HN: I made a customizable iOS browser for minimalists and myself

<p>Hello HN!<p>So early this year I decided to build an iOS browser offering a large range of customization options, to accommodate anyone’s usage and visual preferences. Been using it as my default browser for 6 months and not looking back.<p>On first launch it looks and behaves a bit like Safari, but to give you an idea, here are the various ways I customized it on my phone.<p>- More screen real estate for the webpage, less for the toolbar.<p>- A compact toolbar containing only the buttons for actions I use the most: new tab, close tab, open tab list. Since I use them hundred times a day, I need them available with button taps instead of swipe gestures.<p>- A toolbar button layout adapted to my left-handedness.<p>- A toolbar that disappears on scroll to allow full-screen reading.<p>- The toolbar and address bar at the bottom, as they should be.<p>- A popup menu showing the full URL and the buttons I use less frequently: back/forward (already available as screen edge gestures), share, reload, settings, etc.<p>- Showing the page title in the toolbar.<p>- Read time estimation for each tab.<p>- Opening the keyboard automatically when I open a new tab.<p>- Sorting tabs by read time, so that I can decide what to read based on how much time and focus I have.<p>- Grouping tabs by domain.<p>- A flat, condensed tab list, without snapshots.<p>- A full-black toolbar in dark mode to read at night.<p>It’s still early days but things like content blockers, reader mode, iPad support, and more should arrive soon enough.<p>And of course, no analytics/monitoring/telemetry, no account creation, no backend. It’s not open source, but you can also inspect the app’s web views with Safari developer tools to see what’s going on under the hood.<p>Would love to hear if the level of personalization my app provides resonates with like-minded people.<p>Have a great day!</p>

## Ask HN: What is the best place to hire part time devs?

<p>I'm building an app, and starting to realize that it makes sense to pay someone to help me. I don't have the budget for full time, or even part time, really. I want to hire a person or agency to help me with tasks as I need them and as I can afford. My ideal situation is to hire a consistent person who I can give access to my repo and have them work directly in GitHub on assigned tasks. I've used Upwork for other tasks in the past, but I'm wondering if Upwork is the best place to find affordable and good dev help. Are there any other platforms you would recommend for finding consistent devs who are willing to work on occasional small or medium sized tasks via GitHub?</p>

## Show HN: Scaffolder, CLI tool to generate project structure, taken from YAML

<p>Scaffolder is a CLI tool written in Golang to instantly generate skeleton project structure with boilerplate code, that's taken from configurable YAML file, to quickly kick-start your project<p>I was tired of manually creating the project structure, with all those folder, files... So I decided to create a CLI tool that allows you to instantly generate skeleton projects, based on a reusable YAML file with boilerplate code if specified.<p>YAML is very easy for both humans and programs to work with and parse, hence why it's the most logical choice in context of Scaffolder.<p>Check out the GitHub page for detailed description and examples :)</p>
