On Eurosport, Vingegaard has been speaking about his win and the news that he\u2019ll be racing next at the La Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a:</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s super nice to win it for the second time\u2026I\u2019m more confident and more relaxed in this situation now and I think that\u2019s the biggest difference for me. I really enjoyed the rivalry with Tadej [Pogacar]. It\u2019s been an amazing fight from Bilbao to here today. It\u2019s good for cycling, it\u2019s good for us\u2026but I\u2019m glad I won.\u201d Jumbo-Visma confirmed today that the Dane will be racing at La Vuelta and Vingegaard says it has been the plan all along but they were waiting to release the news.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/23/tour-de-france-2023-final-stage-to-paris-champs-elysees-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/23/tour-de-france-2023-final-stage-to-paris-champs-elysees-live", "date_published": "2023-07-23T15:07:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Max Verstappen wins seventh straight race at F1 Hungarian Grand Prix", "description": "<ul><li>Lando Norris second, Sergio P\u00e9rez third</li><li>Lewis Hamilton fourth after starting on pole</li></ul><p>Max Verstappen won the Hungarian Grand Prix with another dominant display for Red Bull.

The immaculately swept streets and waxed floors in the paintings, the thin ice that supports a crowd of skaters in a frozen winter, the churches that are containers for mellow light and silence \u2013 all are instantly annihilated by the big bang of the book\u2019s title. The Delft Thunderclap in 1654 was the detonation of 40 tonnes of gunpowder, stored for the city\u2019s defence in the cellar of a former convent and probably set alight by a spark when a guard turned his key in a rusty lock or swung his lantern carelessly.

Her actual boyfriend paled before Fabritius\u2019s \u201cdarkly handsome\u201d musician, who lolls beside his lute and viol, and Cumming wished herself out of clamorous, chaotic London into serenely empty Delft.

Just two years ago, in the wake of Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57019456\" title=\"\">morale-crushing defeat</a> in the Hartlepool byelection, some of the most ardent Blairites even discussed abandoning all hope in Labour by launching a new party to be led by Sir Tony. What sounds fantastical today was talked about quite seriously back then. It is a mark of the advances that Labour has made in the time since that Sir Tony now gives his benedictions and blessings to Sir Keir.</p><p>Most people assume he will win the general election, but we have just seen that the path to power is strewn with trip hazards and Labour stumbled over one of them in Uxbridge. Before I get to that, first the good news for Sir Keir\u2019s party from the trio of byelections on Thursday. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/uk-byelection-results-labour-tories-selby-ainsty-uxbridge\" title=\"\">victory</a> in Selby and Ainsty was a stunner. The win in North Yorkshire was the biggest numerical Conservative majority overturned by Labour since 1945 and the second largest swing from the Tories to Labour in postwar history. It usually spells doom for the incumbents when they suffer a byelection defeat that colossal. This result was reminiscent of the stonking Labour byelection wins that the party clocked up in the 1990s when Sir Tony was leading the party towards his first landslide victory.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/labour-stumble-uxbridge-shows-keir-starmer-how-to-put-party-on-firmer-footing\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/23/labour-stumble-uxbridge-shows-keir-starmer-how-to-put-party-on-firmer-footing", "date_published": "2023-07-23T07:32:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Brow boosters: gels and brushes for enviable eyebrows | Funmi Fetto", "description": "A good shape for your eyebrow is the key rule.

For most of us, most of the time, it\u2019s simply there, a place we use almost without thinking.

But it\u2019s also had a justified reputation for ruthlessness.

Does that mean that I (or the IWC judges) would prefer to do our wine shopping in Tesco rather than places with bigger vinous reputations, such as Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer? Not necessarily. I find the peaks at both rivals a little more exciting. But the double-prize does reflect the number of worthwhile and good value wines, notably those developed by its wine buying team for the Finest brand, on offer at Tesco these days.
