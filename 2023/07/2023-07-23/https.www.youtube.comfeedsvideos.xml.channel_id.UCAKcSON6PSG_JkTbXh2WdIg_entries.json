The release of her 2021 album, \"Wary + Strange\" (on @rounderrecords), advanced her solo career after Kiah first gained recognition as part of Our Native Daughters, a supergroup comprising Kiah, Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell, whose live performance of Kiah\u2019s song, \u201cBlack Myself,\u201d at the 2019 Americana Honors and Awards ceremony in Nashville remains unforgettable to all who saw the performance in person or on video.\n\nKiah has been busily on tour in support of her solo work, which included a concert at the Parkway Theater in Minneapolis on Wednesday, July 5. Earlier that day, Kiah and her band visited The Current studio for a session with Radio Heartland\u2019s Mike Pengra. Kiah played a couple of songs from Wary + Strange, and also treated us to a radio debut of her new song, \u201cEmpire of Love.\u201d\n\nWatch and listen to the complete session above.\n\nVideo Segments\n00:00:00 Fancy Drones (Fracture Me)\n00:03:39 Wild Turkey\n00:08:13 Empire of Love\n00:12:05 Interview with host Mike Pengra\n\nMusicians\nAmythyst Kiah \u2013 vocals, guitar\nChris Collier \u2013 guitar, vocals\nAustin Drewry \u2013 drums\nEmma Lambiase \u2013 bass, vocals\n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013\u00a0@AmythystKiah \nHost \u2013\u00a0Mike Pengra\nProducer \u2013\u00a0Derrick Stevens\nVideo Editor \u2013\u00a0Evan Clark\nCamera Operators \u2013\u00a0Christian Ankrum; Micah Kopecky\nAudio \u2013 Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics \u2013\u00a0Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013\u00a0Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
