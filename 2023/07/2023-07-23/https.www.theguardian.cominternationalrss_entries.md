<p>Excess fat around your middle can mean a higher risk of disease later in life. The good news is, there are several ways to combat it – and only one is giving up beer</p><p>It’s surprising how something that is literally right in front of you can creep up on you so easily. Eventually, though, you have to face the truth: you have got a little overhang going on. A beer belly, even if you would rather call it another name. But is it anything to worry about? And what can you do about it?</p><p>First things first: yes, beer is one of the common causes. “An accumulation of fat around the middle is often due to an overconsumption of high-calorie foods and drinks,” says nutritionist Jenna Hope. “Beer fits into this category, and it’s easy to drink a couple of thousand calories more than you need every week. On top of that, the overconsumption of high-sugar, high-fat foods that often go hand in hand with a drinking habit will also contribute to higher body fat.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/23/should-i-worry-about-my-belly-fat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Warner)<br />Dua Lipa and Charli XCX bring high camp to this Mark Ronson-produced movie mixtape that climaxes with the sugary filth of Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice’s Barbie World</p><p>Pop’s perpetual Peter Pan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mark-ronson">Mark Ronson</a> has assembled this glitzy doll’s house of pop royalty to soundtrack this summer’s biggest movie blockbuster, co-writing five tracks himself and producing a handful more. Viewed simply as an ensemble mixtape, it shines like a kaleidoscope in 20 shades of coral. But the accompanying film feels as though it’s straining to live its truth as a fully fledged musical, and as a result a few of the soundtrack’s starry contributors – Sam Smith, Tame Impala, Haim – can’t seem to decide whether they’re serving the gods of pop or narrative. Still, Ronson touches glory with the 11 o’clock number <a href="https://youtu.be/Y1IgAEejvqM">I’m Just Ken</a>, launching Ryan Gosling’s pitch-corrected himbo into full masculine meltdown.</p><p>For all the Midas touch he exhibits on <a href="https://youtu.be/OiC1rgCPmUQ">Dua Lipa’s Dance the Night</a>, Ronson the songwriter lacks a requisite sprinkling of saccharine camp for a job like this. Fortunately, this ingredient is amply lavished elsewhere: in the beeping BPMs of <a href="https://youtu.be/JVhqadzCgwE">PinkPantheress</a> and Ava Max, the gloriously artificial K-pop regiment <a href="https://youtu.be/pfZjylInCwg">Fifty Fifty</a>, and the merciless hit merchant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/19/charli-xcx-people-who-take-it-too-far-are-better-than-people-who-dont">Charli XCX</a> belting her irresistibly idiotic bop <a href="https://youtu.be/TxZwCpgxttQ">Speed Drive</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/23/barbie-the-album-review-mark-ronson-dua-lipa-charli-xcx-nicki-minaj-ice-spice-billie-eilish">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An implausible tale of a painter turned detective does little to free the novelist from the shadow of Cold Mountain</p><p>The eminently first-world problem that can come from having a literary smash hit is that every book you write subsequently has to live within its shadow. The American writer Charles Frazier was in his late 40s when, in 1997, he published his debut novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/cold-mountain-9780340936320">Cold Mountain</a></em>, about a confederate army deserter during the civil war desperate to return home regardless of the punishment he’d face. It won the National Book award, sold a million copies in its first year, and was later made into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1109716,00.html#:~:text=The%20reasonably%20well%2Doff%20man's,of%20the%20American%20civil%20war.">film</a> starring Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. In the 26 years since, Frazier has published only three further books – <em>Thirteen Moons</em>, <em>Nightwoods</em> and <em>Varina</em> – none of which scaled similar heights.</p><p>The 72-year-old’s latest, <em>The Trackers</em>, might just experience a similar fate. It tells the curiously underwhelming tale of Val Welch, a young painter from Virginia eking out a living in Depression-era America. He travels across the country to rural Wyoming, where he is to paint a mural on the side of the town’s post office by arrangement of a wealthy local ranch owner, John Long. Long, an art lover, has political aspirations. He lives with his much younger wife, Eve, and a grizzled old cowboy hand, Faro, whose masculine manner is more wild west than the US of 1937.</p><p><em>The Trackers</em> by Charles Frazier is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

<p>The psychedelic hues of the horses in this image echo the strangeness of  the otherworldly landscape</p><p>When Gareth McConnell was commissioned to photograph the wild horses of Iceland by the <em>New York Times</em> magazine last summer, there was a sense of apocalypse in the air.

McConnell was, at the very least, he told me last week, determined not to do a <em>National Geographic</em> set of pictures.

<p><strong>Roslyn Packer Theatre, Sydney Theatre Company<br /></strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray director Kip Williams has taken a more simple approach with Nevil Shute’s novel and the result is stirring and sad</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>In 1957, Nevil Shute, the British aeronautical engineer, Naval Reserve officer and novelist, wrote of the end of all things as we know it in his novel On the Beach. In his version of Melbourne in 1963, nuclear war has wiped out signs of life in the northern hemisphere, and radiation poisoning is drifting on the wind towards the city. With only a few months to go and no way to save yourself, what matters most? Who do we become when the world changes? Can we stop a catastrophe, or do we lean into it?</p><p>Here in 2023, Tommy Murphy (ABC’s Significant Others, Holding the Man) has adapted the novel for the stage in a world that is especially sensitive to how close we are to the end. We have been buffeted by natural disasters brought on by the climate crisis; we have lived the eerie twilight of Covid-19 lockdowns; we are gripped by the horror of Russia-Ukraine war. We know very well the tension between destruction abroad and its delayed impact at home. Murphy’s play is still set in the 1960s, but it is suffused with our own dread and hopelessness; it is a much-needed vessel for our grief.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/23/on-the-beach-review-an-achingly-beautiful-depiction-of-the-end-of-the-world">Continue reading...</a>
