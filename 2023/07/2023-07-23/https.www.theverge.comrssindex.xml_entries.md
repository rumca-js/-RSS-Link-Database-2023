  <p id="hZN1cH">Apple is using an internal chatbot to help its employees “prototype future features, summarize text and answer questions based on data it has been trained with,” says <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l"><em>Power On</em></a> today. </p>
<p id="GPwKBD">Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800430/apple-gpt-ai-chatbot-generative-ai">hasn’t been sure</a> what it wants to do with its Apple GPT chatbot project on the customer-facing side yet, but Gurman’s report shed some light on at least its internal chatbot uses. According to the newsletter, Apple is looking at ways to expand the use of generative AI within its organization, with one possibility being giving the tool to its AppleCare support staff to better help customers dealing with issues. </p>
<p id="HqSQKa">That won’t necessarily happen soon, as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755057/openai-chatgpt-false-information-defamation-lawsuit">chatbot tendency to get things wrong</a> is well-known to Apple and its CEO,...</p>

  <p id="SPAUuu">Netflix isn’t planning to make a native version of its app for the Vision Pro, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in today’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>. Instead, he says, the company will allow its existing iPad app to run, unmodified, on Apple’s forthcoming mixed reality headset. </p>
<p id="cKWtx5">As Gurman’s piece points out, developers who don’t want to build Vision Pro software from the ground up have two choices: let their iPad apps run as is on the device or tweak them for the Vision Pro. Netflix has chosen the former, though whether pointedly or not, we don’t know.</p>
<p id="vX7OSf">Of course, very few companies have actually pledged dedicated software for the Vision Pro at this point, but Netflix’s reticence carries some baggage. The streaming giant was one of the most...</p>

## Twitter’s rebrand to X may actually be happening soon

  <p id="nwNIHR">Around 12AM ET last night, Twitter owner Elon Musk started tweeting — and did so for hours — about the Twitter rebrand to X, the one-letter name he’s used repeatedly in company and product names forever. It started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673">tweet</a> saying “soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” followed by a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682965462886535168">second tweet</a> adding that “if a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make go live worldwide tomorrow.”</p>
<p id="5t2hmf">Musk then, over the next several hours, gestured at the change in between other posts and replies, tweeting things like <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682986969549221888">“Deus X,”</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683037484186255360">replying</a> to other users talking about it. At one point, he joined a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1dRKZMMdOLzxB">Twitter Spaces session</a> called “No one talk until we summon Elon Musk,” and sat silently for almost an hour...</p>

  <p id="OCo54z"><em>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</em> is 2023’s perfect summer video game. </p>
<p id="hP3JZB">Now, you might be wondering how I could call a Switch port of a Nintendo DS game from 2010 “perfect” (the game’s also available on PS4, Xbox One, and Steam) over any of the games actually released this year, like <em>Diablo IV</em> or <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>. But while I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">enjoyed both</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23747068/diablo-iv-review-blizzard-class-customization">of those games</a>, I actually don’t think either are ideal summer games for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li id="P1VXEt">They’re way too involved, requiring a bit too much mental commitment to play. </li>
<li id="Pob0sp">Their hardware requirements force you to play them indoors.</li>
</ol>
<p id="Ma9ORj">Therefore, a perfect summer game must instead: </p>
<ol>
<li id="OZJAhT">Be simple</li>
<li id="yn5NwA">Be portable</li>
</ol>
<p id="FZsNQn">(Yes, I know <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23750107/how-to-play-install-diablo-4-steam-deck">you can play <em>Diablo IV</em> on your Steam Deck with a bit of work</a>, but level with me here.) </p>

  <p id="oE8RoP">Sometimes you’ve just gotta break the rules and go for it. I attended Nothing’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23795130/nothing-draws-a-crowd-at-its-one-night-only-nyc-pop-up">New York City product drop last week</a> and got my hands on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23649968/nothing-ear-2-review-wireless-earbuds">Nothing Ear 2s</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23792961/nothing-phone-2-review-glyph-screen-battery-camera">Nothing Phone 2</a>. Now, I’m a longtime Verizon customer, which seemed like a major hurdle for actually testing out this phone and its flashing glyphs. At one point, Nothing had mentioned “limited” support for Verizon on its website, but the company has since removed the carrier from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nothing.tech%2Fpages%2Fphone-2%23spec&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23803460%2Fnothing-phone-2-verizon-works-okay-wouldnt-depend-on-it" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">its tech specs</a> altogether — never a good sign. </p>
<p id="6XIi6I">But as I’ve come to find out, as long as you’ve got an active SIM that was already in another Verizon-certified phone, you can toss that into the Nothing Phone 2 and get going without any immediate headaches. When I tried doing so, the phone’s mobile...</p>
