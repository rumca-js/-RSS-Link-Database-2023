I'm currently painting up the Combat Patrol for the Astra Militarum - aka the Imperial Guard - and not only am I really enjoying it, I'm also building towards a 1000-point Guard army, which will be my first army-style force in YEARS. I'll talk about that and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
