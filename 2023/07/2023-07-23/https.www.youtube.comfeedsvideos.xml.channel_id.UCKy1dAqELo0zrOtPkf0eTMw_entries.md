Barbenheimer is the cultural phenomenon taking the nation by storm, but can it save cinema? Join IGN Hosts Benjamin Watts, Jeffrey Vega, Alyssa Mora and Amelia Emberwing as the explore the strange cinematic hybrid and what it means for the movies going forward.

With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie featuring knockouts like Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, Rita Arya, Dua Lipa, Emerald Fennell, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer featuring powerhouses like Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, James D’Arcy, Kenneth Branagh, Florence Pugh, David Dastmalchian, Matt Damon, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek and many, many more, it’s fair to say that these two films are going to be heavily featured in future fan conversations.

Barbie explores the treasured Mattel doll that may have just become one of Warner Bros. Discovery’s most treasured IPs, while Oppenheimer gives the biopic treatment to the father of the atomic bomb and the atrocities that unfolded after. While the plot of the two movies couldn’t be more different from one another, but they do share a certain existentialism that one may not expect from a Barbie doll.
