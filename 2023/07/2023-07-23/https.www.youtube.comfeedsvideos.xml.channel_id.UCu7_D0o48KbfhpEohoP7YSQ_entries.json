This one aired on April 5th, 2020.\n\nMeasuring current is simple. Right? You just take a multimeter, connect it to the two cables, and read the value.\nIf you want to do the same with a Microcontroller like an Arduino or an ESP, things get a little more complicated. Let\u2019s dig into it to see how it works! And which is the best sensor for our projects?\n\nSensors in the video: \nMAX4080: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkuBwx1\nINA169: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dVM29Nk\nINA219: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dn0SeUx\nINA3221 (order black module): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlWzj1v\nACS712: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dS79KJU\nACS758: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_d660NQm\nWCS1800: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdfHAv9\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (no additional cost for you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nDiscord Channel: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nGithub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
