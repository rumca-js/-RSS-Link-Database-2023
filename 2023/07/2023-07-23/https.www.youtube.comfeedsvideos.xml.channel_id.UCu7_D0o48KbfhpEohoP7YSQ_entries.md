During my summer break, I reupload successful videos of the past (for your rainy Sundays). This one aired on April 5th, 2020.

Measuring current is simple. Right? You just take a multimeter, connect it to the two cables, and read the value.
If you want to do the same with a Microcontroller like an Arduino or an ESP, things get a little more complicated. Letâ€™s dig into it to see how it works! And which is the best sensor for our projects?
