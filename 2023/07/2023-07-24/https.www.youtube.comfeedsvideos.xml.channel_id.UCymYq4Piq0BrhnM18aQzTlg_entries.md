See more commentary: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZHp4d1HnIsJJ0Gy1ENvGjbCp7PslRyz - YouTube doesn't want you choosing what to watch, they prefer to have their algorithm decide for you. So why do we creators spend so much time asking you to subscribe? Because subscriptions used to matter. YouTube still has a "subscriptions" tab that shows everything your subscribed channels uploaded but it needs to be updated especially for those of us who watch a number of different types of content on Youtube.  Subscribe for more, maybe it'll matter again ! https://lon.tv/s
