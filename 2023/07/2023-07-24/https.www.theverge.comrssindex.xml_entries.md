  <p id="5OSr7u">Mastodon, the decentralized network viewed as a viable alternative to Twitter, is rife with child sexual abuse material (CSAM), according to a <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/vb515nd6874">new study</a> from <a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/addressing-child-exploitation-federated-social-media">Stanford’s Internet Observatory</a> (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/24/twitter-rival-mastodon-rife-with-child-abuse-material-study-finds/">via <em>The Washington Post</em></a>). In just two days, researchers found 112 instances of known CSAM across 325,000 posts on the platform — with the first instance showing up after just five minutes of searching.</p>
<p id="Ez2pi3">To conduct its research, the Internet Observatory scanned the 25 most popular Mastodon instances for CSAM. Researchers also employed Google’s SafeSearch API to identify explicit images, along with PhotoDNA, a tool that helps find flagged CSAM. During its search, the team found 554 pieces of content that matched hashtags or keywords often used by child...</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0NZER5">Ten years ago today — July 24th, 2013 — Google announced a $35 streaming stick called the Chromecast. </p>
<p id="PHc7zQ">I was one of the first journalists to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553368/hands-on-googles-35-chromecast-a-streaming-tv-stick">lay hands on the dongle</a>, and it wasn’t yet clear how big a deal it’d be. The demo was choppy! It could arguably be classified as a me-too product given Apple’s AirPlay was already three years old and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609916/miracast-certifications-sony-lg-streaming">Miracast</a> was a buzzword across the industry.

  <p id="6uiNb1">Netflix is introducing a new tab in its mobile apps that could make it easier to actually find something you want to watch, <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-my-netflix-a-one-stop-shop-for-series-and-movies-you-want-to">according to a blog post from the company</a>. The new tab, called “My Netflix,” will be available on iOS beginning Monday and starts rolling out on Android in early August.</p>
<p id="7ZmFsq">Basically, it sounds like My Netflix will surface titles you’ve shown some sort of interest in as a way to help you make a decision about what to watch. The My Netflix tab will show you things like titles you’ve downloaded, have recently watched, are halfway through, have saved to My List, and have given a thumbs-up to, as well as trailers you’ve watched.</p>

I don’t know if they’re still really “limited,” as they remain easy to buy even after Nanoleaf has turned 11, but either way, the black triangles are especially cool-looking since they show their all-black base when turned off. Most other Nanoleaf panels are entirely white when switched off, so the black offers a sleek contrast with brighter walls or can blend into darker rooms. </p>

The same X also appears on Twitter’s homepage, as a profile picture for its official @twitter account, and on a splash screen displayed while the website loads.

  <p id="zyChRP">Legions of Barbie-core and biopic fans descended onto theaters this weekend for the “Barbenheimer” box office phenomenon, but one pink-plastered performance, in particular, came out on top. Greta Gerwig’s <em>Barbie </em>has already smashed several records, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230722119383/en/">raking in $155 million domestically</a> over the weekend — the highest US opening <em>ever</em> for a film directed by a woman — beating the previous $153 million achieved by Anna Boden’s <em>Captain Marvel</em>.</p>
<p id="qZGF5b">“The massive, overwhelming response we’ve seen out there proves what we’ve known from the beginning: that <em>‘Barbie’</em> is not only an incredibly special film, but clearly the theatrical event of the summer, if not the year,” said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. Pictures president of domestic distribution in a...</p>

  <p id="zAVL3Z">Twitter is transforming into X, as the site’s former bird logo has now been replaced by an official new X logo. Elon Musk, who owns the transformed social media site, began <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/23/23804629/twitters-rebrand-to-x-may-actually-be-happening-soon">signaling the change</a> early Sunday morning with a series of tweets, starting with one that said, “and soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.” </p>
<p id="kZEjh9">Now X has replaced the Twitter logo on the web version, signaling a change to Musk’s “everything app” that he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387592/elon-musk-twitter-deal-lawsuit-faq">originally envisioned</a> shortly after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">purchasing Twitter for $44 billion</a>  in November. The X logo will presumably replace the bird logo in mobile versions of the apps once they’re updated. References to Twitter still remain on the main web login prompt, though.</p>
