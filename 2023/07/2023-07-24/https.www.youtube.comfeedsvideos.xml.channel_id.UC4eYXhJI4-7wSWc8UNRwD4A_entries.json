(Where is my tissue? I have something in my eye.)\n\nShe closes the set with her song whose profane title can't be written out fully but is as common as the sound of traffic across Latin America: \"DPM (De Pxta Madre).\" In Garc\u00eda's masterful hands it becomes a colorful way to express the ups and downs of emotions of even the briefest romantic episode.\n\nIf there was ever any doubt that Garc\u00eda brings the skills of one of the best lyricists of Latin America to the world of Spanish pop music, this performance proves it. It feels like she is singing her very personal messages of desire and longing just for me.\n\nUh, I mean, for all of us.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Para Siempre\" \n\"B\u00fascame\"\n\"Mundo Inventado\"\n\"DPM (De Pxta Madre)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKany Garc\u00eda: lead vocals, steel guitar, ukulele\nCristian F.
