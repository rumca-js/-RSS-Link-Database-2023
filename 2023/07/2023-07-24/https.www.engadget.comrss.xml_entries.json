Dragging a magnetic sled attached to the expedition boat across the ocean floor, the team recovered a series of tiny spherical objects which Loeb says \u201cappear under a microscope as beautiful metallic marbles.\u201d Preliminary analysis indicated that the sub-millimeter orbs were 84 percent iron, with silicon, magnesium and trace elements comprising the rest. Loeb believes that \u201cas a result of being exposed to the fireball\u2019s heat, the surface of the object likely disintegrated into tiny spherules, similar in number per unit area to those recovered by the expedition.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"An electron microprobe image of one of the spherules recovered from the ocean's bottom.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/12857890-2a63-11ee-bbe6-efe0fb5f720b\" style=\"height: 548px; width: 558px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Avi Loeb / Medium</div></figure><p>Not one to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/books/review/extraterrestrial-avi-loeb.html\">exercise much caution</a> with public pronouncements, Loeb <a href=\"https://avi-loeb.medium.com/summary-of-the-successful-interstellar-expedition-61ff4467070d\">wrote</a> in a <em>Medium</em> post, \u201cTheir discovery opens a new frontier in astronomy, where what lay outside the solar system is studied through a microscope rather than a telescope.\u201d He summarized, in an equally dramatic manner, \u201cThe discovery of spherules felt like a miracle.\u201d Soon after, <em>CBS News</em> picked up on his excitement and published an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/avi-loeb-harvard-professor-alien-technology-fragments/\">attention-grabbing article</a> titled, \u201cHarvard professor Avi Loeb believes he\u2019s found fragments of alien technology.\u201d Loeb has sent the mysterious spheres to Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley and the Bruker Corporation in Germany for more in-depth analysis.</p><p>\u201cIt has material strength that is tougher than all space rock that were seen before, and catalogued by NASA,\u201d <em>CBS News</em><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/avi-loeb-harvard-professor-alien-technology-fragments/\">reported</a> Loeb as saying earlier this month. \u201cWe calculated its speed outside the solar system. It was 60 km per second, faster than 95% of all stars in the vicinity of the sun. The fact that it was made of materials tougher than even iron meteorites, and moving faster than 95% of all stars in the vicinity of the sun, suggested potentially it could be a spacecraft from another civilization or some technological gadget.\u201d</p><p>It all sounds fascinating, especially with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-16-person-panel-investigating-ufos-084041440.html\">resurgent interest in UFOs</a> and the quest to discover <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ufo-whistleblower-protection-102055820.html\">signs of alien life</a>. But there\u2019s one problem: The scientific community, by and large, believes Loeb is, if not entirely full of it, practicing something far outside what they\u2019d call science.</p><p>Peter Brown, a meteor physicist at Western University in Ontario, said that \u201cseveral percent\u201d of detected events appear interstellar at first but almost always end up chalked up to a measurement error. Steve Desch, an astrophysicist at Arizona State University, argued at a recent conference that if the object were traveling as fast as the data suggests \u2014 one of the points Loeb uses to indicate its origin was from outside our solar system \u2014 it would have been wholly incinerated entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Brown and other scientists also highlight Loeb\u2019s lack of engagement with peers who study similar unidentified fireballs.</p><p>Brown recently presented data (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14267\">accepted for publication</a> in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>) demonstrating that NASA\u2019s recordings in cases like these often end up being proven untrustworthy. He believes the fireball likely impacted at a slower speed than the recorded data suggested. \u201cIf the speed was overestimated, then the object becomes, more or less, within the realm of what we see in terms of other bound solar system objects,\u201d he said. (Loeb retorted by citing an unbendable trust in government data: \u201cThey are responsible for national security. I think they know what they are doing.\u201d) <em>The New York Times</em> adds that the government is unlikely to declassify the data that would allow the scientific community to learn how precise (or not) it is.</p><figure><img alt=\"Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb holding a vial while looking at the camera with a proud smile.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/635c5b30-2a63-11ee-a57f-5ee747954374\" style=\"height: 1114px; width: 1714px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Avi Loeb / Medium</div></figure><p>Regardless of the spherules\u2019 origins, researchers are alarmed by Loeb\u2019s penchant for venturing outside science to make bold (and highly publicized) claims \u2014 with his scientific background boosting their perceived legitimacy. The gist of their alarm is that becoming a Harvard-employed astrophysicist doesn\u2019t grant you the wizard-like ability to know the answers to questions the scientific method hasn\u2019t yet confirmed. On the contrary, it\u2019s supposed to mean your peers respect you for exercising restraint and doing quite the opposite. \u201c[Loeb\u2019s claims are] a real breakdown of the peer review process and the scientific method,\u201d Desch said to <em>The New York Times</em>. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so demoralizing and tiring.\u201d</p><p>Loeb\u2019s views about his peers\u2019 harsh response can be summarized in his cited quote from philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer from a recent <a href=\"https://avi-loeb.medium.com/summary-of-the-successful-interstellar-expedition-61ff4467070d\">blog post</a>. \u201cAll truth passes through three stages: First, it is ridiculed; second, it is violently opposed; and third, it is accepted as self-evident.\u201d Notably, Loeb seemingly refers to his conclusions about the preliminary findings \u2014 with plenty of question marks still intact \u2014 as \u201ctruth.\u201d</p><p>The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> defines <em>confirmation bias</em> as \u201cthe tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.\u201d Loeb\u2019s words and excited tone suggest he knows the answer and that his peers\u2019 criticism stems from their resistance to the new frontier he\u2019s discovered. However, their criticism seems only partially about his specific conclusions; it\u2019s paired with a larger concern about an esteemed cohort jumping to conclusions that fall far outside of the scientific method. \u201cWhat the public is seeing in Loeb is not how science works,\u201d remarked Desch. \u201cAnd they shouldn\u2019t go away thinking that.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/astrophysicist-who-claimed-to-find-alien-tech-may-have-done-the-science-wrong-214008434.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/astrophysicist-who-claimed-to-find-alien-tech-may-have-done-the-science-wrong-214008434.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-24T21:40:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "MIT's 'PhotoGuard' protects your images from malicious AI edits", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-brings-dall-es-ai-image-generation-to-bing-and-edge-152749735.html\">Dall-E</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-next-version-of-stable-diffusion-wont-produce-spaghetti-hands-171552952.html\">Stable Diffusion</a> were only the beginning.

Those &quot;perturbations,&quot; as the research team refers to them, are invisible to the human eye but easily readable by machines. The &quot;encoder&quot; attack method of introducing these artifacts targets the algorithmic model's latent representation of the target image \u2014 the complex mathematics that describes the position and color of every pixel in an image \u2014 essentially preventing the AI from understanding what it is looking at.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"9c47ced9740b41c1ac3e42fc53ec68a4\"></div><p>The more advanced, and computationally intensive, &quot;diffusion&quot; attack method camouflages an image as a different image in the eyes of the AI. It will define a target image and optimize the perturbations in its image so as to resemble its target. Any edits that an AI tries to make on these &quot;immunized&quot; images will be applies to the fake &quot;target&quot; images resulting in an unrealistic looking generated image.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;&quot;The encoder attack makes the model think that the input image (to be edited) is some other image (e.g. a gray image),&quot; MIT doctorate student and lead author of the paper, Hadi Salman, told Engadget. &quot;Whereas the diffusion attack forces the diffusion model to make edits towards some target image (which can also be some grey or random image).&quot;  The technique isn't foolproof, malicious actors could work to reverse engineer the protected image potentially by adding digital noise, cropping or flipping the picture.</p><p>\u201cA collaborative approach involving model developers, social media platforms, and policymakers presents a robust defense against unauthorized image manipulation. Working on this pressing issue is of paramount importance today,\u201d Salman said in a release. \u201cAnd while I am glad to contribute towards this solution, much work is needed to make this protection practical.

Years of commoditization have brought features once exclusive to high-end devices \u2013 including big batteries, multi-camera arrays and high refresh rate displays \u2013 down to their more affordable siblings. While there are still some things you'll only find on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html\">flagship smartphones</a>, you don't have to compromise as much anymore if you're looking for a solid device at a lower price tag. If you have less than $600 to spend, I can help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone.</p><h2>What is a midrange phone, anyway?</h2><p>While the term shows up frequently in articles and videos, there isn\u2019t an agreed-upon definition for \u201cmidrange\u201d beyond a phone that isn\u2019t a flagship or an entry-level option. Our recommendations for the best midrange smartphones cost between $400 and $600 \u2014 any less and you should expect significant compromises. If your budget is higher, though, you should consider flagships like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html\">Apple iPhone 13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s-22-review-sprucing-up-a-solid-foundation-151522033.html\">Samsung Galaxy S22</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"293c2d2a489f4f9689454757fe986306\"></div><h2>What factors should you consider when buying a midrange smartphone?</h2><p>Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it\u2019s great.) And if you\u2019re an Android fan, there\u2019s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn\u2019t rule either out.</p><p>Obviously, also consider how much you\u2019re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. And manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer. It\u2019s definitely worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford.</p><p>Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging speed? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what\u2019s important to you will make choosing one easier.</p><p>Lastly, pay attention to wireless bands and network compatibility. If you don\u2019t want to worry about that, your best bet is to buy directly from your carrier. To make things easier, all the phones we recommend are compatible with every major US wireless provider and can be purchased unlocked.&nbsp;</p><h2>What <em>won\u2019t</em> you get from a midrange smartphone?</h2><p>Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones gets blurrier as more upmarket features and specs trickle down to more affordable models. When we first published this guide in 2020, it was difficult to find $500 devices with waterproofing or 5G. Now, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging. Just remember to budget for a power adapter too \u2013 many companies have stopped including chargers with their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their cameras have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600.</p><h2>The best midrange phones for 2023</h2><h2>Google Pixel 7a: The best midrange Android phone</h2><p></p><p>The $500 <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vP3BsaT0xJmhsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNGRjNzY2ZC1hZGIwLTM2NTAtYTIxYS0wZjlhNDIzYTZlMGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaTyX268hvX3yDtZ0Kx1JPtsH8OFpWQ_oupUcBweEBq8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2F%3Fpli%3D1%26hl%3Den-US\">Pixel 7a</a> delivers everything we look for in a great affordable phone.

The company hasn\u2019t said how long it intends to furnish the latest SE with new software, but it\u2019s likely to support the device for a similar length of time.</p><p>For all its strengths, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678.html\">iPhone SE</a> is held back by a dated display. Not only is the SE\u2019s screen small and slow, but it also uses an IPS panel instead of an OLED display, meaning it can\u2019t deliver deep blacks. Additionally, that screen is surrounded by some of the largest bezels you\u2019ll find on a modern phone. That\u2019s not surprising. The SE uses the design of the iPhone 6, which will be a decade old in two years. And if the SE looks dated now, it will only feel more tired in a few years.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy A53 5G: The midrange phone with the best display for streaming</h2><p></p><p>For the best possible display at this price, look no further than <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLUZhY3RvcnktVW5sb2NrZWQtQW5kcm9pZC1TbWFydHBob25lL2RwL0IwOVI2RkpXV1MvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNGRjNzY2ZC1hZGIwLTM2NTAtYTIxYS0wZjlhNDIzYTZlMGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU4Yir_1rczG1_iawZd5gc5O0qfYmqo9ahqbOb8lb3jR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Factory-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB09R6FJWWS%2F\">Samsung\u2019s $450 Galaxy A53 5G</a>. It features a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display that is ideal for watching TV shows and movies. Plus the 120Hz panel is the fastest on this list. Other standout features of this Samsung phone include a 5,000mAh battery and versatile camera system. The A53\u2019s three shooters may not deliver photos with the same detail and natural colors as the Pixel 7a, but it can capture bigger scenes with its two wide-angle rear cameras.</p><p>Like the other Android smartphones on this list, the Samsung Galaxy A53 isn\u2019t the fastest performer. At best, Samsung\u2019s Exynos 1280 is a lateral move from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G found in the Galaxy A52 5G. And though the A53 is $50 cheaper than its predecessor, this Samsung phone no longer comes with a power adapter and headphone jack, so the difference may not end up being much.</p><h2>OnePlus Nord N200 5G: The best cheap smartphone when on a budget</h2><p></p><p>If you only have around $200 to spend on your next phone, you could do a lot worse than the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbmVQbHVzLVVubG9ja2VkLUFuZHJvaWQtU21hcnRwaG9uZS1DaGFyZ2luZy9kcC9CMDdYV0dXUEg1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNGRjNzY2ZC1hZGIwLTM2NTAtYTIxYS0wZjlhNDIzYTZlMGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUj-hciQFI3Jwol3utLKV7JGH57tXaAfkn3oGjmlMBy9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Charging%2Fdp%2FB07XWGWPH5%3F\">OnePlus Nord N200</a>. To start, this budget phone features a big 5,000mAh battery that will easily last you a full day. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-143031687.html\">N200</a> also has a 90Hz display and 5G connectivity, which are tricky to find at this price. Best of all, it doesn\u2019t look like a cheap phone.</p><p>But the N200 is also a good illustration of why you should spend more on a budget phone if you can. It's the slowest device on this list, due to its Snapdragon 480 chipset and paltry 4GB of RAM. Its triple main camera setup is serviceable during the day but struggles in low light and doesn\u2019t offer much versatility beyond a disappointing macro lens. OnePlus also doesn\u2019t plan to update the phone beyond the soon-to-be-outdated <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html\">Android 12</a>. In short, the N200 is unlikely to last you as long as any of the other affordable phones on this list.</p><p><em>Chris Velazco contributed to this report.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-24T18:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple Vision Pro developer kits are available now", "description": "<p>If Apple is going to make the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html\">Vision Pro</a> a success, it's going to need compelling apps \u2014 and that means giving developers hardware ahead of time.

If you qualify, you'll get a loaned mixed reality headset as well as help with setup, expert \"check-ins\" and extra support requests beyond what developers normally get.</p><p>The operative term, as you might guess, is \"if.\" You're submitting an application, not buying a product like the old <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html\">Apple Silicon Developer Transition Kit</a>. In addition to being part of the Apple Developer Program, you'll need to detail your existing apps and overall team talent. The company will favor creators whose app \"takes advantage\" of the Vision Pro's features. You can't just assume you'll get a headset, then, and you're less likely to get one if you're a newcomer or simply porting an iPad app. You'll have to be content with the visionOS beta software if you don't make the cut.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You also can't use the wearable for bragging rights. Apple requires that developers keep the Vision Pro in a secure workspace that only authorized team members can access. The company can also request a unit return at any time. Don't expect many leaked details, in other words.</p><p>The current kit may only end up in the hands of larger developers as a result. However, the launch shows how Apple intends to court app creators, and what titles you're likely to see when Vision Pro arrives early next year. The focus is on polished experiences that help sell the concept, rather than a huge catalog. That's not surprising when the Vision Pro is a $3,499 device aimed at professionals and enthusiasts, but you may have to wait a while before small studios release apps based on real-world testing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-are-available-now-181026904.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-are-available-now-181026904.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-24T18:10:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter CEO teases banking and payment plans in memo about X rebrand", "description": "<p>Twitter\u2019s rebrand to X is officially <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-begins-its-transition-to-x-100901444.html\">underway</a>, and CEO Linda Yaccarino has offered some new clues about what it may mean for the company.

We\u2019re here to help you out. The air fryer, which comes in several different shapes and sizes, can be a versatile addition to many kitchens, once you know what it\u2019s capable of. In the last year, shapes and sizes of air fryers have settled, and like the Instant Pot that came before, its a kitchen gadget that often appears at major online sales like Black Friday or Prime Week.</p><p>The function has even proved so popular that several all-in-one kitchen appliances, and even conventional ovens, now include an air fryer setting. This versatility will be useful for smaller kitchens with less space. Some air fryers offer two different cooking areas meaning you can synchronize cooking two different items without letting anything cool.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>First of all, let\u2019s clear one thing up: it\u2019s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens \u2013 which is part of the appeal.</p><p>For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried version. Don\u2019t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch.</p><h2>What to look for in an air fryer</h2><h3>Convection ovens</h3><p>You can separate most air fryers into two types and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer settings and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed.</p><p>You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven.  They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition.</p><p>The flip side of that is that you\u2019ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own.</p><h3>Pod-shaped air fryers</h3><p>Pod-shaped air fryers<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are what you imagine when you think \u201cair fryer.\u201d They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget,  bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything.</p><p>That\u2019s one of a few caveats. Most pod-shaped air fryers \u2013 there are a few exceptions \u2013 don\u2019t have a window to see how things are cooking, so you\u2019ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. These machines also generally use less energy \u2013 there\u2019s less space to heat \u2013 and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher.</p><p>Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they\u2019re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you\u2019ll have to pay for them.</p><figure><img alt=\"woman serving fried chicken with air fryer waffles\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/fcbb58a0-a9d4-11ec-97f7-1be0d263a8a8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Fabi\u00e1n Ponce via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>Air fryer pros and cons</h2><p>Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you\u2019ll be air frying.</p><p>One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don\u2019t, there\u2019s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a bit of oil spray when you turn items during cooking.</p><p>Most air fryers are easy to clean \u2013 especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We\u2019ll get into cleaning guidance a little later.</p><p>With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don\u2019t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable \u2013 especially the pod options.</p><p>There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food \u2013 like chicken tenders or brussels sprouts. If you\u2019re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can \u2013 and will \u2013 affect cooking.</p><p>There\u2019s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS \u2013 there\u2019s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you\u2019ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer \u2013 possibly one that has multiple cooking areas.</p><p>You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it\u2019s cooked right through.

Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely.</p><p>Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe \u2013 and you have a dishwasher \u2013 the job is pretty much done.</p><p>Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us.</p><p>Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers \u2013 use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides.</p><p>If Dawn isn\u2019t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn\u2019t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry.</p><h2>How to find air fryer recipes</h2><p>Beyond fries, nuggets and \u2013 a revelation \u2013 frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for your new air fryer. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however.</p><p>Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there\u2019s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words \u201cair fryer\u201d on the end of the search string.  We\u2019ve picked up some reliable options from <em>Delish</em>, which also has a handy air fryer time <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/cookware-reviews/a35686392/air-fryer-conversion/\">converter</a> for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/air-fryer-recipes\"><em>BBC Good Food</em></a> is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Nvb2tpbmcubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQlYZaY4TNa78tVAt9mFUeOlSWHXXGjsrTSZXBwIMML9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2F\">NYT Cooking</a>, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions.</p><p>And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What\u2019s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We\u2019re ready to try it.</p><h2>Best overall: Instant Vortex Plus</h2><p></p><p>You probably know the \u201cInstant\u201d brand from the line of very popular Instant Pot multi-cookers, but did you know that the company makes great air fryers too? We\u2019re especially impressed by the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Wb3J0ZXhUTS1Gcnllci1DbGVhckNvb2stT2RvckVyYXNlLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDk2TjI4U1pQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV7QjhbAOnFWnCU6wdAgLMuYEzwivUl-pxjmwrjzveV0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FVortexTM-Fryer-ClearCook-OdorErase-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB096N28SZP%3F\">Instant Vortex Plus</a> with ClearCook and OdorErase, which features a clear viewing window so you can see your food while it\u2019s cooking, plus an odor-removing filter. In our testing, we found that it didn\u2019t completely eliminate smells, but it seemed significantly less smoky when compared to our Breville Smart Oven Air. We love its ease of use intuitive controls, the easy-to-clean nonstick drawer basket, plus the roomy interior \u2013 it\u2019s big enough to fit four chicken thighs. Plus, this top pick heats up very quickly with virtually no preheating time.</p><p>A slightly more affordable option is its predecessor, the Instant Vortex Plus 6-Quart. It lacks the viewing window and the odor-removing filters, but it still has the same intuitive control panel and roomy nonstick interior. If you want an even bigger option, Instant also offers Instant Vortex Plus in a 10-quart model that has a viewing window and a rotisserie feature.</p><h2>Best dual-zone: Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer</h2><p></p><p>Most air fryers can make one thing at a time, but <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW5qYS1EWjIwMS0yLUJhc2tldC1UZWNobm9sb2d5LVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDk2WDlMR0oxP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ9JPd0SJI2oWJQSo9MpuTS_3vnKc7tbM4QkD6TcXHGs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNinja-DZ201-2-Basket-Technology-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB096X9LGJ1%3F\">Ninja\u2019s Dual Zone</a> machine can handle two totally different foods simultaneously. Available in 8- and 10-quart capacities, the machine isn\u2019t compact, so it won\u2019t be a good option for those with small kitchens. However, if you have the counter space, it could be the best air fryer to invest in especially if you cook for a large family. You can prep two totally different foods, like fried okra and brownies, at the same time with totally different cooking modes, or use Match Cook to prepare foods in the dual baskets the same way. The heating zones are independent, so if you only want to fill up one side with french fries and leave the other empty, you can do that as well.</p><p>We appreciate how quickly the Ninja air fryer heats up (there\u2019s little to no preheating time at all) and how it runs relatively quietly. It also has a feature called Smart Finish that will automatically adjust cooking times so that your fried chicken thighs in the first chamber and asparagus in the second will finish at the same time, so you don\u2019t have to wait for one part of your meal to be ready while the other gets cold. In general, dual-zone air fryers aren\u2019t necessary for most people, but those who cook often will get a lot of use out of machines like this Ninja.</p><h2>Best budget: Instant Vortex Mini</h2><p></p><p>Not only is the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnN0YW50LUN1c3RvbWl6YWJsZS1Qcm9ncmFtcy1Ob25zdGljay1EaXNod2FzaGVyLVNhZmUvZHAvQjA4WVMyWlo5Ny8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby00YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRmYjBlMzUtMGQ1OS00MWFjLWE2Y2QtYjlhZjVhNGJkYWQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbxiuo0cZ3liC7ZeaAATWKJ7PfHsqBSVZURtuASXUIhR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInstant-Customizable-Programs-Nonstick-Dishwasher-Safe%2Fdp%2FB08YS2ZZ97%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Instant Vortex Mini</a> budget-friendly with a $60 price tag (and you can often find it on sale for less), but it\u2019s also quite compact. Most air fryers will take up a lot of precious countertop space, but this two-quart model is great for those who don\u2019t have a lot to spare. The Vortex Mini can air fry, bake, roast and reheat, and you can control the temperature and cook time using the dial sitting in the middle of its touchscreen. Unlike some of the other, more expensive air fryers we tested, which have a variety of modes and settings, the Vortex Mini is dead simple to use. Just plug it in, press the preset cooking method of your choice, customize the temperature and cook time and press Start. The machine will beep about halfway through the cycle to let you know when to flip your food, and it\u2019ll chime again once it\u2019s finished.</p><p>Arguably the biggest caveat to the Vortex Mini is also its biggest strength. It\u2019s so compact that cooking more than one thing, or a lot of one thing, won\u2019t be easy. But I was able to cook a whole block of tofu cut into cubes (with a bit of overlap) and reheat (and re-crisp) leftovers in it for myself and my fianc\u00e9 with no problems. Overall, this compact air fryer will be hard to beat for those with tight budgets and tiny kitchens.</p><h2>Best multi-purpose air fryer: Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro</h2><p></p><p>Listen, most people don\u2019t need the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1CT1Y5MDBCU1MtQ29udmVjdGlvbi1CcnVzaGVkLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDFONVVQVFpTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUxrtKpli_MsWp5g9aqLWx0yvD9Bzh4J8wgvardDahZ-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-BOV900BSS-Convection-Brushed-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB01N5UPTZS\">Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro</a>. But if you love to cook, have a large family or throw a bunch of parties, you\u2019ll likely get a ton of use out of this machine. This countertop oven is a beast, measuring one cubic foot, so be prepared to carve out some space in your kitchen for it. But its size allows it to cook an entire 14-pound turkey and fit things like a five-quart dutch oven and a 9 x 13 pan inside of it. It can basically act like a second oven, or even a primary one if your main oven is out of commission.</p><p>As an air fryer toaster oven, it\u2019s quite capable and its size helps since you can spread your food out to ensure things are as crispy as possible. It also helps that you can cook a lot of food at once, which will make it easier if you\u2019re preparing appetizers for a party or a side dish for a family dinner. In addition to air frying, it has a number of other cooking modes including toast, broil, bake, pizza, dehydrate and proof. Despite the \u201csmart\u201d moniker, this model doesn\u2019t have app connectivity \u2013 but you can get that feature if you upgrade to the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c0ca87c7-692e-4b52-8410-9ea74ef1a5a6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Breville&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjMGNhODdjNy02OTJlLTRiNTItODQxMC05ZWE3NGVmMWE1YTYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJldmlsbGUuY29tL3VzL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL292ZW5zL2Jvdjk1MC5odG1sP3NrdT1CT1Y5NTBCU1MxQlVTMSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRmYjBlMzUtMGQ1OS00MWFjLWE2Y2QtYjlhZjVhNGJkYWQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaUrVCOat1Tdkav86QXaIcZ37-kvfn35fsguzZmZUKNx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fovens%2Fbov950.html%3Fsku%3DBOV950BSS1BUS1\">Joule</a>. That\u2019ll allow you to get push notifications when your food\u2019s ready, and the companion app also has guided recipes which you can follow along with. Unsurprisingly, like most Breville gadgets, both the Joule and the standard Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro are quite expensive, coming in at $500 and $400, respectively. But if you\u2019re looking to add the versatility of a multi-use machine to your kitchen, Breville has you covered.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-24T16:45:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple\u2019s MagSafe Leather Wallet drops to its cheapest price this year", "description": "<p>Amazon has Apple\u2019s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1MZWF0aGVyLVdhbGxldC1NYWdTYWZlLWlQaG9uZS9kcC9CMDlHOFRQUzNWLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xcXgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyNDRmZmMyLTA2MjctNDA1YS1hMDNjLTkwODc1YzIxZjg5YiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWnOzzeIRTI1Y6jMQ7CoQg_rtaOTO2GZKsUudFE5_ytv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Leather-Wallet-MagSafe-iPhone%2Fdp%2FB09G8TPS3V%2F\">iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe</a> on sale for close to its all-time lowest price \u2014 and its cheapest price (so far) in 2023. The magnetic wallet, usually $59, is currently available for $48. It\u2019s handy for bringing a few identification and credit cards out into the world without having to lug along a standalone wallet.

Just when it seems like others may be gaining ground, the company adds new features or improves audio quality to keep the top spot on many best lists. Today, Sony is debuting its latest flagship true wireless earbuds: <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=15919d69-aefa-41ae-a977-fdcae58a803c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sony&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxNTkxOWQ2OS1hZWZhLTQxYWUtYTk3Ny1mZGNhZTU4YTgwM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lbGVjdHJvbmljcy5zb255LmNvbS9hdWRpby9oZWFkcGhvbmVzL3RydWx5LXdpcmVsZXNzLWVhcmJ1ZHMvcC93ZjEwMDB4bTUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBjN2JlMmEzLTgwMWMtNGI3Mi05N2QzLTQyODQwNWQ4YzliYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcfEf1DIwsppvc2mbU64APm3VVqhgaO6GpiAqwJ8Wggh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.sony.com%2Faudio%2Fheadphones%2Ftruly-wireless-earbuds%2Fp%2Fwf1000xm5\">the WF-1000XM5 ($300)</a>.</p><p>While some of the company\u2019s trademark features return, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-leak-offers-a-first-look-at-the-unannounced-earbuds-161044694.html\">these earbuds</a> have been completely redesigned, from the overall look to the drivers and even the chips that power much of the functionality. Sony still manages to pack in more tools than anyone else, all while making significant improvements to sound quality. But all of the advancements come at a cost: these are Sony\u2019s most expensive set of wireless earbuds in the 1000X lineup yet.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>For <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html\">the WF-1000XM4</a>, Sony made big changes to the design of its flagship earbuds. Even with all of the excellent things <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-sony-wf-1000xm3-review-true-wireless-earbuds.html\">the WF-1000XM3</a> offered, those buds were huge and they looked more like Bluetooth headsets. The 2021 model had a different shape and were smaller, but they were still quite big and their weight on the outside of your ear could lead to an awkward fit. Thankfully, the company continued to slim things down with the WF-1000XM5, trimming another 25 percent off the previous model in terms of overall size and losing 20 percent of the weight. For this reason, the new model fits in my ears the best of any 1000X earbuds thus far and they never feel like they\u2019re in danger of falling out.</p><p>Sony also slightly updated the ear tips for the M5. Once again, the company opted for squishy foam like it did for the previous model. That switch on the WF-1000XM4 didn\u2019t offer the best fit for me. However, the company says the ear tips are more flexible this time around and it included an extra small size to cater to more ear shapes. The combination of the smaller earbuds and the revamped tips give the the WF-1000XM5 a much more comfortable, more secure-feeling fit than the M4.</p><p>Smaller earbuds also means a smaller charging case, but not drastically so. The WF-1000XM4\u2019s was already compact, but Sony slimmed the new version down while giving it a rounder shape. The LED status and pairing indicator on the previous model was a thin strip on the front. That has been replaced by a single dot and the company added a pairing button around back beside the USB-C port. On the M4, you had to put the buds in both ears and then hold your fingers on the touch controls for 5 seconds to put them in pairing mode.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec3bea90-2a1a-11ee-a3ff-6dfd5d74dd57\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Like most Sony earbuds, the company\u2019s Headphones Connect app is where you customize and activate features or dial in the sound profile. Once inside, tools range from the basics \u2013 things like managing Bluetooth multipoint connections, media playback  and changing the on-board controls \u2013 to more complex items like Adaptive Sound Control.</p><p>This is the feature Sony has offered for a while now that automatically changes your noise control preferences based on your activity or location. As always, the latter requires you to give the app access to your location data so it knows when you\u2019re at home versus when you arrive at the office. Adaptive Sound Control is quite handy even if you just use the activity side of the function. You can set it to activate ambient sound (transparency mode) when you start a run. With Adaptive Sound Control enabled, you won\u2019t have to reach for your phone or tap the WF-1000XM5 to get to your preferred settings each time you go from sitting to walking or vice versa.</p><p>Under the Sound tab, the app gives you access to noise control (noise canceling, ambient sound or off) right up top. And with ambient sound, you can adjust the level (1-20) and opt to have voices filtered in, with other noise suppressed, via a dedicated passthrough setting. Speak-to-Chat is also here, Sony\u2019s handy tool that pauses the audio when it detects your voice. It\u2019s a nice feature, but it\u2019s still just as susceptible to being triggered by a cough as ever.</p><p>The Sound tab is where you\u2019ll also find the EQ, with both manual adjustments and presets available. Sony has added a Find Your Equalizer sound test too, and the beta feature lets you select which sample settings sound best before building your ideal mode. Lastly, 360 Reality Audio setup/ear analysis, Bluetooth connection priority and DSEE Extreme upscaling (on/off) are under this section.</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec3c38b0-2a1a-11ee-b9fe-bf9897cf9b7c\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The System tab is next, which is where you\u2019ll find most of the WF-1000XM5\u2019s controls. You can disable multipoint connectivity, select which voice assistant you want to use and change the on-board controls, including which noise settings you want to cycle through. The M5 supports hands-free access to Google Assistant and Alexa, so you can play music, send messages, get notifications, set reminders and more without touching the earbuds or your phone. Google Assistant can also control certain features of the WF-1000XM5, including enabling ANC or ambient sound, with a spoken cue.</p><p>What\u2019s more, Sony has added a quadruple tap action for volume control, so you no longer have to sacrifice something else to get that function on your earbuds. Four taps on the left lowers the volume while four on the right raises it. All of the playback controls are now on the right side by default and Sony gives you two \u201cquick access\u201d slots for connected services by double and triple tapping on the left earbud. Options for this are currently limited to Spotify and Endel, though. You can also opt to hear some of your voice during calls and to use head gestures for incoming calls or to activate Auto Play. There\u2019s an earbud fit test and automatic options for both pausing when the earbuds are removed and turning them off when they\u2019re not in your ears.</p><p>Auto Play, a tool that\u2019s still in beta, can detect your activity and deliver a mix of music and notifications you\u2019ve selected for it. Activities can range from putting the earbuds in your ears to starting a walk or ending your work day. You can also silence notifications or let important messages through. Right now, Auto Play can only be linked and customized with Spotify and Endel, but it\u2019s yet another way Sony is trying to automate your relationship with your earbuds so you don\u2019t have to reach for your phone as often.</p><h2>Sound quality</h2><figure><img alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec3c38b3-2a1a-11ee-bbbf-4bc0ed25f859\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>WF-1000XM4 vs. WF-1000XM5</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Sound quality has never been an issue 1000X earbuds, but Sony made significant changes on the M5 in a bid to make the audio even better. First, the company opted for dual processors, an approach it has taken on the 1000X family of over-ear headphones. Here, the QN2e chip handles noise canceling alongside the main V2 processor. These two components combine for 24-bit audio and a more powerful integrated digital-to-analog converter (DAC).</p><p>Sony has also installed redesigned drivers that it's calling Dynamic Driver X. These are 2.4mm larger than the speakers on the M4 earbuds and have a separated dome-edge structure diaphragm. The company says the new components offer \u201crich and more detailed vocals\u201d along with \u201clow distortion and a clear sound quality.\u201d There is a noticeable improvement to overall clarity on the WF-1000XM5, especially when it comes to vocals. Lynn Gunn\u2019s lyricism on PVRIS\u2019 <em>Evergreen </em>cuts through more clearly on the M5 when compared directly with the M4, allowing her hooks to rise above the onslaught of chunky, distorted guitars and driving bass lines.</p><p>There are also big gains on the low end of the EQ curve. Bass is bigger and boomier on the WF-1000XM5, something I noticed immediately after getting reacquainted with the M4. There\u2019s more driving thump to the low-end throughout that PVRIS album and a pleasant, clicky pop to the kick drum on Chris Stapelton\u2019s \u201cWhite Horse.\u201d Over a range of genres, the sound profile on the M5 sounds bigger and fuller with a natural dimensionality that doesn\u2019t require 360 Reality Audio to immerse you in an album.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec3c5fc1-2a1a-11ee-a6dd-2b696540873c\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I did most of my testing with Sony\u2019s DSEE Extreme upscaling active as that\u2019s where the company\u2019s headphones really shine. Like other of the company\u2019s premium earbuds, the WF-1000XM5 supports Hi-Res Audio along with its own 360 Reality Audio (360RA) tech. In addition to being able to calibrate 360RA to your ears, Sony has now added head tracking to its take on spatial audio. While it does offer a slight improvement to the immersive nature of the audio standard, you\u2019ll need an Android device and compatible apps (Netflix, YouTube, et cetera) to use it.</p><p>The decision to split audio and ANC processing on the WF-1000XM5 also has implications for the overall effectiveness of the noise-canceling setup. Sony says the QN2e chip can now control the six-microphone array (three on each earbud) more precisely. The V2 chip assists with real-time signal processing. The company also says those dual-feedback mics can now monitor low-frequency noise better, battling things like airplane and vehicle clamor more efficiently than the M4. I found this to hold true, although I would\u2019ve liked to see some improvement with how the ANC handles human voices as there\u2019s not much change to the effectiveness at higher frequencies.</p><h2>Call quality</h2><p>Overall call quality was noticeably better than much of the competition on the WF-1000XM4. That\u2019s mostly due to the inclusion of bone-conduction sensors alongside the usual beamforming microphones. That dual-tech approach is back on the M5, but Sony has added a dash of AI to help you sound better on calls too. The company says its new noise-reduction algorithm is built on deep neural network processing and trained on 500 million voice samples. The result, as Sony explains it, is the WF-1000XM5\u2019s ability to more accurately extract your voice from ambient noise. Microphones were also rebuilt and wrapped in mesh to minimize wind noise.</p><p>In practice, Sony once again does a great job of blocking background noise. A nearby white noise machine didn\u2019t come across on my calls at all, nor did a raucous preseason soccer exhibition on my television. Voice clarity is far from perfect, but it\u2019s better than a lot of the competition. You don\u2019t sound muffled, though your speech does lack the natural warmth you get from a standalone microphone or by holding your iPhone or Google Pixel up to your face.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><figure><img alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec3c11a0-2a1a-11ee-9ff9-592f89f3d7c1\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>One area Sony didn\u2019t improve things was battery life. Just like the previous model, the company says you can expect up to eight hours with ANC turned on. The 24-hour total listening time with the case (2 additional charges) is also the same. If you disable active noise cancellation, Sony promises up to 12 hours of use with 36 hours total including the case, which is also unchanged. The company did slightly upgrade its quick charge feature which now gives you an hour of use in three minutes \u2013 versus five minutes on the M4. And just like before, the case supports both wireless charging and topping off via USB-C.</p><p>During my tests using both ANC and transparency mode at various times, doing a mix of music and calls, I managed just under seven hours. The numbers really started to tumble after about six hours at around 20 percent left. Seven hours is a full hour below Sony\u2019s estimate, but I did have DSEE Extreme upscaling turned on the whole time which likely impacted battery performance. The WF-1000XM4 didn\u2019t make it to the stated number during my review of those either, so hopefully the company either remedies this or clarifies how much its audio upscaling tech impacts these figures.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>Sony sits atop our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">best wireless earbuds</a> list thanks to the volume of features it offers on the WF-1000XM4. Sure, the sound quality is great and the ANC does a stellar job, but there are alternatives that do better in each of those areas. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html\">Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is my top pick when it comes to pure audio performance, though Sony closed the gap significantly with the M5. Sennheiser\u2019s earbuds have always had great sound, and it too continues to improve with each successive model. Sennheiser has also made upgrades to ANC and other features along the way.

Besides blocking out your typical distractions, the company improved its earbuds\u2019 ability to cancel human voices. Overall sound quality is improved over the first QuietComfort Earbuds, but it\u2019s still not on the level of Sony or Sennheiser. The QCE II are currently on sale for $50 less than full price <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3NlLVF1aWV0Q29tZm9ydC1DYW5jZWxsaW5nLVBlcnNvbmFsaXplZC1DYW5jZWxsYXRpb24vZHAvQjBCNFBTUUhENS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXF2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYzdiZTJhMy04MDFjLTRiNzItOTdkMy00Mjg0MDVkOGM5YmIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARx6nqyju4-SdDmzcSkkDtYrLvDjmy4U4xScBCwRcQob&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Personalized-Cancellation%2Fdp%2FB0B4PSQHD5%2F\">at $249</a>.</p><p>Lastly, let\u2019s have a word about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\">the AirPods Pro</a>. It\u2019s true they\u2019re only worth considering if you\u2019re invested in Apple\u2019s ecosystem, but <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-adaptive-audio-for-airpods-tunes-anc-and-transparency-to-your-environment-181218028.html\">features</a> arriving later this year with iOS 17 make them a better alternative to Sony\u2019s 1000X line than before. Apple will introduce Adaptive Audio this fall, which automatically tunes noise cancellation and transparency model levels for your environment. Personalized Volume will adjust levels based on both your surroundings and listening preferences. And perhaps most importantly, Apple will add Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers volume or pauses audio when the AirPods Pro detect your voice. That\u2019s very similar to Sony\u2019s Speak-to-Chat, a feature I\u2019ve enjoyed using despite its flaws. You\u2019ll need the second-gen AirPods Pro for these upcoming updates, which can be currently found <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1HZW5lcmF0aW9uLUNhbmNlbGxpbmctVHJhbnNwYXJlbmN5LVBlcnNvbmFsaXplZC9kcC9CMEJESFdEUjEyLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xcXYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBjN2JlMmEzLTgwMWMtNGI3Mi05N2QzLTQyODQwNWQ4YzliYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASRaKi_vxUCHwGpY-pcdcBuJJVrj9vKXwZG61vXo9m__&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%2F\">for $199</a>.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>With the WF-1000XM5, Sony improves its already formidable mix of great sound, effective ANC and handy features. These earbuds are undoubtedly the company\u2019s best and most comfortable design in its premium model so far, which was one of the few remaining riddles Sony needed to solve.

They can block out lower sounds, but not things like a TV or crying baby, making this headset ideal for new parents. The adjustable mic is built-in, so you don\u2019t have to worry about losing it either.</p><h2>Logitech Zone Vibe 100</h2><p></p><p>Since video conferencing from home exploded during the pandemic, I\u2019ve been extolling the virtues of using a headset for all of your business meetings. They block out unwanted noise, make your voice come through loud and clear, and they\u2019re a good sign to others that you are on a call.

The battery life is rated for 250 hours, though I swear based on my personal use it\u2019s much longer, and it only needs a single AAA battery so you can swap it out in seconds and get back to gaming.

It also brought a lighter touch to the <em>Star Trek</em> universe following darker shows like <em>Picard</em>. As we detailed yesterday, the show dropped its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-drops-its-lower-decks-crossover-early-230033262.html\"><em>Lower Decks</em> crossover episode</a> earlier than expected, and it's now available to stream.&nbsp;</p><p>Musical TV episodes are nothing new, with some of the more noteworthy ones coming out of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmLSjwam26E\"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnIk0npINiE\"><em>Scrubs</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U63EchG3TEQ\"><em>Xena, Warrior Princess</em></a> (yep).
