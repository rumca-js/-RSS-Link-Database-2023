Sometimes it's by accident. Other times the employee is having a bad day. But we know in order to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-axe-smasher-origin-story" target="_blank">maintain a civilized society</a>, you control your emotions and stay on your side of the counter. Once you cross the counter, you're in their world now. And they've been waiting for an excuse.</p><p>Standard viral video disclaimers apply. Location and time of the event are unknown and allow for missing context. Maybe there was a good reason to leap over the counter. Like they said something about his mother, or that they think Joe Biden is a good president.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Don't fuck with fast food workers, they have nothing to lose! <a href="https://t.co/knxKndcVYb">pic.twitter.com/knxKndcVYb</a><br />— Old Row (@OldRowViral) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowViral/status/1593281642919071745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'd love to know what was going through the head of the guy who crossed the counter, other than fists and Timbs'.

I say this as someone who once worked in fast food. 99.86% of us don't want to be there, hate being there, and in many instances hate our lives and ourselves.</p><p>Put yourself in my man working the 2-10 shift's shoes. He has no doubt gotten yelled at three times because the order took twelve seconds too long. He's had to clean the bathroom twice because customers are savages. And he only pours the self-serve ice cream. He's not a mechanic who can fix the machine. The guy doesn't have to work weekends.</p><p>Now he's got customers coming over the counter to disrespect him. Not this time. Not today. What f*cks he had left to give went out the window of the drive-thru at the woman holding up the line as she searched for change in her minivan's cup holder.</p><p>The fast food worker is the hero in this video. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Country star gives powerful defense of Jason Aldean with vulgar (and awesome) rant: "Keyboard warriors talking sh*t"

Aldean <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-plays-try-that-in-a-small-town" target="_blank">addressed the issue himself over the weekend</a> and praised country fans for being able to see through the bullsh*t. Gilbert used a few extra colorful words to make his point.</p><p>"One of my pet peeves is that we live in a world where no one gets punched in the face anymore. We've got a lot of keyboard warriors hiding behind cellphones and laptops talking sh*t. I got upset about this Aldean thing though and decided I was going to say some sh*t back. Then I realized I don't have the passwords for any of my social media because I'm a liability."</p><p>So he decided to write those sons of b*tches are song called "Bury Me Upside Down."

<p>Gilbert has never been known to keep his true opinions to himself. He was one of the first country stars to speak out about Bud Light... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-brantley-gilbert" target="_blank">by saying "f*ck that" as he spiked a can of beer on stage</a>.</p><p>He is also believed to have been one of the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-brantley-gilbert" target="_blank">originators of the "F*ck Joe Biden" chant</a> that took America by storm in 2021.</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with the Aldean controversy:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Jason Aldean released a song in May called "Try That in a Small Town" that, in his own words, is about "the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief. Because they were our neighbors, and that was above any differences."</p><p>A video was released last week that used real news footage of the chaos taking place in America, all of which took place in progressive cities and was the result of progressive policies.</p><p>Progressives and the media (but I repeat myself) hate having their agenda challenged, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-song-backlash" target="_self">so they lashed out calling it</a> <em>"...a modern lynching song"</em> with <em>"very scary"</em> AND <em>"racist"</em> lyrics.</p><p>The New York City-based MTV-owned CMT <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cmt-cancels-jason-aldean-video" target="_self">pulled the video amid the controversy</a> thanks to shrill, gun-control harpy Shannon Watts.

## Watch: Here's the new "Snow White" trashing the original movie because apparently, Disney hasn't lost enough money

Their latest dumpster fire is the live-action Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Or, to be more precise, Snow White, Six Mystical Creatures, and Peter Dinklage. </p><p>You would think the dwarf stuff would be bad enough. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-snow-white-photos" target="_blank">When you are so embarrassed by your movie you lie that it's not real</a>, it's not a good sign for the movie's success.

Neither niece is going to drag me to it.

<p>First, they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/snow-white-dwarf-actor" target="_blank">got rid of all the dwarfs</a>, because <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/01/27/dylan-postl-condemns-peter-dinklage-criticism-snow-white-7-dwarfs/" target="_blank">Peter Dinklage complained</a>. He also managed to get himself cast as the ONLY dwarf in the movie. I'm still impressed with that.</p><p>Then they are taking a fantasy character who sings to animals and turning her into a generic and unpleasant gender studies major no one wants to be around.</p><p>If you want a woke, feminist fairytale, create new content. You can still call the character Snow White. "Snow" can be a nickname for how she blows away the patriarchy. And the seven dwarves can be seven short kings she's competing against for a vice president of marketing job at Bud Light.</p><p>Again, this is Disney's investor's money to set on fire. It affects me zero other than for cheap content. But still, I just don't get the point. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Pay attention, America: Now Biden is coming after the way you choose to heat the water in your house

But look around your home. There is nothing you use in and around your house that Leftists and the Biden Administration are not coming after to regulate within an inch of its -- and your -- life. The latest is new "guidelines" about your hot water heater.</p><p>Biden's Department of Energy is <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/07/23/gas-stove-water-heater-biden-administration-sets-efficiency-standards/" target="_blank">calling for new energy "efficient" guidelines</a> so that "all new electric water heaters must deploy heat pump technology and all gas-fired ones will use condensing technology" by 2029. That means you have to shell out thousands of dollars that you may not have, or have and don't have to spend. I suppose Democrats can ram through another stimulus bill with "tax credits." And much like the "tax credit" for you to buy an electric vehicle, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ford-electric-trucks-price-increase" target="_blank">the cost of the equipment will go up to the exact amount of the tax credit</a>.</p><p>The Biden Admin claims you'll save money (eventually) and you are free to believe them. As Rep. Tom Massie says, people can choose to do this NOW and on their own if they want to. But the monthly savings never make up for the upfront cost of the equipment.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>And if you want to make these changes on your own? The changes you can make now still won't fall in line with the new Biden Admin rules. Erick Erickson just a new tankless hot water heater and is saving $200 a month in his energy costs. "It is a high-efficiency model that the DOE proposal would ban."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>There were a number of leftists tweeting (or, <a href="https://twitter.com/straytwt/status/1683474175766282241" target="_blank">I guess dropping X</a>) at Erick claiming that "no one is coming to your house for your water heater. Or gas stove." </p><p>That is a reference to the proposed Biden Adminstration ban on gas stoves. The one that "independent" "fact" checkers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gas-stoves-biden" target="_blank">were dispatched to say was not true</a>. The ban that Washington Post <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/washington-post-gas-stoves" target="_blank">celebrated before they were told to say it wasn't true.</a> And the gas stove ban <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-gas-stoves" target="_blank">that was passed in New York</a>.</p><p>It doesn't matter if it is Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, or Gavin Newsom. There is no aspect of your life leftists don't want to change alter, or regulate. It is ALL on the ballot in 2024.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Hunter Biden's former business partner drops bombshell testimony over DOZENS of times Joe Biden got involved

<p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer says they are very much looking forward to hearing from Archer "about all the times he has witnessed Joe Biden meeting with Hunter Biden’s overseas business partners when he was vice president, including on speakerphone.”</p><p>Joe Biden has been very snippy, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-cbs-news-reporter" target="_blank">lashing out at reporters</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/voter-confronts-biden-ukraine" target="_blank">at potential voters</a> about how he had no involvement in his second favorite son's business dealings.

Burisma, you may remember, is the Ukraine energy company paying Hunter $83,000 a month to be a director in an industry he has no experience.</p><blockquote>Archer, who also was a director, is expected to testify that, after dinner with the Burisma board at the Burj Al Arab Hotel, he and Hunter traveled six miles north to the Four Seasons Resort Dubai at Jumeirah Beach to have a drink with one of Hunter’s friends.<br /><br />While they were sitting outside at the bar, Vadym Pozharskyi, a senior Burisma executive, phoned to ask where they were because Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, needed to speak to Hunter urgently. Soon afterward, the two Ukrainians joined Hunter and Archer at the Four Seasons bar and Pozharskyi asked Hunter: “Can you ring your dad?” At the time it was early afternoon Friday in Washington, DC.<br /><br />Hunter then called his father, put him on speaker, placed the phone on the table, and introduced the Ukrainians to Joe Biden by name as “Nikolai and Vadym.”</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The speakerphone is key here. The last time we heard about Hunter getting his dad involved, it was a WhatsApp message to foreign business associates claiming Joe was sitting right next to Hunter and angry. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-whatsapp" target="_blank">It was a day Hunter was confirmed to be hanging out at Joey's house</a>, but there is no evidence his dad was sitting next to him. Remember, Hunter was doing a lot of drugs.</p><p>Archer claims at least twenty-four times that Joe was put on the phone. That means twenty-four phone records. That means twenty-four more times of Democrats in congressional hearings attempting to find anything else to talk about.</p><p>We go now live top CNN's coverage of these latest revelations, already in progress:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>My personal opinion about hearings is that they are a lot of bluster and mugging to the cameras for content. And the reality is nothing will happen until conservatives take back the White House (and also nominate someone who can win a general election). We know the Bidens are scumbags. You know the Bidens are scumbags. The Left and the media know as well, hence they're twisting themselves into pretzels trying to avoid acknowledging "Geez, this stuff looks bad."</p><p>It's the drip, drip, drip though. That, and the fact that Democrats no longer have Twitter (or X) to rely on to throttle and censor content about how terrible the Bidens are.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>"[The vice-president's comments] are categorically false. It never said slavery was beneficial to Africans. What was said, and anyone who reads this will see with clarity, it is the case that Africans proved resourceful, resilient, and adaptive and were able to develop skills and aptitudes which served to their benefit both while enslaved and after enslavement."</p><p>Journalisming outlets still have content to create, and they have their memo to create "this was Kamala Harris's finest moment" content. CNN contributor Scott Jennings missed that memo.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote>What is amazing to me is that how little Kamala Harris apparently has to do that she can read something on Twitter one day and be on the airplane the next to make something literally out of nothing. ... Everybody involved in this says this is completely a fabricated issue and yet look at how quickly Kamala Harris jumped on it. So, the fact that this is her best moment, a fabricated matter, is pretty ridiculous.</blockquote><p>A lie travels faster than the truth. Biden 2024 should put it on a bumper sticker. Leftists know with any lie they tell they can count on the media to swear by it. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
