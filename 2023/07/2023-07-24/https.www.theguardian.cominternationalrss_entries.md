<ul><li>England were dominant in fourth Test at Old Trafford</li><li>‘We still had batters to come. We could have shifted pressure’</li></ul><p>The Australia head coach, Andrew McDonald, does not agree that his side was saved by rain on the fifth day at Old Trafford, and is confident they have been the better team across the Ashes series. “Yep,” was his one-word response when that question was put to him after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/23/australia-retain-ashes-after-rain-douses-englands-hopes-in-fourth-test-draw">the fourth Test was washed out on Sunday</a>, an assessment resting on the fact that they had secured the trophy by dint of winning the first two Tests.</p><p>As for the assumption that the weather had robbed England of a 2-2 scoreline before the fifth Test, McDonald says otherwise, with his team 60 runs behind with five wickets in hand. “We still had some batters to come. We could have shifted some pressure. So it feels as though we sit here and [say] it was a foregone conclusion that England were going to win the game – I don’t believe that and that change room upstairs doesn’t believe that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/australia-coach-mcdonald-denies-his-side-were-saved-by-the-rain-in-ashes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After an unconvincing win against Haiti, Sarina Wiegman has a few problems to address before Friday’s match with Denmark</p><p>There is a Fran Kirby-shaped hole in the No 10 position that Ella Toone is struggling to fill. To be fair to Toone, few could replace the ingenuity and guile of Kirby. Toone is a different style of player, a very, very good one with bags of potential, but more box-to-box. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/22/england-haiti-womens-world-cup-match-report">Against Haiti</a>, Toone had most success shifted to the left and struggled to make things happen down the middle. If Sarina Wiegman is not going to change the shape to make the midfield work most effectively with the sum of its parts, then Lauren James is the more natural successor to Kirby. Against Haiti, James coming on as a wide player, in place of Lauren Hemp, felt like a missed opportunity. Yes, Hemp was on a yellow card and perhaps it was a slightly precautionary move but James showed in the pre-tournament friendly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/01/england-women-portugal-international-friendly-match-report">against Portugal</a> just how well-suited she is to the number 10 role.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jul/24/five-ways-england-can-kickstart-womens-world-cup-campaign">Continue reading...</a>
