Then as now, societies turn from God and collapse until someone takes on the burden of restoring the relationship. As Jordan and his round table continue to analyze Exodus, new themes emerge including Moses’ willingness to respond to God’s call, man’s relationship with the divine, the possibility of turning evil into good with God’s help, and how peoples’ willingness not to take a stand contributes to their downfall.
