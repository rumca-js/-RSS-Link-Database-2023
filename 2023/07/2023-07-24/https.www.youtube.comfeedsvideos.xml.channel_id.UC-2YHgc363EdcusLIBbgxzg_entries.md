Over the years, weâ€™ve heard hundreds of time about how we have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world. But is that actually true? Could we actually destroy all life on this planet? We crunch the numbers and see exactly how bad it would be if every nuclear weapon in the world went off at once. And learn a little something about Robert Oppenheimer along the way.
