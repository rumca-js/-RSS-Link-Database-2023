<p>After skipping 2022, Microsoft may have plans for the Surface Laptop Studio once again.</p>



<p>Windows Central <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/surface-laptop-studio-2-specs-design-new-features-and-everything-we-know-so-far&amp;xcust=2-1-2006422-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">believes</a> that the Surface Laptop 2, code-named &ldquo;Ersa&rdquo; (not &ldquo;Ursa,&rdquo; or Latin for &ldquo;bear,&rdquo; oddly) will be launched this fall. What we called the &ldquo;wave of the future&rdquo; in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review.html">Surface Laptop Studio review</a> will be updated with the latest hardware from Intel and Nvidia, the site reports, citing confidential sources. </p>



<p>Pulling from a couple of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/255867&amp;xcust=2-1-2006422-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">leaked Geekbench benchmarks</a>, the site believes Microsoft will skip a Core i5 model and go straight to the 13th-Gen Core i7-13700H and Core i7-13800H. In graphics, Microsoft is going to stick to its tried-and-true model, offering an entry-level RTX 4060 GPU inside of it. These entry-level GPUs have typically appeared in &ldquo;creator&rdquo; versions of popular laptops like the Surface Laptop Studio, aimed more at image and video capture and editing than hardcore gaming. (The latter <em>is</em> possible, though not a priority.)</p>



<p>Windows Central says that it believes that otherwise the Surface Laptop Studio 2 will remain unchanged, which is entirely plausible. Microsoft rarely redesigns its hardware, with the most recent, substantive changes arriving on the Surface Duo 2 (with an additional camera) and revamps to the Surface Pro lineup adding a Thunderbolt connector. Instead, it often updates the internal components instead.</p>



<p>Originally, the Geekbench benchmarks seemed to imply that the Surface Laptop Studio 2 would ship in the spring, but now a fall refresh (hello, Windows 11 23H2!) seems the likely window. With the Surface Laptop Studio, Microsoft re-engineered the Surface in an aggressive, delightful manner. It seems likely that the Surface Laptop 2 will continue its legacy.</p>

<p>A new vulnerability has been discovered in AMD&rsquo;s Zen 2 processors&mdash;one that allows data like passwords and encryption keys to be stolen from the CPU. Disclosed publicly this week by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy, this bug affects consumer chips as well as server, including Ryzen 3000 series parts.</p>



<p>As detailed by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2006423-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ormandy in a post</a>, this &ldquo;Zenbleed&rdquo; vulnerability was first shared with AMD back in mid-May. It can be used to execute code through Javascript on a webpage&mdash;no physical access is needed for an affected PC. And if exploited successfully, Zenbleed allows attackers to see any CPU operation, including those happening in sandboxes or virtual machines. (You can catch the full technical rundown in Ormandy&rsquo;s post, or a more summarized version in this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/zenbleed-bug-allows-data-theft-from-amds-zen-2-processors-patches-released&amp;xcust=2-1-2006423-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware report</a>.) All Zen 2 processors in the following processor families are affected:</p>



<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 3000 Series Processors</li>



<li>AMD Ryzen PRO 3000 Series Processors</li>



<li>AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3000 Series Processors</li>



<li>AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Processors with Radeon Graphics</li>



<li>AMD Ryzen PRO 4000 Series Processors</li>



<li>AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Processors with Radeon Graphics</li>



<li>AMD Ryzen 7020 Series Processors with Radeon Graphics</li>



<li>AMD EPYC &ldquo;Rome&rdquo; Processors</li>
</ul>



<p>Currently, AMD has released a microcode update, though details about when and how it&rsquo;ll appear in firmware updates for consumers has yet to be announced. (As told to Tom&rsquo;s Hardware, AMD says the first patches have been for EPYC server CPUs.) If you don&rsquo;t want to wait for AMD, Ormandy explains how to make <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html#:~:text=If%20you%20can%E2%80%99t%20apply%20the%20update%20for%20some%20reason%2C%20there%20is%20a%20software%20workaround%3A%20you%20can%20set%20the%20chicken%20bit%20DE_CFG%5B9%5D.&amp;xcust=2-1-2006423-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a software tweak</a> as a workaround&mdash;although its impact on performance is unknown.</p>



<p>AMD says it will release a security advisory about this vulnerability (filed as CVE-2023-20593), but until then, information about further patches&mdash;and if they will affect Zen 2 CPU performance&mdash;remains unknown at this time. So if you own a Zen 2 processor, you&rsquo;ll want to keep an eye on the news, so you&rsquo;ll know how to apply the mitigation (e.g., through Windows or BIOS update). Applying it promptly will be vital for your online security.</p>

## Pick up this back-to-school Chromebook for just under $200

<p>If you&rsquo;re shopping for a solid back-to-school deal on a Chromebook, we&rsquo;d advise you to take a close look at the Acer Chromebook 315, a 2022 model that&rsquo;s advertised at a whopping 66 percent off at Amazon.</p>



<p>Low-end Chromebook deals can be confusing, as there are often deals offered on similar devices with hardware that differs little, if at all. Some vendors will occasionally pump up the MSRP as well or even finesse the specs. This Amazon vendor has priced the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor/dp/B08LBZRVLG/&amp;xcust=2-1-2006390-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Acer Chromebook 315 (CB315-3HT</a>) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor/dp/B08LBZRVLG/&amp;xcust=2-1-2006390-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">at $205.80</a>, supposedly 66 percent off. Given that the original MSRP was $279.99, this Chromebook is probably 27 percent off instead.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;d still recommend that you take a look. This is a budget Chromebook, but the Intel Celeron N4020 inside it is a decent dual-core CPU. A 15.6-inch full HD (otherwise known as a 1080p screen) should be large and comfortable for old as well as young eyes. Including 4GB of RAM always makes us frown, but limit the number of Chrome tabs you have open and your browsing experience will be just fine. It also looks like that Google patches and support should run out in June 2027 at the earliest, so you have at least four years of supported use.</p>



<p>If supplies run out, try this alternative seller from Amazon, which was offering the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Chromebook-315-Touchscreen-Celeron-Keyboard/dp/B0C4TBGK86/&amp;xcust=2-1-2006390-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chromebook 315 for $199.99</a>, but who also appears to have replaced a 17-inch version with this alternative while leaving earlier reviews intact.</p>

## Don’t be fooled by back-to-school Chromebook trap deals

<p>While shopping for back-to-school deals, it can be easy to focus on the discounted price, ignoring all else. A recent change to Google&rsquo;s Chromebook support page meant that we briefly considered a back-to-school Chromebook deal when it was a bad bargain instead. Here&rsquo;s how to avoid making the same mistake.</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/818199/back-to-school-deals.html">back-to-school deals on Chromebooks</a> based upon what we know. Not only are we guided by our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">reviews of the best Chromebooks</a>, but we look at the specifications, the price, and advertised discount. We also double-check to see where the Chromebook appears on Google&rsquo;s list of supported Chromebooks. They&rsquo;re all important.</p>



<p>One Amazon vendor has priced the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CB315-1HT-C4RY-802-11ac-Bluetooth/dp/B08488CGYV&amp;xcust=2-1-2006308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Acer Chromebook 315 at $235</a>, 8 percent off as of this writing. That&rsquo;s not great, but the $235 price tag at least made us consider it. One check you can make is to input the URL on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.camelcamelcamel.com&amp;xcust=2-1-2006308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">camelcamelcamel</a>, an oddly-named website that professes to track prices on Amazon. It doesn&rsquo;t always work &mdash; when considering a similar <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor/dp/B08LBZRVLG/&amp;xcust=2-1-2006308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chromebook 315</a> model, for example, the vendor claimed an eye-popping discount of 66 percent, to $205.80, off of a $599 MSRP.</p>



<p>Both vendors, then, throw up some red flags. But, looking back at some historical launch information, the MSRP for the Chromebook 315 should be about $279.99. But there&rsquo;s another problem.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Chromebook 315 trap deal" class="wp-image-2006388" height="655" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Acer-Chromebook-315-not-a-good-deal.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>To its credit, the first Amazon vendor listed the $235 Chromebook 315 as model CB315-1HT-C4RY, with a Celeron N3350 inside. The $205.80 Chromebook is listed as a CB315-3HT, with a Celeron N4020 inside. It&rsquo;s not always true that a higher number equals a better processor, but in this case it&rsquo;s true: the N3350 was launched seven years ago in 2016, and Intel is phasing it out in September.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a tipoff that you should buy the $205.80 Chromebook 315, but it&rsquo;s not the real black mark against it: the support window. Google only supports Chromebooks for a limited time, and publishes the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en#zippy=%2Cacer&amp;xcust=2-1-2006308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chromebook lifecycle information</a> on its website. Once a Chromebook reaches end-of-life, Google will stop supporting it, just like an out-of-date version of Windows or an Android phone. It will work, but Google won&rsquo;t publish any updates or security patches for it. </p>



<p>We checked both the CB315-3HT and CB315-1HT-C4RY against this list. While the first model appeared, the second did not. So that&rsquo;s good, right?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Google appears to have updated its support lifecycle page, eliminating models that it apparently believes have been taken off the market. That can leave even a savvy shopper thinking<em> oh, I don&rsquo;t see it on the list, so it&rsquo;s probably fine</em>. In this case, it&rsquo;s not! Luckily, in 2020 we made a list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393324/77-chromebooks-you-shouldnt-buy-why-googles-expiration-dates-matter.html">Chromebooks expiring soon</a>, and the Chromebook 15 (CB315-1HT) appears on this list. Support for the CB315-1HT is scheduled to run out in less than a year, or June 2024.</p>



<p>While this isn&rsquo;t illegal &mdash; the vendor has every right to sell this Chromebook, which is viable and completely supported by Google for now &mdash; we think you&rsquo;d agree that it does feel a bit slimy. And if you walk away from this article thinking, <em>wow, what a mess</em> &mdash; well, welcome to our world. If you don&rsquo;t see a deal on the site, that means we&rsquo;ve generally excluded the deal for a particular reason. But you may sometimes think you&rsquo;ve found a diamond in the rough, too.</p>



<p>To recap, here&rsquo;s what you should look for in evaluating a Chromebook deal:</p>



<ol>
<li>The price and discount. Use camelcamelcamel or another site to gauge whether it&rsquo;s an actual deal, based on historical pricing.</li>



<li>Vendor name and model. Some models (especially Chromebooks) have similar names.</li>



<li>The hardware specifications. We prioritize larger, higher-resolution (1080p and above) screens, and preferably 8GB of RAM. We look for a modern CPU, but it&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker.</li>



<li>Double-check it against the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en#zippy=%2Cacer&amp;xcust=2-1-2006308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Auto Update Policy</a>, aka the support lifecycle.</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, you can simply check our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/818199/back-to-school-deals.html">back-to-school deals on Chromebooks</a>, which we try to update almost daily during the summer season. But smart shopping is a good strategy any time of the year.</p>

## Remnant II is the first PC game ‘designed with upscaling in mind’

<p>Preorders for <em>Remnant II</em>, the sequel to Souls-like shooter <em>Remnant: From the Ashes</em>, are tearing up the Steam sales charts ahead of its release tomorrow. But early access players on PC are already playing a familiar tune when it comes to recent multi-platform releases: widespread performance issues even on high-end hardware. Apparently the game is so visually complex (or so poorly optimized, take your pick) that it more or less requires upscaling, such as Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS or AMD&rsquo;s Fidelity Super Resolution, in order to run smoothly. </p>



<p>A representative from developer Gunfire Games said as much <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/156syue/technical_information_and_troubleshooting/&amp;xcust=2-2-2006067-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in a post to the official <em>Remant From the Ashes</em> subreddit</a> yesterday. &ldquo;We designed the game with upscaling in mind (DLSS/FSR/XeSS). So, if you leave the Upscaling settings as they are&hellip;you should have the smoothest gameplay.&rdquo; </p>



<p>As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-devs-says-pc-port-designed-with-upscaling-in-mind-dlss-fsr-xess-a-necessity-to-achieve-smooth-gameplay/&amp;xcust=2-2-2006067-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WCFFTech notes</a>, this information is striking a sour note with PC players. Responses in the Reddit post report that even with some top-of-the-line hardware, framerates are dipping well below the generally-accepted 60 frames per second mark. Players are complaining that technology like DLSS, which is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1498499/cyberpunk-2077-levels-up-framwerates-with-nvidia-dlss-3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">generally seen as a &ldquo;booster&rdquo; for graphics</a> that can enable smooth gameplay with high-end settings like ray tracing, is now seen as a required crutch in order to get the game to a basic level of stability and performance. Notably, the initial build of <em>Remnant II </em>does not use any ray tracing effects. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Gaming sites are reporting that even with the absolute pinnacle of PC gaming hardware, <em>Remnant II</em> struggles to run smoothly. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dsogaming.com/articles/nvidia-rtx-4090-cannot-run-remnant-2-with-60fps-at-native-4k-ultra/&amp;xcust=2-2-2006067-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">A post on DSOGaming</a> shows the game running at around 40 frames per second at 4K resolution with the ultra settings in place&hellip;on a system that includes a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</a> and an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a> processor. That absolute-top-of-the-line hardware setup should absolutely slay any current-gen game, but in order to break past the 60fps mark, DLSS has to be enabled.  </p>



<p>Gamers are worried about the precedent being set. Despite the visual splendor and performance boost offered by upscaling tech, it&rsquo;s not ideal for multiplayer competitive games, where lag needs to be kept to an absolute minimum. Hardware-based upscaling is also a relatively new feature, so games relying on it might leave those with older systems forced to upgrade or skip the most visually demanding titles. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/156syue/technical_information_and_troubleshooting/jt2a5yc/&amp;xcust=2-2-2006067-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As one Reddit user puts it</a>, &ldquo;If DLSS is going to become bread and butter baseline optimization, we&rsquo;ve got a serious problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Switching to a solid-state drive is the best upgrade you can make for your PC. These wondrous devices speed up boot times, improve the responsiveness of your programs and games, and generally make your computer feel fast. But not all solid-state drives are the same. You can spend big to achieve read and write speeds that reach a whole other level, or you can find top-notch SSDs that offer solid performance <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/785331/why-you-dont-need-to-splurge-on-an-ultra-fast-ssd.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">without breaking the bank</a>.</p>



<p>Many SSDs come in a 2.5-inch form factor and connect to your PC via the same SATA port used by a traditional hard drive. But tiny NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) &ldquo;gumstick&rdquo; SSDs that fit in an M.2 connection on a modern motherboard are becoming increasingly common, along with blazing-fast PCIe 4.0 solid-state drives for compatible PCs, and you&rsquo;ll even find SSDs that sit on a PCIe adapter and slot into your motherboard like a graphics card or sound card. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3605356/what-type-of-ssd-should-you-buy.html">Picking the perfect SSD</a> isn&rsquo;t as simple as it used to be, though excellent drives like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/703496/sk-hynix-platinum-p41-nvme-ssd-review-the-pursuit-of-affordable-speed.html">SK Hynix Platinum P41</a> are certainly trying to achieve no-brainer upgrade status.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the purpose of this guide. We&rsquo;ve tested numerous drives to find the best SSDs for any use case, and offer our top picks below. In addition to that we give you useful information on what to look for in an SSD so you can be a more knowledgable shopper. Quick note: This roundup only covers internal solid-state drives. Check out PCWorld&rsquo;s guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198109/storage/best-external-drives.html">the best external drives</a> if you&rsquo;re looking for a portable storage solution, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626738/samsung-t7-shield-ssd-review-fast-ruggedized-10gbps-usb-storage.html">Samsung T7 Shield</a>&mdash;our newly crowned pick for the best high-performance portable SSD.</p>



<p><em><strong><em><strong>Updated 07/24/2023:</strong> </em></strong>We&rsquo;ve added the WD Blue SN580 SSD as our new choice for best budget option. Read more about this fantastically affordable SSD with super-fast real-world transfers in our summary below.</em></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to add some storage via a traditional 2.5-inch SATA drive rather than a tiny M.2 &ldquo;gumstick,&rdquo; Samsung&rsquo;s spectacular 870 EVO is your best bet. It&rsquo;s the fastest SATA SSD we&rsquo;ve tested, it&rsquo;s available in up to 4TB of capacity, and it&rsquo;s exceedingly affordable given its speed. Enough said, really&mdash;though Samsung&rsquo;s killer Magician SSD management software and long warranty period also deserve a shout-out. The EVO series is a legend among SSDs for a reason.</p>

<p>That said, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398103/sk-hynix-gold-s31-review-a-great-sata-ssd-from-the-largest-vendor-youve-likely-never-heard-of.html">SK Hynix Gold S31</a> is also worth considering. It&rsquo;s just a hair behind the 870 EVO in benchmarks and costs $12 less in its 1TB version, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B07SL9WBCR&amp;xcust=2-1-407542-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">at $98</a>. The SK drive is <em>only</em> available in a 1TB flavor these days, however, while the 870 EVO ranges from a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B08QBN5J9B&amp;xcust=2-1-407542-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">250GB model for $60</a> all the way up to a massive <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B08QBL36GF?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-407542-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">4TB goliath for $450</a>.

<p>The Samsung 870 EVO offers an intoxicating blend of performance and affordable pricing, but if you want as much capacity as possible for as cheaply as possible, consider the Crucial BX500. You can get its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B07YD579WM?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-407542-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1TB model for $41.99</a>, a whopping $50+ less than the equivalent EVO, while a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B07G3KGYZQ?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-407542-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">480GB version costs just $24.99</a>. 240GB and 2TB versions are also available.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We recommend this QLC drive in the larger capacities for those who want good everyday performance for a budget price,&rdquo; we said in our review. &ldquo;The smaller capacities will likely run into more slowdowns during heavy writes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure, PCIe 4.0 SSDs scream during big file transfers, but if you&rsquo;re still using an older system with PCIe 3.0, upgrading to an NVMe SSD still provides substantial benefits to your PC&rsquo;s speed and overall responsiveness. Better yet, you don&rsquo;t need to break the bank to take advantage. The Crucial P3 is a very good daily performer, but it&rsquo;s available for a bargain rate of just $44 for a 500GB model or $84 for a 1TB model. Though it doesn&rsquo;t have top-tier PCIe 4 performance and the TBW rating is pretty low, the P3 does have excellent real-world write times and unless you really stress the drive you shouldn&rsquo;t notice much of a difference anyhow.</p>

<p>All told, this drive is an outstanding choice for anyone looking to snag a solid everyday SSD at a great price.</p>

<p>The WD Black SN850X is one of the fastest drives we have ever tested and ranks right up at the top next to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394957/seagate-firecuda-530-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FireCuda 530</a> in terms of speed. The reason that the WD Black SN850X takes our top spot for PCIe 4.0 is that it offers the same great speed for a slightly lower price, meaning better value for your money. </p>

<p>Also, in terms of overall performance, the SN850X is not only fast, but it provides outstanding real world transfer rates and top-notch random write performance. This is one of the best SSDs on the market, and holds its own at the top despite stiff competition from a crowded field of competitors.</p>

<p>Cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 SSDs aren&rsquo;t quite as cheap as SATA or PCIe 3.0 NVMe drives, but now that the technology is becoming more established, we&rsquo;re starting to see several models available at compelling prices. The best of the affordable bunch? The WD Blue SN580 NVMe SSD&mdash;and by quite a large margin. At just $50 for a 1TB model, you won&rsquo;t likely find any PCIe 4.0 drives with storage that cheap. In our testing, the SN580 turned out both stellar benchmark and real-world results. It did slow down considerably in the large 450GB transfer test, but seeing as how it&rsquo;s unlikely anyone will write that much contiguous data it likely doesn&rsquo;t matter. In the end, the SN580 is a wonderfully high-performing PCIe 4.0 SSD that well undercuts the cost of competitors. At this price point it simply can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>

<p>PCIe 5.0 is finally here and for those who crave the latest and greatest, the upgrade will help satisfy your desire to be on the bleeding edge. If you do decide to upgrade, there is currently no better PCIe 5.0 SSD than the Crucial T700. It is, without a doubt, the fastest NVMe SSD for sustained throughput that we at PCWorld have ever tested. In our testing, the Crucial T700 absolutely obliterated the competition in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Just to give an idea of how fast we&rsquo;re talking here, in a side-by-side comparison with the WD Black SN850X, our pick for best PCIe 4.0 SSD, the T700 almost doubled it in sequential read and write benchmarks and was over a minute faster in the 48GB transfer test and about 40 seconds faster in the 450GB transfer tests. Those are pretty insane numbers.</p>

<p>The drive itself is available in 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB capacities of storage. This kind of speed will cost you though, as the T700 is nearly twice as expensive as some very good PCIe 4.0 drives on this list. Still, the T700 is undoubtedly the king of the hill by a fair margin among any SSD currently, and if your system is equipped to handle it, you&rsquo;re not likely to find a faster drive for quite some time.</p>

<p>No SSD we&rsquo;ve seen can match Adata&rsquo;s Elite SE880 for portability. Indeed, measuring in at only 2.55 inches long, 1.38 inches wide, and 0.48 inches thick, it reminds you more of a USB thumb drive than a standard SSD. It weighs a mere 1.1 ounces to boot, virtually disappearing when placed in your pocket. </p>

<p>The Elite SE880 is also very fast at everyday tasks. In real-world 48GB transfer tests, the drive displayed outstanding marks. However, it did lose significant ground in the longer contiguous write tests meaning photo and video pros with large files might want to look at other options. Considering the respectable transfer rates and the small form factor, the Elite SE880 is a great pick for those looking to take their SSD on the go.</p>

<p>Samsung&rsquo;s upgraded 4TB capacity T7 Shield maintains all of the speed and durability of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626738/samsung-t7-shield-ssd-review-fast-ruggedized-10gbps-usb-storage.html">previous 1TB and 2TB versions</a>, but now with double the capacity. The Shield models make excellent performance drives for out in the field because they focus on physical protection, with IP65 ratings against particulate matter and water spray.</p>

<p>While the 4TB model is a bit pricey, it is more than capable of handling the largest end-user data sets. But if you don&rsquo;t need so much storage, you can opt for either the 1TB or 2TB versions which retail for more budget-friendly prices. Regardless of the size, all T7 Shields boast USB 3.2 10Gbps implementation allowing for blistering 10Gbps transfer speeds, which gives it the edge over many other external drives, and the superior durability means it should last you well into the future.</p>

<p>In the past, you were out of luck if you wanted to upgrade your storage in a smaller-sized device such as a handheld gaming console where the longer 2280 NVMe SSDs wouldn&rsquo;t fit. Thankfully, Sabrent has changed that with its line of Rocket half-sized 2230 small for- factor SSDs. Its latest Rocket Q4 is our favorite, with up to 2TB of capacity and shockingly good real-world performance. It&rsquo;s only 30mm long, which means you can use it in small devices such as the red-hot Steam Deck. This HMB (Host Memory Buffer) drive has great everyday performance and a decent capacity-to-cost. In our testing it aced the 48GB and 450GB transfer tests&mdash;even beating out other top-notch full-sized PCIe 4.0 drives. The Rocket Q4 is a great SSD, but if your device is able to handle the longer 2280 drives, you&rsquo;ll likely have more options to choose from and might be able to find better price-for-performance at that standard size. Regardless, the Sabrent Rocket expertly fits a niche that is only growing more common with devices such as the Steam Deck. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a die-hard <em>Star Wars</em> fan, then we have the perfect SSD for you. Seagate recently released a series of two Mandalorian-themed SSDs&mdash;the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/793473/seagate-beskar-ingot-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Beskar Ingot SATA SSD</a> and the Beskar Ingot NVMe SSD. And while both SSDs are excellent options for any budding bounty hunter, we chose the Beskar Ingot NVMe SSD due to its exceptional performance and blazing-fast speeds.</p>

<p>If you think it&rsquo;s just a middle-of-the-road NVMe with a hefty Beskar-themed heatsink, then much to learn you still have, young padawan. The FireCuda 530 is one of the fastest NVMe drives we&rsquo;ve ever tested and very well could compete against the Millenium Falcon in the Kessel run.</p>

<p>All of that being said, this is a top-notch drive perfect for the <em>Star Wars</em> fan with a windowed case who wants to show off their latest Beskar metal bounty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nvme-ssd-setup-what-you-need-to-know">NVMe SSD setup: What you need to know</h2>



<p>Be aware of what NVMe drives deliver before you buy in. Standard SATA SSDs already supercharge boot times and loading times for PCs, and for a whole lot cheaper. You&rsquo;ll get the most use from NVMe drives, be it in a M.2 form factor like the Samsung 980 Pro or a PCIe drive, if you routinely transfer data, especially in large amounts. If you don&rsquo;t do that, NVMe drives aren&rsquo;t worth the price premium.</p>

<p>If you decide to buy an NVMe SSD, make sure your PC can handle it. This is a relatively new technology, so you&rsquo;ll only be able to find M.2-connection motherboards from the past few years. Think <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3176907/components-processors/ryzen-cpus-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amds-disruptive-multicore-chips.html">AMD Ryzen</a> and mainstream Intel chips from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955293/hardware/skylake-review-intels-6th-gen-cpu-arrives-with-nice-presents-for-gamers-and-enthusiasts.html">the 6th-generation era</a> onward, for the most part. NVMe SSDs that were mounted on PCIe adapters were popular in the technology&rsquo;s early years, before M.2 adoption spread, but they&rsquo;re rarer now. Make sure you&rsquo;re actually&nbsp;able to use an NVMe SSD before you buy one, and be aware that you&rsquo;ll need four PCIe lanes available in order to use it to its full potential. You&rsquo;ll need a newer Ryzen 3000- or 5000-series CPU, or an Intel 11th- or 12th-gen CPU, to run a PCIe 4.0 SSD to its full potential. PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs will work in a PCIe 3.0 computer, but at slower PCIe 3.0 speeds.</p>

<p>To get the most out of an NVMe drive, you want to run your operating system on it, so you must have a system that recognizes the drive and can boot from it. PCs purchased during the past year or two should have no problem booting from an NVMe drive, but support for that can be iffy in older motherboards. Do a Google search for your motherboard and see if it supports booting from NVMe. You may need to install a BIOS update for your board. If your hardware can&rsquo;t boot from an NVMe SSD, your machine should still be able to use it as a secondary drive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-an-ssd">What to look for in an SSD</h2>



<p>Capacity and price are important, of course, and a long warranty can alleviate fears of premature data death. Most SSD manufacturers offer a three-year warranty, and some nicer models are guaranteed for five years. But unlike the olden days of SSDs, modern drives won&rsquo;t wear out with normal consumer usage, as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-SSD-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead&amp;xcust=2-1-407542-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tech Report</a> tested and proved years ago with a grueling endurance test.</p>



<p>The biggest thing to watch out for is the technology used to connect the SSD to your PC. We go into deeper details and buying advice in our guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3605356/what-type-of-ssd-should-you-buy.html">which type of SSD you should buy</a>.</p>



<ol class="productChart">
<li><strong>SATA</strong>: This refers to both the connection type and the transfer protocol, which is used to connect most 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard drives and SSDs to your PC. SATA III speeds can hit roughly 600MBps, and most&mdash;but not all&mdash;modern drives max it out. (More on that in the next section.)</li>



<li><strong>PCIe</strong>: This interface taps into four of your computer&rsquo;s PCIe lanes to blow away SATA speeds, to the tune of nearly 4GBps over PCIe gen 3. Those sort of face-melting speeds pair nicely with supercharged NVMe drives. Both the PCIe lanes in your motherboard and the M.2 slot in your motherboard can be wired to support the PCIe interface, and you can buy adapters that allow you to slot &ldquo;gumstick&rdquo; M.2 drives into a PCIe lane. PCIe 4.0 drives are significantly faster, but require an AMD Ryzen 3000-series or Intel Core 11th-gen (or newer) processor, along with a compatible PCIe 4.0 motherboard.</li>



<li><strong>NVMe</strong>: Non-Volatile Memory Express technology takes advantage of PCIe&rsquo;s bountiful bandwidth to create blisteringly fast SSDs that blow SATA-based drives out of the water. Check out PCWorld&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2899351/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvme.html">Everything you need to know about NVMe</a>&rdquo; for a nitty-gritty deep-dive.</li>



<li><strong>M.2</strong>: This is where things get tricky. Many people assume M.2 drives all use NVMe technology and PCIe speeds, but that&rsquo;s not true. M.2 is just a form factor. Sure, <em>most</em> M.2 SSDs use NVMe, but some still stick to SATA. Do your homework. Many modern Ultrabooks rely on M.2 for storage.</li>



<li><strong>U.2 and mSATA</strong>: You may also stumble across mSATA and U.2 SSDs, but both motherboard support and product availability are rare for those formats. Some older Ultrabooks included mSATA before M.2 became popular, and drives are still available if you need them.</li>
</ol>



<p>Speed matters, of course, but as we said most modern SSDs saturate the SATA III interface. Not all of them, though.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ssds-vs-hard-drives">SSDs vs. hard drives</h2>



<p>Do you need an SSD? &ldquo;Need&rdquo; is a strong word, but we heartily recommend that everyone upgrade to an SSD. Solid-state drive speeds blow even the fastest mechanical hard drives out of the water. Simply swapping out the hard drive in your old laptop or desktop for an SSD can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2948985/storage/an-ssd-upgrade-is-still-the-single-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-pc.html" rel="noopener">make it feel like a whole new system</a>&mdash;and a blazing-fast one at that. Buying an SSD is easily the best upgrade you can make for a computer.</p>



<p>SSDs cost more per gigabyte than mechanical hard drives, though, and thus aren&rsquo;t often available in ultra-high capacities. If you want speed <em>and </em>storage space, you can buy an SSD with limited space and use it as your boot drive, then set up a traditional hard drive as secondary storage in your PC. Place your programs on your boot drive, stash your media and other files on the hard drive, and you&rsquo;re ready to have your cake and eat it too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-ssds">How we test SSDs</h2>



<p>We test SSDs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks (such as CrystalDiskMark 6&rsquo;s various tests) and real-world tests, including 48GB transfers that showcase how a drive performs in common tasks, and a grueling 450GB transfer test that pushes an SSD&rsquo;s cache performance to the brink. </p>



<p>The PCIe 3 tests utilized Windows 10 64-bit running on a Core i7-5820K/Asus X99 Deluxe system with four 16GB Kingston 2666MHz DDR4 modules, a Zotac (Nvidia) GT 710 1GB x2 PCIe graphics card, and an Asmedia ASM2142 USB 3.1 card. It also contains a Gigabyte GC-Alpine Thunderbolt 3 card, and Softperfect Ramdisk 3.4.6 for the 48GB read and write tests.</p>



<p>The PCIe 4 testing was done on an MSI MEG X570 motherboard socketing an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-core CPU, using the same Kingston DRAM, cards, and software. All testing is performed on an empty, or nearly empty drive. Performance will decrease as the drive fills up.</p>

## Outlook for Windows will replace Mail starting in August

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft Outlook is synonymous with email and calendar functions, to the point that a lot of people don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s actually a paid portion of the Office suite. But that&rsquo;s about to change. Beginning in August, Microsoft is planning on phasing out the existing, free Windows Mail and Windows Calendar apps included in Windows 10 and 11, and replacing them with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1961053/email-and-calendar-replaced-by-new-outlook-in-windows-11.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the new Outlook for Windows</a>. The new app, which has been available for months on the Windows Insider upgrade channel, is also free. </p>



<p>The transition will be complete at the beginning of the 2024 calendar year, at which point the existing Mail and Calendar apps will no longer be available. Users will be able to downgrade from Outlook for Windows to Windows Mail and Calendar in the interim, but there&rsquo;s little point. By the end of the year users will be &ldquo;force-migrated,&rdquo; according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-force-migrating-windows-mail-and-calendar-apps-to-outlook-app-in-august/&amp;xcust=2-1-2005935-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">BleepingComputer</a>. Newly sold Windows 11 laptops and desktops will be pre-loaded with the new Outlook program. </p>



<p>The new Outlook for Windows is not to be confused with the version of Outlook included in Microsoft Office and Office 365, which offers more premium features. But that might be tricky, since Outlook for Windows is visually extremely similar to the Outlook web app, which in turn is fairly analogous to popular web-based email services like Gmail. Microsoft has slowly been adding essential features to the new Outlook app, like support for popular third-party mail services, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702533/you-can-officially-try-out-microsofts-new-outlook-client-right-now.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">since its introduction in mid-2022</a>. </p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s ChatGPT-powered Bing AI chatbot generated lots of hype over the last few months, but only worked in Microsoft&rsquo;s own Edge browser &mdash; until now.</p>

Your chat prompts can only be 2,000 characters long in Chrome, and conversations with the chatbot are limited to five messages before the session resets.</p>



<p>In Microsoft&rsquo;s Edge browser, prompts can be up to 4,000 characters long, and you can exchange 30 messages with Bing before the conversation is reset. As part of this update, the Edge version of Bing Chat has also been given a dark mode, another feature you can&rsquo;t use on Chrome yet.</p>

## How to hide Windows 11’s power button

<p>To prevent users from simply shutting down your computer, Windows 11 lets you remove the power button from the Start menu. It&rsquo;s not obvious, however; doing so requires a small change to the registry, rather than toggling an option in the normal Windows Settings. </p>



<p>Type <strong>regedit</strong> into the Windows 11 search field and click on the &ldquo;Registry Editor&rdquo; option that appears. In the registry editor, follow the path &ldquo;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Start\HidePowerButton&rdquo;. In the HidePowerButton folder you&rsquo;ll find the entry &ldquo;value&rdquo;. Double-click on it and set its value to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Then restart Windows. </p>



<p>Boom! The power button has now disappeared from the Start menu. You can still shut down the operating system by looking for the power options when you use the key combinations Alt-F4 or Ctrl-Alt-Del. Windows also has a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1956601/windows-10-11-has-a-hidden-emergency-restart-function-how-to-activate-it.html">secret emergency restart button</a>.</p>

## RIP blue bird: Twitter rebrands as ‘X’

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>In a continuing effort to exit from a revenue death spiral, Twitter replaced its iconic blue and white bird logo with a simple &ldquo;X&rdquo; early Monday morning. The change follows a series of seemingly off-the-cuff tweets from Elon Musk, the bombastic billionaire who was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693424/elon-musk-buys-twitter-for-44-billion.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">forced to buy the social media site last November</a>. According to Musk&rsquo;s tweets and internal communications to Twitter employees, this is not a temporary change: The bird imagery and Twitter domain will be de-emphasized, if not abandoned entirely, in the near future. The X.com domain now redirects to Twitter.</p>



<p>Twitter has used its bird imagery since the company&rsquo;s founding in 2006, and the previous blue bird logo was adopted in 2012. According to Twitter&rsquo;s current CEO Linda Yaccarino, whom Musk designated as his replacement weeks ago (while still owning the now-private company), the new logo and name reflect a new and broader scope for the company. &ldquo;X will be the platform that can deliver, well&hellip;everything,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213997183574017&amp;xcust=2-1-2005729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">she said in a tweet</a> (or possibly an X?) on Sunday evening. </p>



<p>This language mirrors previous indications from Musk that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/22/elon-musk-wants-to-build-an-everything-app-heres-how-the-worlds-most-popular-one-works/?sh=4445864a4a20&amp;xcust=2-1-2005729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he wants Twitter to become an &ldquo;everything app,&rdquo;</a> a broad idea for a service that can handle such diverse tasks as instant messaging, ride-sharing, gaming, and perhaps most importantly, mobile payments and money transfers. This would mirror Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of an earlier version of PayPal more than 20 years ago, which he merged with his now-shuttered online banking service X.com, where the &ldquo;X&rdquo; branding appears to originate. Market analysts suspect that Musk is trying to emulate the success of the WeChat social platform, which has been attempted and failed by many outside its home territory of China. </p>



<p>Abandoning the Twitter name, logo, and brand is a move charitably described as &ldquo;unconventional.&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s true that companies like Facebook and Google have broadened their diverse interests into &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; parent companies (Meta and Alphabet, respectively), in both cases they have kept their core branding intact, and don&rsquo;t use the new company name in places where the original brand still has value. </p>



<p>Despite failing to turn a profit in its nearly two decades of operation, Twitter&rsquo;s former popularity with social media users and celebrities, eventually spreading to the world&rsquo;s biggest brands and even political leaders, has made it a literal household name. When superheroes use Twitter in multi-billion-dollar movies, blurring the lines between the real and fictional worlds, your brand has reached a level of zeitgeist that marketers spend tens of billions of dollars to achieve. Musk appears to have abandoned that branding in favor of a name for an online bank that became obsolete before many of Twitter&rsquo;s most active users were even born. </p>



<p>The rebrand follows a series of baffling decisions that have left Twitter (or indeed, X) worth only a fraction of its value from less than a year ago. Relaxed user and post moderation has made the service <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-04-27/hate-speech-twitter-surged-since-elon-musk-takeover&amp;xcust=2-1-2005729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lightning rod for posts promoting hatred and violence</a>, putting swaths of essential features behind the Twitter Blue paywall has tanked engagement and made it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1981658/meta-threads-how-to-get-started.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">vulnerable to new competitors</a>, and deliberately restricting API access to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479844/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-apps.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">kill off third-party mobile apps</a> has alienated the service&rsquo;s former power users. As of May the service&rsquo;s ad sales (which make up the vast majority of its income) had <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/twitter-ad-sales-musk.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2005729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dropped by nearly 60 precent</a>. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for the ultimate gaming experience, you better stick around. AntOnline&rsquo;s Ebay storefront is currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/295670937437&amp;xcust=2-1-2005659-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HP Omen gaming laptop for $1,799.99</a>, which is a whopping $600 off of the original $2,399.99 price. That&rsquo;s absolutely bananas, especially given the powerful hardware inside. This machine has an RTX 4080 GPU as well as a spacious 240Hz display. Plus, AntOnline has a positive feedback score of 99 percent &mdash; expected for the Ebay arm of a large, popular retailer. Better yet, according to previous buyers, delivery is quite fast.  </p>



<p>The HP Omen features an Intel Core i7-13700HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s an imposing amount of power right there. This machine is more than capable of flying through even the most intensive titles on the High or Ultra graphics preset, especially if your game supports Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted DLSS technology. The display, which is a spacious 17.3-inches, has a resolution of 2560&times;1440 and a refresh rate of 240Hz. That means visuals should be luscious and smooth. </p>



<p>This is a jaw-droppingly good deal. You simply don&rsquo;t see RTX 4080 laptops going this very very often. Don&rsquo;t miss out!</p>

Admittedly, it&rsquo;s expensive, but it could have the ability to save you a lot of pain, which as any sufferer will tell you is worth every penny.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<p>For those who suffer with RSI, arthritis or general hand pain, ergonomic accessories can be a lifesaver. There are plenty of dedicated keyboards around, with split or angled keys, but most mice you see are weird shapes that alter how you hold and interact with the device. Contour has a different and novel approach.</p>



<p>Its SliderMouse Pro acts as a highly maneuverable bar across the top of a wrist-rest. So, does this method help or hinder? I put it to the test to find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393679/best-wireless-mouse.html">Our wireless mouse roundup includes ergonomic options</a></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="design-build">Design &amp; Build</h2>



<ul>
<li>Comfortable design</li>



<li>Connect via wired or wireless</li>



<li>Risers needed for low-profile keyboards&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>At first glance, you&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that this is a pretty standard wrist-rest. The SliderMouse Pro has a wide, curved surface for precisely that function, with just the top area giving away its actual purpose. </p>



<p>The rest area is covered in what looks like fabric, but once you touch it you realize it&rsquo;s a textured rubber top, which is also padded to make it comfortable when typing for long sessions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The real artistry is the row above the wrist rest which houses the &lsquo;mouse&rsquo; mechanism</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overhead shot of the SliderMouse Pro" class="wp-image-1991329" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SliderMouse-Pro-Review-DEVICE.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Martyn Casserly</p></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s an offset section along the upper edge of the rest area that&rsquo;s home to a scroll wheel, much like you&rsquo;d find in the middle of a mouse (albeit much wider). This is surrounded by five programmable buttons that can be used to trigger typical mouse commands and the wheel itself can be clicked to open a link in a new tab. </p>



<p>The real artistry is the row above the wrist rest which houses the &lsquo;mouse&rsquo; mechanism, not just another scroll wheel. Here you&rsquo;ll find the Sliderbar section that can be slid vertically and horizontally to move the cursor as you would with a standard mouse. It contains a few horizontal lines to give some grip and it all moves freely. </p>



<p>There is a little noise where it sounds like the material is slightly dragging on the Sliderbar at times, but this doesn&rsquo;t translate into anything you can feel or affect the movement of the cursor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A little button on the left side panel lets you adjust the sensitivity of the cursor and the setting is illustrated by a column of five lights just above the button. Connecting it to your computer is done in one of three ways: wired, USB dongle or Bluetooth. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Side Panel of the SliderMouse Pro" class="wp-image-1991324" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SliderMouse-Pro-Review-SENSITIVITY.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Martyn Casserly</p></div>



<p>A cable comes in the box (USB-C to USB-A), plus there is an included USB dongle and a converter that allows you to plug in a longer USB cable. Contour states that a fully charged battery will give you three months of normal use, so you won&rsquo;t need to bring the power lead with you if you&rsquo;re out and about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company also throws in a couple of adjustable plastic keyboard risers that you can put under your keyboard to lift it up. These are necessary, as the edge of the SliderMouse Pro sits quite high if you use a low-profile keyboard (such as the Apple keyboard). The risers work ok but don&rsquo;t feel that stable unless you find the perfect placement. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re using a taller keyboard, like a typical mechanical one, then the SliderMouse Pro actually sits at a good height already.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="How the SliderMouse Pro sits next to a keyboard" class="wp-image-1991327" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SliderMouse-Pro-Review-SIDE-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Martyn Casserly</p></div>



<p>Contour offers the Slidermouse Pro in two colors, light grey and dark grey, and it also states that you can swap the covers out for others that attach by magnets, including a rather fetching wooden one. I have to admit I couldn&rsquo;t find the covers on the website, so they may be currently unavailable. This could have changed by the time you read this. If you don&rsquo;t want the large wrist rest section, then there is the Slidermouse Pro Slim, which reduces the space taken up on the desk by getting rid of the flatter part of the rest. Alternatively, there&rsquo;s also the Slidermouse Pro Extended, which adds an extra section on the right side of the frame to give you even more room.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="features-performance">Features &amp; Performance</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fast and accurate Sliderbar</li>



<li>Six programmable buttons</li>



<li>Probably better suited to right-handed people</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the main advantages the SliderMouse Pro has for those with hand problems is that you don&rsquo;t have to position one hand off to the side as you would with a standard mouse. It acts more like a laptop would, with the controls directly beneath the keyboard. </p>



<p>The Sliderbar sits nicely under the thumbs and has very little friction, making it easy to manipulate. It does take a little while to get used to it, but once you&rsquo;ve adjusted to the ergonomic design it&rsquo;s a nice way to control the cursor. I think, being left-handed, that it&rsquo;s better suited to right-handed people, as the offset position of the Sliderbar means that the right thumb has a lot more room to move.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="How the SliderMouse Pro sits under a keyboard" class="wp-image-1991328" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SliderMouse-Pro-Review-KEYBOARD.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Martyn Casserly</p></div>



<p>The Sliderbar is also clickable, so you can make choices without moving your typing position. One thing you can&rsquo;t easily do with the bar is drag a page up or down or do the same for list options. These are best handled via the scroll wheel instead. Again, this takes a bit of getting your head around, but due to the reachable location of the wheel it soon becomes second nature. </p>



<p>You can also avail yourself of the buttons around the wheel while you&rsquo;re there, giving you pretty much all the controls you&rsquo;d get with a standard mouse. Downloading the accompanying drivers (for macOS or Windows) allows you to configure the buttons to do what you want, which is helpful. You do miss out on the gestures that you may be very attached to if you&rsquo;re a regular macOS user. This does take some adjustment, but there are key combinations that can achieve most of the quick navigation controls that you lose. </p>



<p>Having copy and paste on dedicated buttons is a nice shortcut which can reduce the number of button presses you need to do, which again is beneficial for stopping hands from getting fatigued.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Control buttons on SliderMouse Pro" class="wp-image-1991326" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SliderMouse-Pro-Review-Buttons.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Martyn Casserly</p></div>



<p>I did see some inconsistencies with the buttons, in that the copy/paste function worked happily in Microsoft Word but not Google Docs, so hopefully Contour will be able to fix this with an update. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a really solid and impressive way of navigating your desktop.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="price-availability">Price &amp; Availability</h2>



<p>As with most ergonomic accessories, the prices are higher than a standard, mass-produced model. Contour sells the SliderMouse Pro (wired) for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://contourdesign.com/collections/slidermouse/products/slidermouse-pro-dark-grey-regular#Specifications&amp;xcust=2-1-2002658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$259</a>/<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://contour-design.co.uk/collections/centred-mice/products/slidermouse-pro#product-text-description&amp;xcust=2-1-2002658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&pound;274</a> while the wireless version bumps that to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://contourdesign.com/collections/slidermouse/products/slidermouse-pro-dark-grey-regular#Specifications&amp;xcust=2-1-2002658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$274</a>/<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://contour-design.co.uk/products/slidermouse-pro#product-text-description&amp;xcust=2-1-2002658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&pound;289</a>. You can also buy it from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Contour-SliderMouse-Ergonomic-Bluetooth-Programmable/dp/B0BLMMFBF3&amp;xcust=2-1-2002658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon UK</a>.</p>



<p>This is expensive when compared to ergonomic mice like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005447.html?irclickid=TGXQ6v202xyPRh5Vylw%3A0xWXUkFzXy1ZnRpV2E0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-2002658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Logitech MX Vertical</a> (which costs $99/&pound;109.00) or the budget <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa7852%3Fvariant%3D37438089461910%26discount%3DWS7DNE8HCV&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-2002658-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Anker 2.4G Ergonomic mouse</a> ($25/&pound;30), but they still have the same problem of placing your hand and wrist to the side of the keyboard and requiring you to keep changing your position. </p>



<p>The SliderMouse Pro is a different category of device, bringing with it the cost of that exclusivity and comfort. See our chart of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html">best wireless keyboards</a> for more options.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>I have to admit I was a little sceptical of the design when I first saw it, but after only a few hours it began to really grow on me. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve long suffered with arthritis and RSI which means I haven&rsquo;t been able to use a regular mouse for over a decade. The SliderMouse Pro makes a comfortable change from trackpads that can leave my hands aching after a while. </p>



<p>The ergonomic layout, mixed with the responsive Sliderbar and multitude of buttons, allowed me to tailor the commands to those I use most, lessening the impact on my hands and joints that would normally occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to already suffer from pains in your hands to use the SliderMouse Pro, either. In fact, it might actually help prevent those conditions from ever appearing. Yes, it&rsquo;s an expensive amount to spend on a mouse, but if you use a computer everyday, then it could well pay for itself many times over if it keeps your hands healthy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never easy to decide what to pack for a trip. Whether you&rsquo;re packing light for a quick business trip or heading out on the next big family vacation, it&rsquo;s important to bring the right tech. Here at PCWorld we&rsquo;re continually testing the latest gadgets to sort the good from the bad. This means we&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to find the best tech gear and accessories specifically for travel. </p>



<p>From voltage converters to nose-cancelling headphones, we&rsquo;ve curated a list of the very best gear to optimize your next travel experience. The items below are worthy of any packing list and will help you prepare for anything you may encounter on the road&mdash;or in the sky.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Manage electrical needs with a voltage converter</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SOKOO 230-Watt Step Down 100-220V to 110V Voltage Converter</strong></h4>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sokoo Voltage Converter" class="wp-image-2000831" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/615jV64oX5L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1054" width="1054" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sokoo</p></div>



<p>Something that&rsquo;s easy to forget when traveling to other countries is that their electrical outlets may not support your devices. This is either because of a different outlet orientation or different voltage rating. To make sure you&rsquo;re always prepared no matter where you travel, grab a converter such as the SOKOO Step Down Voltage Converter. Not only does it come with a variety of plug orientations and voltage conversion, but it also has ports for USB and USB-C.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like most travelers, you bring multiple electronics to make the most of your experience&mdash;we&rsquo;re talking cameras, phones, laptops, headphones, etc. But along with all of these items, you&rsquo;ll need to carry all of their charging cables. That can take up space and lead to a tangled web of cables in your bag if you&rsquo;re not careful. With the Rolling Square inCharge 6 Portable Charger Cable, you have the option of USB-C or USB-A inputs and Micro USB or USB-C outputs all in a cable that is small enough for your keychain.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You arrive at your destination and you&rsquo;re waiting for your checked bag to show up on the carousel, but it never does. Baggage handling is at it again. With a Bluetooth tracker you can easily keep tabs on where your bag is and maybe even help TSA locate it, should it be lost. The two best Bluetooth trackers on the market are the Apple AirTag or the Tile Pro. Go with the Apple AirTag if you have an iPhone or the Tile Pro if you have an Android device.</p>

<p>Flying on an airplane is loud. Engines roar, babies cry, passengers snore. That&rsquo;s why you <em>need </em>noise canceling headphones, which have become essential tools in making your flight as easy as possible.

<p>Sure, you could bring a giant SLR camera with multiple lenses and an extra special carry-on bag to store everything. Or for those who aren&rsquo;t professionals, you can opt for a small, retro instant camera such as the Fuji Instax Mini 12. Just like an old-school Polaroid, you can take a picture and instantly print it out to capture the moment. Just be aware that you&rsquo;ll need to purchase and carry the film separately.</p>

There are quite a few services nowadays offering pocket WiFi for travelers, but Solis is one of the best with reliable global coverage across 135 countries. Plus, it has flexible plans depending upon your needs. You&rsquo;ll need to purchase the Solis Lite Mobile Hotspot before registering for a WiFi plan, but it&rsquo;s only a one time fee and you can then use it on all of your future trips.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re traveling to a new country for the first time or just out camping, you should always have access to clean, potable water. You might not know if the tap water in the country you&rsquo;re in is safe to drink or not. So instead of trying to figure out the answer, or worse just drinking it anyways, take a self-cleaning water bottle like CrazyCap with you and never bother again. In just 60 seconds, or 2 minutes for full purification, the CrazyCap uses UV rays in the cap to purify your water to 99.9996%. Plus, it&rsquo;s double-wall vacuum insulated meaning your drinks will stay hot or cold for most of the day.</p>

</div>


<p>LG&rsquo;s Gram laptop line is known for its low weight and slim design, but it seems the company&rsquo;s engineers felt they could do better. The result is the LG Gram SuperSlim, a 15.6-inch laptop that&rsquo;s no more than .49 inches thick and weighs a mere 2.18 pounds. It&rsquo;s the thinnest, lightest 15.6-inch laptop sold right now, but prioritizing portability over performance isn&rsquo;t for everyone. Read on to learn more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-specs-and-features">LG Gram SuperSlim: Specs and features</h2>



<p>LG&rsquo;s Gram SuperSlim isn&rsquo;t a spec sheet superstar. It packs an Intel Core i7-1360P and sticks with Intel integrated graphics, which is bad news for anyone looking to play PC games or use a GPU to accelerate productivity. The 1080p OLED display also merely whelms, though it does perform well in real-world use.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-1360P</li>



<li>Memory: 32GB LPDDR5</li>



<li>Graphics/GPU: Intel Iris Xe</li>



<li>Display: 15.6-inch 1080p 60Hz OLED</li>



<li>Storage: 2TB PCIe Gen4 SSD</li>



<li>Webcam: 1080p&nbsp;</li>



<li>Connectivity:&nbsp; 2x USB 4 with Power Delivery, DisplayPort Alternate Mode, Thunderbolt 4, 1x USB 4 with Power Delivery.</li>



<li>Networking: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2</li>



<li>Biometrics: IR Camera for Windows Hello facial recognition&nbsp;</li>



<li>Battery capacity: 60 watt-hours</li>



<li>Dimensions: 14 x 8.95 x .49 inches</li>



<li>Weight: 2.18 pounds</li>



<li>MSRP: $1,699.99 base MSRP, $1,999.99 as-tested</li>
</ul>



<p>The entry-level LG Gram SuperSlim, which retails for $1,699.99, packs an Intel Core i7-1360P processor, Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics, a 1TB solid state drive, and 16GB of RAM. That&rsquo;s likely the best configuration for most people, but my upgraded review unit crammed in 32GB of RAM and a whopping 2TB of solid state storage (in the form of two 1TB PCIe SSDs), which inflates the price to $1,999.99.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-design-and-build-quality">LG Gram SuperSlim: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Gram design" class="wp-image-2000436" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The LG Gram SuperSlim has a navy blue magnesium alloy chassis that&rsquo;s unadorned aside from a small silver Gram logo in the center of the laptop&rsquo;s lid. The materials feel as plain as they look, lacking any texture that might help the laptop stand out from the crowd. I like the navy blue colorway, at least.</p>



<p>There is one element of the design that stands out: The aspect ratio. The laptop has a 15.6-inch, 16:9 widescreen instead of the taller 16:10 aspect ratio popular among recent laptops. As a result, the laptop looks and feels wide relative to its depth. Its physical measurements, however, show it&rsquo;s slightly smaller than most 15.6-inch and 16-inch laptops.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the laptop&rsquo;s chassis uses a magnesium alloy. It&rsquo;s a remarkably durable and light material that helps the Gram SuperSlim achieve its low weight of 2.18 pounds. Magnesium alloy isn&rsquo;t particularly rigid, however, the laptop&rsquo;s slim profile, which measures just 0.49 inches thick, leaves little space to add reinforcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shoppers interested in the Gram SuperSlim must accept a compromise. This laptop is light and thin, which makes it ideal for travel, but lacks the heft and luxury you&rsquo;ll enjoy from an Apple MacBook Air 15, Dell XPS 15, or Razer Blade 16.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-keyboard-trackpad">LG Gram SuperSlim: Keyboard, trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Gram keyboard" class="wp-image-2000438" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The LG Gram SuperSlim has room for a spacious keyboard with large keys and a numpad on the right-hand side. Technically, the numpad keys are not quite full-sized, but they&rsquo;re so close that the difference is tough to notice. There&rsquo;s plenty of space along the palm rest, too, so your palms won&rsquo;t be left dangling off the edge of the laptop.</p>



<p>However, the laptop&rsquo;s slim chassis means there&rsquo;s a lack of space for key travel. Key action is short and firm, which leads to a wooden feel that lacks tactile feedback. The keyboard is extremely quiet (which some users might prefer), but I like a little more response when I activate a key. The typing experience is acceptable overall, but alternatives like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809123/dell-xps-15-2023-review-a-do-it-all-powerhouse.html">Dell XPS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797659/lenovo-slim-pro-7-review.html">Lenovo Slim Pro 7</a> outperform the LG.</p>



<p>White LED keyboard backlighting comes standard and is controlled with a keyboard shortcut. It does the job but is otherwise unremarkable. There&rsquo;s no color customization and just two brightness settings (aside from off).</p>



<p>A small touchpad measuring four inches wide and three inches deep is centered below the keyboard. It&rsquo;s tiny by the standards of modern 15 and 16-inch Windows laptops, most of which have a touchpad measuring 5 or 6 inches wide. The lack of space might be an issue for those who enjoy Windows&rsquo; multi-touch gestures. Fortunately, the touchpad otherwise feels responsive and smooth. I also appreciate that the touchpad is centered on the laptop instead of pushed towards the left side, which is usually the case with laptops that have a numpad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-display-audio">LG Gram SuperSlim: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Gram SuperSlim hero" class="wp-image-2000411" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Every LG Gram SuperSlim has a 1080p 60Hz OLED non-touch display. It doesn&rsquo;t look impressive on a specification sheet, mostly due to its 1080p resolution, but it looks fantastic in real-world use.</p>



<p>The display&rsquo;s 1,920 x 1,080 resolution works out to 141 pixels per inch, which is a bit lower than a 27-inch 4K monitor&rsquo;s pixel density of 163 pixels per inch. Still, the Gram SuperSlim packs enough pixels to deliver sharp visuals. YouTube videos look crystal-clear and tiny fonts and rendered with minimal pixelation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The OLED panel adds punch with an effectively infinite contrast ratio and superb color gamut. It delivers rich and vivid visuals, rendering dark scenes with convincing shadows alongside saturated colors in brighter content. The Gram SuperSlim is great for watching a movie or streaming Netflix. The display&rsquo;s excellent color performance also proves handy when editing photos or video.</p>



<p>Gamers will be disappointed to learn the display has a 60Hz refresh rate. That&rsquo;s somewhat surprising, as many competing laptops that have an OLED panel deliver a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. However, given the absence of discrete graphics on this laptop, gaming performance clearly isn&rsquo;t a priority.</p>



<p>While the display is solid, the Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s audio is adequate at best. Maximum volume is loud enough to fill a small room with sound, but the speakers have a thin, hollow quality and a muddy mid-range. Even acoustically simple content, like a podcast, can introduce distortion that makes listening unpleasant. Headphones or earbuds are recommended.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-webcam-microphone-biometrics">LG Gram SuperSlim: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>LG conceals a great 1080p webcam in the Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s thin display bezel. It delivers a sharp image with good color reproduction, and while I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for professional video content creation, it performs well for video conferencing on platforms like Zoom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The webcam is accompanied by a microphone array that captures strong, robust audio. You&rsquo;ll rarely hear outside noises, too, as the microphones in the Gram SuperSlim seem to filter out background noise more aggressively than most laptops. This will reduce the volume of your voice if you&rsquo;re not directly facing the laptop during a call, however.</p>



<p>Windows Hello facial recognition login is supported by the webcam and works flawlessly, providing a quick and easy way to log into the laptop the moment you sit in front of it. As is typical of Windows Hello facial recognition, it works well even in low-light environments.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-connectivity">LG Gram SuperSlim: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Gram ports" class="wp-image-2000442" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The LG Gram SuperSlim is focused on USB-C connectivity with three USB 4 Type-C ports, two of which support USB Power Delivery, DisplayPort Alternate Mode, and Thunderbolt 4. The third USB 4 port only supports USB Power Delivery.</p>



<p>This has its benefits. All USB-C ports provide high data transfer rates and connectivity is easily improved with a USB-C hub. I also like that all three USB-C ports can charge the laptop. On the other hand, the laptop will require an adapter or hub for use with older monitors, external hard drives, and most webcams, which is annoying if you use these peripherals frequently.</p>



<p>There is one additional port to mention: a 3.5mm combo audio port. It&rsquo;s included on nearly all modern laptops, of course, but I&rsquo;m happy to see LG didn&rsquo;t sacrifice it in the name of portability.</p>



<p>LG&rsquo;s decision to rely on USB 4 isn&rsquo;t unique. Dell takes a similar tact with the Dell XPS 15 (though it does provide an SDcard reader). Apple&rsquo;s recently released MacBook Air 15 has even less connectivity, offering just two USB 4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports. But other potential alternatives, like the Lenovo Yoga 7i 16-inch, have USB-A and HDMI-out.</p>



<p>The Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s wireless connectivity picks up slack for the slim port selection with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. The laptop&rsquo;s Wi-Fi remained strong and reliable even when using the laptop 50 feet away from the router in a detached office.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-performance">LG Gram SuperSlim: Performance</h2>



<p>LG&rsquo;s Gram SuperSlim sits in an odd position between larger and more powerful 15-inch and 16-inch laptops, such as the Dell XPS 15, and more portable 14-inch laptops like the Lenovo Yoga 9i or Slim Pro 7. All Gram SuperSlim configurations ship with the Intel Core i7-1360P, a 12-core processor with four performance cores and eight efficient cores, and all rely on Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG SuperSlim PCMark" class="wp-image-2000449" height="762" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-pcmark-10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Our tests begin with PCMark 10, a benchmark suite that judges a laptop based on a variety of tests. The LG Gram SuperSlim has trouble here, reaching a total score of just 4,989. That&rsquo;s a tad better than the Intel Core i7-1355U but otherwise falls behind similar laptops.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG SuperSlim Cinebench" class="wp-image-2000450" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Gram SuperSlim hit a Cinebench R15 multi-core score of 1,430. That&rsquo;s a reasonable score for a laptop with an Intel Core i7-1360P processor and enough to place the LG above the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5. However, it clearly loses to the Lenovo Slim 7 Pro&rsquo;s new Ryzen 7735HS and the Dell XPS 15&rsquo;s more power-hungry Intel Core i7-13700H.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG SuperSlim Handbrake" class="wp-image-2000451" height="740" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Our Handbrake test wasn&rsquo;t the Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s finest moment. It transcoded a 30GB video file into an Android-friendly 1080p .MKV format in 26 minutes and 21 seconds.That&rsquo;s barely quicker than a Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 packing a last-gen Intel Core i7-1255U processor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What gives? Blame the Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s thermal management, which prioritizes quiet operation over performance. That&rsquo;s good news if the whirr of fans annoys you&mdash;the laptop isn&rsquo;t silent, but it&rsquo;s quiet and fan noise only becomes noticeable during heavy, sustained loads. It quickly becomes hot, however, reaching external temperatures of up to 107 degrees.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG SuperSlim TimeSpy" class="wp-image-2000452" height="752" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-time-spy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Graphics performance is arguably the Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s most serious limitation. Intel Iris Xe is capable of playing many modern 3D games at low framerates and detail settings, but it doesn&rsquo;t keep pace with the latest AMD Radeon graphics integrated into Ryzen 7000-series processors, and even the most basic discrete graphics solutions will leave Intel Iris Xe in the dust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a problem for 3D games, of course, and might hold the laptop back in productivity workloads. Many modern applications can use a GPU to accelerate video encoding or AI tasks, but that&rsquo;s not an option on the Gram SuperSlim.</p>



<p>The LG Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s performance is easy to sum up: it&rsquo;s not great, Bob. Performance is more than adequate for day-to-day use and easily tackles moderately demanding tasks, like editing large photos or a 1080p YouTube video. Still, it&rsquo;s clear the LG Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s performance is more in line with 13 and 14-inch laptops and falls behind many similarly priced than 15-inch and 16-inch competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-battery-life">LG Gram SuperSlim: Battery life</h2>



<p>The LG Gram SuperSlim packs a meager 60 watt-hour battery. That&rsquo;s small for a laptop in this category&mdash;the Dell XPS 15, by comparison, provides an 86 watt-hour battery.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG SuperSlim battery life" class="wp-image-2000456" height="755" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lg-gram-superslim-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a surprise, then, to see the Gram SuperSlim outlast many alternatives. The LG endured our battery test, which loops a 4K clip of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>, for 12 hours and 51 minutes. That defeats the Dell XPS 15 and Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 and comes close to the Lenovo Slim 7 Pro.</p>



<p>Credit the laptop&rsquo;s meager hardware. The LG Gram SuperSlim&rsquo;s performance is modest for the price, but the lack of power-hungry hardware helps squeeze maximum life from every watt available. The Gram SuperSlim should handle an eight-hour workday of light to moderate use.</p>



<p>The laptop charges over USB-C, as well, and will happily suck power from any half-decent 65-watt power adapter. That further aids its portability, as frequent fliers can easily charge the laptop with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915376/best-laptop-usb-c-pd-chargers.html">compact third-party power adapter</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lg-gram-superslim-should-you-buy-it">LG Gram SuperSlim: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>The LG Gram SuperSlim is a laptop designed for a particular niche. It offers a big 15.6-inch display, lots of memory, and gobs of solid state storage, but lacks the CPU and GPU performance most people will expect in a large laptop with a base price of $1,699.99. The LG Gram SuperSlim could make sense if you want a large laptop only because you prefer a big screen, or if you want a large laptop that feels smaller than it is. If you want performance, however, you&rsquo;ll be happier with a larger, thicker laptop like the Dell XPS 15 or Asus Vivobook 16X OLED.</p>
