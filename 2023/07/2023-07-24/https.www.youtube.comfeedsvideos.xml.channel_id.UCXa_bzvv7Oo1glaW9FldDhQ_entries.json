With the game launching not long from now, here, we\u2019re going to take a look at a few key details that you should know about it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZr6hO20zrk", "date_published": "2023-07-24T17:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pZr6hO20zrk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 - 15 THINGS WE CAN'T WAIT TO DO", "description": "With how massive Baldur's Gate 3 looks, figuring out what to do and where to go can be a real task.

You can manipulate the printing press for positive headlines or shop for new clothes. You can also go full Renegade and take out everything.\n\nCheck out 15 things we can't wait to do when Larian's epic RPG arrives on August 3rd for PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ezZXEti0s", "date_published": "2023-07-24T15:30:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/t9ezZXEti0s/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 Times Single Player Game Developers FOOLISHLY CHASED MULTIPLAYER TRENDS", "description": "The push and pull between single player and multiplayer games has been a fixture of the games industry for a long time now, and as the popularity of both sides has ebbed and flowed, the other has reacted accordingly. \n\nThere have, for instance, been no few occasions when developers that have built their reputations on excellent single player experiences have misguidedly attempted to chase the commercial and ongoing success of multiplayer experiences, and though not all have failed to make that transition successfully, many have. \n\nFrom multiplayer modes being crammed into single player games where they don\u2019t belong to studios dropping solo experiences entirely in favour of whatever the market\u2019s popular trend is, examples of such nature are numerous, to say the very least. Here, we\u2019re going to take a look at a few such instances.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xw6GZlZf1A", "date_published": "2023-07-24T13:30:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_Xw6GZlZf1A/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Awakening Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Awakening is the latest in a long-running franchise that spans almost four whole decades. The newest game brings the same classic gameplay that the series is known for, coupled with impressive new visuals and a unique control scheme that allows fans of strategy games to play it on a controller.\n\nNobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Awakening takes place during the tumultuous period of Japanese history known as the Sengoku era, and revolves around a number of daimyos rising up in rebellion against the falling Ashikage Shogunate.\n\nRather than focusing on battles, however, Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Awakening instead focuses quite a bit on having you manage your clan and its territories. While winning fights is important, making sure your villagers are fed and your treasury isn\u2019t empty is also equally important in Oda Nobunaga\u2019s grand adventure to try and unify the country of Japan.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2U-0K4hXTk", "date_published": "2023-07-24T10:30:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/i2U-0K4hXTk/hqdefault.jpg"}]
