Today\u2019s flip phones are garden-variety 2023 smartphones that happen to fold in half \u2014 plus a screen on the front cover. </p>\n<p id=\"uwTNCD\">They\u2019ve been making a kind of comeback over the past few years, but until now, they\u2019ve existed in the shadows of their bigger, pricier fold-style counterparts. That\u2019s understandable, considering that their small cover screens haven\u2019t been good for much more than checking the weather and pressing pause on a podcast.

It has a USB-C port and a row of GPIO ports on the top that let it interface with other hardware, including an add-on Wi-Fi board. Chris Person, writing for <em>The Verge</em>, called it a Swiss Army knife of antennas. You can use it to emulate Amiibos.
