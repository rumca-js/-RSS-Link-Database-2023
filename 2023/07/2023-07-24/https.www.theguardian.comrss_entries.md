<p>This hilarious, inventive sitcom about a Black film-maker struggling to make it feels totally new. No wonder it’s full of cameos from comedy legends</p><p>Television can have a tendency towards being formulaic, and in some respects, that is part of its appeal. You sit down on a Sunday night to a big BBC period drama and know, roughly, the notes that it is going to hit. But occasionally a show like Dreaming Whilst Black comes along and quietly rips up the formula, finding a new path that feels fresh, exciting and very much its own.</p><p>The series, co-created by and starring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/21/dreaming-whilst-black-bbc-adjani-salmon-on-creating-tvs-hottest-new-comedy">Adjani Salmon</a>, emerges from the foundations of first a web series and then a Bafta-winning pilot. Salmon is Kwabena, an aspiring film-maker from a Jamaican family who is working in recruitment while dreaming of one day making it as a writer and director. Over six episodes, he navigates his way through various opportunities, funding schemes and mentoring programmes, while also trying to earn a living and pay rent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/dreaming-whilst-black-review-this-bafta-winning-show-is-ripping-up-the-rules-of-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>All is not what it seems in this profile of human meat factories – including toddler tartare canapes. It’s a neat satire about the cost of living crisis, even if it is in no way subtle</p><p>Gregg Wallace: The British Miracle Meat begins in the usual way – with me reaching for the volume button, checking the running time (only half an hour – hurrah!) and wondering, yet again, why this man is shouting at me. This time it is about “THE COST OF LIVING CRISIS! NOW IT COSTS A PACKET JUST TO BRING HOME THE BACON! AND DON’T GET ME STARTED ON EGGS!”</p><p>Off we go with GREGG to a guarded processing plant in Lincolnshire belonging to a food technology firm which houses a production line and clinical facilities, that for the last eight months, have been producing meat made from human cells. Line manager Mick Ross explains that it is a relatively new process. “Under EU law we couldn’t possibly operate machines like this.” We see little shavings of flesh (donors are paid about £250 a time, which as Wallace points out is enough to cover an average fortnight’s energy bills) hanging in a nutrient-rich vat and quickly developing into huge slabs of meat (“STUNNING!”). They can yield up to 100 steaks which – according to taste tests carried out with men and women in the street by co-presenter Michelle Ackerley – are remarkably fine substitutes for the real thing and at a fraction of the price. Could this be the answer to part of the cost of living crisis?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/gregg-wallace-the-british-miracle-meat-review-this-look-at-eating-human-flesh-is-a-total-curveball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a Tesla range misspelling ‘sexy’ to naming his own child after an airplane, branding just might not be his strong suit</p><p>On Sunday, in a series of posts that surely won’t be called tweets for much longer, Elon Musk reasoned that his company’s new logo, a badly rendered letter X, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682971111699410944">embodies</a> “the imperfections in us all that make us unique”. What does he mean by that? He, of course, has no idea. This is a man with a terrible, terrible history for naming things.</p><p>At Tesla, Musk would insist on a model lineup that spelled out the word “sexy”, even after there was no chance of Ford relinquishing their copyright on the Model E (so he ended up with Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y). At SpaceX, an uninventive moniker in itself, he named his rockets like an improv audience member shouting out random words to inspire a comedy scene: Grasshopper! Merlin! Starship! Musk’s failure of a tunneling concern, the Boring Company, shows he also flair for lame puns that don’t quite land.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/elon-musk-twitter-x-rebrand">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Technically gifted forward did not meet early expectations, but who could have? Injuries set him back but he was a fine player</p><p>In December 1978, the 24‑year‑old Trevor Francis shambled on to the stage to receive the Midland Football Writers’ Player of the Year award from Brian Clough. Although never a fastidious dresser himself, Clough looked him up and down and told him off for having his hands in his pockets. Francis, then at Birmingham City, was one of the most hyped players in English football at the time, but he meekly withdrew his hands and muttered: “Yes, sir.” Two months later, Clough <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/05/trevor-francis-first-1m-player-nottingham-forest-clough-anniversary" title="">made him the first million-pound British footballer</a> by signing him for Nottingham Forest.</p><p>Perhaps after a youth as gilded as Francis’s had been, making his debut for Birmingham at the age of 16 and scoring 15 goals in his first 22 games, perhaps after setting a landmark fee, it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Perhaps the expectations were never realistic. Francis had a perfectly decent career. He won two European Cups (although he played in only one final). He won league cups in Scotland and England, as well as a Coppa Italia. He played 52 times for England, scoring a dozen goals. But there was a sense that he did not quite achieve the heights that seemed possible in that season of his debut.

Instead, after a high turnout in searing summer heat, Vox lost 19 seats, as its share of the vote fell compared with its breakthrough election in 2019.

<p>Britain’s missing voice in a key global anti-poverty debate reveals how the country is fading into irrelevance on the world stage</p><p></p><p>In late Victorian Britain, “splendid isolation” was celebrated as a testament to the nation’s imperial strength. Today, seclusion from global events is not an indication of power but the world’s indifference to Brexit Britain’s inward turn. A decade ago, the UK would have been at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/uk-passes-bill-law-aid-target-percentage-income" title="">forefront</a> of anti-poverty efforts. Now it offers the world neither money nor ideas. The upshot is that China, the EU and the US are part of the School Meals Coalition, led by developing nations to push for universal access to free school meals by 2030 as a response to rising hunger. Britain is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The coalition was at centre of <a href="https://twitter.com/SchoolMeals_/status/1683434697961922561" title="">debates</a> at Monday’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-food-summit-guterres-russia-ukraine-00612131ea6610f582aa3baa462c9670" title="">UN food summit</a> in Rome. Rising global food prices have left much of the planet poorer. But the main UK parties avoid saying that the state can combat poverty. The Tory <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/25/free-school-meals-uk-marcus-rashford-conservative-mps-defend-ministers-refusal-to-u-turn" title="">indifference</a> to hardship in a cost of living crisis rests on spurious anti-government arguments. Sir Keir Starmer’s crippling electoral <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/06/keir-starmer-free-school-meals-labour-leader-teachers-pay-rise#:~:text=Keir%20Starmer%20refuses%20to%20commit,pledge%20%7C%20School%20meals%20%7C%20The%20Guardian" title="">caution</a> means he won’t back universal free school meals for state primary schools in England. It is political arrogance to think that Labour has a right to the support of progressive voters regardless of what the party says and does. Labour’s Sadiq Khan knows what’s at stake.

<p>Last weekend’s big releases unleashed the kind of excitement that’s been missing for years. But it remains to be seen whether two films can turn the tide</p><p>For entirely guessable reasons, on Saturday night every cinema I would regularly, willingly set foot in was booked solid. I nearly got two tickets in my local, but the seats were as far away from each other as it was possible to be, which my 13-year-old was fine with, except one of them was wheelchair-accessible. The cinema, it appeared, was fine with me booking that<em>, </em>but it struck me as the kind of thing Larry David would do in Curb Your Enthusiasm.</p><p>So we ended up in a cinema on top of a shopping centre, miles from anywhere, a place where everything smells of the weird doughnut-pretzel-hybrid stall in the ambitiously titled atrium, and everyone has accidentally bought a fitness item they’ll never use in Decathlon. The last time I was here, it was to see Hotel Rwanda with my mum, which throws me back a bit, because that was released nearly 20 years ago, and she hasn’t been out of her house for five of them. When we came out, she said “what an appalling place”, and I thought she was referring to the atrocities we had just seen on screen , but she actually meant the shopping centre.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>The Conservatives are right about making urban areas denser, but their proposed planning reform is an undemocratic mess</p><p>Yes, Britain’s housing market is in a mess. No, that does not mean 75 years of town planning should be torn up just to win the Tories a few more seats. Today’s speeches on housebuilding by the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, and his boss, Rishi Sunak, are in part sensible, in part not.</p><p>They are right that there is no “need” for extensive new building over Britain’s countryside. Just because party-donor developers prefer lucrative rural sites, this does not constitute a necessity. A green urban policy is now concentrated – as Sunak and Gove accept – on densifying existing built-up areas and infrastructure, not least in Britain’s extensive suburban sprawl. Density is why the American urbanologist Edward Glaeser, in his 2011 book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/303439/triumph-of-the-city-by-edward-glaeser/">Triumph of the City</a>, celebrated the unexpected green credentials of Manhattan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/britain-housing-crisis-towns-cities-countryside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He was an intellectual heavyweight, a ferocious campaigner for improving cancer screening and a gentle, pleasant presence. No wonder the nation took the newsreader into its heart</p><p>The first BBC TV newsreaders were actors or announcers: a decision rooted in the fear that journalists might insert their views into bulletins through swoops of voice or eyebrow. When this tradition was abandoned, reporters and correspondents graduated to the anchor desk in the hope that those who came to the studio from the field would bring authority and knowledge to the coverage.</p><p>George Alagiah, who has died aged 67, was the exemplar of someone who had seen first-hand events that they latterly recited from an Autocue. His two decades of news reading – across BBC One’s 1pm, 10pm and 6pm slots, before making the teatime show his own since 2003 – were informed by having reported on Rwandan genocide, civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the democratisation of South Africa, the 9/11 attacks on the US and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. As the practice developed of the home-based host doing live “two-ways” with colleagues on the frontline, Alagiah was unusually able to conduct these conversations on equal terms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/intelligent-courageous-and-charming-a-tribute-to-george-alagiah">Continue reading...</a>

The two camps melded together; water bottles were given to the hot and weary walkers, along with slices of watermelon, ice pops and grapes. There was generosity, goodwill and heartfelt sharing. There was the rare understanding that each of us was composed of the many people who came to this place, who continued together up the Qastel hills to Jerusalem, sweltering in the extreme heat but with their souls uplifted.</p><p>The Jewish nation has experienced rifts and divisions: <a href="https://www.angel.com/blog/the-chosen/posts/who-were-the-pharisees">Sadducees and Pharisees</a>, <a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/35277">Hasidism and Misnagdim</a>, and many other opposing factions. But what has been occurring in Israel these past few months is no longer on the same continuum. We do not yet have the words to adequately describe this turn of events, and that is why it is so frightening. It may transpire that it was the beginning of a process that will crumble – and possibly resolve – our society’s ossified, dangerous points. But for now it is bringing to the surface Israel’s secrets and lies, the cumulative historical offences, the lack of compassion, the injustices, all of which have become an intolerable dissonance that breeds mutual revulsion.</p><p>David Grossman is an Israeli author.

When we reach the denouement, the eponymous heroine – the mortal mistress of Jove, fatally tricked into demanding he cast off his human disguise and reveal himself in his full, cataclysmic divinity – is immured in a massive wicker effigy of her rival Juno, which goes up in flames as the chorus look on. It’s a striking<em> </em>coup de théâtre<em> </em>in an otherwise somewhat lacklustre staging and a dour take on what is essentially a barbed Restoration comedy.</p><p>Handel took as his text a libretto by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/congreve">William Congreve</a>, previously set by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/04/eccles-semele-review">John Eccles</a>, about the relationship between desire, ambition and opportunism. Thomas, however, is thinking more in terms of emotional and sexual rebellion, and her Thebes becomes an anonymous modern landscape (it looks like scrubland), where Joélle Harvey’s Semele, already pregnant by Stuart Jackson’s Jove, longs to escape from both the prurient mockery of the community around her and the arranged marriage that her father Cadmus (Clive Bayley) is trying to force her into with Aryeh Nussbaum Cohen’s Athamas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/semele-review-glyndebourne-handel-joelle-harvey-adele-thomas">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a bit of a shock for Pence, since he was Trump’s vice-president for four years, though has very publicly fallen out with him. Here’s why he hasn’t yet made the cut:</p><p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has also hit the polling threshold.

## Wet Leg, Fontaines DC … Kylie? The weird world of post-punk superproducer Dan Carey

<p>He went from No 1 pop hits to being the beating heart of south London’s thriving indie scene. Now releasing his own music, the producer explains why playing tricks with bands gets results</p><p>Dan Carey’s studio is notoriously hectic at the best of times, but today takes the biscuit. The air is thick with hangovers, the tabletops strewn with empty champagne bottles and Carey’s head has been freshly shaved bald. His new musical project Miss Tiny, a duo with Warmduscher’s Benjamin Romans-Hopcraft, played at Pratts &amp; Payne in Streatham last night, before stumbling the short walk back to the studio with a few select friends in the early hours.</p><p>As we retrace those steps back to the venue, Carey rightly strides through this patch of south London as if he has been granted special civic freedoms, such has been his role in establishing it as a hub of alternative music culture over the last decade. In an era when it has been harder for traditional music scenes to solidify, Carey has been the lightning rod for a boom of agitated, prodigious post-punk bands that are bound together not just by time and place, but by an aesthetic that was honed to a significant extent by Carey himself, quietly, behind the production desk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/wet-leg-fontaines-dc-kylie-post-punk-superproducer-dan-carey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Open marks the end of a stunted, 16-week major championship season that hurts both prestige and popularity</p><p>It is perhaps just as well Brian Harman collected the Claret Jug in front of a few hardy souls holding umbrellas, against a light backdrop more akin to November than July and having refused to let excitement get in the way of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/23/dominant-brian-harman-wins-the-open-to-secure-first-major">final round of the Open Championship</a>. Anybody gripped by an alternative scene would soon have been struck by the harsh realisation that more than 260 days will pass until the next major championship ball is struck in anger.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/10/jon-rahm-overhauls-brooks-koepka-to-win-masters-on-dramatic-final-day">Jon Rahm was crowned</a> as the Masters champion on 9 April. Harman’s finest hour arrived on 23 July.

If one supposed benefit of this brief major run is to develop a seasonal theme, Hercule Poirot is required to determine it. At face value, nothing links the 2023 majors at all besides desire to get them out of the way as promptly as possible. The delay between final putts dropping at Royal Liverpool and opening drives being struck at Augusta National is great for the Masters, which benefits from fevered anticipation. It surely cannot be regarded as much use to anybody else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/the-open-golf-major-championships">Continue reading...</a>

## How Edward Enninful’s Vogue changed British culture

<p>The magazine has become less white, but remained as grand and elitist in its aesthetic vision as it ever was</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/24/british-vogue-editor-in-chief-edward-enninful-says-march-issue-will-be-his-last">British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful says March issue will be his last</a></li></ul><p>Edward Enninful’s Vogue has changed what Britain looks like in a way that goes beyond clothes. The version of British Vogue that Enninful has helmed for the past six years has defined itself as a portrait of aspirational Britain that is never, to put it bluntly, all-white. Black models are a consistent, high-profile presence rather than an afterthought. The April 2023 magazine, with the coverline The New Supers, starred three models – all non-white, all non-sample size, all photographed full-length rather than in the zoomed-in closeup that fashion traditionally chooses for non-skinny models. People of all genders and all skin colours, disabled bodies, bigger bodies, octogenarians alongside teens, are included in the aspirational vision of the country’s premier glossy magazine.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because Vogue is the paper of record for the beautiful people. Vogue has always been not just about fashion, but about status and visibility. Vogue is the top table of what glamour looks like. Diversity has become a non-negotiable aspect of that guest list – and this has a knock-on effect on worlds adjacent to fashion. Say, for example, that you are the person in charge of throwing a high-profile party to celebrate the opening of a venue that is angling to become the latest place to be, or putting together a lineup of influencer-ambassadors to represent your new beauty or wellness brand. The trickledown effect from Vogue is that the optics will look way off – hopelessly unfashionable, embarrassingly out of touch – if the lineup of faces fails to embrace diversity. Tokenism is no longer enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/24/how-edward-enninful-vogue-changed-british-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spain appears to be heading for political gridlock after rightwing parties failed to clinch a decisive victory and no clear winner emerged from a national election, leaving pro-independence Catalan and Basque parties as potential kingmakers. After winning the most seats, the conservative People's party will be given the first attempt at trying to cobble together enough votes in parliament to win a prime-ministerial investiture vote. But its alliance with the far-right Vox and tough stance on separatism will make it difficult to gain support from any other faction. The law does not set a deadline for the process but if no candidate secures a majority within two months of the first vote on the prime minister, new elections must be held</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/23/spainish-election-conservative-party-ahead-but-unlikely-to-win-majority">Spain elections: hung parliament after conservatives fail to secure expected majority</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jul/24/spain-faces-political-gridlock-after-national-elections-video-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Start with a West African sweet potato and chickpea stew, and round things off with some no-bake peanut butter cups that even the kids can make</p><p>Peanut butter is<strong> </strong>a pantry stalwart (well, it is in my house) that works beautifully in both savouries and desserts, adding a richness and subtle sweetness in one simple step. I always opt for the crunchy stuff, but smooth works, too; both are interchangeable in today’s recipes. This West African-inspired stew and peanut butter cups make peanut butter the well-deserved star of the show, and can be batched up and frozen in portions for future meals – the stew, in particular, will benefit from being frozen, because the flavours become more “lived in” and bold the second time round.</p><p>Cook Clever: One Chop, No Waste, All Taste, by Shivi Ramoutar, is published by HarperCollins at £20.

## Proms at Sage Gateshead review – festival goes north for euphoric weekend that moves from Brahms to barking like dogs

<p>With concerts encompassing pop, classical, jazz and a CBeebies family extravaganza, the Proms took over Sage Gateshead for a triumphant communal experience that underlined how music can connect us</p><p>‘I’ll pretend it’s me and my friends and we’re just chilling,” jokes Rebecca Lucy Taylor, better known as<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/25/self-esteem-glastonbury-interview-rebecca-lucy-taylor"> Self Esteem</a>, admitting to feeling “quite nervous” at the start of her debut performance with a live orchestra. Behind her are the strings, horns, keyboards and percussion of the Royal Northern Sinfonia (RNS). In front of her, an audience are making a noise that conductor <a href="https://robertames.co.uk/">Robert Ames</a> later compares to “a jet engine”. The whole thing is being recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 3. No pressure.</p><p>The world’s largest classical music festival may still be synonymous with the Royal Albert Hall, but <a href="https://sagegateshead.com/whats-on/bbc-proms-self-esteem-rns/">the fastest selling concert in Sage Gateshead’s history</a> kicks off the Proms’ first ever festival weekend outside London. This year, the festival travels to towns including Aberystwyth, Great Yarmouth and Dewsbury. “This is the most ambitious thing we’ve done to date. We don’t want the Proms to just feel like a London festival,” says Proms director David Pickard. “When Sir Henry Wood started the Proms in 1895, the original mission was to bring the world of classical music to a widest possible audience. All we’re doing is reinterpreting that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/proms-at-sage-gateshead-review-festival-goes-north-for-euphoric-weekend-that-moves-from-brahms-to-barking-like-dogs">Continue reading...</a>

## The big idea: Why the laws of physics will never explain the universe

<p>We should think of the cosmos as more like an animal than a machine</p><p>It is hard to come to terms with the sheer scale of space: hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy and, at a minimum, trillions of galaxies in the universe. But to a cosmologist there is something even more intriguing than the boggling numbers themselves, which is the question of how all these stars and galaxies were created over a period of 13.8 billion years. It’s the ultimate prehistoric adventure. Life cannot evolve without a planet, planets do not form without stars, stars must be cradled within galaxies, and galaxies would not exist without a richly structured universe to support them. Our origins are written in the sky, and we are just learning how to read them.</p><p>It once seemed that, for all its immensity, the cosmos could be understood through the application of a small number of rigid physical laws. Newton encapsulated this idea, showing how apples falling from trees and planetary orbits around our sun arise from the same force, gravity. This kind of radical unification of earthly and heavenly phenomena survives in modern teaching: all the innumerable molecules, atoms and subatomic particles in the universe are expected to obey the same set of laws. Most of the evidence suggests that this assumption holds true, so it should follow that perfecting our understanding of these laws will resolve any remaining questions about cosmic history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/the-big-idea-why-the-laws-of-physics-will-never-explain-the-universe">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Lyric theatre, London<br /></strong>This show from Tall Stories brings children into the action with a gentle warmth, squeal-inducing gags and engaging puppetry</p><p>Tall Stories know a thing or two about adapting Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler’s books for the stage. This is their fourth one and there is a gentleness about their production – and a lovely sense of enfolding the young audience into the action – that does Donaldson’s mesmerising works great justice. The dramaturgy isn’t perfect (too much filler!) but this is my son Benji’s first visit to a proper theatre and, other than a few lapses in concentration, he has a wonderful time.</p><p>The director, Toby Mitchell, and the designer, Barney George, have pitched the atmosphere and visuals really well. The Smeds and the Smoos and their barmy planet is conjured up with a few choice props; a jaggedy jiggly plant here and a purple sprouting flower there. It is all very impressive, but never overwhelming. The use of narrators (Tom Capper is particularly engaging) helps to echo the intimacy of the bedtime story routine – only everything is just that bit bigger and brighter, with a few jolly songs thrown in for good measure.</p><p>At <a href="https://nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-smeds-and-the-smoos/">Lyric theatre, London</a>, until 3 September</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/24/the-smeds-and-the-smoos-review-songs-and-screams-in-donaldson-and-schefflers-jolly-voyage">Continue reading...</a>

The media often focus on these, however, during times of extreme fire weather (very dry vegetation, very high temperatures, low air humidity and strong winds) any ignition can rapidly turn into a fast moving wildfire.</p><p>That could be faulty power lines, small intentional fires to burn debris getting out of control, sparks from moving machinery or building activity, arson etc.</p><p>Under climate change, what’s changing is the frequency of the weather conditions that enable fires like this to break out, and also to burn so intensely and synchronously across the Mediterranean.</p><p>The Mediterranean has seen a dramatic increase in the frequency of the hot, dry conditions that were considered extreme at the end of the last century, and these increases are expected to accelerate for each added degree of warming in future.</p><p>We understand how difficult this experience has been for many, and our entire focus is on looking after our customers. We have a significantly expanded presence in Rhodes, with a huge team of experienced colleagues providing all the support we can for our customers, whether that is in affected areas or at Rhodes airport.</p><p>We have also put on three repatriation flights to bring our customers home, which is on top of our scheduled programme of flights that will continue to operate from Rhodes to the UK this week.

<p>The stylish feature debut from Céline Devaux explores the life of businesswoman Jeanne, her louche ex-lover and a strangely seductive new acquaintance</p><p>Parisian film-maker and illustrator Céline Devaux, whose award-winning shorts have been shown at Cannes and Venice, now makes her feature debut with a salty romcom character study; it is deceptively slight, though leaning heavily on a certain kind of quirkiness, and undoubtedly intriguing.</p><p>Jeanne is an entrepreneur who has fallen into a depression caused by the death of her mother and the recent bizarre collapse of her business; she has an inner anxiety-voice represented by Devaux’s own sketches of the cartoon-ghost in her head, always nagging at her. An undersea device for hoovering up microplastics, into which Jeanne invested every cent of her own money, became unmoored and Jeanne was humiliatingly shown on the TV news as she desperately dived fully clothed into the sea in a doomed attempt to save it.

I have never had a garden shed before, so I wasn’t expecting to give it away so quickly, but once they moved in I accepted it was rightly theirs – for this summer at least. I have never had such a good view of a wasp nest. I peer in most weeks to marvel at its progress.</p><p>It is quite exquisite in its grey, papery layers. Where there was once a solitary queen, now there are many more insects building and foraging, so the nest is only going to grow in size. These are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/29/stinging-wasps-are-precious-not-pointless-say-scientists">common wasps</a>, <em>Vespula vulgaris</em>, and the colony will survive into early autumn, until the first queen dies.

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for summer minestrone with chicken and rice | A kitchen in Rome

<p>A summery, Milanese take on the much-loved Italian soup, to be eaten at room temperature in a cooling breeze</p><p>There was a house on Cassland Road, east London, that would produce the most fantastic cooking smells. This is more than two decades ago now, when I would pass the house once or twice a week, usually on my way to catch the bus. It didn’t matter what time it was – early morning, late afternoon or evening – evidence of something baking, simmering or roasting was almost always drifting through the kitchen window, over the wall and across the pavement. What made the situation even more intriguing, (and slightly Roald Dahl) was that I never saw anyone at the window, or going in or out. Who was responsible? And why? Did they have a large family, lots of friends, or run a small catering company? Were they happy cooking, or exhausted, or both? Whatever the reason, their repertoire was wonderful, and the smell of fruit cakes, things covered in pastry, burnt sugar, rice and peas, full roast dinners and even fuller curries circled like low-flying aircraft before being whisked away on the east London breeze.</p><p>Twenty years later in Rome, the smell of burnt jam and frying chicken brought back memories of Cassland Road. I was cooking in my dressing gown at 9am, an attempt to beat the heat and stickiness that moves in by mid-morning, a state not helped by watermelon, which turns every surface into adhesive. The burnt jam had leaked out of a tart, and the chicken was for this week’s recipe: <em>minestrone</em> <em>estivo freddo</em>, or cold summer minestrone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/24/summer-minestrone-chicken-rice-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A wonderful, much-missed housemate, his death ended my fantasy of having a house full of exotic creatures</p><p>The Belgian pet shop where we found Julius wasn’t a good place. You could get anything: puppies, wallabies – owls, even. It smelled wrong in there: of excrement and fear. Your vestigial hackles were raised.</p><p>I knew we shouldn’t buy a pet from that shop. It was no better than buying a pangolin from a Vietnamese market to “save” it, really, but walking around, between sphynx cats, chinchillas, geckos and chameleons, we spotted a large tortoise in a glass case that was far too small. My husband and I had had tortoises as kids and loved the idea of them. Plus, he was so beautiful: big – probably 40cm long – with a yellow and black head and ruby-red spots, like jewels, on his legs. Impassively munching a stalk, he seemed like a grounded dragon, stuck in a box in a Brussels suburb. We exchanged a quick glance, then called over one of the sales assistants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/24/the-pet-ill-never-forget-julius-the-tortoise-won-our-hearts-then-died-of-a-broken-penis">Continue reading...</a>

I eventually saw them at Birmingham Odeon in 1974 and still have the pristine programme and ticket stub. I never imagined that many years later I would be photographing them and Bryan solo for Getty.

It is inevitable. The tech burns you out because you are the fuel that is destined to be used up: you are the log throwing itself on the flames that warm the tech corporations.

The Brazilian has two French bulldogs and, although they look about as threatening as a couple of sticks of candy floss, they may be categorised as “dangerous” owing to poor branding when names were being handed out to fashionable pets.</p><p>The Mill would have liked Fabinho – and other footballers – to have been put off moving to Saudi Arabia because of other hardline rules there but in the Brazilian’s case it seems the line could be drawn at discriminating against cute dogs.

But when Barbie being lifted up seems to depend on Ken being pushed down, it rings a little hollow</p><p><strong>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS</strong></p><p>The Barbie movie’s great triumph is its heroine’s makeover. After a difficult history setting, and maintaining, unrealistic beauty standards, she has been reinvented as a feminist icon. But there’s a problem – one that shortchanges half the potential audience and jeopardises the overall empowerment message. It’s the Kens.</p><p>Ken has, of course, long been portrayed as a pretty boy, the canonical boyfriend throughout the decades.

<p>An unflinching debut novel set in west Ireland explores the pull of place and duty</p><p>Noel O’Regan, born in Tralee, County Kerry, is a notable addition to the wave of literary talent coming out of Ireland. In his debut novel, he writes about difficult subjects such as depression, trauma and absence with a quiet eloquence.</p><p>Micheál lives in his family’s bungalow at the end of Kerry Head: “like some tourist’s dream of a rural Irish cottage”. It’s a stunning landscape, but the cliffs exert a powerful pull on the bereft and Micheál’s home is the last port of call before the headland. His parents had felt it was their duty – spiritual and civic – to attempt to save the lost souls they referred to as “visitors”. When Micheál’s father dies, his mother places the burden on her young son’s shoulders – an experience from which he never fully recovers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/though-the-bodies-fall-by-noel-oregan-review-eloquent-tale-of-trauma-and-absence">Continue reading...</a>

That left the golfing establishment to sound cool, calm and – unusually for them – like the good guys. They had, after all, triumphed. No one had been inconvenienced in the course of watching their sporting entertainment and that, by and large, has been the focus of anger at Just Stop Oil’s activity this summer. Critics find it frustratingly hard to accuse them of anything else. The protesters haven’t endangered players, or broken equipment; they haven’t altered the course of the sporting action or brought it to an unwanted conclusion. They’ve shown up, made something temporarily orange, then disappeared peacefully in a police van.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/global-catastrophe-matters-more-than-pause-in-sport-just-stop-oil-protests">Continue reading...</a>

After which she has her face cut up and sewn back together, or sometimes her fat sucked out, before being swaddled in a tasteful blazer and kitten heels?</p><p>Makeover shows at their peak, in the 2000s, were famously unhinged, arguably even more so across the Atlantic. The US had Extreme Makeover (2004), whereby “ordinary” people underwent invasive surgery, strict exercise regimens and a wardrobe overhaul. On The Swan (2004), Fox’s controversial reality show, two “ugly ducklings” were completely physically transformed – including the use of surgery – before battling it out for the title of “the swan”. Some, too, might remember Bridalplasty (2010), in which 12 women fought to win their perfect wedding as well as an entirely new face or body (to be revealed down the aisle. I’m not making this up.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/time-for-an-entirely-new-face-or-body-the-chequered-history-of-the-tv-makeover-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We are thinking of £150,000, some for decorating, as my husband wants to be nearer his family when he retires</p><p><strong>Q</strong> My husband and I are going to move to Sweden when he retires as he wants to be nearer to his family. We own our home outright. We are thinking of taking out equity release for £150,000 to buy and decorate a property about a year before we move out of and sell our current home. Is this a good idea? Is there a better option of releasing money from the property? Our house is worth approximately £650,000.<br /><strong>PS</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> I’m not sure that it is a good idea. But that’s because I can’t imagine being able to manage the renovation of a property at long distance, not to mention the cost of insuring an empty property that is miles away. But if you are made of sterner stuff than I am, you may be pleased to hear that, according to Andy Vickery, an equity release expert and mortgage adviser at the independent brokers <a href="https://www.moneyrelease.co.uk/">Money Release</a>, “lifetime mortgage interest rates are at an all-time low, so now might be the best time for you to look at equity release”. But it is worth noting that if you want to release just under 24% of the value of your home (which is what £150,000 represents) the younger of you has to be over 60. If you are under 60 the most you will be able to release is £97,500 (which is 15% of £650,000).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/24/equity-release-house-sweden-sell-in-uk">Continue reading...</a>

## Kit by Megan Barker review – roads not taken

<p>This bittersweet debut fuses prose and poetry as a narrator struggles with a troubled friend and her own life of lost freedoms</p><p>Hybrid novels fusing prose and poetry are in vogue: witness the success of Derek Owusu’s prize-winning <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/26/derek-owusu-that-reminds-me-review-poetry-book-of-the-month">That Reminds Me</a></em>, Jen Calleja’s innovative <em>Vehicle</em> and Max Porter’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-max-porter-paperback-of-the-week">Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</a></em>, among others. Playwright and lyricist <a href="https://www.meganbarker.co.uk/quiet-river-of-dust">Megan Barker</a> follows suit in this poignant debut about the pain of witnessing a loved one’s depression at close quarters. Or at least that’s how I read it: the book, 160 pages long, raw as well as wrought, is narrated by a woman, Megan, who loses a male friend<strong> – </strong>the titular Kit – in circumstances that, as with much else here, you’re invited to infer; told in bittersweet retrospect, it’s a novel of spaces and gaps, of things that didn’t happen or might have happened, or ought to have.<br /><br />Megan and Kit meet in the 90s while living in Glasgow. Their friendship is joyous, intense, platonic-ish – she’s attached and he’s sleeping with her flatmate, which she finds herself overhearing more keenly than she’d like.</p><p>After a snapshot of their early 20s – nights out, plans, ambitions – we cut to London (“last year”) as they’re catching up in middle age over a curry. But Kit doesn’t look well – there’s an oblique reference to whether his drugs are working or not – and he has stalled (we think) on a photography PhD, talking about an ex-girlfriend who aborted a child he wanted. Megan, for her part, is knee-deep in what she calls, not altogether joking, “the Great Betrayal”, wed with three young children:<br /><br />“My daughter never sleeps.<br />My marriage is on its knees.<br />I speak in ultimatums.<br />I have become a gaoler of wild things...<br />All deep thought has been replaced with lists.”<br /><br />Much of <em>Kit</em>’s texture comes from the granular rendering of its narrator’s push-pull emotions around motherhood, from lying sleeplessly at night in a bed crowded with unsettled kids, “snatch[ing] angled breaths over all the tangle of hair in my face”, to waking up to “a million notifications... from other mums about the potato person we are supposed to have made, ready for school”. But the book’s crisis comes when the narrator, after a hesitant yes from her husband, brings Kit on their family holiday to the Welsh coast, which ends abruptly after a harmless accident compels them to weigh their duty to Kit against their duty to their children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/kit-by-megan-barker-review-roads-not-taken">Continue reading...</a>

## Parisian panache: six of the most spectacular Paris Métro stations

<p>Grand designs will feature in a major expansion of the Paris Métro, but there is plenty of theatricality, beauty and swagger on show at existing stations</p><p>One aspect of the Paris Métro is minimalism. Most stations are simply white subterranean vaults with no surface building to sully the beauty of the streets. Sometimes, a station entrance is indicated by art nouveau iron flowers of no known genus (except possibly triffid), and these – the creations of Hector Guimard in the early 1900s – signify the flamboyance that coexists with the minimalism.</p><p>The sheer theatricality of some stations reflects a society that accords engineers a high status (the UK has no real equivalent of the elite engineering school École Polytechnique) and encourages them to make bold statements. This kind of swagger is evident in the Eiffel Tower and the Pompidou Centre. It will also be manifest in the huge new stations of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/12/paris-23-billion-euros-grand-express-metro-expansion-unify-city">Grand Paris Express scheme</a> which, between now and 2030, will double Métro mileage.

<p>This documentary about women who make an epic annual trek across a rocky mountain pass draws an intriguing contrast between the vast landscapes and intimate family dynamics</p><p>Baato – “the path” in Nepali – is the extraordinary journey taken annually by villagers living in rural Nepal, as they transport huge bundles of medicinal herbs to the city of Dharan for sale. Following a tradition that has existed for more than a century, Mikma and her family cover a distance of 300 miles by foot over five arduous days. Wrapped around steep and rocky mountains, the trails are treacherous and gruelling, while the obstacles they face are more than physical: they have to deal with administrative hassle, corruption and infrastructure development.</p><p>Closely following this resilient group of travellers – which largely consists of women carrying enormous loads on their shoulders with astonishing ease – the film draws a striking contrast between the scenery of Nepali highlands and the intimate dynamics of Mikma’s family. As they take the occasional breaks for food and rest, their spirited conversations attest to the growing tension between tradition and modernity. The absence of young men on these annual treks is a prime example of this tug-and-pull; many have left the village for a brighter economic future elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/baato-review-astonishing-500-mile-walk-to-bring-herbs-to-market-in-nepal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We switched close but stifling social networks for a capitalist safety net that offered modern life choices. Now we don’t have either</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jane is a junior doctor working several extra locum shifts to make ends meet. Burnt out after the pandemic, and struggling with her physical and mental health, she would really like to take unpaid leave, but she cannot afford to do so. Last month, her landlord hiked up her rent, then served her with an eviction notice when she said she couldn’t afford it. She now has to move for the fourth time in three years, and is back in a flat-hunting market where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/21/private-rents-outside-london-rose-third-four-years-rightmove">rents are higher</a> everywhere.</p><p>She feels trapped, she tells me. Trapped in her job, with her accommodation options diminishing and her time permanently constrained by balancing long work hours with the demands of looking for a home. There is no space for socialising or relaxation, only for a fleeting sleep, from which she wakes up to go back to work, to look at places to live that are almost certainly out of her reach, and to run her numbers again, hoping that an overlooked saving will magically appear.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/liberal-economics-free-social-capitalist-safety-net">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The founder of Compass has been a Labour member for over 40 years. But last month he was invited to defend himself over a two-year-old tweet - and he now awaits the party’s judgment</p><p>About a month ago, Neal Lawson, a member of Labour since the late 70s, got a letter from the party’s governance and legal unit, inviting him to defend himself over a two-year-old tweet. His apparent offence? He had praised an example of cooperation between the Lib Dems and the Green party, saying: “This is what grown-up politics looks like.” If this was deemed to be an incitement to vote for a party other than Labour, he was warned, he would be in breach of party rules and expelled.</p><p>“Whether I’m a member of the Labour party or not is inconsequential,” Lawson insists, when I meet him in his south London offices. But it was quite a slap in the face for a man who has been so intimately involved with the party. He has spent 20 years as the head of the membership organisation Compass. Today, it focuses on the progressive alliance – how parties with shared values can cooperate to beat the Conservatives, rather than splitting the vote. But when he founded Compass in 2003, it was conceived as a critical friend to Labour, a sort of Cassandra-chorus of the soft left, to remind the government what its values were. Over the years, it has campaigned on issues such as high executive pay and loan sharks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/neal-lawson-on-the-threat-of-expulsion-by-labour-they-are-making-sure-no-one-on-the-left-has-a-platform">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Their hits have filled dancefloors for over 40 years. As Kool &amp; the Gang embark on another round of summer gigs, founder Robert ‘Kool’ Bell reveals the secrets of their success</p><p>It was after a gig in France a few years back that Robert “Kool” Bell found himself in receipt of an unlikely business proposition. “The promoter came to me and said: ‘Listen, your concerts are sold out – how would you like to sell bottles of champagne at your shows?’ I said: ‘Well, how many of my fans want a bottle of champagne after a concert? They want T-shirts and caps, that kind of thing,’” he shrugs. “Then he said that what he really wanted to do was get it on the shelves, like Dom Pérignon and Cristal. He wanted to take me to d’Epernay, to Rheims – the Champagne region. So I went over and we made Le Kool champagne. The name,” he adds, “has that French vibe to it.”</p><p>I didn’t imagine I would end up discussing Premier Crus, terroir and the ongoing plans to revise the boundaries of the Champagne region when I arrived at Bell’s hotel in Docklands, London. Still, there’s something telling about it: someone was prepared to market a Kool &amp; the Gang-branded champagne 40 years after the band’s commercial peak, which says a lot about the deathlessness of their hits.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/kool-the-gang-robert-bell">Continue reading...</a>
