The version of British Vogue that Enninful has helmed for the past six years has defined itself as a portrait of aspirational Britain that is never, to put it bluntly, all-white. Black models are a consistent, high-profile presence rather than an afterthought. The April 2023 magazine, with the coverline The New Supers, starred three models \u2013 all non-white, all non-sample size, all photographed full-length rather than in the zoomed-in closeup that fashion traditionally chooses for non-skinny models. People of all genders and all skin colours, disabled bodies, bigger bodies, octogenarians alongside teens, are included in the aspirational vision of the country\u2019s premier glossy magazine.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because Vogue is the paper of record for the beautiful people. Vogue has always been not just about fashion, but about status and visibility. Vogue is the top table of what glamour looks like. Diversity has become a non-negotiable aspect of that guest list \u2013 and this has a knock-on effect on worlds adjacent to fashion. Say, for example, that you are the person in charge of throwing a high-profile party to celebrate the opening of a venue that is angling to become the latest place to be, or putting together a lineup of influencer-ambassadors to represent your new beauty or wellness brand. The trickledown effect from Vogue is that the optics will look way off \u2013 hopelessly unfashionable, embarrassingly out of touch \u2013 if the lineup of faces fails to embrace diversity.

But to a cosmologist there is something even more intriguing than the boggling numbers themselves, which is the question of how all these stars and galaxies were created over a period of 13.8 billion years. It\u2019s the ultimate prehistoric adventure. Life cannot evolve without a planet, planets do not form without stars, stars must be cradled within galaxies, and galaxies would not exist without a richly structured universe to support them. Our origins are written in the sky, and we are just learning how to read them.</p><p>It once seemed that, for all its immensity, the cosmos could be understood through the application of a small number of rigid physical laws. Newton encapsulated this idea, showing how apples falling from trees and planetary orbits around our sun arise from the same force, gravity. This kind of radical unification of earthly and heavenly phenomena survives in modern teaching: all the innumerable molecules, atoms and subatomic particles in the universe are expected to obey the same set of laws. Most of the evidence suggests that this assumption holds true, so it should follow that perfecting our understanding of these laws will resolve any remaining questions about cosmic history.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/the-big-idea-why-the-laws-of-physics-will-never-explain-the-universe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/the-big-idea-why-the-laws-of-physics-will-never-explain-the-universe", "date_published": "2023-07-24T11:30:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "ClientEarth loses high court fight with Shell over climate strategy", "description": "<p>Environmental law charity claims energy firm cannot achieve net zero goal with current transition plan</p><p>An environmental law charity has lost an attempt to revive a lawsuit against Shell over its climate strategy after the high court in London refused permission to bring a case against the energy company.</p><p>ClientEarth, which holds 27 shares in Shell, argues that the company cannot achieve its aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 with its current climate transition strategy, and its directors are therefore breaching their duties to shareholders.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/24/clientearth-high-court-fight-shell-climate-strategy-net-zero\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/24/clientearth-high-court-fight-shell-climate-strategy-net-zero", "date_published": "2023-07-24T11:29:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "England name unchanged Ashes squad and face Anderson call for final Test", "description": "<ul><li>Ollie Robinson or Josh Tongue could replace fast bowler</li><li>Moeen Ali likely to continue at No 3 in batting line-up</li></ul><p>England have named an unchanged squad for the final Ashes Test of the summer with a decision now required over Jimy Anderson\u2019s involvement at the Oval.</p><p>The Manchester weather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/23/england-and-stokes-ponder-fine-margins-after-failure-to-regain-ashes\">washed out play</a> on Sunday and wrecked England\u2019s hopes of setting up a winner-takes-all decider this week.

Playwright and lyricist <a href=\"https://www.meganbarker.co.uk/quiet-river-of-dust\">Megan Barker</a> follows suit in this poignant debut about the pain of witnessing a loved one\u2019s depression at close quarters. Or at least that\u2019s how I read it: the book, 160 pages long, raw as well as wrought, is narrated by a woman, Megan, who loses a male friend<strong> \u2013 </strong>the titular Kit \u2013 in circumstances that, as with much else here, you\u2019re invited to infer; told in bittersweet retrospect, it\u2019s a novel of spaces and gaps, of things that didn\u2019t happen or might have happened, or ought to have.<br /><br />Megan and Kit meet in the 90s while living in Glasgow. Their friendship is joyous, intense, platonic-ish \u2013 she\u2019s attached and he\u2019s sleeping with her flatmate, which she finds herself overhearing more keenly than she\u2019d like.</p><p>After a snapshot of their early 20s \u2013 nights out, plans, ambitions \u2013 we cut to London (\u201clast year\u201d) as they\u2019re catching up in middle age over a curry. But Kit doesn\u2019t look well \u2013 there\u2019s an oblique reference to whether his drugs are working or not \u2013 and he has stalled (we think) on a photography PhD, talking about an ex-girlfriend who aborted a child he wanted. Megan, for her part, is knee-deep in what she calls, not altogether joking, \u201cthe Great Betrayal\u201d, wed with three young children:<br /><br />\u201cMy daughter never sleeps.<br />My marriage is on its knees.<br />I speak in ultimatums.<br />I have become a gaoler of wild things...<br />All deep thought has been replaced with lists.\u201d<br /><br />Much of <em>Kit</em>\u2019s texture comes from the granular rendering of its narrator\u2019s push-pull emotions around motherhood, from lying sleeplessly at night in a bed crowded with unsettled kids, \u201csnatch[ing] angled breaths over all the tangle of hair in my face\u201d, to waking up to \u201ca million notifications... from other mums about the potato person we are supposed to have made, ready for school\u201d. But the book\u2019s crisis comes when the narrator, after a hesitant yes from her husband, brings Kit on their family holiday to the Welsh coast, which ends abruptly after a harmless accident compels them to weigh their duty to Kit against their duty to their children.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/kit-by-megan-barker-review-roads-not-taken\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/kit-by-megan-barker-review-roads-not-taken", "date_published": "2023-07-24T06:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Parisian panache: six of the most spectacular Paris M\u00e9tro stations", "description": "<p>Grand designs will feature in a major expansion of the Paris M\u00e9tro, but there is plenty of theatricality, beauty and swagger on show at existing stations</p><p>One aspect of the Paris M\u00e9tro is minimalism.
