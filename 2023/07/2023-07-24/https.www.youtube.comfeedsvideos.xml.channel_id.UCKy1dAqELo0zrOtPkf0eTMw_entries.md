Heels showrunner and executive producer Mike O’Malley also portrays Charlie Gully on the series. Michael Waldron is the show creator. Christopher Donnelly , Pete Segal, Patrick Walmsley, and Julie Yorn also serve as executive producers on the series. Heels is produced through O'Malley Ink and LBI Entertainment in association with Lionsgate Television for STARZ.

When the university’s dark secrets come to light, the students must come to grips with what type of heroes they are going to become.

Serving as co-executive producers are Brant Englestein, Sarah Carbiener, Lisa Kussner, Gabriel Garcia, Aisha Porter-Christie, Judalina Neira, and Loreli Alanís.
