In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. When Reggie (Will Ferrell), a na\u00efve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. But once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Oscar\u00ae winner Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. Determined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug's pals--Maggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner's new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who's stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal--together hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home... and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It's not his foot.)\n\n\u25ba Learn more: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strays_2023?cmp=Trailers_YouTube_Desc \n\nWatch More:  \n\u25ba Rotten Tomatoes Originals: http://bit.ly/2D3sipV    \n\u25ba Fresh New Clips: https://bit.ly/3mJePrv    \n\u25ba Hot New Trailers: http://bit.ly/2qThrsF   \n\u25ba New TV This Week: https://bit.ly/3Or3I2w   \n \nRotten Tomatoes TRAILERS delivers hot new trailers, exclusive content, and first looks for all the best upcoming movies.
