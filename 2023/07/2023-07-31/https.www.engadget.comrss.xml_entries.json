Rafaela Vasquez will serve three years of probation for her role in the 2018 Tempe, Arizona collision that killed Elaine Herzberg while she was jaywalking at night. The sentence honors the prosecutors' demands and is stiffer than the six months the defense team requested.</p><p>The prosecution maintained that Vasquez was ultimately responsible. While an autonomous car was involved, Vasquez was supposed to concentrate on the road and take over if necessary. The modified Volvo XC90 in the crash was operating at Level 3 autonomy and could be hands-free in limited conditions, but required the driver to take over at a moment's notice. It noticed Herzberg but didn't respond to her presence.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The defense case hinged on partly blaming Uber. Executives at the company thought it was just a matter of time before a crash occurred, according to supposedly leaked conversations. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-24-ntsb-preliminary-report-uber-self-driving-crash-emergency-braking.html\">collision findings</a> also noted that Uber had disabled the emergency braking system on the XC90, so the vehicle couldn't come to an abrupt stop.</p><p>Tempe police maintained that Vasquez had been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-22-uber-self-driving-crash-driver-watching-hulu.html\">watching a show on Hulu</a> and wasn't paying attention during the crash. Defense attorneys have insisted that Vasquez was paying attention and had only been momentarily distracted.</p><p>The plea and sentencing could influence how other courts handle similar cases. There's long been a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-07-the-uk-gets-its-first-driverless-car-insurer.html\">question of liability</a> surrounding mostly driverless cars \u2014 is the human responsible for a crash, or is the manufacturer at fault? This suggests humans will still face penalties if they can take control, even if the punishment isn't as stiff for conventional situations.</p><p>Fatal crashes with autonomy involved aren't new. Tesla has been at least partly blamed for collisions <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-12-ntsb-blame-driver-tech-fatal-tesla-crash.html\">while Full Self Driving was active</a>. The pedestrian case is unique, though, and looms in the background of more recent Level 4 (fully driverless in limited situations) offerings and tests from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/waymo-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-094718022.html\">Waymo</a> and GM's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-06-gm-cruise-to-receive-2-25-billion-softbank-investment.html\">Cruise</a>.While the technology has evolved since 2018, there are still <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-asks-california-regulators-to-halt-or-slow-driverless-vehicle-testing-083906662.html\">calls to freeze robotaxi rollouts</a> over fears the machines could pose safety risks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uber-safety-driver-involved-in-fatal-self-driving-car-crash-pleads-guilty-212616187.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/uber-safety-driver-involved-in-fatal-self-driving-car-crash-pleads-guilty-212616187.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T21:26:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Water-soluble circuit boards could cut carbon footprints by 60 percent", "description": "<p>German semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies AG <a href=\"https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/market-news/2023/INFGIP202307-137.html\">announced</a> that it\u2019s producing a printed circuit board (PCB) that dissolves in water.

The pitch was to reinvent radio with \u201can <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/run-the-airwaves-with-amp-the-live-radio-app-from-amazon\">infinite dial of shows</a>.\u201d Amp offers users access to a vast, built-in music library to create their own DJ sets with. No need to buy songs or flirt with the DMCA, just make a playlist, go live, talk in between tracks, follow the chat and even invite callers. When I wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-dj-app-140031755.html\">a year ago</a>, it showed promise, but it was iOS only, light on users and had a limited feature set.</p><p>A little over a year later and Amp is reaching an important milestone: It\u2019s finally <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmFtYXpvbi5hbXAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg5MWVlOTNjLWJmZmUtNGRjZS04MzRiLTZhOWQ1ZGVmNjI4YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAU-bywQqhc2wUAjmKuJXsyUBZTcTugalSvJGVEB6mUYw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.amazon.amp\">available on Android</a>. Amp is Amazon\u2019s first home-grown streaming platform and the year-plus stint as an Apple exclusive meant it enjoyed a level of technical predictability and a self-imposed restriction on growth and user numbers. But as the doors open to the other half of the mobile universe, it\u2019s about to be exposed to the full reality of competing in an already busy social-creator landscape.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Growing beyond iOS is an important move for Amp, even if the platform technically remains in beta (and US-only). But the wider reach of Google\u2019s operating system \u2014 from TVs to Chromebooks and beyond \u2014 will be a decisive step in the process of Amazon proving it can build a viable streaming platform from the ground up (rather than acquire an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-25-amazon-buying-twitch.html\">already successful one</a>).</p><p>You can, of course, find DJ sessions and internet radio in myriad places online. Whether it\u2019s big platforms like YouTube and TikTok or more direct rivals like <a href=\"https://www.stationhead.com/\">Stationhead</a> or Tidal (via its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tidals-listening-party-feature-is-now-widely-available-205035086.html\">Live Sessions</a> feature) and even Amazon Music\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-dj-app-140031755.html\">DJ Mode</a>, there are several destinations for live curated music streams. Of course, let\u2019s not forget Amazon-owned Twitch, which is teeming with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-twitch-artist-livestreams-135926372.html\">tune spinners</a>. Oh, and there\u2019s obviously FM radio, too. This obviously begs the question: What makes Amp unique?</p><figure><img alt=\"Guest DJ on Amp, Zach Sang, is pictured in a press shot.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/e9f3b5c0-2d2f-11ee-bf5f-bfb19395ab16\" style=\"height: 1125px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amazon</div></figure><p>\u201cIt's very much like Sirius meets YouTube,\u201d Zach Sang, one of Amp\u2019s contracted creators, and former broadcast DJ told Engadget. \u201cIt's real life, legacy career broadcasters mixed with the future of those broadcasters. It's everybody coming together, it's radio democratized. It's a way that radio genuinely should be programmed: for people and not for profit,\u201d he added. From a user\u2019s point of view, Amp\u2019s main differentiator appears to be its focus on radio and radio-style shows specifically. Plus that built-in music library (Stationhead, for example, requires you to have either Apple Music or Spotify at your own cost).</p><p>I asked user Christina \u201cCriti\u201d Gonzalez, who hosts her own daily show, how she\u2019d describe Amp. \u201c[It\u2019s] a very unique, weird place where you're able to listen to all the music you've forgotten about, didn't know about and crave to hear, again with personalities and so many people of all different walks of life that have one common interest - music.\u201d</p><p>Amp Co-Founder, Matt Sandler - who used to work at LA\u2019s KROQ FM \u2013 explained that he felt all of the existing options weren\u2019t quite giving listeners <em>or</em> creators what they wanted. \u201cIf you posted a job for KROQ and an on air position, you'd get hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of submissions and people who wanted to curate music and talk to the community on air,\u201d he told Engadget. \u201cThere have been lots of services built around live connection or music or community. One of the things that I think will drive the success of a business like this is really that balance between scale and connection.\u201d</p><p>Amp signed deals with celebrities and established presenters such as Nicki Minaj, Joe Budden, Nick Cannon and the aforementioned Sang to give the platform some known-name appeal, and it\u2019s done so without creating much of a barrier around them compared to regular creators. Your show can sit right next to Nicki Minaj\u2019s in the listings. Although the roster covers large genres like hip-hop, sports, country and pop there\u2019s not much in the way of alt/indie or electronic in that lineup right now.</p><p>Unlike Clubhouse, which enjoyed an early surge of popularity, Amp has largely gone under the radar since launch. \u201cThe thing we're maniacally focused on every day is making sure that the product is right before stepping out and bigger and bigger fashion,\u201d Sandler said. But many people I\u2019ve mentioned it to aren\u2019t aware of it \u2013 and Amp\u2019s not even included on the list of Amazon products/services <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Amazon_products_and_services\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot from the Amazon Amp website with some show highlights.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/37da2f30-2d30-11ee-b2b7-8f6687a1646c\" style=\"height: 555px; width: 965px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amazon</div></figure><p>The app is clearly a lot busier than when I wrote about it just after launch, but the average number of listeners for most shows remains frustratingly low for most shows (based on multiple user reports and other publicly visible data). But several users explained they weren\u2019t discouraged. \u201cThe community that it has right now, it's a small enough space for people to feel like they're connected, even if they don't know each other.\u201d Gonzalez said.</p><p>At the beginning, according to Sandler, even Amp's leadership was unsure in which direction the platform would unfold. There was the possibility that the big-name artists would dominate while regular users gravitated to being listeners. In reality, it\u2019s the smaller, home-grown shows and the aforementioned community that has made Amp a nice place to hang out.</p><p>\u201cThe culture there is so inviting.\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI feel like other social media sites can turn negative quickly. I haven't had much experience with that on Amp and I appreciate that.\u201d Adding, \u201dIt's crazy what the experience on Amp has done, because I truly honestly say to anyone that's not an Amp to join it, because it really will change your perspective.\u201d</p><p>One of the main complaints I had with Amp right after launch was that hosts needed at least one listener to be able to play a song and often that meant\u2026 waiting. There was also no way to communicate with any listeners you <em>did</em> have. Today the awkward waits are (mostly) gone and each stream has its own chat room which has switched it from a one-directional platform to the collection of friendly gatherings that it has become today.</p><p>Several creators and listeners have told me they\u2019ve created genuine connections and friendships that have spilled over into real life. The chat rooms in shows are a rare mix of positivity, musical discourse and humor. Trolling and negativity is unusually rare and it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s a real sense of commitment to the app. But at some point it needs to expand to stop it becoming a circular economy where everyone is both a host and a listener.</p><p>Amp doesn\u2019t share information about user numbers or demographics, but the typical host and listener right now, perhaps unsurprisingly, appears to mirror the generations that were brought up on mix tapes and burning albums to CD. Where sharing music was more tactile and a little bit slower. In the nicest possible way, the community energy often feels like the best bits of early internet chat rooms. Like many music-first spaces online, there\u2019s little in the way of negativity, and while many creators may fall into a similar age group, a variety of backgrounds has been a defining factor since day one.</p><figure><img alt=\"Three screenshots together showing different elements of Nicki Minaj's radio show on Amp.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/dacccc50-2d37-11ee-bdbf-24d09bc2feff\" style=\"height: 983px; width: 1488px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amazon</div></figure><p>The positive community is Amp\u2019s to lose though. As it opens up to Android, the door to even more users opens, and with that the challenge of scaling up the platform while maintaining what keeps it special. And there\u2019s also the matter of money. Right now, Amp pays out many of its hosts via an opaque creator fund. \u201cOne of the things that we're focused on is making sure that creators can earn through the service over time, not just through the fund, but through other mechanisms as well.\u201d Sandler said. When I asked about subs, tipping and other Twitch-esque ways to earn money he added \u201cThose are all things you could easily imagine in the service.\u201d</p><p>For now, the creator fund is helping keep hosts motivated, but Amp will need to provide realistic alternative revenue streams to keep creators around (and, of course, lure in more). But perhaps the bigger investment Amp needs is in itself. It\u2019s hard to find much in the way of outward promotion of the app and the best tool for promoting its best creators are its own social channels. If Amp can make itself more visible, it can grow the user base which in turn makes that creator economy, be it tipping, subs and beyond, more viable.</p><p>There are also occasional technical issues that remind you the app is still in beta, which an injection of new users, on a new operating system no less, might exacerbate. Mostly, it\u2019s small annoyances like the chat swallowing your last message. Occasionally, it\u2019s more dramatic like a stream crashing or a host being booted out of their own show.</p><p>\u201cThe glitchiness causes some frustration. And, sometimes that can change your experience doing the show and with others listening. So once those kinks get ironed out, I feel like the creators will feel more comfortable and less anxious while they're doing sets\u201d Gonzalez said. Users have even coined the phrase \u201cAmp be Ampin\u2019\u201d as a refrain to the inevitable quirkiness that happens every couple of weeks or after an update.</p><p>Where does the app go from here? \u201cI think there's a big opportunity for amp specifically to move charts and culture around the world. And that means personalities, spinning music, having conversations and developing communities that exist in the app but that have social currency outside of the app as well.\u201d Sandler said. Sang on the other hand thinks it\u2019s a way to keep the spirit of radio going. \u201cIt's not like there's any major radio stars on the come up. So it's like, where are they going to come from? Let them come from Amp.\u201d</p><p>Or, as Gonzalez was quick to point out, sometimes, it\u2019s just about the music. \u201cThere are certain creators that talk through their experience or a memory or something like that. And it completely changes how I looked at the song to begin with\u201d she said. \u201cI love the community so much, but it's also just the variety, being exposed to certain genres. So I love that and ever since I've been really addicted.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-is-trying-to-reinvent-radio-194634553.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-is-trying-to-reinvent-radio-194634553.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T19:46:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best streaming devices you can buy in 2023", "description": "<p>If you're in the market for a new streaming device, chances are you want to improve your home theater experience. Maybe you've been relying on your phone or tablet for binge-watch sessions, or perhaps your TV's built-in operating system just isn't cutting it anymore. Streaming dongles, like the Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite, and set-top boxes, like the Apple TV 4K, are ubiquitous at this point, but sussing out the differences between them can be challenging. Plus, they're not the only gadgets that can deliver your latest Netflix or Peacock obsession to your TV screen. Let us break down all of the options you have today and give you our picks for the best streaming device you can buy.</p><h2>Who needs a streaming device?</h2><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that if you only use a couple of streaming services (say, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video),  you might not need a standalone streaming device. Most modern televisions ship with a basic selection of apps that usually include the most popular streaming services. Some TVs and soundbars run on built-in Roku or Fire TV operating systems, which offer a robust selection of apps without the need for a separate device.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But if your TV is on the older side, adding a streaming stick is obviously much cheaper than shelling out for a new smart TV. Also, a dedicated streaming device typically has access to a lot more streaming services and apps, while content is often presented more intuitively. Some devices also offer better search features, including voice control. Cord cutters in particular will benefit from this sort of streaming hardware, as live TV services like Sling TV and Hulu Live aren\u2019t always available in basic TV interfaces.</p><h2>How to pick a streaming device</h2><p>The most important things to keep in mind when choosing a media streaming device are platform, price and what you already have in your home. Currently, the most popular streaming platforms are Roku, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, Apple TV and Google TV (which is an overlay on top of Android TV). All of them offer a similar selection of streaming services, with the primary differences being the user interface. Roku, for example, has a basic grid layout, while Fire TV and Google TV emphasize personalized recommendations.</p><p>The prices for streaming devices typically start at around $30, and can go all the way up to $200. Sticks or dongles are generally more affordable, while set-top boxes tend to be pricier. The main reason to opt for a streaming box over a dongle is if you need Ethernet connectivity. Some models also have additional features like Ethernet ports and faster wireless connections. (Roku\u2019s set-top boxes, for example, have Dolby Vision, while its sticks don\u2019t.) Another benefit of a set-top box is that they\u2019re faster than older TV processors and are easier to upgrade over time.</p><p>There are some feature differences, too. Fire TV uses Alexa for voice commands, for example, while Google TV uses Google Assistant. In fact, when it comes to devices from Amazon, Google and Apple, it\u2019s generally best to pick one that belongs in a previously chosen ecosystem. So if you\u2019re already a committed iTunes user, an Apple TV would make more sense than the Fire TV. This isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule, of course: If you depend more on a streaming service than on buying or renting shows, the ecosystem question isn\u2019t quite as relevant. We\u2019ll get more into the details of each system later in this guide.</p><p>Below are some recommendations for the best streaming sticks and other budget-friendly options. We also included suggestions for set-top boxes and devices geared toward gamers.</p><h2>Best streaming stick: Roku Streaming Stick 4K</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2t1LVN0cmVhbWluZy1EZXZpY2UtVmlzaW9uLUNvbnRyb2xzL2RwL0IwOUJLQ0RYWkMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeD6Zl5kC5bCB1ZHeOCV6uvO4SfIINjXpS_BM6t8oUKw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls%2Fdp%2FB09BKCDXZC%2F\">Roku Streaming Stick 4K,</a> plus earlier iterations like the Streaming Stick+, has long been an Engadget favorite, and for good reason: It packs a lot of features into a small and affordable package. It has a straightforward user interface along with the widest selection of streaming TV options. All you need to do to set it up is plug it into your TV\u2019s HDMI input and attach the power cable to your TV\u2019s USB port. After that, you can finish the rest of the installation process via the TV interface and Roku remote.</p><p>As mentioned, Roku has a large selection of content. According to the company, you can choose to stream from more than 500,000 movies and TV episodes. Another useful feature is Roku\u2019s universal search function, which can find shows across a variety of platforms without prioritizing one over another. In contrast, Amazon\u2019s streaming platform prioritizes search results from its own Prime video service.</p><p>The Roku Streaming Stick 4K also supports Apple AirPlay 2, so it\u2019s great for those who want to stream from Macs or iOS devices. Additionally, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K supports 4K, HDR streaming and Dolby Vision.</p><p>We especially like Roku\u2019s private-listening feature that lets you listen to shows using headphones, which is useful if you don\u2019t want to disturb other members of your household. You can do this via the Roku TV app, which is available on both iOS and Android. The app also works as an alternative to the physical remote control. This is especially handy for entering login and password information, which is a lot easier to do with a smartphone keyboard than having to hunt and peck using the remote.</p><p>In addition to the remote, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K also responds to voice commands, which you can use to search for your favorite shows, adjust the volume or enable closed captioning.</p><p>If you want an upgraded remote, consider upgrading to the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUJLQ1FZUk4vcmVmPWFzX2xpX3NzX3RsP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdVLMisE6xpyQLUjaqL0NkqVRDODa4_baPW6e5EU5-n-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09BKCQYRN%2Fref%3Das_li_ss_tl\">Roku Streaming Stick 4K+</a>. It has all the features of the Streaming Stick 4K, except it comes with the rechargeable Roku Voice Remote Pro as well. You can find your lost remote by saying \u201cHey Roku, where\u2019s my remote?\u201d and it has a built-in 3.5mm headphone jack so you can use the private listening mode without the app. The Roku Voice Remote Pro is almost $20 more than the Streaming Stick 4K, however, so unless you really need that fancy remote, we recommend the Streaming Stick 4K instead.</p><h2>Runner up: Chromecast with Google TV</h2><p></p><p>For years, Google\u2019s Chromecast was a dongle without a remote. It was simply used to stream shows from your phone or laptop to the TV. The updated <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEtSVjdTMjI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZmwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI1NTdmMTBhLWE4MzctNDBiMy1hYWE2LTRhZTc3YzJmOTAzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARwwjrJF1Znd_dFv5j8sxdkim6fB6HDDT-MrDxAZIMVt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08KRV7S22\">Chromecast with Google TV</a>, however, is completely different. Not only does it now have a dedicated remote control, but it ushers in a brand new menu interface plus Google Assistant smarts. While the Roku might be our overall pick, the Google Chromecast is best for those who like a more personalized interface and robust voice controls.</p><p>The highlight of the new Chromecast is Google TV, which is actually a revamped version of Android TV. The home screen is personalized based on your watching habits. There\u2019s a rotating carousel of trending TV shows, curated top picks as well as category headers like \u201cContinue watching\u201d and \u201cTrending on Google.\u201d We especially appreciate the \u201cContinue Watching\u201d row as it offers a quick shortcut to catch up on programming you were \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 already watching.</p><p>There are also algorithm-generated recommendations such as \u201cShows about aliens\u201d or \u201cShows about murder.\u201d What\u2019s nice is that most of the suggested shows are from services you\u2019re already subscribed to. If you\u2019re a YouTube TV subscriber, you\u2019ll appreciate the Live TV tab, which acts as a channel guide for the service. Google has said, however, that the tab should eventually work with other live TV services such as Sling or Hulu Live.</p><p>We also like that Google TV gives a lot of information about a specific show or movie, such as the Rotten Tomatoes rating and all of the different ways you can watch it. You can also add it to your watchlist right from the show page, regardless of what TV streaming service it\u2019s on. Renting or buying the show can only be done from the Google Play Movies &amp; TV store, however.</p><p>One of our favorite features of the new Chromecast is Google Assistant integration. You can make general queries, like asking for a five-day weather forecast. Best of all, contextual queries like \u201cFind movies with Bill Murray\u201d and \u201cShow me true crime documentaries\u201d all turn up highly relevant results. You can also control the TV entirely with voice commands, including powering it on and off and adjusting the volume.</p><p>The Chromecast with Google TV supports 4K HDR as well as Dolby Vision. However, it doesn\u2019t support Apple's AirPlay 2 protocol so it\u2019s not quite as compatible with Macs and iOS devices. It also doesn\u2019t currently carry Apple TV+ or iTunes videos. We should also note that unlike other streaming sticks, the latest Google Chromecast can\u2019t be powered by a TV\u2019s USB port; you\u2019ll have to use the included 7.5-watt power adapter instead.</p><h2>Best budget streaming device: Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite</h2><p></p><p>If price is of the utmost importance and you don\u2019t need 4K, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1lOTEJTN1IvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe-lj6bjW23mp7GrPWRpjS-jGHh21WrXxjYMQQ5wz6GC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07YNLBS7R%2F\">Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick Lite</a> is a decent alternative. At $30, it\u2019s one of the cheapest streaming sticks on the market (it\u2019s also frequently discounted, too). It supports FHD streaming with HDR and, just like its higher-end siblings, comes with an Alexa voice remote.</p><p>One of the reasons this is considered \u201cLite\u201d is that this particular Fire TV Stick can\u2019t control your TV; you still have to use your television remote to power it on and off or to adjust its volume. That\u2019s not that big a deal, especially if it helps save you a few bucks. In comparison, the standard <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEMxVzVOODc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZmwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI1NTdmMTBhLWE4MzctNDBiMy1hYWE2LTRhZTc3YzJmOTAzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXlG7-z5BgV4M3G48hv32hAtrHrWJO2qIlsCRVC8jPLO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08C1W5N87\">Fire TV Stick</a> typically retails for $40, while the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFhWWVoxWTUvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcO6yDSUwPJ7HnuRFgD0tsNrykiFvMziCbx34MLHpPFK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08XVYZ1Y5%2F\">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> costs $50.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s Fire TV supports nearly all of the major streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, YouTube, YouTube TV and Hulu, among others. The Live page features Twitch out of the box. While you can\u2019t use Alexa to control the TV, the Fire TV Stick Lite does let you use Alexa to search for shows and ask general questions like the weather forecast or the latest scores for your favorite sports team.</p><p>Despite its low price, the Fire TV Stick Lite is a decent streaming dongle. It comes with the updated Fire TV interface that adds features such as user profiles, a new main menu navigation bar with show recommendations, plus a scrolling list of your favorite streaming apps.</p><p>The layout isn\u2019t quite as intuitive as Google TV\u2019s and is more complicated than Roku\u2019s, but it\u2019s still easy enough to figure out. That said, the interface tends to prioritize Amazon Prime Video content, and there are a lot more ads than on other streaming platforms. It\u2019s not the best streaming device out there, but it\u2019s the best buy if you don't have a smart TV and want to update an older set while spending as little as possible.</p><p>For a little more money, you could also upgrade to either the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFhWWVoxWTUvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcO6yDSUwPJ7HnuRFgD0tsNrykiFvMziCbx34MLHpPFK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08XVYZ1Y5%2F\">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> or the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOE1RWlhOMVgvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUJle3qAvQkby0wnKrXSACFfL8kUeoiWgo31lOOqFSCz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08MQZXN1X%2F\">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>. Both feature 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, but the Max has WiFi 6 support and a faster processor.</p><h2>Another budget option: Roku Express</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1dWRkNWSk4vP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT77uX3qiyfFyOQNSkwIiiPDQwB1zciv-w3TbZUgdqZA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07WVFCVJN%2F\">Roku Express</a> has the same user interface as the Streaming Stick+, but it\u2019s housed in a compact set-top box instead. It doesn\u2019t support 4K or HDR and the remote control lacks a voice command button. But if all you want is a capable HD streaming device, the Express fits the bill. If you insist on having 4K, however, consider the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTE2VEtGRjIvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeIHd3VdyKEiRpyvPq4odcjjYpqzI4k4tIkniO3xsktn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0916TKFF2%2F\">Roku Express 4K+</a>, which retails for $40. It\u2019s very similar to the Express, except it carries support for 4K, HDR and AirPlay, and it comes with a voice remote as well. That could well make it worth the extra money.</p><h2>Best set-top box: Roku Ultra</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVQ0VlpEWVYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeCv9brqsdhoUyBXU_l4mWwo_C8Y2ojfUeZ3clMDTcJr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09T4VZDYV%2F\">Roku Ultra</a> has the same features of the Streaming Stick+ and then some. There\u2019s a wide selection of content, a simple user interface and support for 4K HDR streaming, AirPlay2 and voice commands. On top of that, the Ultra adds Dolby Vision support along with HDR 10+, USB connections, a microSD slot for external media, and Ethernet connectivity.</p><p>Like the Streaming Stick 4K+, the Ultra comes with Roku\u2019s Voice Remote Pro. The remote also features a couple of programmable shortcut keys that you can map to specific commands, like \u201cLaunch YouTube\u201d or \u201cPlay classical music.\u201d Best of all, the Ultra features a remote finder in case you lose it in between your couch cushions. The Ultra is definitely the most capable Roku device on the market, but you\u2019ll have to pay quite a bit more for it.</p><h2>Best premium streamer: Apple TV 4K</h2><p></p><p>For those who want a slightly higher-end option and have a lot of Apple devices, the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQkpMRFZKVEMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeAhsSANR6AHEV91TGJBQ7fd1oLenitJA37vaFM2_rDH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BJLDVJTC%2F\">Apple TV 4K</a> could be worth a splurge. It can stream in 4K HDR and Dolby Vision, plus it supports AirPlay 2 for streaming from Mac and iOS devices. The tvOS platform has an attractive and clean user interface that\u2019s also easy to use. There\u2019s also a \u201cOne Home Screen\u201d feature that lets you sync apps and their layout across multiple Apple TVs, and you can use Siri to search for your favorite shows. And ever since Apple revamped the Siri remote included with the box, it's been much easier to navigate between apps, scroll through content and generally find what you're looking for quickly.</p><p>As you might expect, the Apple TV is also the only set-top box that works with the entire Apple ecosystem. This means that you can use the Apple TV to buy and rent movies from iTunes, access music and podcasts, play games from Apple Arcade and run apps like Fitness+, Apple\u2019s line of workout classes.</p><p>iPhone owners in particular are likely to benefit from owning an Apple TV. You can hold your handset up to the box during setup to transfer all of your settings and enter passwords directly through the Remote app, which is itself easily accessible via iOS\u2019s control center.</p><h2>Best for gamers: NVIDIA Shield TV Pro</h2><p></p><p>For those who want an all-in-one device that lets you stream movies, run a PLEX media server and play games, consider <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1lQOUZCTU0vP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWZsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNTU3ZjEwYS1hODM3LTQwYjMtYWFhNi00YWU3N2MyZjkwMzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfrLWj2eRKubnCxOJ6koR9V2e_xOpmpPHy1pmieoTjyK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07YP9FBMM%2F\">NVIDIA\u2019s Shield TV Pro</a>. It currently runs Android TV, which is a little outdated at this point, but there\u2019s a possibility that it could be upgraded to Google TV in the future.</p><p>Thanks to its capable Tegra X1+ processor, the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro can stream in native 4K and it can also upscale 720p and 1080p video to 4K with the company\u2019s AI neural network. It also supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, has 3GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and two USB-C ports. Additionally, there\u2019s a gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI socket and a microSD card slot. Since it runs on Android, you can use it to play most games from the Google Play Store.</p><p>The main reason you\u2019d choose the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro over other machines is that it gives you access to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service.

It can play 4K Blu-Rays and supports all of the usual streaming video apps including Apple TV+ and Disney+. However, the PS5 can\u2019t stream Disney+ in 4K or Dolby Atmos, which is disappointing if you ever want to watch <em>The Mandalorian</em> in all its cinematic glory.</p><p>Fortunately, that\u2019s not the case with the Xbox Series X. On top of that, the Xbox Series X (and S) also support Dolby Vision for streaming video, which is especially great for people with newer TVs. Of course, the Xbox is also a pretty great gaming machine, and it offers access to Game Pass, Microsoft\u2019s subscription service that has a large library of titles.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T18:55:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Mazda stops selling its only EV in the US", "description": "<p>Mazda's MX-30 is a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-22-mazda-mx-30.html\">strange EV</a>, and it appears the company knows this. The automaker is <a href=\"https://news.mazdausa.com/2023-07-28-Mazda-MX-30-Discontinuation\">pulling</a> the small crossover from the US market after the 2023 model year. The company says it's currently focused on &quot;large platform&quot; plug-in hybrids like the CX-70 and CX-90, and also offers conventional hybrids like the CX-50.</p><p>The MX-30 is Mazda's first and only mass-produced EV to date, and it came to the country in fall 2021 as a California-only model. From the start, its prospects were limited by a number of unusual business decisions. On top of its small size, it had just a 35.5kWh battery with an estimated 100-mile range. This was supposed to make it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-mazda-mx-3-limited-torque.html\">feel more like a gas car</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-29-mazda-says-long-range-evs-worse-than-diesels.html\">limit the car's CO2 footprint</a>, but the net result was a car that was both less exciting to drive and less practical than competing EVs costing significantly less than Mazda's $35,385 sticker. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-says-a-next-gen-chevy-bolt-is-on-the-way-144518735.html\">outgoing current-gen Chevy Bolt</a> costs $9,000 less while delivering more performance and over twice the range.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Sales were accordingly poor. Mazda has sold just 571 MX-30 units in the US over three years. In some countries, the company has reworked the machine as a plug-in hybrid with a rotary gas engine and an estimated 53 miles of electric-only driving.</p><p>Mazda is rethinking its EV strategy. It plans to introduce cars based on both an existing platform as well as a new framework. There are claims the company might use a future Toyota platform expected to deliver <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/toyota-claims-its-future-evs-will-have-a-range-over-600-miles-104555944.html\">over 600 miles on a charge</a>. The MX-30 discontinuation isn't the end, in other words \u2014 rather, it's an acknowledgment that the company needs to be more competitive.</p><p>The move is also a reflection of Japanese brands' general trouble entering the EV market. Honda <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-honda-e-compact-electric-car-might-not-get-a-follow-up-051431133.html\">might not replace its E compact car</a>, and is refocusing on SUVs like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honda-prologue-ev-design-reveal-160536773.html\">next year's Prologue</a> as well as its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-honda-mobility-officially-unveils-its-collaborative-ev-concept-first-look-ces-2023-015133456.html\">collaboration with Sony</a>.

Here are our favorite environmentally-friendly phone cases.</p><h2>Pela Case</h2><p></p><p>Without a doubt, our favorite eco-friendly phone cases are those made by <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlbGFjYXNlLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViYzRjMmViLWYyYzQtNGM0Zi05ODk4LTlhNDFlZmVhYzdmNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWL1XLUzxiJWhDQVRbd6nOxiU_W3Lj-SONanCPqj2NGg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpelacase.com%2F\">Pela</a>. We absolutely love their colors and designs, plus the fact that the entire line is 100 percent plant-based and compostable. The case material is called \u201cFlaxstic,\u201d which the company says is made from flax straw and compostable bioplastic elastomer. Importantly, it's also free of BPA, phthalates, cadmium and lead. If you ever decide to get rid of it, you can indeed just chuck in a compost bin and it\u2019ll be completely biodegradable.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>What\u2019s more, Pela cases are available for a <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlbGFjYXNlLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9vdXItcGVsYS1jYXNlLWNvbGxlY3Rpb25zPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJjNGMyZWItZjJjNC00YzRmLTk4OTgtOWE0MWVmZWFjN2Y0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdUDXH9nIhCENpnx3JwnP6EETXJ-AsTtEj3b0XXs3ZZN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpelacase.com%2Fpages%2Four-pela-case-collections%3F\">wide array of handsets</a>. They can accommodate iPhones (from iPhone 5 onwards), Samsung Galaxies (Galaxy S8 and newer), Google Pixels (from the Pixel 3a on) and even some OnePlus and Huawei models.</p><p>For iPhone users, we should note that Pela cases are not MagSafe-compatible by default. Strangely, too, you can only purchase an additional <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlbGFjYXNlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9tYWdzYWZlLW1vZHVsZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJjNGMyZWItZjJjNC00YzRmLTk4OTgtOWE0MWVmZWFjN2Y0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdncKSo3XYQoxLe9Rm2xeMhZPFjtAvBXUk6qWwdAUGtY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpelacase.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagsafe-module\">$13 MagSafe module</a> for the iPhone 13 and 14, and not the iPhone 12.

It comes in four different colors, and features an attractive sculpted wave pattern. It feels sturdy and durable, and LifeProof says it\u2019s drop proof from two meters (roughly six and half feet). Plus, it\u2019s MagSafe-compatible by default. The LifeProof Wake is available for iPhones (iPhone 11 onward), Samsung Galaxies (Galaxy S20 and newer) and Google Pixels (Pixel 4a and up).</p><h2>Casetify Ultra Compostable</h2><p></p><p>Casetify is mostly known for making durable yet stylish phone cases, but it has several eco-friendly options, too.

My recommendation would be to go with the more durable Ultra Compostable option, even if it does cost a bit more.</p><p>Unfortunately, Casetify\u2019s Compostable line is only available for iPhones the (iPhone 7 and up). Casetify does make other kinds of sustainable cases for both the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy handsets (Galaxy S20 and newer), but they\u2019re not compostable. Instead, they\u2019re made from 65 percent recycled materials.

It also has trouble recognizing basic music concepts like keys, scales and BPM. Just like most AI-creation platforms, you aren\u2019t going to get a perfect match right away.

If one of the game tweaks is running on Forge 1.7.10/1.12.2, intruders can remotely control both servers and gamers' devices.

Users just have to send special network traffic to a server to take control. The first evidence of BleedingPipe attacks <a href=\"https://github.com/bdew-minecraft/bdlib/issues/57\">surfaced</a> in March 2022 and were quickly patched by modders, but MMPA understands most servers running the mods haven't updated.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>We've asked Mojang parent company Microsoft for comment.

While there are 46 mods known to fall prey to BleedingPipe as of this writing, there's the potential for considerably more. Users are asked to scan their systems (including their <em>Minecraft</em> folder) for malware. Server operators, meanwhile, are urged to either update mods or stop running them entirely.

It\u2019s an 8-bit digital synth and sequencer inspired by video games of the early PC era, which had to do <em>a lot</em> with incredibly little. The core here isn\u2019t some high-powered ARM processor; there\u2019s no advanced physical modeling or complex wavetables. Instead, the RoAT runs on a very basic microcontroller like you might find in old kitchen appliances. (Not the kind that connect to the internet and have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-upcoming-smart-fridge-has-a-32-inch-display-and-integrated-smart-things-hub-115528671.html\">giant touchscreens</a>.)</p><p>There are four freely tunable oscillators with 16 waveforms to choose from. The frequency range available is huge and the potentiometers can only turn so much, so dialing in a perfect scale isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to come easy. The 16 voice options are all harsh and decidedly digital. Think Atari 2600 in a blender. And the resonant filter is deliciously lo-fi. I know that it\u2019s somewhat cliche at this point to say that a synth is oozing character, but I don\u2019t know how else to describe the sound of RoAT. It\u2019s one of the more characterful instruments I\u2019ve had the pleasure of using at any price point.</p><p>The sequencer is basic, too. An oscillator is either on or off and that\u2019s it. If you want a particular note you have to lock it in with the tuning knobs. The one variable is that by default, the voices can either be momentary on, or momentary off \u2013 so you can set one to drone while the others pop in to add color. The sequences must be played in live, nothing is quantized and the pattern length is just a single bar. But since it\u2019s not a step sequencer, that doesn\u2019t matter quite as much. You can always just turn the tempo down to 70 bpm while actually playing at 140 bpm and effectively get two bars.</p><figure><img alt=\"Soma Labs Rumble of Ancient Times voice buttons.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2bbceb70-2cb8-11ee-ad6a-f4bcc945ea3a\" style=\"height: 1365px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>The simplicity here actually makes it fun and fuss free. You just hold down the record button and tap the little copper pads under each voice button, wait for the loop to come back around and tap some more to add additional triggers. The whole process of dialing in notes then sequencing them is sloppy and playful. You don\u2019t have to think about ratchets or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-elektron-model-cycles-review-affordable-fm-groovebox.html\">parameter locks</a>. The limitations actually free you up to focus on jamming, experimenting and iterating.</p><p>The one part of the RoAT interface that might seem intimidating at first is the bank of registers. This is how you do actual sound design on the instrument. There\u2019s a table in the bottom right hand corner where all the various parameters are laid out, like frequency, wave selection, LFO type and speed, etcetera. They\u2019re in numbered rows, from zero to seven, and you navigate between them using buttons on the left side labeled one, two and four. So yes, you will need to do some basic arithmetic if you want to change the release of a voice or tweak the filter resonance, which you\u2019ll find on page five and select by pressing the one and four buttons (1+4=5, got it?). While this might seem unnecessarily complicated, it\u2019s actually pretty easy to wrap your head around and I\u2019d argue far faster and more enjoyable than trying to scroll through an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roland-tr-6-s-review-classic-drum-machines-808-909-portable-143001780.html\">endless menu</a>.</p><p>Some of the parameters need a little more explanation than what can be squeezed into the table on the front. But flip the RoAT over and you\u2019ll get most of the info you need on the back of the unit.</p><figure><img alt=\"Soma Labs Rumble of Ancient Times reference charts on the back of the device.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2bcc06a0-2cb8-11ee-b85f-01e45c655a20\" style=\"height: 1365px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>The one exception to this is page six of the registers, which is where you\u2019ll find the summing algorithm controls. These are explained on the back of the device, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I fully understood what they all meant or why they affect the sound the way they do. I have a feeling that many people will be in the same boat as me. That being said, you don\u2019t really need to understand to simply tweak the knobs until you hear something you like.</p><p>By the way, turning knobs until you hear something you like is perfectly a valid approach for any instrument, but it seems particularly appropriate here. The dramatic changes even a tiny bit of movement introduces mean this is best navigated by feel. And if that seems like too much work for you, there\u2019s that button labeled \u201cCHAOS\u201d in the top left corner. I bet you can guess what it does. (It causes chaos, btw.)</p><p>This button randomizes all the parameters except for the row you\u2019ve currently selected in the register. So if you don\u2019t have any of the numbered buttons on, you\u2019re on row zero which controls pitch, you can knock out countless iterations on a particular melody or sequence, swapping in different waveforms and algorithms.</p><figure><img alt=\"Soma Labs Rumble of Ancient Times chaos button.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2bc995a0-2cb8-11ee-b8ff-71a79eb8c610\" style=\"height: 1365px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>Now this is where the limitations of the RoAT might become an issue for some. Do you like the chaos you\u2019ve just created? Great, you better record that <em>right now</em>. Get out a field recorder and a TRS cable, or fire up your DAW or something. Because once you flip that power switch on the RoAT off, your creation is gone \u2013 forever. There\u2019s no saving of sequences. No presets. No MIDI out to control other instruments.</p><p>There is analog sync out, but no sync in. That means that, while you can connect the RoAT to a Volca or a Pocket Operator and keep them in time, you have to use the clock on the RoAT to drive everything. And there\u2019s no tap tempo here or a screen where you can see the exact tempo you\u2019re at. So I really hope you enjoy your jams at 108.45 BPM.</p><figure><img alt=\"Soma Labs Rumble of Ancient Times register table.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2bd6b500-2cb8-11ee-bff4-ab555a208246\" style=\"height: 1365px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>Practically everything about the RoAT is messy and ephemeral. But, that\u2019s also kind of what makes it so great. I realize that a lot of what attracts me to the RoAT might not matter to many of you. You might just want to play a pleasant melody on a clean sounding synth. Which, great, I like doing that too. That\u2019s not what you come to the RoAT for, though.</p><p>It\u2019s excellent at noisy rhythmic patterns perfect for industrial or chiptunes. But it\u2019s limited connectivity and inability to reliably reproduce the same exact results multiple times means it\u2019s not an ideal performance instrument. Instead it\u2019s best as a source of inspiration and samples. Though, thinking of the Rumble of Ancient Times in purely practical terms misses the point. It takes obsolete technology that would otherwise be destined for a landfill and mutates it into an experimental instrument that\u2019s easy to get lost in. And every time you turn it on feels like a brand new adventure.</p><figure><img alt=\"Soma Labs Rumble of Ancient Times close up of SOMA logo.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/2bc96e90-2cb8-11ee-afbb-48c456f66894\" style=\"height: 1365px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>Remember when I said earlier that it reminded me that sometimes you need to let things go? Well, I am a digital hoarder. I have saved practically every photo I\u2019ve taken since 2008 (and every crappy photochop since 2005). I have a hard drive overflowing with song sketches that are absolute trash and clearly going nowhere. And I have a hard time parting with even insignificant personal items floating around my house.</p><p>Not only that, but I am the sort of person who second guesses <em>everything</em>. I will nitpick and obsess over a project \u2013 be it a song or this review \u2013 until I hate it. In April of last year I mentioned in my review of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chase-bliss-habit-review-guitar-effects-pedal-delay-looper-130017678.html\">Chase Bliss Habit</a> that I had been sitting on three songs for an EP for over a year.

Although the accessory-maker likely toed the line enough to avoid unwelcome attention from Nintendo\u2019s lawyers, the color schemes match the classic consoles nearly perfectly: The NES-inspired variant ships in a familiar white / dark gray / black color scheme, while the Famicom-influenced one uses white / crimson.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Fami Edition includes Japanese characters below the English markings for each standard alphanumerical key. The keyboard\u2019s built-in dials and power indicator also have a charmingly old-school appearance. And if you want to customize the keyboard\u2019s hardware, you can replace each button on its hot-swappable printed circuit board (PCB). 8BitDo tells Engadget it uses Kailh Box White Switches V2 for the keyboard and Gatreon Green Switches for the Super Buttons.</p><figure><img alt=\"Marketing photography.

Even if you treat your tech like gold, it\u2019s impossible to predict all the hazards life will throw at you. But having a layer of protection in the form of a case can make it so your iPad has a better chance of emerging unscathed from those situations. Below are some of our top picks for the best iPad cases you can get right now at various price points, and providing different levels of protection.</p><h2>Otterbox Symmetry 360</h2><p></p><p>Otterbox is an expert when it comes to protection, as seen with their phone cases, but its <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhZMlBUU05NLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xcnUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZiYTE4YzkzLTU0NTYtNDYyNi04ODRlLWRhM2JkYzdiNDQ5ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS7kG55oS7DsUOyMw62vVOPdZp9gRkBkG2fGQ_Z_6MM4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08Y2PTSNM%2F\">Symmetry Series 360 series</a> shows that it has design chops, too. Symmetry cases look similar to Apple\u2019s Smart Cover, but the clear, scratch-resistant back is sturdy without adding a lot of weight to the iPad. Plus, the edge protection is substantial, so you won\u2019t have to worry about damage from the inevitable, accidental bumps your tablet takes. The extra flap Otterbox added keeps the iPad screen cover closed and holds the second-generation Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pros. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL3N5bW1ldHJ5LTM2MCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmJhMThjOTMtNTQ1Ni00NjI2LTg4NGUtZGEzYmRjN2I0NDlmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbZfXhGUuTZzSeRJxYwktigWcWW9rZdpn7sGLuhZGU7j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fsymmetry-360\">Symmetry Series 360 cases</a> are available for most iPad models, and there\u2019s a new offshoot of the lineup called <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL2lwYWQ_cHJlZm4xPW5hbWUyJnByZWZ2MT1TeW1tZXRyeSUyMFNlcmllcyUyMEZvbGlvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYmExOGM5My01NDU2LTQ2MjYtODg0ZS1kYTNiZGM3YjQ0OWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfJtO65_-ImOf6Z7NawG80Fycus3xzzk0RTcu1kHvSXO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fipad%3Fprefn1%3Dname2%26prefv1%3DSymmetry%2520Series%2520Folio\">Symmetry Folio</a>, which includes a dedicated sleeve for your Apple Pencil on the front cover.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>ProCase iPad cases</h2><p></p><p>Look no further than <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS8xRTJFOEQ1Ni05QjMzLTRDNkItQkExMS01NDc0NkE3NTczMEM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXJ1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYmExOGM5My01NDU2LTQ2MjYtODg0ZS1kYTNiZGM3YjQ0OWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcGC3O51FGOFZwO7Xu80j4Q1eTSRqg_fEpKaumhT-Lkn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F1E2E8D56-9B33-4C6B-BA11-54746A75730C\">ProCases\u2019 iPad covers</a> if you want a solid dupe for Apple\u2019s own Smart Cover. ProCase has a lot of different designs, but its <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qcm9DYXNlLUdlbmVyYXRpb24tU3RhbmQtUHJvdGVjdGl2ZS1SZWxlYXNlL2RwL0IwQjhGWjE0U1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXJ1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYmExOGM5My01NDU2LTQ2MjYtODg0ZS1kYTNiZGM3YjQ0OWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWLc_gTLbZjc7WAG4uKR08jZTrrbI9gNuMDNJl49e4Xa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProCase-Generation-Stand-Protective-Release%2Fdp%2FB0B8FZ14ST\">Thin Hard Protective Smart Folio</a> will be a great option for anyone that just wants a bit of extra protection for their tablet. Plus, it helps that it\u2019s available for all current iPad models and even a few old-school versions, too. A thin layer of hard plastic encases your iPad while the front flap magnetically closes over the screen to protect it. And for iPad models that support the second-generation Apple Pencil, the case leaves a cut out on the edge where the stylus can sit when you\u2019re not using it. They may not be quite as substantial as Otterbox Symmetry cases, but ProCase\u2019s accessories make up for that in price: you can pick one up for as low as $13, and we\u2019ve seen some go on sale for even less than that.</p><h2>Otterbox Defender series</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019re not messing around with your iPad, look no further than <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PVFRFUkJPWC1ERUZFTkRFUi1DYXNlLWlQYWQtRGlzcGxheS9kcC9CMDBaN1JWVFFBP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFydS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmJhMThjOTMtNTQ1Ni00NjI2LTg4NGUtZGEzYmRjN2I0NDlmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfBTH7lmTe0t9SZ7tFOCaJSlG4hPToZpyQMEuiOhSZ3P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOTTERBOX-DEFENDER-Case-iPad-Display%2Fdp%2FB00Z7RVTQA\">Otterbox\u2019s Defender series</a> of cases. The company has these rugged covers for tons of different devices, and Defender cases for iPads provide some of the best protection you could ask for. In addition to passing more than 24 shock, abrasion and drop tests, Defender cases have a built-in screen protector and covers for the single port on all of the latest iPad models. You can also detach the Shield Stand and use it to prop up your iPad for better viewing. It may be on the bulky side, especially compared to other cases on this list, but we think that\u2019s a fair tradeoff for the extra protection.</p><h2>Apple Magic Keyboard</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s hard to get much better than Apple\u2019s own <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NYWdpYy1LZXlib2FyZC0xMS1pbmNoLWlQYWQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi9kcC9CMDg2M0JRSk1TP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFydS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmJhMThjOTMtNTQ1Ni00NjI2LTg4NGUtZGEzYmRjN2I0NDlmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZZ4o806ysheBPAu7AYcaeBb099jp0P_4eFjo4P_usHR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation%2Fdp%2FB0863BQJMS\">Magic Keyboard</a> if you want a case that will turn your tablet into an acceptable laptop replacement. iPads magnetically attach to it, hovering above the keys and trackpad, while allowing you to angle it from 90 to 130 degrees to get the right viewing position. It feels surprisingly sturdy, and the keyboard itself is great to use for long periods of time. It doesn\u2019t have the same stability a standard laptop would if you\u2019re using it on your lap, but you won\u2019t feel like your setup will collapse at any moment either. The glass trackpad is another standout \u2014 it\u2019s wide enough for gestures and generally a breeze to use, even if it\u2019s noticeably smaller than one you\u2019d get on a full-sized MacBook.</p><p>There are two major drawbacks to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-magic-keyboard-review-ipad-pro-299-349-130015291.html\">Magic Keyboard</a>: it doesn\u2019t provide a ton of protection, and it\u2019s expensive. The edges do not wrap around the iPad, so this is not the case to get if you\u2019re particularly prone to dropping things. Also, the Magic Keyboard costs $300 to $350, depending on the size of your iPad. Without a doubt, it\u2019s the most luxurious iPad case on this list, but those who want to make their iPad as functional as possible will get a lot of use out of it.</p><h2>Logitech Combo Touch</h2><p></p><p>Logitech is known for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html\">solid accessories</a>, and the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS84RUQzRDQwOS00QzVDLTQ4NUEtQTZCQi1GRTA0MDdCNDU0M0M_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXJ1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYmExOGM5My01NDU2LTQ2MjYtODg0ZS1kYTNiZGM3YjQ0OWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfD1ogA8x6E5TUh5hU00Y4pTXw9O_v41YfUwGrJM1olL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F8ED3D409-4C5C-485A-A6BB-FE0407B4543C\">Combo Touch keyboard case</a> is no exception. Think of it as a more versatile (and more affordable) alternative to the Magic Keyboard. The case wraps securely around your iPad and has a built-in kickstand that lets you adjust your viewing angle for whatever you\u2019re doing, be it typing, watching videos, sketching or reading. The backlit keyboard is pretty spacious and includes a multi-touch trackpad for more precise on-screen control. There\u2019s also a spot for your Apple Pencil, so it\u2019ll be close at hand when you need to mark up a document or doodle an idea in Apple Notes. It\u2019ll probably be harder to balance Logitech\u2019s kit on your lap than the Magic Keyboard, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for an otherwise stellar keyboard case. We also like that Logitech offers the Combo Touch in various sizes that fit the latest iPad, iPad Air and iPad Pro models.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T13:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter threatens to sue anti-hate group over its research", "description": "<p>X Corp (aka Twitter) may take legal action against one of its more outspoken critics.

The Center <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/twitter-fails-to-act-on-twitter-blue-accounts-tweeting-hate/\">published</a> a research article in June asserting that X allowed explicitly racist and homophobic posts despite policies to the contrary, even days after they'd been reported.</p><p>X accused CCDH of using poor methodology, and not studying the 500 million posts on the service each day.

It adds that X never said just what was inaccurate, and that it doesn't accept any funding from companies or governments.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The researchers further maintain that X is being hypocritical for attacking supposedly limited research while simultaneously curbing the ability to conduct those studies.

The company believes some scrapers are abusing their tools to train AI models and conduct manipulation campaigns. Even Blue subscribers are capped at viewing 8,000 posts per day, making it impractical to conduct extensive research.</p><p>X has disbanded its communications team and isn't available for comment. CCDH says it &quot;will not be bullied&quot; and will continue publishing its research. It also intends to post the original letter, and believes a lawsuit with &quot;frivolous&quot; claims could prove risky.</p><p>Reports indicate that X's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitters-ad-sales-have-reportedly-dropped-by-59-percent-since-last-year-092543851.html\">ad sales have plunged</a> by half since Musk bought the company last year. The executive pinned the exodus on European and North American marketers trying to deliberately bankrupt the firm, but employees talking to the <em>NYT</em> maintained that advertisers were balking at the surges in hate speech and porn after Musk's acquisition.

However, for those looking for something smaller, the options are a lot more limited. But with the upcoming EX30, Volvo has created a compact electric SUV with a ton of premium features and a surprisingly affordable price. After getting to check one out in person at its North American debut, it\u2019s clear we need more electric vehicles like this in the market.</p><p>Due out sometime in the summer of 2024, a base EX30 will start at just $35,000 for a single-motor setup with around 275 miles of range. Granted, that\u2019s a bit more than a gas-powered alternative like a Honda CR-V (which starts at just under $30,000) or a Subaru Crosstrek (around $25,000). But when you consider the average price of a new electric vehicle is <a href=\"https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/how-much-electric-car-cost/\">over $53,000</a>, Volvo is definitely helping make EVs a bit more affordable.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"3ac2998318bb443386f3fafb1a87d739\"></div><p>On top of that, a base EX30 appears to be well-equipped, with Volvo including things like a 12.3-inch touchscreen based on Android Automotive (with support for wireless Apple CarPlay), cyclist detection, Pilot Assist and rear passenger detection as standard. And as you\u2019d expect from Volvo, you get a very Scandinavian minimalist interior made from a range of recycled and sustainable materials. Now some may take issue with a few of the components Volvo is using like the speckled panels on the dash \u2013 which kind of remind me of a fancy gym mat. But in a car sporting a slick modern design, I think it works.</p><p>That said, if you don\u2019t mind spending a bit more, the EX30 is also available with an upgraded dual-motor all-wheel-drive configuration that boasts a 0 to 60 time of just 3.4 seconds. Not only does that make the EX30 faster than bigger and more expensive electric SUVs like a Tesla Model Y Performance, it\u2019s also the fastest Volvo ever (across both electric and ICE vehicles).</p><p>The EX30 feels rather roomy in the front, with Volvo simplifying its interior by using a soundbar that runs the width of the windshield instead of multiple individual speakers. The company has also moved a lot of common controls for stuff like the windows to the center console to help streamline the interior. And Volvo put an emphasis on storage, with the EX30 featuring a lot of handy cubby holes including a center-mounted glove box and a dishwasher-safe removable tray (with a cute little moose graphic) for rear seat passengers. Thankfully, there\u2019s no shortage of power options for your devices with two USB-C ports in the front, another two in back, and a built-in dual phone wireless charging pad between the driver and passenger seats.</p><p>When sitting in the rear, things do feel a bit tighter, though that\u2019s somewhat expected for a car that, at 166 inches long and 61 inches tall, is very similar in size to a Chevy Bolt. As someone who\u2019s six feet tall, there\u2019s very little legroom if the front seats are pushed all the way back. And in the truck, you get a surprising amount of cargo space at 31.9 cubic feet if you include the extra room underneath the load flat floor.</p><figure><img alt=\"The EX30 features a similar design and many features with Volvo's flagship EX90 electric SUV, but in a more compact body.  \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/395db3a0-2cbc-11ee-9bcb-71c2a6a660e7\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So while I haven\u2019t had a chance to take it for a drive, all told the EX30 looks to offer a great blend of premium features and decent range in a compact size. Not to mention excellent performance, just so long as you\u2019re willing to pay for it. And coming from someone who lives in the city, the EX30 seems like a great EV for getting around town while still being easy to park on the streets, which is something we need more of among electric SUVs.</p><p>Reservations for the EX30 in the U.S. are available today with a $500 refundable deposit before the car arrives at dealerships sometime next summer.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/volvo-ex30-first-look-the-compact-electric-suv-we-need-100013835.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/volvo-ex30-first-look-the-compact-electric-suv-we-need-100013835.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T10:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "iPhone 15 Pro set to feature thinner bezels, a titanium frame and USB-C charging", "description": "<p>We're one step closer to getting a complete picture of Apple's upcoming iPhone 15.

Yesterday, Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1685437228967686144\">tweeted</a> that X's HQ would remain in \"beautiful\" San Francisco despite the city being in a \"death spiral.\"&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kanye-wests-twitterx-account-has-been-unbanned-again-075206407.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/kanye-wests-twitterx-account-has-been-unbanned-again-075206407.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T07:52:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple says it's aware of a bug that may affect Screen Time restrictions for kids", "description": "<p>Apple has promised to fix a bug in iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices that may affect Screen Time restrictions for kids, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hcHBsZXMtcGFyZW50YWwtY29udHJvbHMtYXJlLWJyb2tlbi01NWEyYWE1MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjdjZjZkMzktMjY2My00ZTJiLWE0Y2ItOWQ5ZDExYTI2YzkwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASG2WE89Swk_oh9lpFY5WQdnE6yGrs96-mWoeH-c7TY4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fapples-parental-controls-are-broken-55a2aa52\"><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></a>has reported. It affects a function called Downtime that allows parents to remotely set hours when kids can't use their devices.&nbsp;</p><p>\"We are aware that some users may be experiencing an issue where Screen Time settings are unexpectedly reset,\" a spokesperson told the <em>WSJ</em>. \"We take these reports very seriously and we have been, and will continue, making updates to improve the situation.\"</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Parents checking the feature have found that scheduled times have either reverted to older settings or been removed altogether \u2014 allowing kids to use their devices at will. One user changed his passcode to be sure his kids hadn't guessed it, but found he needed to reset the feature \"two or three times a week.\" Suffice to say, kids don't always report the issue in a timely fashion either. Around 2,300 people on an Apple discussion page on the subject said they experienced the same bug.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple knew about the issue before, but reported it fixed with the release of iOS 16.5 in May. However, WSJ reporters found the issue in subsequent releases and even in the iOS 17 beta.&nbsp;</p><p>Screen time was introduced in 2018 at Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-04-ios-12-lets-parents-limit-kids-screen-time.html\">developer's conference</a>, allowing parents to remotely check their kid's Activity Report and manage their app use time. They can also set a custom amount of time per app that kids can't extend, or create a Downtime to block everything but selected software and phone calls for a set hourly range. Apple has yet to say when it will release a fix.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-says-its-aware-of-a-bug-that-may-affect-screen-time-restrictions-for-kids-052057086.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-says-its-aware-of-a-bug-that-may-affect-screen-time-restrictions-for-kids-052057086.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-07-31T05:20:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
