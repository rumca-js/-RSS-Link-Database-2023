With the upcoming Starfield, it looks like what we know as the BGS RPG is going to take probably the biggest leap it\u2019s ever taken in a long, long time. \n\nFrom improvements to the technical side of things to a staggering expansion of scope (not that past BGS games were small by any means) to a glut of exciting new gameplay ideas and mechanics, Starfield is looking like a step-up over BGS\u2019 past works in no few ways. \n\nHere, we\u2019re going to compare it directly to the studio\u2019s two most recent major releases \u2013 Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 \u2013 and talk about what\u2019s changing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dyb9DIYCns", "date_published": "2023-07-31T13:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2dyb9DIYCns/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart PC Graphics Analysis - Does It Surpass The PS5 Version?", "description": "In 2021, Insomniac Games delivered an excellent action platformer with Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart on the PS5, thanks to an enjoyable gameplay mechanics and an impressive suite of distinct rifts available for players to explore. In keeping with the recently established traditions of Sony's first-party releases, this previously exclusive PS5 title has finally made its way over to the PC platform. \n\nNixxes Software is the team behind the porting process, and expectations are obviously high considering that it\u2019s the same team that worked on translating the Insomniac\u2019s engine with PC ports of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. With this graphics analysis, we will be diving deep into the features of the PC version, how it compares to the PS5 release in terms of graphical fidelity, loading times among a slew of other things.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZjW-3O9ip8", "date_published": "2023-07-31T11:30:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qZjW-3O9ip8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
