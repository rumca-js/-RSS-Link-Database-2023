Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has been delayed indefinitely. Sony Pictures has jumbled up a bunch of its movie release dates, pushing films slated for release this year to sometime in 2024. It’s been rumored that animation on Beyond the Spider-Verse hasn’t even started. In an interview conducted by Vulture, an experienced artist who has apparently worked on big-budget animations for various studios claimed there’s no way Sony Pictures will hit its March 2024 release date. In other Marvel news, we got the season 2 trailer for Loki, coming to Disney Plus. This and much more in IGN’s latest entertainment news series with Akeem Lawanson.

Get a behind-the-scenes look at Strays, an upcoming live-action comedy movie starring Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Brett Gelman, Will Forte, Josh Gad, Harvey Guillén, Rob Riggle, Jamie Demetriou, and Sofia Vergara.

They say a dog is a man’s best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. 

When Reggie (Will Ferrell), a naïve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. 

But once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. 

Determined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug’s pals—Maggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner’s new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who’s stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal—together hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home … and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It’s not his foot). 

Strays is produced by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans), by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal) and by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) and Lord Miller President of Film Aditya Sood (The Martian, Cocaine Bear). The film is executive produced by Jessica Switch, Nikki Baida and Julia Hammer. It is directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal).

Strays opens in UK cinemas on August 17, 2023 and in US theaters on August 18, 2023.

Rachel has been trained to be the consummate professional: a phenomenal field agent who sticks to the mission, follows the numbers, and trusts no one. When a routine mission is derailed by mysterious hacker Keya Dhawan (Alia Bhatt), Rachel’s two lives collide. As she races to protect the Charter and strives to beat the odds, her humanity might just be her biggest asset. 

Heart of Stone launches on Netflix on August 11, 2023. Tom Harper directs from a screenplay by Greg Rucka and Allison Schroeder.
